today we are super excited to bring you a pumpt enjoyable we we've been excited for this one for a while but I'm not alone today I am here with somebody new it's a new face to the channel so I am here with David how's it going guys um I'm actually a student in profit with JavaScript course and I have the honor to uh go live with sunny and show you the M Stack um Tik Tock clone so I'm super fun for today it's a where yeah nice yeah so we're super pumped for today guys we already have 200 people watching that's awesome we have loads of comments flying in and guys what I want to say is let's run through the app itself okay so let's run through the app itself and let's go ahead and check so David this is what we're building today right we've got the Tik Tok clone and what's different about this Tik Tok clone JS with Firebase so Firebase is actually a suite of tool that is like it it is kind of replacing serers side uh development and so you don't have to go around uh building the server side application uh and the back end but this time we are going to actually build the backand as oh David I don't know if they can I think they can't actually hear you at the moment David one second it's volume side I'm not available to justify right give me one second guys let's go ahead and see what's going on there so can't hear David let's go there we go just speak David for a second right I think I think we're good now all right sorry for that guys so we actually had a little bit of an issue David if you're in to chat and you guys just let us know in the comments if you can hear David that would be awesome so just to tell you guys what David was saying we went ahead and we built the Tik Tok Clon you guys saw this before and all the data was being pulled from Firebase before but David has worked with mongod DB quite a lot in his time and what he's essentially done is he transformed the app so we have a pumped and exciting build for you guys today we are going to be building this Tik Tok clone with react deploying it on Firebase but David where is the data actually coming from today so the data today is not going to come from Firebase we are actually going to be using mongod DB mongodb is a nosql database it's kind of like uh filebase like data structure wise but it's like super professional and lot of companies are using mongod DB and yeah so we are actually going to be building no JS apis as well and they are going to be pulling the data and throwing it to the front end exactly guys that's exactly what we're going to be doing let's run through a quick demo of the app so we have a working Tik Tok app and the nice thing is as you scroll guys you can see it actually snaps so we have this lovely snap functionality a lot of you guys liked this last time let us know if you're pumped for this by the way guys and let's go ahead and see so if I tap on the video you can see we get a live video and then if you scroll down and click the next one you can see I love this [Laughter] video and then if you got you guys are crushing routine yeah nice so they said David son is low but yeah guys I've just up dav's volume so if you guys want to go ahead and check that out then um go ahead and check it out but what we're going to do essentially now is actually go ahead and build this app so the main difference between this and the previous Tik Tok clone is that we are going to be powering everything with an Express JS uh back end so it's going to be it's going to be the data is going to be coming from mongod DB we're going to show you guys how to set up mongod DB we're also going to be showing you guys how you can combine Firebase as a front end sort of service and then also David are we going to deploy mongod DB in where are we going to deploy it to uh of course actually actually actually mongod DB is an online service but you definitely want to go ahead and deploy the API the OJs API and we are going to be using Heroku for that yeah nice dope it's going to be all live David Jonathan just said Sunny you need help with the dance just dude I mean my friend is a professional dancer so she you know like if if you're with a professional dancer of course you're going to look bad you know uh guys some things to point out so like let me go ahead and just get this again so like some things to point out we have material UI as well here we have material UI icons we have a lovely little animation over here we have this nice little ticker we call it like a react ticker here I'm going to show you guys how to build that and then we also have this lovely snap functionality that you guys saw earlier and also these videos are actually from Tik Tok so you can go ahead follow kazzy's Tik Tok over here and follow my Tik Tok or my girlfriend's Tik Tok over here and we appreciate that also guys if you're enjoying this content and you're excited make sure to go ahead and actually grab out your phones right now and snap the the snap today's session and tag myself here and David I've added his tag over on his side of the screen that's perfect yeah down there right and with that guys also before we get started I don't know how many of you guys are following me on Tik Tok on um on um and also somebody just said it's front end covered in the other video guys we're doing the entire build today so we're not we're not playing around we're doday we are going to be developing a full stack application front and back and covered full stack application guys so full front end functionality back end functionality we just hit over 750 people on this stream thank you so so much guys and all we ask is that you just smash the Thumbs Up Button if you're excited for this um also I was going to mention yes so guys if you haven't already seen we actually have a react challenge so get excited for this because this is huge guys we have a 5day react JavaScript challenge the link is in the description right now so all you need to do is go over and actually you know what I want everyone right now to go to that link in the description and sign up for this challenge do you know why because it's completely free guys it's completely free and I'm

you're super quiet at the moment David So to just speak a little closer to the mic okay so actually I highly recommend everybody going ahead and joining because uh back in March uh Nazi's first uh JavaScript challenge helped me uh Kickstart My development uh developing career and today I'm getting uh getting clients like almost every day nice yeah so David actually came from the uh the one of the first JavaScript challenges that we actually did U and I can see some people actually signing up that is awesome and guys like David was once a student who came from a challenge so like think about it this way if you want to get involved you want to be a part like of the Journey part of these live streams then there is nothing stopping you all you need to go ahead and do is First Link in the description make sure you go ahead and check that out rishav rishav sorry if I didn't pronounce what I said it's for beginners 100% if you've never coded before I want you guys to go into that right now and sign up right we also have a free live webinar training um which you guys can go ahead and check out that will be in the description at some point as well um but yeah so guys all I'm asking for is that you go ahead and smash the thumbs up button and sign up to that uh free uh react Challenge and you can win yourself uh a huge priz prize if you if you actually go ahead and get involved inside of that so make sure you get super pumped up for that we have loads of people signed up this is insane so we have Beast rwa Bobby Kumar Juran he says samat says encouraged everyone to enjoy it that's awesome Leroy says what is the challenge about we are teaching you how to do a full stack application we're going to be running through the Amazon clone and we're going to actually be having the entire app up and running built for you guys um and you guys are going to have homework each day of the challenge it's it's a very intensive challenge guys but you guys are going to learn a huge amount in those days and you have the chance of winning a $6,000 coding boot camp and if you're referred then that person wins too so we it's very very exciting stuff um I can see a lot of people saying the mic is low I hope it's it's okay now um but yeah guys and also today you don't need to know anything if you're complete beginner it's completely all it's all good right like David this video is for everyone right exactly exactly we are going to be explaining everything for everybody awesome love that wow we have a lot of people signed up this is insane right with that said guys we're just about to hit 800 likes before the videos even started just about 880 people get everyone that you know share this video out get as many people on this right now smash that Thumbs Up Button we're about to get started right now and let's just jump straight into it David what' you say yes let's go let's jump right into it let's do it dude so the first thing that we're going to do guys is we're actually going to go ahead and build the front end portion of the app right so um what we going to do here is we're actually going to pull up our terminal so command J is a nice little shortcut that you can use here and what we're going to say is LS just make sure we're in the right directory so this is the directory that we're in right now we're going to say MPX create react app and then you want to give it a name so in this case we're going to call it Tik Tok right now while that's happening guys what that's going to actually set up a starter template for us I also see a bunch of questions about react native that is coming guys so if you're excited about that smash that damn Thumbs Up Button this is insane David we're at 868 likes already oh man I mean this is yes exactly and if if you're if you haven't smashed that uh this is what your like button should see yeah exactly guys we just got a donation from suit and he says watching YouTube during working hours # zero regrets dude that's what I'm talking about that's the kind of energy we need on this channel thank you so much um so this video so some people asking if it's going to be recorded yep everything is recorded it's going to be up straight away afterwards so stay tuned for that guys 900 likes oh man we're about to hit 900 viewers as well so let's let's keep pushing that number up guys and you guys will see and guys we're not only here today we're here tomorrow and the day after doing man stack build so don't worry you we've got a lot of fun coming your way guys and we have a react challenge starting next Monday so we got a lot of stuff for you guys all right now um we have oh great time to be uh go for it what was that D I just said uh it's such a great time to be it's such a great time to be a programming student yeah really is honestly really really is nice so guys while this is getting set up right now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and go over to Firebase and we're going to set up our Firebase instance so with that said let's go over to the console and you want all you need here is a Gmail account to get started you can see we've got the other clones here but let's go ahead and click on ADD project and here I'm going to say Tik Tok clone right Tik Tok clone and all what you want to do is click on continue we're going to disable Google analytics cuz we're not too interested and this will actually go ahead and set up the um the project for you and now the reason why we're using Firebase is it's a suite of tools provided by Google but it's going to allow us to deploy the app in a extremely simple way we just got another donation from gamer 001 thank you so much dude I appreciate that W thank you so much insane so some people are saying you still need Firebase even with node and so uh the only reason we're using Firebase is to make the deployment of the front end Super S simple right so let's just let's go ahead and separate our concerns there the the background is going to be uh the back end sorry is going to be completely in node.js Express and using mongodb so yes it is a completely separate build so so right now we've set up our Firebase project which is all good now we can go ahead and close that that's awesome and let's go ahead and actually run our app so I'm going to stop the one that I have running locally right now and I'm going to go instead so now we should see the site can't be reached awesome let's go back here and you can see once you've actually set up create react app or create react app has finished its job then we basically want to go ahead and CD into that folder so CD into it uh and then you want to hit mpm start and that will spin up this template app right now David you've coded in react before right yes that's correct yeah and what's your experience of react so far do you enjoy it why do you like it what's what's what's good about it yeah so so react is uh I think it's it's super uh cool to Pro uh program in react I mean it's uh very uh very easy to code I think yep uh it's it's so much easier than actually typing up the HTML CSS and JavaScript because it's it's like in one file and then I can see everything and uh also it um by default it features the hot reloading which is very developer friendly and also with the uh component based stuff it's it's very very very nice way to program so yeah exactly awesome dude really enjoyed it nice so with that guys we just got another donation from abishek devans thank you so much dude we appreciate any donation you guys are sending in um so Madan this is a good question he says you're going to host the front end and back end separately yes and there's a really distinctive reason why I want to do that because because guys when you create a front end and a back end it's kind of confusing in the beginning it's like well I have a react app I have some nodejs app are they two separate things or they are going to be two completely separate um sort of entities we're going to have a react app on on the front end we're going to have a nodejs server on the back end we're going to separately deploy them so the front end app is going to go to Firebase and then we're going to have the back end app go ahead and live on Heroku and then we're going to show you how the communication still works everything will still work in its place right um so really really exciting stuff uh we are at 990 likes guys this is insane thank you so much wow this is insane right let's go ahead and carry on guys so this is what you're going to get when you actually set up your first react app and you do mpm start so if you get to this page that's very good let's go ahead and actually show you this on one screen so you guys can actually see this a little bit easier because right now it might be a bit confusing to see so there we go and just tell me guys if it gets too small I can make the font a little bit bigger so what we're going to do at this point is we are actually going to go ahead and open our Tik Tok folder open the source and we got we need to do a cleanup process so what we do in the cleanup process is we get rid of app. test.js we get rid of the logo. SVG and we get rid of the setup test.js right so we're going to go ahead and do that and we're going to do this not here to test exactly not today and you should get an error because we just deleted the logo file that was part of that spinning app right and we just hit 1K likes that is insane guys thank you so much we massively appreciate that we've just started this stream we have 930 people watching this is insane we love you guys and appreciate every single one of you that's insane dude uh so we need to delete much guys yeah honestly it's super cool delete the header over here and let's just take type in H1 and we're going to say let's build a full stack man Tick Tock clone that's exciting stuff dude and let's do that and we're also going to change this to a lowercase a because we are following something called the bem naming convention exactly yeah go to app.css and then you want to go ahead press contrl a command a and delete everything inside app. CSS The Next Step that we want to do is you see this little Gap up here right you get this like this bit of spacing at the top and you don't want that whenever you sort of open up a a fresh project damn we just got two donations back to back we've got uh kka I can't pronounce the last name I think it's Ash ashanta thank you so much dude yeah and we have niten as well got from nitt that's it dude thank you so much I appreciate that massively uh We've even got viewers in France hey love that what's up fian nice so um so somebody asked a quick question address this he goes what do I need for the challenge I'm an absolute beginner all you need to do for the react challenge guys is go ahead and sign up that's it link is in the description make sure you go ahead and sign up to that challenge I'll show you guys one more time this is the challenge I'm talking about it is a huge amount of value for you guys so the link is in the description we go live on Monday with this challenge it starts in 5 days if you aren't there you are missing out guys so go ahead and check this out and I'm pushing ping it hard because like I literally we have put our heart and soul into this challenge so if you guys enjoy the content if you enjoy everything then you will love this challenge so please please please it's it's a big deal and I really really feel like you guys are going to love this so we've gone out of our way to make this massive for you guys and yeah go ahead and benefit from that guys so we just got another donation David damn we got a donation from damn from lith y lith just he says waiting for reca oh react native builds nice react native yeah awesome on the way somebody said please another one hey nice damn that's awesome dude so Sean we got Shan mugam and we also got an from an nice he goes way to be a full stack developer that's insane yeah guys you're going to be full stack developers you can actually call yourself full stack developer after this video cuz he is a full stack build right um nice so let's go ahead and jump in so somebody said please increase the font size I will do that for you guys so inside of index.css that little Gap that we had at the top right here to get rid of that we're going to go ahead and do the following we're going to say margin of zero like so and what that will do is that will go ahead and remove it as such right so we won't have that issue that we have right there now I'm going to go ahead and start the other app on the side so I can show you guys when we're building certain things how it will look on the screen so that might help you guys visualize what we're building building as we build it um let me go ahead and pop that in there there we go nice so what we're going to do guys first thing is you see now we have a fresh build right we have a fresh fresh starting template this is insane um let's go ahead and check this out so test oh guys and actually you know what I will we'll just cover this right now because the tech that we're going to use today right this is a really important point because I feel like you guys are going to learn a huge amount today and it's going to be really valuable for you guys to actually see and understand the exact Tech that we're going to be doing so that you get the most value from today's session so what we're going to be doing guys is I'm going to quickly draft out so David what we what have we got in today's session we have react so we we have react that is a letter r from uh earn we also have nodejs that is yeah so let's separate let's separate this into two sections just have the front end front so for front end we are going to be using uh react and we will be hosting react on the Firebase right so for front end we are just uh going to be using these two technologies yep no no we still got more we got material UI for the designs we got material UI we have flexbox guys so we're going to be showing you how to use flexbox even a third party Library so we have a third party ticker library and the ticker that I'm referring to is this one over here so um oh God oops not that one y this lovely ticker over here I'm going to show you guys how to do that right so you're going to have all of that inside of this we're also going to be showing you guys how to actually go ahead and have this beautiful functionality where you can the scroll snap functionality whoa we just got loads of donations guys I'm going to be dropping those in a second guys right after we um right after we you know I have to I want let's let's quickly take a minute to appreciate that guys we have so many all right so let me go ahead and go through this so we've got manav Aurora says do I need JavaScript Advanced for web like promise closures no you don't need to be Advanced for this kind of stuff guys keep it simple don't over complicate it just follow the builds pattern recognition will teach you a lot of this stuff and you'll learn it as you need to learn it okay so don't worry about beinged little motivation uh I just started programming back in March exactly and here I am now exactly guys so you can be complete beginner and you will be able to build it by yourself in in half a year even less exactly David we just broke over a thousand viewers damn dude we just got 1,00 likes this is insane okay this is awesome another donation by Jason Francis he says good job guys any react native tutorials coming soon yes so we have three man builds we have today tomorrow and the next day uh and then we have the react Challenge and after that on the road map I have definitely got react native in my in my eyes so like so I'm going to be dropping some content for you guys for that if you interested in that if you are smash that thumbs up button and we'll be happy to deliver uh another donation from netra he says how can we enable terminal in our vs code using hyper right now so if you go ahead and press command J inside of your terminal um then you can actually so right now I've got it open if I press command J you can actually go ahead and pull up a terminal so it has a terminal built into vs code so that should help you out there uh let's go ahead and check we've got another one he goes I also want to become a full stack developer Danny Great Dane you are in the right place my friend make sure you are in that challenge next week and I promise you you will get a huge amount of value from that um so yeah you're in the right place well done for for watching this and being here let's go ahead and see that is awesome guys massively massively appreciate that so let's go ahead and jump and Carry On David So now we've got the so the tech we were talking about we've got the front end which is this portion right we've got all of this stuff now the back end David break it down for me what is on the back end so the back end we are going to be using something called nodejs uh nodejs is a backend uh framework for JavaScript and we are going to be running an expressjs server for that y um and we will be using mongodb as a database yep and we will be hosting this whole thing on Heroku right okay so hosting on Heroku right and also there was something you said about was it mongus yeah yes exactly yes uh so for uh to connect to mongodb there is a tool called mongus uh which will make the connection between the database and your application super simple awesome yeah yeah so this is uh there was mindblowing for me uh back in the day nice dude that is awesome I'm excited for this build so like this is awesome and guys this is a in case you're wondering this is a full stack build okay so everything else has actually been a full stack build we've just used um react Firebase to make it super simple so it doesn't actually feel that big but yep today you can be sure that this is a full stack build okay so with that said let's jump straight into we just got another donation dude we got another one over here hey check that out that's awesome dude nice we got another one oh my god um damn oh somebody says Hey Sunny I'm hearing your breathing sound louder can you hear yeah sorry about that guys I actually I have a bad habit of breathing into this mic and it's super it's just so delicate like I can hear it all the time so we've got another one from Pine thank you so much another one from tan Mishra thank you guys that that is really really nice yeah so thank you so much um okay so with that said let's go ahead and carry on so here let's close this up we don't need this so for the app so let's go ahead and I always like to start off these builds by starting off with sort of drafting out what we're going to be building right so in today's build what we're going to have is essentially a container so we're going to call this like an app container so we're going to have a container and this is basically going to hold all the videos right so here it's a very simple architecture in today we're going to have just this is going to be like a list of videos right so we're going to have all the videos inside of that app container and then what we want it to do is basically render out in such a way that it's essentially you'll have some kind of like video like this right and it will basically just be like this so so we would like pull something from the database and then we would actually have um several videos show up here but then they render out like so like this right let me actually remove that comment sorry guys I've got that on there still um so somebody said The more enthusiastic sun he becomes the more he breathes louder you know what guys it's probably true I don't know you know it's a small price to pay for the the the content you get so we got sa Chan thank you he says what about authentication method um so we're not going to be covering authentication in today's build we have plenty of Builds on that yeah we have plenty of Builds on that um and somebody says you don't use fir store why we actually have a video where we built the entire thing with fir store so go ahead and check that out if you're interested that is uh the Tik Tok build that we previously built has it from um from firestore So today we're focusing on a complete full stack build so get excited for that right let's go ahead and jump on so we're going to have it like this right so David I think what we should be doing right now is essentially maybe let's go ahead and create the video component yeah okay let's go so you want to go into your file type in video.js like so whoa we just got a big donation somebody said Super Chat I have completed the Google clone Instagram clone and YouTube clone thank you sunny and Kazi for that I'm super pumped for man development that is awesome dude that is awesome well done for completing all of those things um and guys I I'll say again and again like honestly if you just follow these tutorials you're going to get so much value from it so make sure you actually stick with this somebody just dropped another 2 pound he said man like Sunny top Che appreciate that dude uh and today it's not just me we got David in the house too so that's awesome exactly thank you so much dude um another donation a man like Sunny top tutor I couldn't agree more yeah thank you guys that is awesome um right so let's go ahead and jump on so now we're going to create a video component so I like to use something called Snippets so you can see here I'm using RFC as soon as I hit enter boom it pops out the entire code for me now how do we get that to work right so I'm going to go ahead and hide the mini map so we get a bit more room so in order to get those Snippets features go into the extensions type in es7 in the search bar and the top one that you see right here so es7 Redux react graph cure Snippets that is the one that you want to click on install for very very important stuff um so a lot of people are asking what's being covered in today's build that that wasn't covered in the last one guys if you have seen the last one today we are going to be including an entire back end so we're going to run through the front end get everything up and running and then we're going to show you how to do an entire back end to this build right so Express server we're going to have a database and then we're going to have everything running on the back end so really really powerful stuff we will be understanding what's going on in Firebase exactly eventually yeah yeah exactly so now let's go ahead and when we create a new file we need to do the following we need to create a video. CSS file so let's go ahead and do this so video. CSS as such and then we're going to create a class name for that as well and we're going to call this one video like that right now inside of video let's go ahead and do a few things so in here we're going to basically have the F we're going to have the video itself so this is going to be a video component like so and this can be uh let's just let's grab a source temporarily so let me go ahead and grab this one um there we go so this is a video Source right here and then we're going to have a so this is actually like a hard value I've got straight from Tik Tok at the moment so this is kaz's video and then we're actually going to have a video phoo and a video sidebar Right video sidebar David we got another donation Dam dude he says oh my god oh I can't actually see that one oh okay so it's actually on YouTube it actually looks a bit different so on YouTube it looks a bit like this it says Mahesh PO with a dancing chicken thank you so much dude appreciate that thumbs up chicken actually yeah doesn't always show properly and somebody you ask what does the man stand for David so why don't you go ahead and tell them what does M Stack actually stands for mongod DB expressjs reactjs and no JS so these are super hot topics uh in in today in in nowadays uh development world but we just got another donation hey and it's actually orange yeah so it's from anit agoal and he says sunny can we use other de databases like Cassandra later also would love to see Docker in the upcoming videos what's your thoughts on this it's my second donation in the video love you guys firstly massively appreciate that dude thank you so much for a second donation and also to answer your question so I like to keep it somewhat focused because we can very quickly go into all sorts of areas and we never really sort of specialize or get good in one so what I would say is focus your energy on your actual development and in this case what I would say is Firebase and M M Stack development focus on those two things and you will really sort of go far you want to get really really good at those things guys and then like then you can look into the other things in your own time as a hobby but I would say really harness on this and that's when you can actually start making money from it cuz you have to be really good at this stuff yeah once you get great in the fundamental fundamentals then you can just go ahead and learn whatever and super in in like no time yeah exactly once you get that build up that ability to learn and you you're going to go very far with that so uh awesome stuff now um I'm just trying to see if I can get the starts up okay so okay so I can't actually see anything there okay so let's carry on so we've got the video footer component and the video sidebar component when I talk about those guys we're actually going to go let me clear this off the screen for a sec so here you can see the video footer oops I've got it stuck on the video footer is referring to this right here so everything inside of this video footer is what I'm referring to as the footer element uh and then we also have the sidebar which is this element right so the sidebar is that element over there and these are the sort of markings of what we're doing there so it's always good to mark it out because it will help you sort of structure out your build and and sort of like if you ever get stuck or you kind of get into a bit of brain fog you know what you're going to be doing next and it does honestly guys I know it seems a bit pointless at times but it does actually make things a lot easier it really does it really does help especially for uh beginners yeah really really will help you out it will make you overall a a better developer guys if you're doing that so that's going to help you out a lot I'm just pulling up some stats as well nice so we've got the video um footer on the side so now what we're going to do is we're actually going to render this to see if it plays in the uh if if we can actually go ahead and see this so let's go ahead and do the following we're going say video and you can see it says Auto Import from video so we can actually do that little trick so we've imported the component that we just wrote over here and if we save this now and go to our Local Host it says cannot resolve video CSS that's because we created a CSS file uh we didn't create the CSS file sorry but we imported it so if we do that we should be able to see it now guys we can't actually see anything on our page the first thing I want to check is actually that this is a correct video so so that is a video that's working um wow an again he said had to say thanks again really appreciate that dude that's insane thank you so much man like really really love that and appreciate that um let me go ahead and activity stream okay nice so we are $25 in chat Revenue right now guys thank you so much that's insane God yep 1,266 likes as well so really really massively appreciate that nice so we can see that the video isn't actually showing on the output right so we oh no it is here yeah awesome so it is here yeah so that's we can see our video is here and it's working um so let's go ahead and actually take it a step further now so we have the video right here but we actually want this firstly we don't want want it to play autop playay so we're not going to add any kind of autoplay elements we are going to add a few attributes to this we're going to add one which says Loop so that way if you do choose to play the video then we want to be able to Loop through it we also want to have some kind of Click Handler but we will come to that in a sec um and we're also going to give this a class name so let's give this a class name so we can sty it later and we're going to say video player so that's going to be the video player now let's get that swiping functionality done first thing because that's the most crucial part about Tik Tok right so let's go ahead and drop two videos in like so and if we see this now we've got two videos right but we want it so that it actually snaps right so it's actually going to go ahead and snap when you are scrolling so David if we check this one out if I scroll like a little bit and I let go it actually snaps you see that so I'm scrolling and I let go and it snapped just like it has a very nice behavior to it right let me go ahead and get rid of this there we go sorry guys I just saw it says remove the donation I removed that so there we go if we can see it snaps very nicely right so we want to achieve that same functionality in here right now guys please don't um spam if you do spam I'm just simply going to block you like honestly like if you do that I'm going to block you so don't go ahead and spam um right so let's go ahead and the first thing in order to get that functionality what we're going to do is we're going to basically wrap this in a container right so we're going to say um app container so I'm going to say say div and I'm using emit here to get the shortcut I'm going to say app um I think it's app container what did I call it I call it app videos it makes sense just yeah videos oops read app videos there and what we're going to do is we're just simply going to Chuck this inside of here like that right now we are using prettier and prettier is a very nice uh uh formatting tool which is why I didn't have to actually fix all my indentation so if I save the file it fixes it to get this tool all you need to do is go into the extensions type in prettier like so and you'll see the top one you want to enable that it's got so many downloads so you know it's pretty legit um and then what you want to do is go into code insiders preferences settings and make sure you enable this format on Save uh tick that and you'll basically get the functionality that we get right now when we're coding right so let's go ahead and carry on so we've got this app vide so let's go ahead and style this right now so in order to get that snap functionality what we need to do now is we need to open up app. CSS on the side over here we're going to go ahead and pop this over like so and I'm going to make this a bit smaller because right now it's extremely difficult to see that so there we go and you can see app. CSS right so in firstly we're going to have to Target all we're going to have to Target all of the HTML so this is a trick that you have to do when you do this snapping functionality so we're going to add the following line and this will actually allow us to get that um that snapping functionality so you see here we're actually going to go ahead and say for all of the HTML go ahead and make a y snap mandatory right so that will actually start to give us that snapping functionality but here you see nothing's actually snapping at the moment right so it doesn't snap now um what we're going to do is next we're going to basically we have an app container surrounding everything so I'm going to go ahead and at this point remove where it says let's build a full stack man Tic Tac Tik Tok clone we just got a $5 Canadian donation from Ibrahim Ryan yeah thank you dude thank you so much that brought the chat Revenue up to $30 guys thank you so much amazing and we've got 1.3k likes that's what I'm talking about that is what I'm talking about guys and we're still at 900 viewers so this is insane um let's go ahead and check it out so we've got the app video so firstly what I'm going to do is we need to set some boundaries right so for the app itself I'm going to go here and I'm going to say inside of the for the app component I'm going to do a height of 100 view height so let's go ahead and first do that and the reason why we want to do that is because we want to snap according to that 100 view height of whatever device you're on and then I'm going to do a background color of black so just to emphasize if there's anything behind us we want it to be black so like you see like there now it's black right want to be a black background and then basically guys this is a very nice trick that I've learned yeah and basically the way what you're going to do is you basically going to go ahead and change the display to grid right change the display to grid and then what you going to do is you to click Place items Center and what this will do is you see it just perfectly centered and the beautiful thing about this guys is it will perfectly center right now and this is something which we'll fix afterwards you can see I've set it to 100 view height which means that this is actually only going to color in up to 100 view height of the original device height which is what we want at this point because I want trying to show you guys that we want to have that snap functionality perfect um but you can see now it's actually centered everything vertically and horizontally in the center so that's a really really cool trick with just two lines of code so make sure you guys use that trick quite a lot the next part we're going to do is for the app videos right so here we're going to go ahead and do app videos like so and here we're going to say position is relative like so and then we're going to say for the video container itself I want it to be 800 pixels I don't want it to be like a too too big right 800 pixels is good uh and then what we're going to say is a border radius uh let's give it a border radius of 20 pixels um but the overflow will be a scroll so overflow scroll like so and you can see now look at that guys so so you see before it was acting a weird right it was acting strange it was going off the screen but now we've actually contained it so we've said your maximum height is your your actual height is 800 pixels your border radius over here is 20 pixels and we want it to be scrollable okay so it's scrollable but it's not snapping yet then what we're going to say is I want to make the width 80% of the screen so let's go ahead and make it 80% of the screen like so and you can see like that right um and then we're going to say give it a Max width of 500 pixels so we're going to limit that growth right so we're going to limit the growth um and then we're going to go ahead and do scroll snap type so scroll snap type y mandatory now this is another step which is crucial so you see it's the same line of code that we did earlier you need to apply it to HTML and you need to apply it to The Container itself but that's done that's the second part right that's the second part um of getting this to work but you see it still doesn't snap so we almost there but we're not actually we've not got it down just yet another lovely donation from Joe Jamon thank you so much dude I appreciate that that brought us to $30 in chat Revenue thank you so much guys W thank you really really awesome and what we want to do is we want to hide these scroll bars right so to hide these scroll bars I'm going to copy a snippet that I've got online and actually I don't actually remember this snippet I always just Google it and then I always find this again but this is the snippet right here what you want to do is you want to Target the container so app videos and for Chrome Safari and Oprah you want to do this colon colon webkit scroll bar and then you want to do display none and for Internet Explorer Edge and Firefox you want to apply these rules now these rules cuz it is just targeting this you can put them inside of here but I like to keep it separate because I always know that this is the code that's just explicitly doing it for hiding the uh the the bars and you see when I do that now you've actually got this nice little viewfinder right you got like a nice little viewfinder but the video's too big and it's not snapping so let's go ahead and fix that so inside of our video component so this this actual video here we gave it a class name of video player so what we're going to do is we're going to open up video. CSS like so and we're going to go ahead and style that so inside of here what we're going to say is Target video make the position relative like so change the background color to white in case that it ever has any sort of space behind it or anything let's go ahead and make that white yeah so you can see it's very very subtle but there is a white background there uh and then we're going to change the this is the magic bit here so there's there's three lines of code that that are going to completely change the UI here we're going to change the width and the height to 100% that's the first part and if I save that it automatically should fit the container to the content so you see that now it's actually the the video is the correct height right so the video should be the correct height oh no not yet sorry not yet it's almost there it's almost there um so if I do this video yeah so then that we're going to do that and then we're going to say scroll snap align scroll snap align start and this is what will give us that snap functionality you see that now it snaps so if I scroll a little bit down it snaps because what we're doing is we're making the child snap to the start point of the child when we're scrolling so you see that as soon as I sort of scroll a little bit it kind of snaps and you see you get this very very nice sort of snapping functionality so if if you guys didn't know about that trick and you just found out now drop us a thumbs up and let us know in the comments I'd love to see who sees that and who doesn't see that right um a lot of people are saying give us the video URL guys like you can use any video right you can use the any video like please don't focus on the video URL focus on the actual learning behind it because it's not going to benefit you by knowing the exact video you I mean you can pause at this point and copy that but um yeah focus on the actual functionality take a lot of time actually I think it it even work for me with a simple YouTube video so yeah oh yeah so you could use a YouTube video even you could use any video just to see so juren Hector said first time seeing that snap function awesome dude really really glad sham says you are the best shoter Sunny thank you very much dude appreciate that uh it says which language are you using this is all in uh JavaScript right now and we're using the react library to get everything up and running right so with that said now the actual player itself so this video itself to make sure that that doesn't sort of look too big or look a bit strange we're going to go ahead and do video player and then we're going to say firstly we're going to say object fit fill because I want to just use up the cont contents as it needs to and then we're going to say a width and height of 100% so it's only going to use up 100% of its parent container so 100% oops that's 10% oops so you can see it does work if you say 100% now there we go you see that guys you get a lovely perfectly sized and just to prove if we made it 200% see it's stretched out right so it does it just shows you that it is doing something right we just got another donation by J jittin Saina awesome awesome oh thank you so much massive yeah this is this is awesome guys and just if you are new here so we still have 800 people watching guys if you are new here today just to run through you guys we are building the Tik Tok clone with a complete man architecture so it's going to have a react front end and then we're going to have all of the data coming from the back end which is going to be a node.js server and it's going to um be running on the express and then we're also going to be pulling from a mongod DB database and that's what David is going to be showing us so that is going to be some awesome fun stuff to go through guys yeah and we just got another donation from Stephen who is glad that we are not using Firebase well that's why we are here that's why we are going to be using nodejs Express and mongod DB yeah honestly and guys this this video is not to bash Firebase I love Firebase it's so powerful it it has a place and it really like if I had to choose between the two I would choose Firebase but I want to show you guys yeah and even for this build I would go with Firebase as well but just so that you get the most value out of this Channel and out of um watching these lives I think it's crucial to understand uh what is happening in the background using a backend uh service like Firebase right yeah exactly and in a job setting and in a professional environment you're going to be pretty much needing to know full stack development so there may be an Express server on the back end and things like that and you need to know about those two things and how just like in the beginning I remember I was kind of confused I was like hang on is is is my node.js server a separate app that I'm running cuz I was like shouldn't it all be one app right like and I was super conf and it took me ages to figure that out like so guys if anyone else has that same like pain or got confused let us know in the comments because I really kind of was like whoo whoa whoo I'm already doing mpm stuff so my app's already running why do I need another app running which is a node.js server so that kind of confused me when I was learning but we're going to clear all of that up for you today uh and somebody says do I need to learn node and express before learning mongod DB uh yeah I would say it's a prerequisite you would need to know node but guys don't even worry about learning all those things separately just follow us along and you guys will will be able to uh be able to see that right uh we just got another we got a PHP donation he says hey guys we are watching from the Philipp hey we have some team members from the Philippines that's awesome dude yeah nice oh guys thank you so much for these donations let's go ahead and jump back on so let's go ahead let me move this out the way thank you so much Stephen K for that donation as well right so we have the video player so now we've got the the UI sort of looking pretty good right so the eyes looking pretty decent uh so we're going to go ahead and carry on so for the video itself what we're going to now do is we are going to go ahead and go over to let's go ahead and let's actually add over some of the components let's add a video Foo and let's add a video sidebar and then we'll enhance this afterwards with what we're doing actually no before we do that let's actually sort out this functionality CU right now if I click this it doesn't play right if if I click this it doesn't actually play anything so what we need to do now guys is to be able to make this video actually play when we click it we're going to use something called a reference right so a reference in JavaScript is essentially just think of it as like a pointer right it's just like literally imagine your finger is a pointer you just point towards that video video sort of element and then every time you click it you're saying all right the thing you're pointing at play it and then if you click it again the thing you're pointing out pause it that's that's the the easiest way to kind of think of what a reference is right so let's go ahead and actually Implement that and it should make a bit more sense so we're going to be using the use ref hook because this is a functional component so we're going to say const um video reference so con video ref equals use ref and initially it will start off with a no right value so you see it says us ref is not defined so let's go ahead and import that from react you can do it two ways you can either go to the end of us ref and click type in control space bar and it will actually come up and say Auto Import from react or you can type it in it's whatever is your preference click save and then you should be able to see everything loaded okay so that's all good and then what we can do is we need to attach this we need to point towards the video so in order to attach it to the video we say reference equals that video reference and that's it that's pretty much at this point this reference now is like it's like a giant finger which is just pointing towards that video right so now we have a way of targeting that video if we want to play it if we want to pause it whatever we want to do right um also I love I love the fact that in our comment section people are actually answering other people's questions like it's really nice to see that so somebody say you don't need to connect you just create an API on a backend server and then use the API in your front end hope this helps yeah so that's exactly what we're doing today we're going to be building an API on the back end so we're going to have like a little backend server running and then we're going to actually be communicating it from our front end so this is amazing guys to see that you guys are helping each other out uh really really love and appreciate that and guys David what can they do if they're enjoying the content so far uh they can just go ahead and destroy that like button like literally this is what the like button should see like boom exactly guys you just want to completely smash that thumbs up button and yeah that's all we want guys this will help the video get out to as many people as possible we are actually over nearly over 14,000 playbacks already which is just mindblowing like it's insane we're just about to hit 1500 likes as well so really really amazing stuff guys let's carry on strong so now what we're going to do is when we click on that video we want to click trigger off a function right and that function is going to be like Play the video stop the video so what we're going to do is we're going to say onclick so on click and then we're going to have something like handle video press right so we're going to create a function called handle video press so let's go ahead and create that function we're going to say handle oops whoa handle video press oops and then that's going to take nothing as an argument uh so this is an arrow function in es6 that's how you write them and now guys we need to somehow say like if video is playing right so if the video is playing stop it I guess right um otherwise like like literally if the video is playing stop it otherwise if it's not playing yeah literally play it right and it seems silly right it seems like why would you need to write that out trust me guys when you're learning do that like it will save you time like do that and actually just write out because some people will kind of run away and think oh I'm too clever I don't need to comment things but like trust me it just makes it a lot easier guys like when you just do that right like um it does make it a lot easier so now the reason why this will make it easier is because now it will actually answer a question we need a piece of state or some kind of variable to keep track of if the video is playing right right now we don't have that we have no way of telling if the video is currently playing or not right so what we're going to do is we're going to introduce a piece of state and this one's going to be called const we're going to call it playing like is the video playing right and this is how you write a very inside of react so it's called H we use the use State hook and we're going to give it an initial value of FAL because the video won't be playing by default right now what we can do is we and you want to import that at the top now you what you want to do is uh so David Jonathan says are we ever going to try graph ql of course we are David of course we are we got we got react native coming up we will go ahead and do graph ql we'll try like some Apollo stuff even nextjs like if we get enough like hype on that we'll jump on that so yeah we'll be jumping on all of that and even typescript so I actually code in typescript quite a lot uh when I'm doing side projects so I happy to go through all of that yeah awesome um so now what we're going to do is we are going to say if playing so now we have something to check against if it's playing then what we do is we say video ref right which is the pointer that I spoke about earlier video and gats spe I will we can cover gatp as well so video ref dot current right so this means what is the current thing it's pointing at then we just say pause right so if it's playing then pause the video right else yeah oops God damn it else if it's not playing then what we're going to do is Target the video ref get the current thing that it's pointing at and play it right so that's pretty much what we said here in a nutshell so we have this but whenever we do that we have to update that little variable so that it's it keeps it keeps track of what's going on so if we pause the video we need to set playing to F right and if we play the video we need to set playing to true and that way that little variable that we're checking against knows if the video is playing or if we pause the video right so we're going to go ahead and save that um so James Gardner says do you guys look into microservices at all um very good question actually I we look at I try like to kind of focus on things like Firebase because it kind of like abstracts a lot of the complexities of like microservices out of the way but I think microservices are very important to know what they are and so I would recommend everyone researches what that is and also this is the good start to actually understanding those sort of principles because we are learning full stack development right now we're going to be doing a complete man stack build and how you choose to host these small Services which could be considered as small Services um will actually open up um the door to that that sort of domain so is heru is capable of handling microservices pretty well yeah as far as I know yeah exactly thov vinard says any update on the react course we have an amazing course guys called profit with JavaScript the link is in the description I coach on there every single Tuesday we have tons of good content in there including a bunch of react content and a few people even in today's session like David Jonathan are in those react coaching calls uh and David actually ran yesterday's one so amazing stuff and yeah and like guys like there is a lot of react content in there so so definitely yes we have it inside of the uh course at the moment okay so awesome stuff so now what we can do is we can actually go ahead and check if this works so let's go ahead and click refresh and if I click if I tap this now so I'm going to click hey and if I press it again look at that guys so it works so you can see I'm actually clicking it nice right and it does work awesome nice so that's a that's an awesome thing right now so do you make okay so nice now what we're going to do is that actually fixed the video playing functionality so a very simple level this app is pretty much working as we need it to at this point but we're going to go ahead and enhance the UI a little bit right we're going to go ahead and Implement these two components the video footer and the video sidebar right so let's go ahead and create both of those components so video foo.js and let's go ahead and do RFC boom we get that let's go ahead and do a class name so this is setup which we just should get very fast at doing and it makes our life a lot easier and we also need to go ahead and create the video photo. CSS file so video photo. CSS whoa we just got another donation thank you so much he goes my pathmaker S react God you missed one s dude damn it that's my fault for having too many s's in my name no appreciate that dude thank you so much uh D DM sing nice uh and we need to go ahead and create the corresponding video I just did it for you oh okay uh one sec video for CSS so David went ahead and created this one so let's go ahead and actually create a video sidebar as well so I'm going to create a video sidebar so video sidebar. JS and David you want to go ahead and create the CSS file while I set this up yep so nice so I'm going to create a class name and this one is going to be video sidebar like so and we're going to do import video sidebar. CSS nice awesome and David went ahead and created the video sidebar CSS file so that's why we don't have the issue popping up right so somebody said should Co PA programming yeah that's exctly this cool pairr we doing it with VSS code live share so really exciting stuff um somebody said should I also learn JavaScript dude if you're not learning JavaScript what are you doing make sure you go ahead and learn JavaScript there is so much money in this field right now I want to scream like if somebody says should I learn it like go ahead and learn it guys like the the the market is booming right now like and and especially with react that's the only thing you should be learning yeah like react like guys you can work from Bahamas Caribbean like anywhere you want in the world is if you know this skill like all you need is an internet con connection and I see so many people like oh do I need to know this like or like do I should I do this or I'm it's too difficult I'm too young I'm too old throw all the excuses Straight Out The Window Guys like you don't need to like over complicate this stuff if you are on the edge just start right just start just follow the live streams these are all free right now right and we so have a react challenge link is in the description if you haven't signed up yet and you're new watching right now please please please go ahead and sign up to that react challenge because it's completely free and it's going to give you guys so much value especially you guys who are new to programming so go ahead and sign up to that 6,000 worth uh $6,000 worth of prizes as well so really fun stuff there so now we've got the video sidebar open let's go ahead and actually work on these components David so let's firstly let's do the video foot yeah let's do the video fo video foot there there we go Auto Import nice and guys it's David's first video as well like we just hit 1.5k likes can we can we give David some love right now in the chat right now right guys cuz he is literally super super Brave to just jump onto these intense builds and like try and provide you guys as much value as you can like guys these are M Stack builds these are full builds right there a full full builds and like David has literally just jumped down and said like I'm ready for this like he said he just started coding um not long ago March March yeah yeah actually it was April exactly yeah yeah um for the challenge if you guys are on the fence the challenge is the best kickart like ever that you could think like I mean we there are these lives every single day it's cool and all but to actually get started you need a bigger project that looks awesome and that will just kick you kick you in the butt and you will just go ahead yeah it's exactly exactly guys like it will yeah it really will David you're getting so much love right now in the chat damn dude yeah that's insane thank you guys hey love that guys we love that positivity that is awesome guys let's go ahead and carry on so this so we got the video footer component so we're going to go ahead and jump into that and what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to have a few things in here so we are going to have a div which is going to in include all of the text so when I mean all of the text I'm just I'm talking about all of this stuff right here so all of this text right here in the bottom is going to be referred to as video foter text right so let's go ahead and do that now so here I'm going to say we're going to create a div and this one's going to be called video footer text like that and then in here we're going to have a H3 so the H3 is going to have a channel name so here let's just do uh Instagram handle for now and it's it's going to have a P tag and this is going to be some kind of description right so it's going to have some kind of description somewhere uh and then we're also going to have the ticker so the ticker will Implement afterwards um so somebody's what about making Tinder Tinder is tomorrow dude so we have yeah we have Tinder coming tomorrow so you guys wa for treat there yes so today we're gonna be bu we building the Tik Tok tomorrow is going to be Tinder and on Friday we're going to be building what'sapp yeah God Friday is a big boy build guys like you're ex yeah that's going to be huge so massive massive things coming so for the video fo. CSS now what we're going to do is we're going to style this a bit so we can actually see some of that text and in order to do that what we're going to do is I'm going to add the following to the video footer going to say video footer position relative the color should be white bottom should be 150 pixels uh away from it and right now obviously we can't see anything oh no there we can we can finally see it pop in so you can see it's relative uh it's got we've got a color white text the bottom is pushed up so if I went ahead and changed this to zero pixels you'll see that it actually kind of snaps way far down so we need to actually go ahead and give it a little bit less so you see like if I do 100 it comes up there so 150 up from the bottom left 40 pixels away from the left so that way that's why we've got this little Gap here and then we're also going to say display Flex because we're going to have some stuff inside of it for that text field I want it to grow as much as possible so I'm going to go ahead and add Flex one to that field and it will make sense as as to why we're going to do that in a sec but I'm going to go ahead and Target the P tag inside of the text field and say give it a padding bottom of uh of 20 pixels so that way whenever we've got some stuff underneath it um we can actually sort of have a little bit of a gap underneath so it shouldn't be too bunched up we're then going to Target the H3 so you can see the H3 sits on top where it says SSS s and then we're going to go ahead and give that some padding bottom so it separates a little bit so now you see where it says this is some description we actually have a bit more space in away from that right so that makes it a little bit more readable now what we're going to do is let's go ahead and actually add a few things in so the first thing we need is some icons right so we need some icons uh so we're going to need this music icon so let me go ahead and get rid of that we're going to need this music icon right here this one is called the music note icon for material UI and I'm going to show you guys what material you in a second and we need this ticker this ticker is a third party Library sort of that we're going to import that somebody else has created and we're going to go ahead and create that and then we're also going to pull this icon so let's start with the icons right so the icons and also I just want to address this question so Ahmed Ali says sunny how much difference is there between react and react native put it this way Amed if you can code and react and a job says to you hey I need you to code and react native you can do that and I'm living proof because my first job I'd never coded in in react n before um but I got the job for the for the react position and then before you know it I was coding react native so extremely similar extremely close builds uh we have a lot of people who are reposting stories and all sorts of stuff like that where they're actually building some react native apps which is awesome because we haven't even taught react native yet so if you know react you can code in react native put it that way um the Heidi B yeah so someone from the pwj uh Community reached out to me that he got a client and he wants me to help with react native and I was like well I never CAU it in react native but let's go ahead and try it and within like 15 or 20 minutes I had react native up running yeah so it's super easy to start with it yeah and I think the updates lately have made it even better so it's really awesome Heidi I think she's from um she actually joined not too long ago inside a Prof JavaScript she said great job loving the build today sunny and David thank you so much appreciate that yo thank you oh nice check this one out okay so we we actually have a really lovely comment here by Redan uh it hasn't popped up but let me go ahead and see if I can grab it in the cuz this is actually something quite cool so Redan says let me go ahead and pop it in here guys and we'll carry on with the build so Redan said I got a frontend job with only JavaScript it pays so well if you want a good job follow these videos it's super good I wish I had this back in the day dude I wish I had this back in the day when I was learning too like if if somebody could actually give practical knowledge but ran is living proof guys and um that's another person we should add to the the guys our goal is yeah our goal is literally to get 5,000 developers um on uh in this year with a developer job right yeah exactly and then next year 10,000 as far as I know EXA exactly that's it and we are going to hit that guys like so that is awesome uh another donation thank you so much he say can we make it load Rand vids every time when refreshed we will show you the full stack build first if we get time we can do that but um it's not a main priority for today I think the full stack element is more important for today um so let's carry on guys so to get those beautiful looking icons that you guys have at the bottom and those and those sort of things what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and install something called material UI so it's a design Library by Google you want to go in and you want to do this line right here mpm install material UI core so we're going to go ahead I like like to just click on ADD so you don't actually close that previously running terminal so we're going to go ahead and do this so mpm install material UI core like so okay uh so we're going to do that and then what you want to do is you want to go on to so that will install and then that will give us all of the material UI components so they have a bunch of components like an avatar a few other things we might need um but you're actually going to need that in order to choose the icon so the next thing you want do is to the search by typing icons and then you want to do this mpm install material UI icons like so so you want to go ahead and drop that in like that and that will go ahead and pop in oh guys actually don't go ahead and do this make sure you're in the right directory so right now what I'm going to go ahead and do is I was in the wrong directory so I'm going to actually go ahead and delete that one so package lock delete make sure you don't do that mistake that will bite you back later on when it comes to deploying so make sure you're cded into the right directory uh and then let's do it so let's do that again so mpm install material UI core and then you want to do mpm install material UI icons um so somebody says bootstrap is not as good as material UI uh I I tend to I mean uh bootstrap is it's good for when you're learning it's good for like if you're doing a lot of freelance work material UI is just so clean it's honestly has such a clean looking fill to it it look it's very easy to implement and use it documentation is amazing and we use it in every re build and you guys can see the power of it because the apps look amazing right um and I end up fighting yeah I mean David I don't know about you but I find that I fight a lot with um with um material UI no sorry not Material I find I fight a lot with bootstrap with bootstrap I don't know um I I usually before these lives I was using always um bootstrap and I I I could get by pretty easily I mean uh for the for uh for beginners I would definitely recommend using bootstrap uh they actually give you like Snippets of code and you don't have to um import that much stuff and you don't have to like mpm install stuff you can just uh use the cian um but then when when you get Advanced I would definitely go with the material UI yeah exactly and I agree uh we have a good question which just relates to ahed says yo Papa react Sunny I'm feeling really bad about responsiveness and he basically says like after I do projects I suck at the responsive part of it my advice here is use something like material UI and read up on it and because it will help you get like the especially the grid functionality inside of it that will help a lot but I would say use something called storybook storybook will help you become a very good responsive uh coder so if you're interested go and learn story book I might drop a um a video on that actually I find I think it might help a lot of people Rin also said I joined pwp and the knowledge I gained massive knowledge within a short span of time plus views of my portfolio increased by 600% due to live projects by Sunny oh that's amazing dude wow that's amazing actually for responsiveness I have like a very beginner friendly and not too elegant way but it's a great way to start yeah so back in the day when I started coding I uh actually created three different CSS files and based on the width of the screen I imported uh the other one so I had one for uh optic for iPhones another one for iPads and another one for Macs you can go ahead it's not the most elegant but then you will have a a bit of understanding on what what's where right my my advice would be is because you want to stick to a convention that's recognized by as many people as possible so media queries would be my start if I if you're talking responsive design media qu will be a really good place to start and then flexbox guys learn Flex box and your responsive design will go through the roof and my best recommendation can be flexbox froggy so this website will change your life when it comes to responsive design so if you're interested in that go ahead and check that out but yeah honestly like it's it's all a case of just trying and playing around with it I think we should definitely jump back into the code so the next part guys is for the material icons you want to click on this link here so search the full list of these icons this is how we find the icons whenever we're coding so if I want to go ahead and type in something like dis or something you see like dis full pops up I think the one I was looking for is music note icon so music note icon so music note so this one is how you get like the music note icon and it'll give you the import code at the top and then you can just pull it into the app so if you see any import logic and things like that this is how we find the icon itself so let's go ahead and do this um somebody says which is best flexbox or css CSS is the language flexbox is part of CSS so just clear that up tool yeah y um um nice so you've also got CSS grid so Alex code says good day evening everyone that yeah that's nice thank you dude good day to you too yo how's it going nice uh awesome so let's go ahead and carry on guys so the music no icon we're going to import into our code so at the top boom we have it there save the file and then inside so underneath the the text over here we're going to create a div and this one's going to be called the video footer ticker because it's going to have the ticker inside of it as well as that music note icon so I'm going to go ahead and pop the icon in here and you can see that we're giving a class name or video footo icon so that way we can start it afterwards um so now what we're also going to do is so you see that ticker at the bottom guys so you see we've got the music note icon popped in but this beautiful ticker that kind of Scrolls across that right there is actually something which wasn't built by us it was built by somebody else so what we're going to be using is something called react ticker so we need to go ahead and import this so to do that we're going to say open this say mpm install react ticker and hit the ENT key and that will go ahead and install this package into our app and then what we need to do is import that into the project so let's go to the top go here and we're going to say import ticker from react ticker like so and then what we're going to do is to actually use the ticker I'm going to paste the snippet of code that we pretty much need to use and I'll explain what it does so we're going to put it inside of our container here so we're going to drop that down and this is the code right here so it takes a prop that they've actually implemented so this one right here and the mode is you see if I hover over it says smooth chain or a weight and smooth essentially means that like it will start showing the text again once it goes out of the screen right so that's what we're using smooth for and then what we're going to say is here the index we don't actually need this Index right here so this is called a higher order component so it's actually giving us a something called a render prop uh and then it's rendering out this jsx here but right now we don't have a song prop so instead I'm just going to say I am a song so I am a song like so save it and you can see look at that it says I am a song and it works right and if I get rid of the mode you can see you actually see like I am a song I am a song I am a song I am a song so like they built it in a way that if you say smooth it will only show once it goes past that point which is really nice yeah then what we're going to do is we're actually going to have an image tag underneath all of this so let's go ahead and drop this in over here so underneath everything outside those divs I'm going to add a video foter record and this huge record that spins so on the actual one you can see it spins and we're going to add that spinning animation but this is the actual record itself and and this is the URL for it it's just a PNG and the class name of video footer record okay um whoa dude I just saw ahed Ali say papa react by the way thanks to you I have sold the Amazon clone by eding eding it based on client needs fonts and logos $400 $400 oh my God that's insane guys that is insane like I love that and guys like you know a lot of people do say like like oh like the course is this much or this that like guys he just made it back from like literally one of the Clones which are completely free so like if you find that that's valuable then the course and things like that we take it a whole step further um so make sure if you're not already I'm going to repeat again be sure to join the 5day coding react challenge which goes live on Monday starting um and guys you're going to get huge value this is yeah you you will get that thing for free and you can sell it for $400 yeah exactly yeah so he got that he sold this he sold that app for $400 and this is actually the complete this is actually the like a more advanced version of the Amazon app with payment and things like that so we're going to be using stripe so it's insane oh I said you oops this is not you will be using stripe yeah stripe yeah using stripe let me move the uh we're actually blocking the uh footer somebody said so I'm going to make us a little bit smaller guys and pop us over to the side so that should be a bit easier uh and now if I go ahead and check there we go so now you guys should be able to see a little bit easier you can see that little spinning icon at the bottom there you go now whoa multilingual program has just said I just joined profit with JavaScript uh if that's Todd Brown then let me know in the comments below cuz that is amazing if you just joined thank you so much we actually get notified when people join so if you have joined I will definitely see it through my phone right now so let me know if that was you Todd Brown thank you that's awesome dude right so let's go ahead and check so now what we're going to do is we're going to save this and you see we've got all the list up it doesn't look like the final thing right um oh wow also Pap I have credit limits on card I won't use that $400 that's yours man we'll join pwj right right after limits lift up oh snap dude honestly like this is insane dude this is insane like dude like look you landed the client well done to you firstly like you you've crushed it and keep up that positivity that's the kind of stuff we want to see in this community that's insane we just hit4 in dollar and $40 in chat revenues thank you so much guys thank you right so now we have um where it says I am a song so now I'm basically going to go ahead and actually style this to make it look nicer because right now it doesn't look that good right so let's go to the video footer and what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and firstly we're going to Target the ACT ual um video for a ticker right so let's go ahead and Target the ticker and basically they give you a so that that ticker itself actually has an internal class that they don't tell you about and it's called ticker so I inspected and I found out we're going to give it a height to fit the content margin left of 30 pixels and a width of 60 so if I save that it will change the look and feel of that a little bit um we're also going to go ahead and actually so you see right now it's actually flying not next to it right so it's kind of like underneath it we don't want that right so in order to fix that what we do is we say video foter icon which is what I gave the uh music note so that little floating music note I'm gave that and say position absolute save that and we should see now let's go ahead and we should see that it now Pops in next to it which is a lot cleaner right because it's absolutely positioned within its little container so that will make it a little bit cleaner then we're going to do is we're going to Target that H1 we're going to give it a um padding top of seven pixels so that's going to be the little H1 that we have where it says I am a song uh and then basically I'm going to add an animation so this animation I got from actually create react app so it's I'm going to call it spin the record and what it's going to do is it's going to go from a rotation of 0° to a rotation of 360° right now how do we actually apply this animation like cuz it sounds kind of cool right but I don't know how we actually apply that so in order to apply that what we do is we target the record and the record is over here so we go ahead and Target the record to the class name here we grab it and we pretty much do the following so we say go ahead and use the animation spin the record so this one make it an infinite Loop and basically go from 0° to 360 in 5 seconds in a linear speed right then it's going to say height of 50 pixels this filter you see this is a black image right here right so this was actually a black image over here so I'm going to go ahead and move that this one is a black image over here I'm actually going to go ahead and invert the color so this one when I save will go white and then we're going to say position absolute bottom zero right 20 so it should stick to the bottom right over here here as soon as I hit save boom there we go beautiful and this is all in relation to the container itself so if I go ahead and scroll up you see it's actually part of just that video container so very very very nice design right so that's clean that's very very nice and now what we're going to do is we are actually with that said and done we have finished the uh video footer so that's super clean David and I think we actually went at a very good speed there so we've got the video for done yeah uh so we're almost done with the is so we done the uh I just done the little round of applause nice yeah so so we actually need to now do yeah so we are almost actually done with the Clone the the front end portion of the Clone yeah and then we're basically going to go ahead so I'm going to go ahead and finish off the video foot video sidebar with yourself and then let's actually move over to the back end right and we'll show everything in that sense silicon TV says is reactjs and Django a backend as backend good combination yeah I mean I see a lot of people do it uh we're going to be using reactjs and nodejs as the back end because that's even better in my opinion because it's both JavaScript so it's easier to maintain easier to sort of work on um but uh yeah there's nothing wrong with using Jango as a backend and if you're good at Django if you're good at if you have python experience go for it yeah then go for it yeah yeah and thank you by the way silic TV you just pushed us over $40 in chat donations so amazing now we're going to say video sidebar let's go ahead and create this right now so video sidebar uh and then it's going to complain cuz there is no video sidebar I'm going to do video sidebar. JS oops did I create that oops oh yeah we did create that yeah you created yeah yeah yeah I forgot we actually prepared so in order to import it little trick control space bar Auto Import and it will pull in this right here hit save and there we go we have the sidebar so right now obviously the sidebar doesn't have anything so let's go ahead and add what we need inside the sidebar so over here now what we're going to do is we have we have a few different buttons right so over here we have like a like button you see it even has clickable functionality um and and let's go to this one cuz you can see it a bit clearer but you see we have like a a container here we have a container here and we have a container here right each one we're going to be we're going to call it so we're going to say Dev video sidebar uncore button so it's going to be like a button container and it's going to be repeated three times right so three times each one is going to have an IC icon and a number icon a number icon a number the first one the second uh no so the first one is actually going to have a favorite icon so we're going to go ahead and do this import the favorite icon and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and add the following so we're going to say favorite icon and they actually take a prop called font size which will actually make it a little bit bigger so if I go ahead and add that in now and save the app and go back here we can't see anything but it is there right uh and I'll show you we'll style it so you guys will see it in just a second so we're going to add in this one we're going to add something called a message icon and in the last one we're going to add something called a share icon right so in this one we're going to add something called a share icon then we're going to go ahead and import these at the top of the page so let's go ahead and do this and then we have all of those inside now obviously it's not pulling the correct uh things right now so I'm going to go ahead open up the sidebar CSS and let go ahead and make this visible so for the parent container we're going to say video sidebar like so we're going to say position absolute right so position is absolute we're going to say the top you should be 50% from the top and we're going to say you should stick away from the right side of the screen by 10 pixels go ahead and save that and you can see now we actually have those beautiful little icons pop up oh nice so they pop up and because uh the parent is relative it's going to stick to you see it sticks to that video yeah yeah and then we say the color should be white so let's go ahead and do that and it actually turns to White and then for the the button itself what we're going to say is that container itself so that video sideb button container give it a padding of 20 and align the text centrally so when we have some text there it will send to that text so let's hop over back here and each one of these now will just simply have a number underneath it right so they're just going to be pretty much P tags underneath so this one would be something like P and it would say something like 100 this one would be something like this and it would say something like uh let's just say it was like 250 messages on it and this one would be the number of shares so let's just say 12 people shared it if we hit save you can see the numbers pop up nicely yeah now nice so very very clean right very very clean very very um slick implementation there so now what we're going to do is we have we want to pass this information in as a prop but I want this to be clickable as well so to make this clickable what we're going to do is we're going to introduce a piece of state and it's going to keep track of if you click like or not like so if you click like so we're actually going to get a variable called liked and it's going to initially start with a value of false now what we're going to say is if so this is jsx right here we're going to say if it's liked so if you have already liked it then you should render out the favorite icon because this one is actually the one that's populated um and it's sort of colored in right and then there's also an icon which is a heart but it's not colored in right so the one that we're going to use here is something called favorite border icon so if I go ahead and click save uh and I import this from Material UI so let's go ahead and import at the top now what you'll see is use State also needs to be imported so let's go ahead and click Auto Import do it and we just got another donation thank you so much he says no JS is worth to learn because of the Firebase so honestly guys node.js is whoa I got my friend in the chat as well this is dope so chery firstly um nodejs is worth to learn because of the fireus yes so today we're going to be showing you how to use nodejs in a M Stack build so it's going to pretty much be front end and back end front end is in react JavaScript and the back end is in nodejs which is server side JavaScript so essentially the same thing various minor differences but if you can C in JavaScript you can use them across now I just want to highlight this one this is one of my best friends um and I actually caught up with him today he goes I used to study with sunny and my God this guy is such a beast of cing oh that's that's awesome to see my friends watching this massively appreciate that Jay and yeah and he actually contacted me today about a coding interview was a python one and he Sunny my man such a you smash that like button you heard him guys we are just under David we're just under 20,000 playbacks already oh my God 20,000 yeah just under just under 1,700 likes guys if you're enjoying the content please just smash that Thumbs Up Button massively appreciate it'll send this video out to as many people as you possibly can uh I appreciate that bro uh nice that is awesome and also yeah to answer the other question uh if you do learn node.js on um on Firebase if you ever need to write a cloud function which is essentially something which lives in the in in the cloud and it can scale up scale down but it's it's pretty much just a piece of JavaScript code that you can call on when needed um you can write that in nodejs so that will help you out a lot um Ahmed Ali just said I earned my first $400 from you having a goal of earning my first 1K with react wish me I working hard day and night David what have you got to say to that who good luck dude and and let's go and keep crushing that's all I can say I mean yeah those 400 there we go more to come yeah exactly as a few people are excited for you David they said I'm waiting for David's part that must be fire too hell yeah dude that's exciting oh actually I know that guy he's one of my friends hey're going to college yeah yo Dani what's good that's awesome dude nice we got friends on this chat as well that is nice all right of course so oh I love this sunny you're so cool you're you're proof that you can be cool and a programmer I appreciate that dude David's cool too you know like there was a sick guy was I mean if if his backend works like as if if his nodejs stuff works then he's cool right so no no pressure David no pressure oh man so we're going to make it so that when we click on the notice how when we click on the uh so when it's like this if I added this on click here which say set like to true so if I click that you see it actually changed right if I do the same thing for when it's populated and we say onclick set like to false then what we have now is actually a really nice implementation where it will flick the liked variable between true and false based on which one is rendering and you can see now look at that we get this nice little thing right here right now that works really nicely but we also want that number to update so here what we could say is if liked then it's going to to be 100 else it'll be 101 right this is temporarily for now and obviously we will make this a bit oh sorry if it's like it should be 101 otherwise it should be 100 just for now we are going to make this properly implemented but you can see now it says 101 100 right so a very dummy level that works really nice um uh oh nice this guy arm dude you're crushing man he says by the way I'm turning 18 this year so same age as amanath one of our key students who I work with daily um and he's crushing it as well same age as you he says just hate universities if somebody would ask me who is my best teacher we point them to you lots of love appreciate that dude and just wanted to say this is living proof guys it doesn't matter what age you are just start right it doesn't matter I have one of my youngest students is 12 years old and he landed his own school yeah my youngest student did you just say 12 like one and two he's 12 years old and he and and he landed his school as his um as his uh is it his first client so they asked for a website and he was like oh I can code and they were like really and then like he was like yeah sure I I'll build this thing for you and then he literally built it within two days boom came back they actually paid him for it so 12 years old oh my goodness insane yeah really really insane really really lovely to see as well yeah nice so um let's go ahead and check it out so somebody says why don't they have a startup dude I have had a startup company before uh so it's a lot of work um yeah but yeah once you once you can code you can do whatever you want to do so really really nice all right so let's carry on guys so there we go it works really beautifully now what we want to do is somebody said you can use a hook and put the camera right there you can use a hook but we're going to pass in those things as a prop right so now what we want to do is for the video sidebar I'm going to show you guys props so obviously I don't want it to be 100 I don't want these to be set numbers I want to pass in a value and then render it based on the the value gets passed in so in this case this is where the props come in so Props are basically uh like properties for a component so in this case what we can do is we can actually go ahead and destructure this is es6 syntax and we can pass in something like likes shares and messages right and then here what I can say is the likes should be if it was 101 we could say this should be likes oops this is already in jsx we say likes plus one and here should just be the likes and we're going to replace everything so here the messages should be messages whatever prop we passed in and here the shares should interrupt you bro but we got Abdul who earned $800 uh in one month yes damn bro let's have a look so he says because of you guys I earned $800 in one month love you dude that's insane oh my God I love like that just like oh that makes you so happy dude damn and like guys if like Abdul for example like you landed a client who paid 800 in one month do you mind just dropping it in the comment section like where was your client from how did you find them cuz I see a few other people asking I think that would be really helpful to actually tell other people we have loads of videos where we actually share this out um and we actually sort of talk about this Rachel did an amazing one on freelancing with kazy which you guys should definitely check out that is a free video on the channel um make sure you go and check that out because that is that was awesome and actually helped a lot of people land clients so that's really good and it showed you how to sign up to upwork and the sort of a template you can use to get started with that that is really really goodly um so okay let's jump back just do it that's awesome dude no thank you for pointing that out that's really really that's good stuff like nice so you can see now the numbers have disappeared right so if we go inside of the video footer if we go down to our video components let's go down to video so now we actually need to pass it through so here if I said the likes were for example 111 the shares were for example 222 just to exaggerate this and the messages were for example 333 now if we save it that gets passed through as a prop and you can see now it comes through so obviously I passed it in in a weird way that's why it doesn't seem right but it is right so likes 111 messages 333 and the shares is 222 so you see it actually does pass through as a prop right which is awesome we want to do the same thing with the video footer U so let's go over to our video footer and we can see here we actually need to go ahead and pass in a few things so for the video photo this is where the props comes in so we're going to destructure it and we're going to say pass in a channel a description a description and a song like so right and instead of doing this we're going to say this one should be at the channel name so like so this one should be a description deson so like a description like this and the final one should be a song right like so so it should be song right and now you can see obviously it's not going to render anything because we have actually passed it something so we need to go back to video and we need to pass in the F so let's just say for example the channel is um let's go ahead and say ssss s and then the description is wow epic M Stack clone TI to Tik Tok alone yeah Tik Tok let's scream at this thing yeah yeah and then and then we'll say song is song is I don't know 99 problems but react a one there we go hey I I mean guys I think that was smooth yeah I I don't think that is the original title yeah I mean like I think that does have like if you found that good I think you smash that thumbs up button oh man oh it's JayZ right yeah that's JayZ oh I love this one by ler out such a class thank you so much for the kind words lay through off uh we will keep on bringing the content that is awesome thank you dude right yeah that's JayZ nice so JayZ feed sunny exactly yeah and so now what we're going to do is we've got everything sort of like passing through as a prop right now the video itself what we want to do is we kind of want to drill down and pass that as a prop so we actually want everything to come through as props here and then we kind of pass it through the video so so to to make sense of this what I'm going to say is essentially the the URL of the video should be a prop so this one here should actually be a prop so I'm going to go ahead and cut this and say that this should just be something like URL right because we want to make the video customizable so here I can just pass in url and then save it and then what we can do is we can go back to app.js and then here I could just say the URL should be for example that that that um URL here and then if we refresh it you see it works yeah but we also want to pass in all the properties at this point as well so uh we want to pass in like all of the other things like and then that way it's just essentially we're just rendering out the video with a bunch of props and then it kind of gets passed down right um this is a lovely comment as well from deanii AG while Sunny because of you I could complete a whole clone project which I couldn't when I was following regular videos you and your team is super fun and awesome we love that thank you so much and thank you for just watching these videos cuz honestly like the fact you guys watch this stuff and find it useful it changes everything and it makes this whole thing worth it so really appreciate that nice um so here we're going to pass in a few things so all of the props that we pretty much saw before whoa dude we just got a huge donation D wow Diego Serano just says working in a side project that's worth a few thousand us I'm applying all your tricks for react plain JavaScript CSS and material UI just sharing this minimum amount but worth too much to me all love for the knowledge you share that's insane dude that's amazing and that's another example yeah that's another example of someone else who has got a job or a client or a job like a gig from these videos guys so like oh that's that's just I love to see that and and thank you so much Diego like $20 is insane like thank you so much for that we really really do appreciate that and that actually brought the chat Revenue up to $63 guys so thank you so much whoa that is awesome nice yeah really really awesome now um let's go ahead and actually add the rest of the props in so we're going to add in all of those props that we pretty much passed before we're going to pass at this level and then we're going to basically filter them through so you see it says Channel description song Etc so here what we would say is the channel would be um the channel here the description would be the description because it's coming from the props now here the song would be the song like that and then for the video sidebar here it would be the likes so you see the likes the messages and the shares so we're basically passing it through now and even here we're passing it through and with that said now it shouldn't actually be uh okay so we're still passing but you see all of the details have gone right so all those details have actually gone so now we need to go to app.js and we need to go down here and we basically need to just pass in those props so you can see what we done here guys we actually done something called it's a like it's like a two level prop drilling situation so it's very light it's not very bad in doing it like that um but when you start going to levels where you're drilling down three four levels deep that's when you need to bring in something like Redux or the react context API but in this case it's perfectly fine to do that so let's go ahead and add in some of the props you can see the channel Pops in the description is going to be yo this works uh the what other ones was it the song is going to be song was 99 problem about react name one react one nice by JayZ featuring nice the likes are going to be 123 the messages not a prop yeah that's not not a state oh yeah no that works yeah that work messages are going to be 456 and the shares are going to be 789 so let's just go ahead with some generic numbers like that boom and you can see everything got passed down so that's awesome like everything gets passed down that looks really really clean and you can see how little addon works really nice and everything's spinning so this at this point we've got the build working so you see now the second one rendering is is blank because we don't actually have anything here so what I'm going to go ahead and do is paste that and you can see now that that comes in like so um and basically just to prove to you guys that this is two different components what I'm going to do is I'm going to get the video of me and my girlfriend here copy the video address change it here to this one and you should be able to see in our W now that if we go back here you see it renders that one right and you can change those props so this could be like just an example 999 likes in the second video so you see kazi's one has 1 two three and this one has 999 so everything works of course yeah oh yeah I I didn't no no furing shade you know um yeah so this is awesome guys and with this said right so previously with the last build what we did is at this point we pretty much migrated things over to Firebase and then we deployed right so we actually all of this data we kind of pulled it from Firebase right but today we're doing something different we're doing a full stack M build so if you haven't already smashed the like button smash that like button because we're going to try and drive that number up to 2,000 likes because this video is about to get really really interesting because David is about to drop some fire for you guys on how we can go ahead and pretty much build a back end which we haven't properly done on this channel yet so David without further Ado let's go ahead and shock these guys and let's go ahead do some go okay first let's go and stretch everybody because yeah yeah is nice just have a have a stand up have some water if you need to you know get get pumped up again cuz this is is where things pick up again and this is something which you guys haven't seen before so it's going to be really really awesome as Jay said smash that like button that's it guys goly yeah let's go so um Sonny do you mind creating another uh folder for the backand yes so is it actually a separate app so how how do we explain this so we could go with this project uh and we can um implement it inside in here or we can actually create a complete different workspace within we code yep and and go with that one let me go ahead and delete this node modules but that's the wrong node modules it should be this one yeah so guys at the top level we have Tik Tok which is our this is actually our react build right this is the react one with the source code inside of it and then what we're going to do is like David said we're going to actually create a folder and what should we call should we call this one Tik Tok back end or something yeah let's go with that yeah so Tik Tok back there we go so this is the front end Tik Tok this is the back end right so this is going to be where all the data comes from so uh yep done that I I think I I I think I need to refresh because I I don't need I don't see that folder yeah you're going to have to refresh that okay yeah it's right there okay nice um I'm going to take over a terminal and can you can you see it into that Tik Tok backend folder for me yep so let's go back back level so we're back at this level if I do LS you can see the two folders so I'm going to do CD Tik Tock backend so I'm going to go into the back end and then now we're inside the back end so it's empty so I'm going to clear the terminal and what we going to do now David so now we are going to uh Define uh all the uh details of our uh nodejs app and we can do that by simply uh typing in mpm in it uh uh it's only it's read only terminal uh you just need to click on the request and it should be able to to you be go so make the terminal read and write for everyone there we go so you need to type in mpm in it mpm in it uh that's going to start setting up our uh no JS package.json file and let a couple of questions yeah yeah so it's going to throw a couple of questions at us um first up we have to name uh our package it's by Def fold it's going to be the name of the F the containing folder I think Tik Tok backend is pretty descriptive so we can go with that um we will uh have the version and just to just to show them David you're just hitting enter right now right yeah exactly I'm just hitting return and doing nothing else okay um I'm going to give a quick description I think EP epic uh Tik Tock back end is is pretty good okay uh entry point uh we us usually use server.js so it's um because it's the server file dop yeah um test command I'm just going to ignore and hit return once again get repository no uh don't worry about that uh keywords again author I think um I will go with my name okay and yours hey love that JavaScript right there nice yeah yeah and we don't have to worry about license for now and it's going to prompt if we are satisfied with it but yes so I'm just going to hit return once again and that is pretty much uh it for sending up our uh package.json file nice yes so so that's actually going ahead and guys just to show you guys that's actually inside the backend photo right so David just went ahead and used mpm and nit to set up package Json and package Json has this basically this config inside of it right which which means and this this kind of allows us to then do things like mpm install to basically go ahead and use like modules inside of this foldo okay now we need to add actually a script like a trigger that we will be using when we are deploying our application to Heroku but this is the good time to actually add it because you will forget it it's just the best practice that I uh I learned over time yeah I can y oh I'm inan terminal yeah uh so yeah um let's go ahead and just type in start okay and H and actually add whoops I added too much spaces and actually type in node app.js and that will pretty much help Heroku start this uh server this this should be server.js right because we main is server oh yeah yeah yeah right so whatever you whatever you give the main over here guys make sure it's that one right so that exactly exactly exactly and now um can you open up a terminal for me uh acally closed that one so you might have to go ahead yeah so let's go ahead and do LS and you need to CD back into Tik Tok and let me make this read and right for you guys so this is going to be share terminal boom there we go oh okay I mean we're inside of this one again so uh let me go back and get rid of this one there we go boom you should have access okay yeah yeah yeah perfect so now I'm just going to install a couple of De dependencies it's going to be the exact same method that you guys did with material Ur for UI for example yeah uh so let's just go ahead and type in mpm install um and we are going to be using Express y yeah Express and mongus so Express is going to be our server uh framework and is a tool that we will be using to connect to our database right right so just to pause there one sec David so we've got two things that you guys are going to need to install one is Express and I saw somebody said the breathing was quite heavy so sorry about that I moved away from the mic I get carried in I forget about that so I'm going to go ahead and do so Express and mongus yeah so you want to go ahead and install these two things uh right here and the the way you do that is essentially what David's writing in here right here so perfect nice one David yeah so now with that done uh let's actually go ahead and set up our uh database okay so actually if you could uh share your screen and go to mongod db.com that would be very helpful okay so mongod db.com yes yeah and guys if you don't have a mongodb account uh now is a great time to pause this video go there register it's completely free you don't even need to provide your credit card like it's 100% free and yeah and and just uh resume the video once you're done awesome yeah so sign so let's go ahead and click sign in at the top and I think we can use our Google account yep we can use Google here I'm going to use my personal cuz we haven't actually set up on my I think we use the cover program so let's go ahead and do this one and can you share your screen by the way oh it says server oh uh I am sharing on the oh do you mean on Skype do you mean yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay do let me go ahead I should have done that actually in the beginning sorry David um good let me go ahead and share my I'll share my I'll share eam because then you can see everything that I'm sharing okay there we go nice oh awesome yeah yeah so now let's go ahead and do um I mean should I use let me go ahead and try something which you want to use let me do Sunny uh test oh okay it doesn't work okay so let me try and use this one again so let's go ahead you sang gmail.com doesn't work okay let me just go ahead and do this then and um let close this L into your let's click sign up oh man going do this I tell you what guys let's go ahead and log in with Google and let's go ahead and do I'm going to log into my one and what happens David when you log in initially it will just ask you a few question you will just see yeah yeah it's it's going to ask you a few questions uh and it's going to prompt you to create your first very first CL yeah let me let me get rid of this one so they can see this one yeah so actually you can oh yeah okay right so you guys will actually get to a point where this will be empty or it will ask you like what do you want to uh essentially create right what we're going to do is we're just going to click on create a new cluster yeah exactly so let's go ahead and do that um one second sorry I've got everything everywhere oops what the hell happened all right so let's go ahead and click create a new cluster okay and and let's one me through this y uh because you still have the other one running uh just go ahead and create a new um project a new project yeah yeah okay where do I do that uh oh I see okay yep so okay so nice so here yeah new project there we go project and everybody you can just name it whatever um like Tik Tok M okay Tik Tok M there we go Tik Tok m uh next and this is where you can add collab uh collabor collaborators but I don't think we need need any of them you can just go ahead and create project nice nice and this is what you guys will see when you uh sign up awesome so this is literally it yeah right go ahead and just to explain to them quickly David what is a cluster so cluster is basically a server which runs several uh databases right okay yeah so technically it's it's something called like a node right and which is funny because it's we're using node to run it but yeah it's like a server which is running the database perfect so let's go ahead and click on build a cluster build a cluster you can just go with the left one uh the free okay yeah and you don't have to worry about any of these uh setups you can just go ahead and uh hit bu cluster something interesting here guys is you can actually go ahead and use something like Google CL AO here as well but we're going to be using AWS and like we said just like in Firebase it asks which server but we don't really care about this at this point we don't even care about this stuff just go ahead and click create okay and the cluster name can be cluster zero that's fine yeah exactly yeah and you want to click on create cluster at the bottom nice yeah and it's going to take a couple of minutes don't worry if it it can even take up to 10 minutes doesn't matter okay um but yeah um while it's work working let's actually go back to our um server. js5 and start setting up our server right let's actually have something up and running okay let's do it dude so I'm just going to go ahead and create the server.js file okay and yeah it's all done and okay nice and for uh and you did some magic that made the whole thing uh es6 yes yep so I'll explain what that is so yeah so so essentially guys when you're using nodejs things like importing modules from other files you can't use that nice little import syntax you have to use like this old school sort of const and require syntax right so to get R to get around that what you need to is go to package Json um go here and basically go ahead and add this line of coding so you need to add in this right here where it says type module so this this right here is what you want to add where it says type module and this will give you es6 sort of syntax to your nodejs right so this is going to be uh this is really going to help you out when you're sort of setting up that that back endend so you actually have all that nice fancy um fancy syntax right so we're going to go ahead and it says oh oops overwrite this o let's go ahead and save that nice okay now so now uh go for yeah uh just like with react you have to actually import the core stuff so let's go ahead and import uh Express uh from Express and it's literally like like reading English it's it's super easy to understand what's going on right and the other thing that we just installed and we need uh is going to be mongus so let's import that as well okay so import mongus from mongus and there we go and now with that done we will actually go ahead and configure our application right yeah so let's actually create our instance which will be a const app and that is going to equal to express and that is basically creating uh simple uh instance of our application right nice okay uh we also need to define a port where our application is going to run okay um and that is going to be another variable so const Port equals and for development servers uh usually we use 9,000 or 8,000 I'm just going to go with 9,000 now okay um and let's actually create a health check API which is going to just return hello world it's a nice little thing to do uh I will explain it a bit later uh and it's going to be very useful when you are actually deploying your application y so that's actually good go ahead and say app.get and when we are calling with the get method so when we are calling our application with the get method on the root uh root directory um we will be having a callback function and that will have a request and a response in it okay and let's create a um an arrow function okay and set the response status to response status could code to 200 and let's send back hello world right okay oh we done some weird stuff oh yeah yeah send and hello world so what I what did I just do I just defined uh that if I'm uh if somebody's calling my uh application with a get method on the root folder um I will send the response status to 200 which means okay um and it will send back hello world right okay yeah let's make this though some reason the pr is not working let's just space this out a little bit all right yeah thanks yeah and I think we have too much of these brackets y okay nice yeah nice okay and to actually make that app listen for our requests we have to tell them that you should listen on whatever report we just uh configured right yeah so let's go ahead and type in app. listen okay and this is the port where we are when we want this to listen Okay and let's actually add the Callback function here as well okay which will just console log um listening on Local Host whatever Port right right so listening on whoops Local Host and I'm going to use something called uh string concatenation Y and I'm just going to pass in whatever value that I have right that worked with using back ticks right exactly yeah it worked using back Tex not single quote not double quote it's back Tex it's uh in the United States keyboard it's right left to the uh one number nice okay awesome okay so now now uh if if you could just go ahead and uh open up a terminal okay and and um you can just type in or or if you haven't already you can just uh install nodemon which is going to enable you to run uh your stuff in your development environment right okay and you can just go ahead and and uh type in uh npm install DG node modon so what does DG mean dasg literally means that it's going to install this dependency for your whole computer so you have to only run it once so if you have done that you don't have to worry about it and I believe you have it right yeah I mean we we could do it but I think at this point we do have nodon yeah yeah yeah yeah and with nodemon you can just uh trigger your server so I'm just going to type in noon server.js and it should be working and there we go uh it says listening on Local Host 9000 as we uh said it right nice so if Sunny if you could just go ahead and uh open up a postman that would actually let us show people that we have a live no. JS app yeah I just want to quickly run just run through a quick visual breakdown of what's Happening Here Right yeah so so I think cuz cuz one thing that gets confusing with front end and backend development is how it all kind of comes together together and this is an amazing example of what David just showed you guys so this is the code required to set up a server on the back end right so this is actually what you need to get everything up on the back end so what we need to do now is I'm just going to do a visual breakdown here I'm going to say like imagine we have the front end on the left and we have the back end on the right okay so we have the back end on the right now here is our front end right so this is like the Tik Tok clone that we just built right and then on the right side we have a back end right so the back end is like this little server and let's just make it look a bit like a server or something right so you got the back in which is like a server now whenever basically whenever we want to do for example David here has done app.get right now get you can send different types of requests to your backend server from your device so like imagine this is the Tik Tok clone right so we've got the Tik Tok clone working on the app so this is like the Tik to clone that you guys were seeing before what you can do is you can send different types of requests and this is called a API and the different types of requests you might see are like a get request is one you have something called a post request you have like a delete request you have update and so forth right so these are examples of what we like to call arrest API right and arrest API all it essentially means is communication between a front end and a back end in this case David created something called a get request and what that one is essentially saying is that if we go to the endpoint um local host 9,000 which is on our local machine 9,000 and then we say forward slash because that's that's the directory here then it would actually go ahead and should if we've done it right David it should give us a hello world right exactly okay so we're going to use a tool called uh Postman to actually test this right and guys yes there are more than get post delete those was just three examples um but usually you use get to sort of fetch information from your back end you use post toload yeah yeah use post to push information it's pretty descriptive so G is basically getting data from the server yeah so when you are like let's go with uh with an example that I uh I did yesterday so get is literally when you're going to Facebook and you're uh loading up the whole thing that's a couple of get requests right Y and when you are actually posting on Facebook it's the same thing uh you will be using a post um method and I think delete is pretty descriptive enough yeah so imagine like you had a Facebook Messenger app the get would be fetching the messages the post would be when you type in the message and you hit send that's going to post that message to the server and then the delete would be for example if an admin comes along and deletes something right so yeah exactly yeah so uh and and somebody did mention a good point rest API is used um between communicating between any two kind of applications not just front end and back end so in this case these are the two applications in question we've got a front end and we've got a back end and what it's not just one way to guys as well like if you make a request to get you the messages for example a get request the backend can actually go ahead and send back the messages for example so here you could actually send back the messages or in this case when we do a get request to for slash it sends back a message saying hello world right now something that's worth remembering is that David also said here result. status 200 right now 200 typically means for anyone who's new to web development is a 200 means basically it means okay okay right so it means everything was okay right a 404 you might have seen before a 404 means like page not found for example page not found and a 500 means like a server error I believe I always forget anyway exactly that that that is internet server so if you're getting uh a status code any kind of 200 uh codes that means we are fine we are on track if you're getting a status code with uh in the 400 area that means uh there is a client side error yeah um and if if it's a five 500 something that means the server needs to be uh made better Ser yeah exactly yeah and something worth mentioning is that we David mentioned here that there's a request and a oops a request and a server right the request is this one this Arrow right here response is the other one exactly so the response status the back end what he's doing is when it gets over there he's setting the status to 200 and then he's sending back hello world right so now instead of actually pointing from the front end what we can use is we can use a tool called Postman so Postman I'm going to open up something called Postman Postman is a very handy tool which I recommend everyone goes ahead and guess yeah exactly uh now is a great time again to uh pause this video and go ahead and download and install it uh it's a free testing Tool uh for backend developers and yeah uh and if you are even a front end developer and you are pulling some random data from I don't know let's say uh you building a weather application and you pull you're pulling data from the API it's a good way to know how the response is going to be built up right yeah exactly exactly yeah and I would really recommend so ready Dev say best explanation ever that's awesome David really nice yeah uh I think guys I give David some love because I think he's explaining this really really good and like even even today I haven't coded in this quite a lot and I think it's really really topnotch stuff that David ran through Jessica just dropped A50 Mexican dollar I think pesos uh donation thank you so much says super useful I didn't have a clue how to keep together a backend frontend application and honestly I I can really relate to that because I had the same problem as well when uh I was starting off um so really really massively appreciate that jica that's amazing yeah thank you yeah thanks a lot um so this is a really really good tool that I would recommend everyone goes ahead and grabs and basically you can mimic that back end so basically what you're doing here is you're pretending to be the front end with Postman right so the front end can either be the react app or we can pretend to be with the PO you can even at this point even use the browser so like if I was to literally go to local let's go to Local Host 9000 and let's just go to the yeah look hello world you see in the there we go so it actually says oh they can't actually see the uh the top of the there we go so it says Local Host 9,000 up here and hello world it's very very small for them so what we're going to do is let's actually show them in Postman so Postman is like the official way of of doing any sort of API testing I would say and what you want to do is click on the new tab so click on this new tab button here uh yeah yeah click on the new tab uh you can set the method but it's by default it's get you can just go ahead and type in Local Host oh my God HTTP I know HTTP for/ localhost uh 9,000 which is our 9,000 exactly and you can uh leave out the forward slash after uh yeah yeah so you can leave it out or because by default it goes to this but let's let's just put it there for now so they can really see and let's click on send and and look at that guys it says hello world so this is exactly what we were saying here it's it's pretty much acting as the front end so you see we pretty much sent a request so we sent a get request at this point so this get request was sent over and we pretty much got a response of 200 so you see this is the status it says 200 okay and it pretty much replied with a body of hello world so I think that's that's really really awesome way of showing them David I think that's that's that's really really nice so like with that I think I think at this point it will be a good point to show them how we can send kind said guys you have a working API with an endo yeah right exactly yeah you have your that's it you have your first yeah in like a couple of line of codes okay um I think we can just jump back and and and go ahead let's go for it dude so we have the server running now what is next yeah yeah uh just like you did I like to uh like sketch out how our application is going to look like so we will be so this is this is where uh I like to divide it uh this way so we will be having some app config stuff okay uh coming over here uh we will need some middle Wares uh which I will uh explain a bit later yep um we will also need DB config that goes here and this is where our API routes will go or and actually we can go we can say API end points yeah and we also have to have a listener section that's really clean dude I I really like how you laid that out nice yeah yeah it's super clean to and it's easy to understand and it organizes your code yeah yeah um okay so I think we should go and connect to our database now right yes so I think uh what we did where initially when we were working with this guys is we actually set some dummy data so right so before we fetch from mongod DB what we do is we start off by mimicking the data that we're going to send back right so what we could do here is we can create something called like data.js right and David what goes in here so here basically uh goes a simple um J on file and and actually there was a way that you exported it yeah so uh export default so we can say con data and we can just pass in an array of objects here and the array the array of objects here would pretty much just be those props that we showed you guys earlier so imagine we had this right here so let's go ahead and actually make this very visible for you guys so you can see here we have con data and it's just an array of objects and this is going to mimic like a like mimic back kind of the response that we're going to get right and then what we're going to do is to make sure that we can use it outside of the file we're going to say export default data right and this will actually go ahead and and Export this data and make it usable outside so David with that done how can I actually go ahead and pull from this from this data file so first we have to import uh this file just like we did uh before okay uh so let's actually import this file so Port uh data from who um we had a file I think yeah it it just uh said we we do have to say JS uh when we're doing um no y yeah that is correct and this is guys this is literally how our um DB is going to be built up uh it's super easy way to visualize the the uh no SQL database like this right y so let's actually um go ahead and create another endpoint okay and we will be uh saying at dog once again okay and we will have another endpoint uh I think we should we can just go and say version one yeah and like posts okay we will have an other uh what's that called call back function with request and response and let's create the uh Arrow function again and what we want to do now is literally go into the data file okay so the one we import grab whatever data we got yeah what we just imported exactly and just go ahead and send that uh data back right go ahead so we will be doing uh response status um my inter sense is not working yeah so response status uh and to 200 again because it's a good request and we will be sending back uh data right okay yeah and it should be working if you go ahead and test it out I just want to mention as well some people asking how we using how are we're using import instead of commonjs like the require uh somebody says you need Babel and I always forget how you pronounce it but guys like honestly at this point don't bother doing any of that stuff just go into your package Json and add this type module and that will give you those es6 Imports so it will be a very very handy thing so in case anyone joined afterwards that's how we're doing Import in rather than require right so you just add this it is an experimental feature at the moment but I mean is is essentially what we're what we're doing here um nice so David went ahead and added this uh endpoint which means that if we save this now what we should see David if we go to this endpoint so for/ V1 posts it's a get request so let's actually go ahead and set this up so it's say get request and then what we want to do is we're going to say make this a little bit bigger for everyone to see and what we say it was V1 and it was for/ posts right now if I click Send what should I see now like if let's go ahead and do it uh send you should be seeing the data. js5 and there we go nice dude awesome this is exactly the data that we just had so for small like super small projects uh this is a good way to kickart uh if you don't have access to a database at that moment um but yeah uh for bigger stuff then definitely you need to go ahead and set up a mongod DB so can we actually go back to our mongod DB yeah let's do it dude I just want to say as well guys we just broke over 262,000 playbacks and we are just under 2,000 likes so like this is huge guys and this is amazing we at $66 in chat Revenue massively massively appreciated if you guys are enjoying this let's push that like up to 2,000 today cuz that is amazing and David's dropping some serious knowledge here for you guys regarding the M Stack so I think he's doing an awesome job show him some love and David let's carry on strong yeah let's go uh um so let's go to mongod db.com uh let's actually set up our database right go ahead yeah so I see clusters here exactly and Below clusters there should be a a network access right y uh okay right awesome yeah so on the leftand side so over here guys it was actually kind of hard for me to find in the beginning so just over on this left side where it's under security you need to actually set up some security rules over here so what we need to do now is go to let's do database access first or network yeah let's go with database access where uh whichever you prefer okay nice okay let's go with database access So currently we are going to create a user a technical user to log uh to uh access our database right let's go ahead and uh click that button nice yeah uh and you can just type in whatever username you want to uh we will be using password uh so let's use admin as us only two thing that you yeah yeah the only two thing that you will need to worry about is those two text box nothing else right yeah okay so in this case we'll do admin as a user because it's kind of an easy one to remember and then we're going to say autogenerate a secure password and I'll show you guys cuz this is going to be we're going to take this down afterwards so you basically just want to copy this make make sure you copy this because David I I believe they can't actually see the password after right exactly so you create this user and I couldn't retrieve the password at any time uh I had to delete and create a new user yeah exactly if you know how to retrieve it with without creating a new user let me know yeah exactly nice I think you might be able to reset but I'm not sure you can do it but at this point that's the username and this is the password you want to make sure this is all good this just read and write and that's all good rightly add user yeah and you don't have to worry about anything else you can just go ahead and add the user that's correct so we're going to go down here and click on add user nice exactly uh with that done uh on the left hand side there is the network access button right so we're talking about this button here network access yeah exactly uh you can just go ahead and click it Y and now you can just add an IP address uh rule this literally uh will will restrict restrict any uh un unauthorized IP address to call our uh database right yeah but for today and it's for only educational purposes disclaimer do not do this in production environment we will be using allow access from anywhere yeah so it doesn't make exactly and this will set it to z00 Z uh but what David said is really important there guys so this is for like demo purposes it's completely fine if if you're doing a demo but when you do have production environments you tend to limit the IP addresses which actually can access your database right now um Firebase do this in a really clever way this yeah go for that working with a client just do not do it yeah yeah exactly yeah if you're working with a client don't do it yeah don't do a don't don't make it like super open to everyone make sure it's restricted if you are working for a client um oh amona is in the house nice dude he keep going guys on the verge to get 2K yes guys you heard let push them likes to 2,000 today and um uh yeah am 17year old student he's crushing it in pwj I work with him every day he is absolutely a boss of what he does and guys like just be surrounded by these good people and you will go far also sh this is a question for you David uh here David Shi says David I hope we will also use the best practices for error handling also uh I think it's not today uh we will be doing some error handling stuff it's our application will not like Crush if uh something error happens but uh we will not cancel out any um user stupidness right yeah to be fair I mean I think we are we are following best practices with what we're doing today we're going to check if there is an error and we change the response depending on if if there's an error so I think we will be doing that yeah to answer the question yeah I mean we we will be we will be canceling out any technical errors that could happen right yeah exactly yeah nice so with that said guys we are now going to click on confirm and that means we added this sort of a whitelisting rule now so the next step is to go over to clusters and what do we do David now we click on connect uh it's with in the cluster yeah that that's the button that you want to click and you will go with the middle option so connect with your application okay and you can just go ahead and copy that uh long um like text that is what we will be using to connect to our application now actually realize that there are two uh two like variables that you will need to pass in one of them is going to be the password exactly you will have to delete that uh and place your password in there that you just uh copied with the uh the DB user uh do you have that Sunny yeah so let's actually visually do this so let's go ahead and do let's say const and let's just say like um connection connection URL so let's just do connection URL equals and let's paste that so you see this is what we got from that thing and then right here where we've got the uh admin password I'm going to go ahead and paste the password that we had so whatever you set as your password go ahead and do that there and then David there's another important part this one right exactly that is going to be the name of the database that we will be creating so you can just type in whatever you want but if you just ignore that it will be create your database will be created with the name of DB name right with with the crocodile brackets exactly yeah yeah yeah so we're going to call it Tik Tok you can just Tik Tok y nice um and actually we will be now is the time that we will be using the uh so if you don't mind I will uh remove this line and move it down here to DB config nice okay and we will be using mongus for now okay and is it's going to be super easy to connect so let's go ahead and type in that connect okay and let's actually uh use the connection uh URL that we just created nice and we will need to add a couple of like options okay nice yeah so mango is actually under development and under constant upgra updating so we will be need to use something called the new URL parser so let's go and type in and it's going to uh pop up the new URL parser which will be true yep and we have two other stuff the one of them is use I think it's uh use create index and what something is where is happening use create index yeah there we go okay and the last one that we will be using today is use unified topology right okay so and these three uh things are are going to be needed so that it doesn't freak out in the uh terminal and it's running peacefully right okay and with that done we pretty much have connected to our database nice and if we go back to um mongod DB come and refresh a couple of times and like wait for two or three minutes it will show that we are connected right okay so at this point we could safely assume whoa Frank's in the house dude nice Frank just dropped $5 he says learning the mon stack is a great way to start a career in hot technology companies very valuable info sunny and David love that Frank Frank always comes in like swinging thank you so much dude and he just took us over $70 in chat Revenue so thankk you dude massively appreciate that also guys I want to mention just quickly I to take a little note here Frank was somebody who took the Spotify clone that we built um not long ago and actually showed that to um so the company called Sonos which is many of you may know they produce really high quality premium speakers and he landed a six figure contract guys and the Spotify clone helped him do that and that blew our minds when we heard that it is insane that he's doing that and and he actually worked with Frank quite closely now and he shows me the progress as it goes on and it's just amazing what he's doing really really awesome stuff Frank um and guys like it just goes to show you stick with these clones you will learn you will pick up a lot of stuff and it's no joke like six figures and and it's real stuff like uh Frank's always on the coaching call inside a profit with JavaScript every Tuesday as well links in the description make sure you go and check out if you're interested in learning more but let's Carry On David so yeah let's go so now we will be creating a a model which will be the data structure that is in the um that we will be using within our database so I will just create a new file and I will call that uh DB model. JS okay uh super descriptive super easy and we will be doing uh so we will be uh importing uh once again uh from of course okay I added a that um yeah there we go and now we will be creating a schema that it will be in our application right right so let's actually create a const and guys just to clear this up for you guys um so a schema is essentially something which is going to tell it's going to tell the database or like the collection that we're storing information in what kind of data structure to expect right so what kind of oh we just hit 2,000 likes dude hey Zaza says we just hit 2,000 likes my first time watching your guys streams J what's up dude you goes just hit 2K likes what it and let's touch 3K let's go dude um that's insane that's oh I love that dude amazing stuff well done David this is your first stream and it's it's hitting 2K likes that's awesome dude thank you yeah thanks a lot so I just dropped in a snippet of code and this is actually uh the definition of our schema right so I am creating a um variable called Tik toac schema which is a schema and I am just passing in all the names of the fields and I'm telling what kind of data that will be in right so everything is going to be string that's the easiest way to go okay and we will have a URL a Channel song likes messages description and shares all of these are going to be stored in mongodb right okay and we will have to export it uh and I think it it's uh exports. default right yeah um exactly export defa we will be we will be saying like Mong goose. model yep and this is a great uh now we have now you will have to pay attention what are you typing in because this is going to be the collection within your database right so we Define the database name uh inside uh of the huge link where we connected to our database and this is going to be the colle ction okay okay so it's the document collection and I will say um Tik Tok videos okay it's pretty descriptive and with a comma I will just add uh Tik Tock schema right so what you're essentially saying here is we've got a collection of Tik Tok videos which has this data structure exactly exactly yeah so we just created our data structure right nice okay yeah uh and I think uh we can go back uh to our server.js and we need to import this I think one thing worth mentioning is for anyone who's new to um actually uh sort of no SQL development whenever you have like so if you're wondering what a collection is for example like we keep saying collection uh in a nosql database so no SQL is what we're working with here and this mongod DB pretty much so no SQL is mongod DB and David just interrupt me at any time if what I'm saying is incorrect it follows um a structure as such it'll be a collection is essentially like an array of documents so think of it this way and then we have and then you have you can have another collection and then you can have another array of documents and so forth right it basically just takes this pattern yeah so collection if you're coming from SQL background collection is kind of like the table right yeah uh I I I understand it that way okay that's really good inside of collection you can have several documents and one document is essentially going to be a Json object and and that's pretty easy way to understand it if you can if you go back to our data.js file yeah um real quick uh that that's that's pretty easy way to show um yeah so here's like the collection yeah yeah the whole thing is a collection right okay and each one is collection and exactly exactly go ahead yeah yeah and I think it's a super easy way to understand databases yeah I think that awesome explanation I think that would help a lot of people also David I just want to stop uh for one second um because this is this is really really awesome like somebody said based on the Airbnb clone I created an application for a local company in my city and so sold it for $200 thanks so much and greetings from Poland that's awesome dude whoa that's insane right that's cool awesome yeah that's insane like yeah so that's amazing like just from the Airbnb clone like this person's probably restructured it for a client used it yeah awesome let's carry on awesome yeah yeah let's carry on so now we need to go back to our server that J file okay and we will have to uh import uh this model that we just created right okay so I will just go ahead and say import uh and I think I will name it videos okay and I and we will import it from uh DB model file yeah it's F I found it awesome so we pretty much have it and now it's going to be a super easy way uh to just go ahead and actually post data into our database and we don't have to worry about manually creating our database and collection and whatsoever because mongos will take care of it for us right okay y so let's actually create a post uh endpoint so app. post right and we will be using the version two SL poost uh end point okay which yeah and in the Callback function as usual we have a request and response uh variable oops sorry and let's actually uh let's actually create the arrow function and uh we will be passing in whatever data that we want to save into our database uh inside the request body uh and this is a this can be done with Postman pretty easily but first we have to yeah yeah we have to just go ahead and save it into a variable so we don't have to worry about it anymore so let's go ahead and c and the naming convention that I learned is uh DB Videos or okay it's like DB and whatever you want to save and it's going to be the requestbody right so David just to just to tell everyone like what are we trying what are we trying to achieve right now like what is this what is this post request doing what's the purpose of this for okay so the post requests per purpose is um literally adding data to our database it's like posting on Facebook when you are posting on Facebook you go ahead type in a string and then you hit the button that will send the request into Facebook server that will save your post into their database and then Rend it out right this is literally what we will be doing now right nice and and you you will pass in your stream what's up we just got another donation dude sorry sering Cen he watches these videos quite a lot uh and he just jumped in as well he goes thank you for doing a m project slightly different what I'm used to you guys are killing it dude I love the fact you show up every time keep doing that um and just like I'm glad you're just watching these videos every time like it's amazing that you're here showing up that's awesome dude nice yeah exactly yeah thank you guys um so yeah and we will be passing the data in the request body yep and so we have to just go ahead and save it into a variable right yep now let's actually go ahead and save our data into our database okay so what we will be doing is uh we will be using the model that we just created uh it's going to be a super easy way so let's actually type in in videos. create and we will just pass in as data our DB Videos right okay whoops uh we and we will have now this is the time when we will be handling any kind of Errors okay so if there is an error we will run uh a function and if not we would just want to see what kind of data that which is created right so that's let's go and type in uh data and here we go and we will be just using a simple if uh if gate and that would just do it for us so if uh I would and so if there is an error I want to set the response status to 500 right which is going to be uh internal server error and send back whatever error that we had right quiet so if there's an error change the stat to 500 Y and return an error object okay yeah and but if we don't don't uh catch any kind of Errors so else uh we want the response status uh set to 2011 and 2011 means created right so it's uh when you're posting and and it's succeed and it succeeded uh you want to see 2011 right right yeah and we're just going to send back uh the data that we just created and with that I think we have our uh our second end point Done Right awesome so if you can go ahead and yeah if you can go ahead and uh check it out okay in post that would be awesome nice just want to drop in Al kamish just dropped a juicy comment he says sunny I got placed because of your videos I will donate after my first payment love you paji that's insane dude like he he got another job from this just seeing like the people getting jobs from these this content is just like I I have to take a second and just pause because it's like it's always like just so like humbling when people drop that like it's such a lovely feeling and and it really does make all the difference guys so let's just like we'll keep it coming yeah it's so motivating yeah so David like we saw now this was the same um Endo but it's V2 because we're now we called it V2 to show that it's now not pulling locally but we're going to be posting to the mongod DB right so we're going to do post and we're going to change it to V2 and what should I so it's you I I saw that you actually had a body right so it says the database videos we're passing as a request body so how can I go about actually passing this body I think we can click on body here so exactly then you will need to click raw because we are just going to be uh like hard pushing the data okay and that is where you want to copy one of the documents uh from yeah exactly and you you have to set the uh file type to uh Json right there because we we will be using Json and you just have to go back to data.js and copy one of the documents and paste it right in there right right so let's go ahead and grab this one for example exactly and it's going to error because Jason actually needs the uh double quotes around these uh keys right here so exactly you have to uh you have to take care of that yeah exactly and now if you hit sand it should be working and it should be posted into uh mongodb okay so we're going to hit send and then this should populate if it's all good and if it is all good yeah if it is good it should send back the the data rate that we actually posted so we should see this down here afterwards if it's all good right so let's go ahead and click Send sending request and it said could not send request view in console let's go ahead and see what uh are we actually are we actually running we're not running the server are we no we are we crashed okay uh yeah no um there was a bit of issue okay now it's running um I forgot to add the extension uh when I was importing the modal so you have to add the JS I think somebody actually pointed that out that's really awesome that somebody pointed that out earlier yeah I saw that so whoever pointed out what thank you I wasn't sure what they were talking about but now it makes sense so um yeah we click post now hey there we go we get this back oh something happened because uh we just got back these two uh Fields I think I think the reason why might because we not we don't have a middleware right now to to pass Jason right do we need the express. Jason middle yeah oh yeah yeah I forgot about it so this happens often times and you were just spending hours and hours trying to debug what is happening and the only thing that you forgot saying app use yeah H and the only thing you you forgot is Express is Json fun fun ality right yeah exactly that is all that we missed out exactly and guys what that's doing is it will basically pass the response as adjacent object and then it will it'll read it from you now we just got a $15 donation from uh codep suar says I develop mobile application using react native even though you guys develop clone using reactjs it makes it really easy for me to convert it into a mobile application that's insane dude and that just goes to show that a lot of people had asked previously about if react native can be used used if you know react yes the answer is yes and that is so awesome to see that dude anding answer yeah that just hit us to $87 in chat Revenue thank you so much guys who that's awesome that's crazy so let's go ahead and hit sa yeah yeah now now it should be able to understand Json and it should be able to uh pass in data right y yeah let's go s y there we go dude there we go we get back to Jason now nice yeah yeah yeah yeah awesome so that was that that one little line of code uh can cause so many errors right nice so with that said so we we just uh pushed some data into the DB and let's actually check that it actually got pushed in so let's go ahead and go to collections yeah right so collections yeah exactly and it does take a look bit longer to do it on mongod DB uh and you can see now uh here's strange let's go to Tik Tok videos so this is the one that we actually pushed to I'm not sure why that came up but you see this was the first one that we pushed by mistake um so ignore that one for now you can go ahead and uh and actually you can delete it it's uh it should be on the right side oh nice yeah let's just delete that one there's a little yeah exactly there we go there we go so should we go ahead and push the other one David as well yeah let's go let's go let's go ahead and push this object in as well so that way we should have some data inside of our inside of our DB so I'm going to go ahead and pop that in there and again we need to change this to the following so boom boom boom likes messages description description sh there we go and get rid of that little extra comment and just to double check so it said and nice David I like the two1 that you added as well that was a really nice little touch yeah so we hit send now it's like what what you always do with front end so on front end you have to worry about the nice little touches uh with like um with like shadows and stuff and this is this is the exact same nice little things uh with backand right exactly yeah we just hit refresh and now you can see hey we've got our data we got RAF Kazi Channel go and my channel nice awesome dude okay exactly okay now let's actually go back to our server.js file and add the ability to actually retrieve that data that we just added right okay so we will be we will need another endpoint uh which will be using a get uh method right because we are downloading data uh we will be using the exact same uh endpoint and yeah which is V2 and posts okay we will also have the usual um callback function okay request and response so let's see and now we don't have to save anything a get uh method um call will not have a body so that's uh that's going to throw un unknown but what we can do super simply is say videos. find and that will just retrieve uh the data from the database and we can add a filter Within These quigly Braes but you don't have to worry about it so you if you want to retrieve everything from the database you can just leave it completely empty yeah I think we can actually we can actually get rid of that if we don't need to pass options right I think so yeah yeah let's try it and if it doesn't work we can just head back um and this one will have another um callback function uh with an error handling and a response data right okay and we will just go ahead and copy the exact same uh if gate RI statement and just you can we can just pass it in there one thing we have to work uh take care of is the two1 status code okay we have to change it to 200 right okay because uh it's downloading data and error data there we go um I think it should be working now teral it's working key differences are the get and the post here so get obviously we've changed it so it's the same you see it's the same actual URL but it's just changing the type of uh request so if we go to get now and we can clear the body because we don't want to care about that if I click send you can see hey it just went ahead and fetched us two things we got the items here nice awesome dude there we go there we go say it's fetching from the DB yeah awesome exactly now before we uh deploy it to Heroku we have to add another uh kind of um middleware okay and this thing we we want this thing to be run uh before every um API core right okay um this is again uh huge disclaimer this is going to be security without ignore with with ignoring security right okay so this is a thing that you don't want to do uh when you're working for a client uh yeah so let's go and say app. use and for all the functions that means we will have a call back with a request and the response and then next I will explain that what what's that later uh and we will just uh setting a couple of headers and if you are asking uh in the comments if it's a course headers yes it is this is this is course headers okay um so we will just be adding a couple of headers um one of them is Access Control allow uh origin and we will add a star which means everybody so we will um it's it's the exact same thing that we did uh on mongodb when we allowed access from anywhere y uh and the other one is going to be actually I will just copy paste this line of code and we have to change the origin to headers and with that done we just have to go and hit next so what these line line of code do uh so whenever we receive a request we will be setting the headers to these which means we accept all the requests and then we pop through these functions that are in here right right so that that's pretty much all it does nothing else and with that done I think we are ready to deploy nice dude how's that sound awesome I think that's dope yeah that's dope I I wasn't expecting that okay so that's awesome guys so now we can actually push to the database we can pull from the database so I guess the next step like David said is to actually go ahead and deploy this thing into um we could I mean we could maybe do the front end connect it to our local and then deploy both uh yeah we could do that but then we will have to um change the connection right on the front end okay more headache so that's why I prefer to um just push deploy the backend yeah okay right so how do we do this so we do that by going to hu.com it's basically like virtual server that's the easiest way to put it and understand what it is so you can go to her.com and uh you can go ahead and register it's now it's again it's a great time uh to pause the video if you don't have an account or maybe do along it but sunny I don't know if you have an account uh I'm not sure I mean I have one for ages ago I think I haven't used herok in a while um let me go ahead and try and sign in guys one second yeah yeah yeah oh I do have an account I think yeah nice okay there we go yeah so you can go ahead uh if you don't have an account and just create one it's again it's free and you don't have to provide a credit card yep and then uh it's going to prompt you uh I think my video is frozen yeah there we go um you got 1 2 3 four okay uh so on the top right corner this is how how you how it will look like if you already have an account if you don't the upper uh part of the screen is going to be uh completely purple and under that there will be two buttons and you will want to hit the create new application right if you go ahead and uh hit new yeah create new app that's the uh that's the button that you want to hit okay yeah you can just um I don't know say m Tik Tok TI Tok back end or whatever do backend yeah and just uh go and create it okay create app nice and go create app and nice little donation thank you so much whoa thank you so much appreciate that dude yeah um yeah now there is actually two way to go about it if you have your code on GitHub you can just go and grab it from there but that's uh that's the boring way and backend guys do it with a CLI okay so there is a option to install Heroku CLI right okay can you see uh you can just yeah open up it in a new uh yeah and if you start uh scrolling down not not not that one uh you can go even even more down and there is an other uh installation method yeah that's the code that you want to grab it's uh for Windows it's for uh Mac it's for Linux it's for everyone uh and you can go with that and just paste it it will require your password to install the CLI okay and this will allow you to uh this will give you a super fensive way to deploy your app right nice so how it doing so this is just uh installing and nice nice there we go awesome there we go perfect so we can back to um yeah you can go ahead and close it up now let's go and you will have to log to your Heroku CLI it's going to be the exact same way that you do it with Firebase so it will pop up a browser uh page okay so C nice I like I like how they do that yeah so you do so get um Heroku login and let's go ah aead see say press any key to open up there we go yeah just uh hit hit any button yeah just go ahead and hit return nice okay and then we can go back and it LO awesome yep I think it's yeah it's breaking up a little bit there we go everything what was that okay sorry uh yeah so you can go back to your Heroku yep uh the other one yeah and you are already seated into your project but you have to initialize a git repository by hitting git in it okay so what it does is basically we will be initializing a g repository a Version Control and uh we will we will be pushing this code to heroku's uh G uh repository right let's go back and set the origin okay so this one here yeah that's the one yeah yeah and you can just go ahead and copy paste everything like it's it's super easy nice there we go we say it as the origin yeah yeah and you can just uh commit like saying get add dot then get commit D am we say get and this will actually go ahead and add it to our G so if you do get status now you can actually see everything goes green I mean it's committing the node modules do we want to do that or um we can go with the node modules uh if you don't want to uh you can go ahead and add a g ignore file yeah so easy way to do that guys is if you right click and uh I mean yeah I think we should add a get ignore I think yeah here let's do a so it's dogit ignore like this and then in here you can just do node modules just yeah node modules actually can you go and Google up something for me what's up uh just go go into your browser and uh uh and open up a new uh page so just we can like show people why it is important to create a do getting or file okay and if and you can if you could um like Google node J node modules uh node modules GitHub meme just this yeah show me can you show the and and the dog dog Cloud this one ah yeah yeah that's it yeah that's what's going to happen guys it's literally going to like just Cloud everything we don't want to do that yeah yeah so you can go ahead yeah exactly um nice so what we can do is actually I'll show you guys just a little trick as well so here if you go inside and you can see stage changes get ignore node modules yeah and inside of here if we do get um status uh so he's already added them to staging so I think actually at this point what I need to do is I can actually minus them all and you get status there we go and then you can see now it's just these files yeah so so now you get add all get status um and you only want to make sure that these files are green not all of them right so it's very very important to to do that so you want to make sure you're only committing these ones um uh and then what you want to do is you want to go back to those little commands and what we can do is we can just commit saying uh mean we don't have to use thematter that's that's perfect say tick talk server commit or something and then boom we committed it you want to go ahead and actually open up a new terminal before you do anything else okay uh because you want to see all the uh log so you can just type in Heroku logs DT right and that will just initialize all the log files or all all the logs of the deploy and this will allow you to easily see if there is an issue and if you go back to your other terminal oh nice okay uh yeah yeah yeah if you go back to your other terminal and type in get uh get push Heroku Master Okay so this Command right here guys get heru push master that is the last step to deploy our app and if everything goes well um we will be yeah and on the right side the build is going to be starting and we will be able to see the log of the build yeah this is awesome dude nice look at that yeah and there is an error so that that's why we need to see yeah it crashed for some reason um right so it said local package Json exists but node modules are missing missing did you mean to install um it should be installing oh it it got deleted for some reason let's go ahead and check out what's going on so we've got the package Jason here we've got the node modules over here um that's an error I've never seen no it's modules um and node modules um when pushing to Heroku let's go check this out yeah so deploy node Heroku apps so I mean I think it should by default actually go ahead and and push I mean um but I mean there may be something small here that we're missing um it says package.json unspecified okay so node modules package Jason remove the package lock file oh yeah oops there we go let's go ahead and do that uh and also I I think we need to actually go ahead I've already pushed it to the um the thing yeah you need to commit again and push it once again so get get a DOT yeah uh let say this let's just do have same commit let's just do a get push Roku there we go yeah so let's see what do we got well stuff like this happen yeah this is part of engineering exactly guys so you can see now we should see um it said build succeeded yeah it's starting okay crashed okay so it says mpm1 local package.json exists but modules are missing did you mean to install and there must there should be a little simple fix for this um I haven't worked much with Heroku before but I mean we can debug This Together guys so let's go ahead and check it out so local package Jason exists but MP okay so mpm stop uh let's just type in Heroku as well and if anyone does know the answer to this let us know in the comments below and we will go ahead and add that in so you need Prof file so let's go ahead and check it out so check out so you need to run mpm install before you can build the package I know that but why do we need to do that in how do we do that in proc file somebody said proc file so let's go ahead and check out what a proc file is the proc file in Heroku oh okay okay so proc file so we know that we need a proc file how do we add that in guys so let's go ahead and see add NPI script get add so in Heroku you can add a build step to mpm install Okay so let's go check that out so add a build step do you uh I haven't actually used Heroku much so let me let me check it let me check uh I'm going to check it out my her go on my end go for a dud this is an error I've never seen so so with the it's a it's a proc file without extension so run mpmi again this will save dependencies in your package Jason yeah so typically that's what we would do I know but as in in this case I don't think cuz we're not committing those things so he says in settings okay so let's check out in settings remove build packs certificates transfer mainship uh um uh do you have the nodejs build pack added nodejs so it's called No JS yeah it's got no GS build pack oh I've added duplicate now oops uh oh duplicate okay so yeah so push node modules along I mean we could push the node modules along just for the sake of the tutorial but I don't really yeah we could do that mean I mean okay I mean I don't really shouldn't really be doing that but terminal okay so run on Terminal Heroku run mpm install let's go give that a try Heroku run mpm install let's go ahead and see if that works okay so look running mpm install on Tik Tok man back end nice dude and there we go that was ready Dev so thank you so much dude that's awesome it goes up and complete up to complete let's go ahead get push Heroku let's go ahead and see oh right sorry oh no I did it right okay yeah it's done I think it's done dude that was insane that's what I love about this yeah don't push the no modules yeah do not do that you see even even we were on the edge because it it's like the demo gods are against us but um yeah that's awesome nice okay so now how do I get the um the URL so you have to so you have to go back to your Heroku and in this settings down there not not that one that's the get repo um yeah that's the link that you want to just go ahead and click and it should be saying hello world no it doesn't Okay so application error is what we get let's go ahead and check out the actual overview and resources maybe let's go ahead and see so it says this app is web mpm start on deployed today at 1003 resources let's see and it's actually get push Heroku Master we've already done that okay so it crashed it crashed over here it says I think it said app crashed State changed from up to complete error app crash me get so crash when we tried to access something it says check your Heroku logs method get pass says 503 so which is strange let me check if we do this so let's go ahead and do let's go back to type in V1 posts it's going to yeah it's 503 again even there okay yeah that that's why we have the I mean that was the half check API I mean I see a lot of people saying the environment variables guys oh the port oh yeah the port actually maybe so maybe the proc that shouldn't be an issue oh that that could be it because I mean like they might be setting a port number on their end which which we're not mapping to correctly so David I mean previously we usually do this right it's written like process environment port or 9,000 so in this case what we could do because it could be a local thing so let's carry on with that there and let's go ahead and and and add this one so so get add get status and then let's do get commit uh we don't want to commit the package lock right now just delete that for now um get status okay get add and let's just do get commit and let's just do just do fix bug or something and then let go get push her master there we go guys this is kind of cool because you guys can see um so Heroku doesn't let you assign ports beforehand okay so maybe that's why suceeded compressing yes it's compressing looking looking promissing now so it's starting build succeeded released version five um a damn it's a oh now we have now let's go and and install the the stuff yeah oh man there we go this is awesome though guys this is like debugging live with you guys which is kind of cool and I can see we still got half a thousand people watching so it is really cool to see that wa so it's up to complete and let's go and go back to the link that we just had the one that crashed uh in the browser and let's refresh application error okay so we got another one it say the code this time is h10 interesting oh it's 503 still okay I think what we'll do maybe wait create so somebody saying create de proc file web mpm start configure the mpm start script on package Json to start node server so let's go ahead and look at our package Json start nodejs server this one here is start nodejs server do not forget to install M config install M and require I mean I don't think we need m. config at this point it will install on herok if you specify no JS in package Jason like this yeah so maybe we need the engine specified because right now we haven't said the engine um so somebody actually dropped a really good comment there I'm just trying to grab it um before it goes so let's go ahead and let's let's use that let's go ahead and give that a try so thank you RAF so Rafel just said why don't you go ahead and try this so boom let's do that engines like this okay let's go ahead and give that a try mhm let's do get add and then let's go ahead and do boom boom boom get commit am let's just do book fix uh get push Roku master and then we're going to probably have to maybe I mean now I guess it should do so downloading and installing node bootstrapping mpm replacing something okay oh it's replacing that one oh I mean I guess like we could have maybe done a higher uh Higher One but it's okay so 503 unavailable server indicates the server is not ready to handle the request the server is either overloaded or okay so it might be actually the server down um wow that's strange yeah nice awesome so let's go ahead and do let's go ahead and check the logs and it's going down did you try and access it again um not yet uh I'll try to um just running and install again Ser is not down yeah so a lot of people are saying proc file on Route um yeah I mean if somebody can give aile and and a snippet of code maybe then yeah yeah go ahead proc file right so let's do this and let's go ahead and try boom so we're still getting the eror okay so I think at this point let's try and check it out so profile so somebody says paste that but uh they didn't actually give the code okay paste that PM PM run pm2 run server JS I mean use pm2 okay I mean let's try that let's give that a try so pm2 run Ser J and that's inside a Pro File they're saying so let's go ahead and give that a try pm2 run server JS and I just want to double check that guys pm2 run as in server JS obviously automatically restarts your application if it crashes digital ocean this is digital ocean guys I mean this is pm2 I don't know if this is going to work for what we're doing here I mean so a lot of yeah so some people saying don't use pm2 like okay I don't really I mean this isn't really going to do much so let's go ahead and check what else is saying so create and then inside right web all right so somebody else gave a nice little suggestion he said create proc file text file then write web uh node server.js let's go ahead and give that inside it and a lot of people are saying that this is a bad choice and Heroku is a bad choice but guys honestly um like no it's not this is completely fine this is a case of like this happens this kind of stuff happens um let's go ahead and give this a try now yeah so this this happens and this is actually a good I actually glad because I think a lot of people do tend to think that there's no debugging and this is the reality of it so added proc file um oh oops I've added it in the wrong thing it should be inside of here there we go get add dog status and then we can see added Pro File and let's push that that guys to Heroku so say Heroku get push Heroku master and let's see how that goes guys yeah right so we're pushing it down no JS server is not running on Heroku I think that's what's happening guys you're right because if it's a 503 it means the server is not ready which means it's probably not running so somebody is true like I think that that's a very good point right so says okay so it says starting process with mpm start hey oh no okay spoke too soon guys God damn it oh wait actually this is good this is good so it says module resolve esm resolve okay so now mod not found cannot find Express imported from App server it could it be that it's not ready for es6 because I just uh recreated the whole thing yeah uh and it's freaking out for me with the exact same stuff and it says uh the es module type is uh so so the es module is set to no so the es type is set to module and that just doesn't work out for it and it's crying about the import uh in and and not seeing uh require uh I'm just checking so it says cannot find Express imported from App server JS so let's check it out so Express okay so I mean maybe yeah maybe it could be a case of um I mean actually this is a good point we we specified in package Json uh an mpm and node module of six and I don't think it's supported in six in hero cool yeah yeah yeah so so like so let's do node import guys does anyone know what uh version nodes uh start supporting um import statements I think it's I was I think it's like 13 14 so how can I use 14 so node 13 and above okay so node 13 and above so in this case let do 13 I don't know if they support 13 I'm going to push for it uh let's see yeah this is why that's that makes a lot of sense actually that makes a lot of sense uh get ad get status uh get commit am let's just say upgraded node yeah node upgraded and let's go and push um to Heroku yep and let's go and check and guys whoever is being negative in the chat you know I don't think like you guys have to be kind of realistic to what development is actually about so somebody somebody said unsubscribed I mean dude like that's cool you can do that that's cool like this is what actual this is what actual development looks like you know exactly and by you unsubscribing you will make our community healthier yeah so like this is this is what it's about this is a positive environment uh what we do we support each other so now what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and do mpm in Heroku run mpm let's try and run mpm install again so her run mpm CU I think when we change the dependencies all the dependency tree might be messed up so an mpm install Okay so so it's up to complete nice and then let's go ahead and run mpm start MH and let's go ahead and check it out so mpm start and it's up local package Json exists but no modules um did you mean to install I mean I guess I just did install we can try again um hold Dam okay I mean I think what we might do in this case is actually just change it to the old style of importing without the es6 yeah that may be a good way to go just for this case but I mean like you know I it is really frustrating because like it would be cool to see how that works but you know what it's fine what we can do in this case is I think it's going to be an error on heroku's side look it is I think it is this um it's this support okay that's fine so what we can do guys I'm going to this is this is kind of cool like so we can actually show how to go ahead and get rid of this now so type let's go ahead and change this to so let's change this back to six let's get rid of that support there and what we're going to do now is actually go back into our code and I'm going to refactor it all to be the old style so what we'll need now is instead we will say con const Express uh equals require and I've got the Snippets uh here there we go okay you faster so we did the require so this is the sort of es6 syntax right so we can go ahead and drop that out and look loads of people find this cool this is this is awesome dude and there's over half a thousand people doing this with us so really really nice to see that uh and now what we're also going to do is we're going to change this so it's going to be const uh data equals going to be requir yeah require boom like this and then this one will be con require there we go nice uh so that's cool and then we also need to change our exports so like here I mean this one yeah we should really do this we should do like exports um exports how' you do it again is it exports. exports equals mongus model and then we go with Tik Tok videos wait wait wait we can't see what you're doing dude let's go over here so he sorry sorry sorry so uh so you're changing this one okay so module exports equals yeah yeah and then I just uh yeah so instead of yeah instead of export default I'm just going to say module. export and um Mong mango. model and everything is everything else is uh the same whoops and don't forget about the import up top which what about this one I think I think we this one we could do it like this right we could just do data uh what's up and and you see where I've got data uh data.js I think we can export like this oh yeah yeah yeah we just do a simple export like that and then db. model okay nice and then what we're going to do is just to test this out let's go ahead and do uh nodemon uh server.js app crash module not found and this is inside of server there so what is this freaking out now um cannot find module Express what the oh dude D oh my God I think I know why this didn't work whoa what's look in our package Jason we haven't got the dependency here what which means we never did mpmi Express oh my God okay let's let's try something now this is this is really oh somebody said that Bonito came said that oh my god look oh my God damn it okay I think yeah that was it so let's go ahead I'm going to try something cuz I'm I'm really sticking by my guns with this like what was it was it module I'm going to we're going to do this it was type module yeah let's go why not yeah let's do this cuz guys like we God damn it somebody said it somebody said it all right we we can do this we can do this guys let's go ahead and change this back to export default um but I mean like that's it like I think we all learn here like in a in a pretty crazy moment like you know like yeah let's go ahead and change this uh David I think this one should be import yep there we go and in server.js let's go back here and let's go ahead and get rid of this Pro File and ser DS there we go and uh I was actually going to just do okay we can do that on goose y there we go I'll just comment out everything else just to so it's there you know okay so I'm the kind of programmer there you go uh let's go ahead and and oh oops I'm running oh me oops I didn't mean that uh D nodon server.js so identify Express has already been identified let's just go ahead and drop this out here and then let's do it again why where is it got module is not defined in DB model DB model is okay yep yeah oh yeah there we go and it says address is already in use because I'm running it over here oops uh address is already in use am I running this app anywh else okay let's actually change I don't know error on change it to 8,000 yeah change it to 8,000 okay oh I think I've got 8,000 actually in use do um esm module loader is EXP mental events okay just change it to 7,000 um I changed it to 880 okay okay so so some reason it's it's like it's double starting it or something but um app and Port I mean I'm not running anything on aa oh process environment Port oops okay maybe that's why it shouldn't be shouldn't be it yeah let's do um let me just change it to some random a bad P oops you can't do that guys that that's a silly mistake he's like 81 right um that's that's weird that's strange I don't know why that's happening you have three terminals open I mean I don't yeah but guys I don't I'm not using that one I was using this one let's go ahead and cancel this that's my react app let's go ahead and try it now okay so I guess it was that oh strange the hell okay what the what the I mean this is all fun guys this is all fun we still have 560 people watching this is insane I'm glad you guys are enjoying this if you're enjoying this just drop a comment yeah exactly let us know get status and I think we should rename this video so building and uh debugging and fixing I know like it's it's cool though cuz this is a full stack build like is in what do so let's do let's go ahead and say fix uh let's just say fix Express dependency um sorry fix dependencies yeah fix dependencies uh and let's do get push to Heroku so get pushok master and this one and I'll just go ahead and open uh I'm going to go ahead and check the tail so something yeah yeah yeah okay build started there we go build starting a lot of people are enjoying this he goes Jason says big shout out to you both legit one everyday programmer goes to dude like now we're going through it together this is even when I'm building these clones like I run into a lot of debugging things it's just obviously when you do get stuck like it's a case of like it's kind of cool to be a to do this together so it says starting process yes dude starting to up that's what I'm talking about let's go guys let oh man somebody just donated as well deack Pandit pleas L your spirit guys that was insane thank you thank you let's go guys let's see in Chrome hey oh okay internal server error let's check why let's check why uh 500 so a 500 for the forward slash just check why I so we've got a get headers it not is not a function what do you mean wait where did you where are you getting that I can't see uh it's in the log it was in the log uh okay let's check so now let handle let's go ahead and check out so this is the thing we do V1 D V1 posts yeah internal and let's go ahead and check the actual um so 500 inant Ser eror Network so at least okay so we made we made progress CU it did definitely so it's pushing that now post gets 500 I mean it's not giving me much it's check if V okay that there there's something weird thing going on in the invitation okay so um no I I I I think I know what the issue is I think it's because I wrote it in plural resda uh let's see if if it pops up with my intellisense but yeah it's because it's plural okay it was one single letter so when you are uh defining your middle Wares uh you should see it set header in singular without the S at the end right oh do we have set headers yes oh okay okay yeah that was probably the reason oh here it is David yeah you're right look type error set headers is not a function okay nice yeah yeah dude that's cool man I mean like it's a it's a huge learning curve yeah that's nice nice exactly okay so let's go ahead and do uh get ad Doom uh whoa we just got another 5 donation keep it up guys I love this guys this is insane this is like respark like a fire this is awesome thank you so much guys um I mean all these tutorials are like everything is working perfectly and there is no error but at the end of the day the the the real truth is that coding is 90% % writing the actual code and then the other 90% is debugging yeah it is definitely yeah like you you will run into these things a lot guys and it's it's an exactly and like we showed here like you it can be very easy even when it's an experience developer to start to lose heart um um but like and I see some people saying you should use like cause modules yeah we should but it for the sake of the tutorial we keeping it very very simple um nice though dude I mean like this is cool cuz even like I haven't used this in quite a while uh so Heroku is pretty cool to see this um guys we are at $96 in chat Revenue that's insane thank you so much yeah that is awesome uh okay so now it's starting mpm start again it started on Local Host 85 nice and let's go ahead and check it out let's go back to okay so it got V2 post replied empty hello world came in whoa it's working let's go man let's go ahead but V1 post let's see V1 post okay so V1 post gave it back that's awesome that is amazing right that's that is yes guys thank you that's what we need that little oh guys oh sorry so somebody actually gave a Super Chat he goes you miss you guys are rocking thank you so much dude whoa this is all coming in Jason Francis goes let's go just dropped another fire donation let's go guys this is insane holy crap the energy wow oh man thank you thank you oh man this is so jokes okay so all right so now this is the kind of community that you want to see right yeah I know right like this so V2 so V2 is not working okay so that's that's interesting V2 is not in working so V2 is actually when we do a get post saying find okay so maybe actually David it it might be to do with the fact that we're not passing the yeah yeah but I mean what we could do what we could do to test this is we can actually run this on the local so we can say here let's go ahead and do nodon server.js like this and then what we can do is listenting on Local Host 9000 so let's go ahead and do Local Host 9,000 V2 poost and double check so this is emptying a this is a return of an empty so let's go ahead and check it on on here we see okay so I don't think at this point there's actually there might not be let's go ahead and double check the database so Tik Tok cuz that's super strange I think what's up that that's uh super strange that that's actually come up oh David look somebody's actually the database is gone so maybe H interesting guys I mean if somebody went if somebody went in and did that I mean like let you know give us a break come on I think I think I think somebody could have did that cuz I wasn't expecting that we'd be debugging so somebody could have just gone in and done that but I mean you know it's all good this look good let's go ahead and let's just post yeah actually let's go and post it yeah somebody's definitely gone ahead and done that I think cuz I was wondering that's what happens if you don't secure your end points yeah guys I mean that's it you just saw security it's it's funny somebody go oh man funny what did you do oops I have no idea there we go description she has this is a true programming like this is an experience today guys this is an experience uh let's try this one out here and then boom and then just quickly I mean like guys it's don't do anything to database cuz if you do like I mean I can just I can I can just block the IP addresses and it ruins everyone's fun you know like so let's go ahead and get this boom and now let's go ahead and make that request on our boom there we go Works uh whoa there we go just Bo everything and let's check the Heroku version there we go guys so our server is up and running guys I think that was pretty dope that's pretty dope you know that was pretty fun yeah yeah now that was such a huge run oh man I mean like I think I think everyone like we made it in the end we just hit 33,000 playbacks as well um and guys like if you if you thought that was if you thought that was insane and we made it in the end smash the thumbs up button that was a true live debugging experience you know like that was a really really good one okay so guys with that said now we have the backend up and running it's deployed and it's in Heroku right so it's literally sitting at this end point now so this one right here is sitting there so what we can do now is we can actually go ahead to our front end again so let's go ahead and close a bunch of stuff let's go back to our front end uh app.js let's go so here we had the video being pulled in right here right now uh um that was actually true you know somebody said um uh where is it first ever in my life I saw a live example of security yeah like that was that was an open case there where like if you if you leave it open yeah go there is a hacker Among Us oh who's the hacker yeah I love this guys and the view account's coming off this is insane yeah oh man right so now what we're going to do guys is we are going to make a use effect because a use effect is basically when we want the app to when the app initially loads what we want to do is actually create a like a fetch from the the database but before we do that what we're going to do is we're going to create an um we're going to use something called axios so a lot of you guys what axio is I'm going to go back over to my uh let's go back over to this terminal let's go ahead and go back into our Tik Tok build there we go so we're back inside our front end Tik Tok and I'm going to go ahead and do mpmi uh oops I can't you guys can't actually see whoa damn dude just got 10 P dollar donation thank you so much for your time I'm learning a ton from omed n dude thank you that's insane thank you dud so much yeah yeah that's amazing dude thank you so much um somebody said what is Sunny's personal channel name it's just Sunny sang on YouTube by the way so if you want to follow go ahead I just hit a th subscribers not bad so wow yeah I know right yeah thank you dude uh so let's go ahead and create an axios JS right so axios JS oops axos JS and here what we're going to do is underneath we're going to do mpmi and axos so in the bottom I'm going to make this a bit bigger for you guys to see mpmi axos at the bottom and this will actually go ahead and pull axios into the uh the project right axio is a good um Jason follow thank you so much um yeah so live debugging was I think that was actually really cool David I think like I actually learned a bit myself as well like that was pretty cool that was intense me too dude yeah that was intense dud we should have had some like music you know like yeah I mean I mean it's definitely a real world uh exam I mean it couldn't get any more real world yeah honestly exactly yeah yeah now we just added axos to the project so what we're going to do now is we're going to say import axio from axios and here what we're doing is we're saying we're creating an axios instance and we're exporting it so we can use it outside and then here the base URL so a lot of people would say you can use fetch I agree but there's a reason why I kind of want to show you this axio way because I do like the base URL stuff um so I just want to show you guys this and yes you can use Fetch and you can reduce the number of dependencies that's a good point by Jason Francis um so he just choed in here thank you um so what we're going to do now is we're going to change the base URL to actually be the base URL of this one so let's go ahead and grab our Heroku deployed base URL so this one here and guys like you can see that that's now going to be the base URL right so what it means is like when we use use effect is essentially a hook which is going to get fired off and what it allows us to do is it says when the app component loads um go ahead and run this code and we only want to run it once in this example right so we're going to leave the dependencies empty so when app component loads go ahead and do something and what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to say um let's go ahead and say uh a wait so so what we actually need to do is we need to do an asynchronous function inside of it so the way you do an async inside of a use effect is you say a sync function and then let's go ahead and say fetch post so this is going to make an API call to the back end and then here we say uh const request so let's just go ahead and say const request Quest or actually this would be the response really I guess the response yeah equals a weight and then we're going to say axos doget and then let's go ahead and pull from the V2 so not this one sorry V2 posts right remember V1 was our local V2 is our actual mongod DB with two post and then what actually I don't think you have imported xos by the way oh yeah I haven't no sorry yeah so don't do this guys this is a bad thing what you want to do is not this one this is pulling from the actual thing you want to go ahead and do it from our local axios because that one we the difference between the two is I think it's uh it's uh super important to understand so if you do not add the dot slash uh that means you are importing the actual dependency but this way you will be importing the instance that you just created right exactly exactly yep so very very important uh cuz otherwise you would be getting the um you wouldn't actually be doing the um you w using the base URL we just got another other stuff to debug yeah we got another five by Calvin caber he says first time watching just started learning how to code most of the terminology going over my head but I don't want to leave my seat keep it up guys honestly dude pattern recognition yeah thank you so much firstly and pattern recog even the fact you're watching this I'm telling you like it will slowly drip feed into you and you'll start to understand different you'll start to see patterns across different things like how a function is written and so forth just your You by you being here is the best thing that you could be doing for yourself so thank you so much for that donation we appreciate you here what we're going to do guys is when we get back the uh the response we're going to create a piece of state to actually go ahead and store the videos so we're going to say videos and then we're going to say set videos and here we're going to say use State and we're basically going to go ahead and initially just have an empty array okay empty array and here what we're going to say is set the videos to to be the response. data because remember the data comes back inside of that response so that that would be where all of those that list of items comes back as um so we're going to go ahead and do that uh and I'm going to just going to drop this down so you guys can see and then what we're going to do is we're going to say return request so just this return request will just stop the function from from firing so there we go we can just return the request end that's the cleanup process is is that correct uh I think so yeah so in this case we'll say fetch post to actually call the function so this is the async function and then we're just saying fetch the post right so that will work really nicely uh some people are saying why do you never use classbased components because the new way of writing components is uh functional and it's trust me it's so much better um yeah so so you want to be doing dropping the this word yeah that's and to it is a kind of a handy skill to be able to refactor class based to functional um but but definitely do functional if you're writing fresh components um okay so this means that now we should be getting the video so if I do console log and I do videos so now what we should see is when we run the app so let's go ahead and go to our Local Host 3000 where we're running the app so it says wre is not defined on 14 so Rec is not defined on 14 so this one here is response that's why oops my bad so now we can see we've got this so it's actually working see the array initially a zero and then we get an array of four so some people are pushing stuff into the the okay thank you guys we got a hacker Among Us what yeah somebody says fix the security flaw okay I mean like so that's cool and then we've got this and then what we're going to do is we're going to say rather than rendering out these videos like this let's go ahead and get rid of this we're going to go ahead and do the following guys we're going to say videos. map and we're going to say for every every single video return me a video object right with the following props and I've actually done saved us the hard work here and what we can do is we can destructure the video at this point so we actually break apart the video and we can actually get all of the different properties from the video so that the URL Channel description song likes messages and shares and what we can actually do is go ahead and pass those in as props here and to make things very clear what we can do is we can go ahead and delete the hardcoded stuff and now what we should see is this is all the information from the database right so let's go ahead and refresh and you can see this where it becomes full stack hey look at that hello oh so so this I mean somebody probably posted some like dummy data here but like something that doesn't work yeah somebody changed stuff is working yeah David is a champ hey nice so that's awesome guys this is actually fetching from mongodb right now yeah yeah somebody goes J JK don't fix your floors okay so I mean we are we are somebody is messing around with the database but I mean it's fine right now like as then this is going to be empty one but guys you can see right now that this is actually going ahead and fetching from the database right now which is awesome right so that's actually fetching from the database we have all of this work right now and guys what's amazing here is that like this is is actually working completely um by using an Heroku endpoint so this is actually a Heroku endpoint um that's actually live and we're pulling data from it and I guess David at that point what we need to do now is deploy this app exactly exactly yeah let's go yeah so let's do it dude now is yeah yeah now is the time to go with the Firebase right yep so Firebase guys if you're excited let me know just smash that thumbs up button I mean like can we get another 100 likes I don't know I mean you guys you know can we can we do that yeah it would be nice I mean let's just set up everything uh and just stop right before deploying let's do it so this case what we're going to do is we're going to say Firebase in it so firstly in order to get Firebase tools working I actually need to do it on this computer cuz it's a fresh computer so to install the CLI what you need to do is go to um Firebase let's go to Firebase I'll show you guys the step to do this so you want to go to to the console go to the project that we created earlier so in this case the Tik Tok clone and then what you want to do is go to this one here the web and you want to register your app so here I'm going to say Tik Tock clone also set up Firebase hosting yes and register the app and then what you want to do is you want to skip this one you don't care about that this one here mpm install Firebase tools now you're probably going to want to do Pudo before it because when you install anything globally you actually do usually need admin privileges so in this case you are going to go ahead and do that and we oh we did hit over $100 in chat Revenue by the way guys we hit $119 at the moment that's amazing and 34,000 playbacks oh damn dude jeez so that's so cool and we got 2200 uh likes yeah 2200 likes insane love that so now we added five actually sorry sorry to interrupt you uh there is a question from Muhammad uh so I don't think you can host your node server on Firebase but there is a thing called Firebase functions which is almost the same thing right so you can create um uh AP in points on Firebase yeah and I actually really recommend this guys and I will be doing a video on this because I'm a huge fan of Firebase Cloud functions for loads of internal tools me and kazy do it they're super secure there there's a lot of like they're also serverless they scale up and down so it follows a micro service architecture so extremely powerful extremely extremely powerful also because they're on Google servers you don't have to mess around with the security access which means because that function is going to be fired off in a safe environment so you're never going to get some entanglement so if you do interact with data you can do it in a safe way yeah I mean I if if something gets there then uh Google is in some real problem yeah exactly yeah like if yeah I mean we're all in problem if if Google's getting hacked so awesome so with that said now what we're going to do is we're going to say Firebase init and this will actually go ahead and we just got another $5 donation thank you dude that was from Carl fertil he goes we guys are the best and I learned so much I appreciate that dude thank you so much for the $5 donation 124 in chat Revenue awesome so look it says failed to authenticate so we need to do Firebase login go ahead and do that and it will go ahead and say pop up so we can just say yes and then let's go ahead and log to your account that you set up on make sure it's the correct account click allow and then just like Heroku it will log you in then you want to do Firebase inip and here what we're going to do is we're going to go down to hosting hit uh space bar and then we're going to S click on use an existing project and here I'm going to go down to the Tik Tok clone so the Tik Tok clone oh God damn it I've got loads of them oops which Tik Tok which Tik Tok is the question yeah let's go ahead and check where is the ID project settings this one is e65 29 so E6 529 e652 there one there we go now here guys is very important you want to do build right so build is what you want to have here so you want to type in build and then you want to redirect yes because every react app is a single page app and now what you want to do guys that set up Firebase right so now what you do is you do mpm run build and what this will do is it will create an an optimal build of Firebase right so no of of react Sor of the react build it will strip out all the developer tools like the hot reloading all of those things and then it will actually go ahead and it will make it super streamline so it's very fast and optimal because that's what you want to do when you're actually deploying something um you want to kind of strip it of all the things you don't need so that the app is just super fast right now after that what we're going to do is say Firebase deploy now I'm not going to hit enter yet let's get you guys pumped up yeah so I still see we have just under half a thousand people guys if you're excited for this and you've enjoyed this just let us know in the comments right now if you're ready to deploy this app and and then we can go ahead smash the enter button and also if you haven't already smash the thumbs up button for the channel um yeah exactly and guys if you haven't already and you're watching and you're still with us yeah if you're still with us and you survived that intense debugging session let's go ahead and shoot an Instagram story and let us know that you're still watching and tag me and David in um at the bottom and that would be awesome because like this this was an intense build this is an intense build nice so you can see a lot of people hey that's it let's go everyone's flying in we got ready Dev we have so many people and guys this is awesome because I saw so many of you guys in the beginning of this of this stream and I still see you guys are here so like amazing stuff like we got loads of people dropping comments let's go ahead and do it Firebase deploy and it will be live in five four four three two two one and we're live look at that dude nice I'm going to go ahead and drop this in the chat for you guys to go ahead and see boom and let me go actually and check it it actually works in the first place so let's go to the app Tik Tok web app and we should see hey it's loading nice dude I can't promise whatever's going to be up here is going to stay up here but thank you there's going to be new stuff added every time yeah this is awesome this is so cool guys so we just deployed an app using um Firebase hosting which has which communicates with a uh node.js Express back end which is connected to mongod DB and we're hosting that on Roku right so I mean David like that's pretty cool right like we just done a lot of stuff in one build yeah exactly and guys I think this is a first ever M uh build on this channel yeah and actually let us know in the comments if you if you liked it and if you enjoyed Arturo definitely liked it he just said Bravo €1 donation dude just took us 136 thank you so so much Arturo that is a huge donation massively massively appreciate that wow that's insane dude thank you so much yeah oh man damn it dude this is so cool like as in guys like if you found something if you if you thought this was really cool just like again if you haven't already all we ask is just hit that thumbs up button so this video can go out to more people we're just under 35,000 playbacks so this is amazing the support that we've had from you guys um yeah so today we pretty much just to reiterate we built the Tik Tok clone in react used material UI for the designs we have the entire app hosted on Firebase hosting and then we went ahead and built a completely separate backend uh which was completely hosted um on Heroku and that was making use of mongodb so we have an online database uh we went through a live intense debugging session with you guys uh so you guys got to experience what it was actually like being a developer jel brusa just said thanks sun and David that was a roller coaster that sure was a roller coaster dude and that was awesome uh yeah exactly and um this will be live on the channel um we will we can definitely post the code if anyone wants to on GitHub and guys while
