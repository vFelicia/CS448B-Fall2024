hey you what's up this is kanji from clever programmer calm and in this video I want to answer two really cool questions for you guys the first one I'm going to keep it relevant and it's about how do I practice coding in the best way by Chris gamer and then we have a second question which is do I have any other chat channels or whatever so I'm going to answer both of those questions for you guys there going to be a lot of fun and let's jump right into it so the best way to practice coding if I'm going to be honest with you guys I am going to say that you definitely want to spend as much time as possible but I want to be respectful of your constraints because you might be working already at a job or you might have no jobs so now you have time or you might be at school college student or a high school student or middle school or whatever so if that's the case which was the case for me any extra time that I would have I would spend in coding but let's say if I have time where college was off then I would just spend full time in programming and in coding and this question also ties in with one of the previous questions of apps I live my life cause II do I have spend time with friends or do I choose coding and how I entered him was you don't have to pick one or the other you can kind of combine the two which is what I did and I had my friends kind of start day they were coding and so we kind of did that together and so we got to spend time hang out but then we also got to spend time coding so it was like a double whammy so that's something I would say for you now the best actual way to practice coding I mean it's the question is a little vague in that sense but the most important thing again is time and then resources so a lot of people stick just academic resource and they treat like college high school or whatever it's just the only resource I want you to think of your school as only one resource out of the many resources you can use so don't be dependent on oh I haven't got a new homework yet so I guess I'm all caught up like in the meantime go online look at some other resources have at least five six seven different resources that connect fast with you Udacity course connects best with you jump into the Udacity course Coursera course connects best with you jump into the course air of course my course at clever programmer connects the best with you jump into my course anywhere that offers you the best value and that you can connect with jump into those courses you don't have anything to lose and if you have multiple resources you can pick and choose so one of them is not working for you you can pick the other that's always cool and you never essentially run out of homework okay and your ultimate homework is basically trying to build projects so the best way to learn coding is have multiple resources work on projects and involve your friends or make friends in the circle of coding and that's how I would answer that question Chris gamer hopefully I nailed that one for you moving on to the second question do I have any other chess channels I've been getting a lot of chess interest because I'm interested in chess I love chess so you guys see that and some of you who are interested in it that's one of the freaking will frequently asked questions I get so I'm going to just take the liberty to answer it yes I do it's called chess tastic it's been dead it's super highquality channel but back in those days I wasn't so good with my youtubing and I wasn't consistent and like what I thought was going to be great with I just made a bunch of videos and then just publish them on the same date which is a terrible idea you should publish it on a consistent schedule consistency beats anything on YouTube or in any type of business and yeah I even have a website called chest tastic Tom so I guess for you guys go watch those videos on YouTube I think they're really awesome there like one of the highest quality videos on chess and especially for beginners and then I play a few games there so you can pick up some coding chops and in my learn Python Opie course we are actually going to be building a chess app so it's going to be a desktop app it's going to be local and you're going to be able to play with a friend and a full graphical user interface using Python because I love chess and I found a way to combine my passion my love for chess people who play table tennis those pawns using Python right so it's really up to your creativity and how you mix your passion and hobbies and your work together okay that way you can practice coding in the best way that way you can learn chess or whatever else thing that you love to do and combine it with programming hopefully that answers your guys's questions this is ask Kazi ask your question below hashtag ask Ozzy and if it's good enough I'm going to jump in and answer it for you all right that's it I love you guys so much and I'll see you in the next video
