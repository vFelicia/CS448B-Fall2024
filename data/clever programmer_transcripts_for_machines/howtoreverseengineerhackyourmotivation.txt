Stefan says hey man I have a question for you I really want to learn programming and I really started once but I lost my passion and motivation for for it does that mean I'm not for it or what you're gonna lose passion and motivation and then it's gonna come back it's it's like like mjid said a sine wave it's a horrible way to describe it only people who do math or know anything about math will get it but it's like waves you know you'll get really motivated and you'll be like yeah motivated and then you start going down and then all of a sudden you feel motivated and passionate again and then it goes down it comes in cycles but motivation can be reversed engineered so motivation and passion is not what you guys think it is it's not this random thing that happens by luck all of it could actually be reversed engineered and you could turn into a system and make yourself be motivated and passionate so for example as human beings we are really dumb okay we are really really really really stupid as human beings here's what that means whatever is happening around us influences us and what you think are your thoughts aren't actually not your thoughts at all these are thoughts that you have based on the environment that you're in the people that you're around the media that you're consuming that's what is that's what those thoughts are actually comprised of they're not your own there's just a mixture of all these and that unique combination that gets marinated that's inside your head that's what you think is the unique you and are your thoughts now knowing that we could be really depressed that we are really stupid or knowing that we could be really happy because we could reverseengineer it a lot of things in our life so for example if I feel less passionate or motivated when I'm driving I don't listen to em you because it's a waste of time listening to music it's sometimes good if you're using it to get yourself palmtree working on something to get yourself focus but if you're driving it's just a waste of time why not listen to books on something like audible why not when you're in a train and you got your headsets in or you're doing a commute listen to books and you could listen to books that motivate you or talk about coding or programming that's one thing you could do here's another amazing crazy hack that's lifechanging when you are at home and you're about to eat your food why waste all that time just sitting there eating food looking at a wall or what do some of us do we eat food while watching house of cards while watching stranger things or suits or I don't know whatever news channels or cat videos or just you stuff on YouTube or surfing the internet whatever it may be for you instead of doing that why not watch cool stuff you could be building with code or maybe there's a new problem in coding that you've hit and now you're stuck so you're looking up how to solve it or you're looking at coding tutorials and you're eating food and looking at that at the same time all right so if you replace your car time and all that other nonsense so you replace your music with stuff about coding and you're watching stuff about coding and coming up with new ideas those are the easiest hacks so you can start implementing right now or also you could go to local meetups where there are other people who think about coding who dream about coding who love it and want to build amazing things now this is something important to you and you start applying all three of these things I just told you you know changing the circle of your friends because you know they say the five friends around you write the five closest people to you you're not only just the average of them but quantifiably that it's actually measurable and your average salary is also the average of the five people around you and how much they make okay so for those of you who like to think very objectively like me even if you don't believe that other whole thing about you're the average of the five closest people to you if you look around what their salaries are and you see what your salary is you're like whoa we're all really close that should be you know that should tell you something so if those people are not about coding or not passionate about their life or not trying to reach their goals or not trying to move themselves forward or not motivated and not motivating you and not believing in you maybe just maybe it's time to expand that inner circle to other people and those people who don't care for you or are there for you to make yourself feel comfortable but don't really push you or challenge you or move you to do new things maybe just maybe it's time to cut them out all right so you combine replacing music with books you combine or placing Netflix and the stupid you watch and you waste your time an average American spends 40 hours a week and my phone just died so my live stream is dead let's figure out what's going on with this bad boy but think about this okay average American spends 40 hours a week on TV so most of us complain about not having time we have time we just spend it on a lot of weird things and I'm not putting myself above it I do it all the time that's why I have these things in the back of my head because while I am teaching you and sharing this with you I'm mostly getting the most benefit for myself because it reminds me to do these things because I'm the one also who's not spending time doing the right things so if we can change our habits we can reverse engineer being motivated and passionate and being at that level that we want to be at and we don't have to condemn ourselves anymore for not having that passion or that motivation
