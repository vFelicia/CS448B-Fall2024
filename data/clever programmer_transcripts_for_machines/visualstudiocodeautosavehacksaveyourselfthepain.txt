it's pretty much gone ahead and it's made everything black but it didn't do what we wanted and change the app.js h1 so it should have made this actually should we should we just enable word wrap like because we do this really often yeah shall we because i think a lot that will help a lot of people actually yeah um okay so on so let's go back there so it i think word wrap is gonna be super because that's been i think a really frustrating thing even when i'm watching our own streams i get confused where everything is yeah so that should be good is there auto is there auto save or something along those lines we can enable in visual studio code oh good shower actually good shot uh let's go ahead and click settings let me double check let's do auto save something save auto save yeah so on focus change a dirty editor is automatically saved when the editor loses focus or we can do after a delay oh that's a dirty editor what the hell is a dirty editor i think that's when i switch to a different file it will save actually that's a good way of doing it yeah own focus change maybe but i mean you want it should be delay right or because it should be unfocused or which one should it be let's do after delay because then that way they can see the screen as it changes yeah let's do after today what do you have today i think perfect perfect that's really good so that might be one second yeah so if i one second delay that's pretty good so like let me test it so it says um okay reels nice that's perfect dude let's actually remove the building i'll do i'll remove the delay to half a second actually to dude that's pretty good actually try it that's like that's like real time coding i guess that's like real time yeah so let's do it yeah two do it 300 seconds yeah the only thing i'm wondering is say if i'm coding like a bunch like this oh that could be annoying oh no then again it's not doing it it's not doing it that's okay yeah we're good we're good okay he does it in a clever way should i do should i do it half second or less than half a second uh let's do it let's just give it let's give it a half second let's see let's see how half second goes okay cool done yeah that's pretty cool nice so that should help you guys out a bit more so you it should be a easier sort of smoother visual cue on you guys so now if we go back to this and we save oh no i don't need to save um so now
