on youtube what is up youtube how's it going this is qazi welcome to day one of the react challenge we're gonna be showing you your front end developer road map with react and web 3.0 so it's going to be absolutely unbelievable never been done before this is the first time so if you're here you're the lucky one this is going to be super exciting we have tons of people live here on zoom if you're watching it on youtube that's totally fine as well and with that said we're just gonna jump right in because i want to give you guys as much value as possible hopefully that sounds good to everybody on zoom and that sounds good to everybody on youtube with that said let's jump right into it so i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here all right and uh you guys let me know if you guys are able to see my screen okay here we go awesome all right um amanoth david if everybody can see david can you let me know if you guys are able to see my screen clearly on zoom yes we are perfect here we go guys your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in 2022 let's just get rocking and rolling if you guys want to grab something to take notes with do that because it's gonna be ton of information for you guys i wanna i wanna bring it all to you guys okay so let me ask you guys this who here wants to become a frontend developer in 2022 as we head into this new year raise your hands drop some comments let me know if you want to become a frontend developer as we go into the new year if you weren't a developer before guys let's go to this new year ready to crush it if you're with me on this let me know now here is the state of the world right here's what's been going on minus my beautiful drawings let's see if i can erase them okay they're gone okay so this is web 1.0 this was the the world and how it was before as we knew it okay so for example if you could go on to msn or aol or see the internet explorer or google and just search stuff that's what used to exist back in the day you couldn't really add your own data you couldn't create your own profiles there wasn't much you can do to interact with it was essentially a read only internet does that kind of make sense guys if it does let me know just so i want to make sure we're going on the right page or give me a thumbs up if that makes sense if we're on the same page okay beautiful jacob thank you for that anthony thank you for that so that's kind of how like the world of the internet right had been in the past then came web 2.0 so who's who's familiar with web 2.0 right instagram who here uses instagram raise your hands hopefully everybody and if you don't watch out that person might be the next serial killer just kidding everybody uses instagram right most people do uh facebook right some people don't or are are going off of it but i guess let me let me get a show of hands who still uses facebook you still use facebook kind of actively oh wow big group of people nice okay uh facebook messenger right all these things are web 2.0 and on web 2.0 right like youtube you could create videos you could delete videos you could edit videos you could create posts you could delete posts you could edit posts does that make sense guys kind of how web 2.0 is fundamentally different than web 1.0 we're all on the same page with that we understand that so far give me a thumbs up if we do because i see everybody okay beautiful awesome and then now we're heading into web three now this is the thing that's like remember guys when we were going from web 1.0 to web 2.0 it was just as confusing everybody was just as confused and most people didn't understand it until like everybody was on it okay this is kind of what's happening as we head into web 3 and things are shifting and technologies are shifting and a lot of us are still not in it right who here is familiar with or has heard of things like nft raise your hands if you've heard of things like nfts wow a lot of people right i see lots of hands going up raise your hands if you have heard of ethereum raise your hands if you ever heard of ethereum tons of hands going up yup so hopefully you guys can spot that's ethereum right there right this is bitcoin right here now let me ask you guys this what's this fox looking thing right there does anybody know you guys uh feel free to let me know in the chat below as well meta mask shiva inu somebody says yeah with shiba inu do you guys know what happened where this one person like invested in shiba inu and came out with 5.7 billion dollars in 400 days would you guys like to come out with 5.7 billion dollars in 400 days that would not be a bad work here right uh but this is not shiba inu right this is metamask okay so what's happening with this web 3 world is we're now starting to get a lot of ownership that's verifiable that's why people like um i don't know if you guys saw but jayz hopefully everybody knows here jayz but jayz's profile picture on twitter is what do you guys know what's his profile picture he's using it's an nft right it's a crypto punk yeah it's a crypto punk a ton of big celebrities you know like steph curry is he has board ape yacht club even if you don't know what i'm talking about just know this they have just paid seven hundred thousand dollars for a freaking photo okay and why people do that is for a lot of reasons we're not going to go too much into why nfts are valued at what they're at but the reason why a lot of these people have it is this sense of ownership and now you can have real ownership verifiable that you couldn't have with just web 2.0 and that's where we're headed and a lot of things are very transparent you can see transactions on the blockchain and you can even start hosting data on the blockchain and web 3. so this is the world that we're heading to um other benefits of this are if i'm sending us money usd to some other country i'm being charged crazy fees it takes so many days apparently the bank people sleep on the weekends and the money doesn't get through like what the hell is up with that like it's a bank it's just like send the freaking money right i don't imagine it's some actual physical worker that's traveling that's actually carrying the money right it's probably technologically done so i don't understand why technical technology is sleeping on fridays saturdays and sundays with the crypto world that doesn't happen right with the with that doesn't happen things are happening 24 7 almost instantaneously you can move i can send bitcoin from here to philippine or to pakistan or to any country in a matter of seconds people will get it don't have to pay fees for it and then can exchange it for anything they want right so hopefully kind of at a high level you can see some of the benefits of web 3.0 and even as confusing as it is can you guys at least see somewhat why it might be powerful as we're heading into it give me a thumbs up or a head not or something if you kind of see that there might be some potential in here all right we got guesses yes i can see it perfect explanation yep no middlemen right no middleman so i'll cut out a lot of the fees like for example you know who here loves overdraft fees with your bank raise your hands if you love overdraft fees david right with web 3.0 and stuff those concepts don't exist you don't have to pay minimum fees for having less than a certain amount of money so there are a lot of things that are going to start to become a lot more simplified transparent no middlemen and just much nicer okay so tons and tons of potential lots of no all right so let's move forward now before we dive in guys i have to let you know and i want to thank our sponsor you know uh our sponsors third web let's give it up for third web guys because this is huge this would not be possible without third web okay so i just want to give them a moment of appreciation i thank you for third web for sponsoring this event and anything you guys want to learn or build with web 3.0 guys there's this is going to be one of the best platforms to do it with now me i usually rarely ever do things with sponsorships right i want to make sure that it's something that actually can bring value and this is one of the companies that we decided to partner up with because we're like man this is there's a lot of value behind what they offer and uh in the project that we're gonna build we're gonna be using third web all right to actually build it and it makes it so much easier because without them it's so much harder to do what we're gonna do but with their help it's gonna be a lot easier so the goal is that the technologies that they provide and what we bring to the table you guys have a project that you can put on your portfolio does that sound good to you guys and you guys don't have to pay nothing for that right that's beautiful okay amazing yes yes yes all the excitement i want it all guys i want that energy because if i can't hear you i can at least see you and when i see you guys excited smiling giving me some love on the zoom chat that hypes me up and make sure that i keep going for you guys so we can give you guys more value okay all right let's keep going so all things when it comes to nfts building even your own marketplace you know like openc who here knows openc raise your hands if you've heard of openc 20 billion or whatever dollar transactions went happened in a month tons of you guys know openc okay i'm seeing the comments come through beautiful lots of hands being raised see that as well with web3 with third web we'll be able to build our own marketplace we'll be able to build our own nfts okay and if tomorrow you guys got hired by some influencer or some big company you guys will actually be able to build all this web 3 stuff in the easiest way possible does that sound cool for you guys is that nice okay awesome now if you're on youtube do me a favor and if you're not even on youtube do this anyway um go ahead and smash that like button okay that's one of the first most beautiful things you can do turn it blue so we can help more developers in the world and it really really helps get the video um out everywhere all right so what's the agenda for today day one guys we're gonna be covering your road map to becoming a frontend developer in 2022 day two we're gonna be building an epic project using react.js and web 3.0 using third web day three we're gonna show you how to land a frontend developer job in just under 90 days does that sound good for you guys are you guys excited about this yeah hey let's go isaiah i see you brother okay fantastic so we're going to show you all of this we're going to give you the road map and our goal is to over deliver with value now this is the project that you guys are actually going to build all right this is the project that you guys are going to build so you guys are going to build this nav bar right over here okay you guys are going to build this search bar right over here right you guys going to build all the nfts that are going to show up okay and these will be real nfts that people will be able to purchase so guys if you just look at this project how fire is this project how fire would it be to when you leave you have this on your portfolio right like a recruiter will see this and this will be stunning work for a crew they'll be like this is amazing yeah people man luca yeah yes yes aj is like yes jacob says wow that's exciting yeah and you will be cutting edge right you'll stand out from the crowd because you're building stuff with react and you're building stuff with web 3.0 so you'll stand out from the crowd that's our goal for you now stick to the end of day three which is gonna be this sunday we have something amazing for you okay we have something really special for you and we'll announce it at the end of day three let's get started with today's training and i'm going to start going a little bit fast with you guys so just try to keep up with me okay so according to glassdoor an average frontend developer salary is about 87 000 a year okay real quick in zoom chat just drop below or or on youtube just drop below for me what would be your dream salary that you would love to make and don't just say the biggest number ever i want you to give me a number that you're going to be happy with that can support you your family people around you that gives you peace of mind and don't worry about what other people are saying right i wanna i want you to put your number there hundred and twenty thousand hundred twenty five thousand five hundred thousand a year geez 165 thousand we don't have a single person that wants under under six figures i love this okay i mean it's all good even if you under six figures i mean that's totally cool right you could make 60k 70k and be happy as heck so there's nothing wrong with that amazing 150k 100k min 100 okay cool so yeah doge baby so if you guys learn um these skills you'll you'll have a very value you'll be very valuable in the job marketplace right one of our students thomas just yesterday got a job for a hundred thousand dollars a year and that was his first um he had a big jump and he was making 45 000 before and then he went to making a hundred thousand so everybody's going to be at a different page when you get your first job but this is kind of what the average looks like for the first job so i want to just have your expectations clear all right but if you're above average you're crushing the game you know maybe frontend development and then you know how to do how to build stuff with web 3.0 you could definitely like start off or be looking at a six figure salary does that make sense okay fantastic awesome uh according to indeed.com right if you go right now you'll see that there's ton of developer job openings it's about 20 000. why i share these stats with you guys is because i want you guys to be able to see that when it comes to jobs there's tons of opportunity right people go are developer jobs like coming to an end like will developer jobs run out and um it always you know it's an interesting thing that i see or or people go if i don't have a degree can i get a job as a developer and it's like look at the number of people that need that that graduate with uh relevant degrees it's about 30 to 40 000 a year do you guys know how many software developer jobs are open just in u.s every single year you guys want to take a guess so let's say there's 30 to 40 000 graduates coming out of us right how many jobs are available put up put a random number put a random number i want to see do you guys have any idea how many jobs are available 80k 25k 100k there's about 150 000 positions open so tell me this right if there's 30 to 40 000 people with degrees and then there's still a hundred thousand almost more positions open what are they going to do just like not give jobs unless people get degrees or do you think that people without degrees can also get those jobs right so i think it's important to understand that um and and we want to just show you this because there's a huge increase and happening in the market right so the last time we did the challenge there were 19 000 job openings now we're doing the challenge literally three to four weeks later and there's already a 6.8 increase in the market and it's up to 21 000 that's just to show you that the demand is increasing so hopefully that makes sense for you guys okay now let's talk about the difference between front end and back end development so i want to talk to you guys about that who here knows the difference between front end and backend development raise your hands or show me or drop it in the comments okay i see you thea's like kinda okay kinda have people handsraising all right beautiful let's get into it at a deeper level so back end right is you're requesting data the javascript code blah blah blah and then front end then shows it right it shows you the website the data might be stored here so for example all our instagram posts might be stored up here right in some ugly database and then it sends it to the front front end and it goes hey make it look nice so in the simplest way that's how it's said okay all the information stuff is going to be at the back end all the stuff that looks pretty that you could see that you could play with you could touch that's going to be front end at a very high level okay now you might ask what do i need to know to become a frontend developer in 2022 here's something i want to show you just to kind of um well let me ask you this have any of you guys seen something like this before raise your hands if you've ever seen something like this before okay lots of hands going up right uh this is this is not really how it works guys this is not this is not reality you don't need to know a million things these are designed to kind of scare you and make you run away from the world of development but like i don't know what oocss is or smacs like i i don't even think i've heard of any of these honestly like i don't even know what suits css is right you don't need to know these things like i think that if you just know these well right over here what i'm highlighting you can actually get offered a lot of jobs if you know them well like really really well these are the fundamental blocks that build up everything else everything else is just syntactical sugar or a framework to make things nicer okay that's kind of what it is so i want you to worry about all this stuff afterwards and just know that a mastery of a few things is what you really need all right now i'm going to simplify the process for you and figure out what's the end goal the end goal is get a job as a frontend developer does that make sense now because you know the reason why i said i know it sounds obvious but the reason why i say this is some people just get stuck in like learning every single technology ever and you guys might know the people that i'm talking about and you might even be one of those people you just want to learn like every framework every possible thing that might be out there when we forget the goal which is learn the skills so we can get a job and then have as much fun as you want do whatever you want i mean nothing wrong with having fun along the way but i think we want to get to our destination as fast as possible okay beautiful so um right now right there's tons of job opportunities available for everybody to be able to apply and go for these jobs right like for example here's an entrylevel react js developer job so if you have uh if you're an intermediate level developer you can build some projects or you could do some basic problem solving you can be looking at being able to get a job like this okay probably if you do uh three months to six months of really solid learning and if you have a good path that you're learning on this is a very possible thing that you can go for if you have um let's say like no experience right now okay it's very possible for you to go after this something like this 115 235 range i would say like a little bit of experience you know probably maybe a year or two of experience could really help or maybe your skills are just so freaking amazing which most of the times is really rare unless you have at least a year or two of experience or working at a job so that's just to kind of give you guys a possible range okay so hopefully that that makes sense now here's what you need to do you need to start coding and then you need to start applying all right so let's dive in let's cover the fundamentals in which you need to know the fundamentals are what what is this here what do i have here hopefully everybody knows these logos just drop it in the chat so i can just see that you know we got html5 we got what else css3 and then we got javascript okay these are the three things that you need to know and html is the skeleton as we like to say css makes everything look nice and javascript adds all the dynamism meaning when you click the button javascript is what makes the magic happen with css this is what makes all the styling happen so if you color your button blue that's css if you make it so when you click the button you know the app makes a sound that's javascript okay and the structure of the page that's going to be html now where can i learn these technologies we have you know um who here is already familiar with like my youtube channel clever programmer raise your hands if you're already familiar with it okay a lot of people are already familiar with it so on my channel these are freely available for you to watch you can master html go through the html course you can master css go to a css course master javascript go through the javascript course okay so we want to make all these available for you guys and javascript just completed its ninth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language so javascript is the number one most programming uh commonly used programming language so i'll be showing you guys how to work with that okay now here's what's next all right and this is a stack overflow survey 58 000 responses from mostly developers and you can see javascript stacks up right there okay now here's what's next you need to then learn a frontend framework all right so once you learn javascript this is what you need to learn next so if you have never gotten this roadmap i would say take notes and write this down so you have a roadmap of what you need to do so make sure you learn react because i think this is the best um it's a library i understand a lot of you are gonna start freaking out causey this is this is a library it is not frame break you up quite wrong and it's like jeez i didn't know i had the freaking police on here but um you know this is it's a library it's fine okay so learn something like react you could also learn something like angular i wouldn't say learn both of them just pick one and choose you could also learn something like view okay this is also fine uh svelt is a framework amber is a framework alpine gs is a framework and here's what a framework means it just makes like for example react just makes writing code a lot easier there's other benefits of course underlying technology and how it works but it will make your life a lot easier when you're building components building things to do with your website and according to stack overflow uh react.js is now officially the most popular web framework slash library surpassing jquery okay so it's a good time to consider using react moving forward okay here you can see the stats based on 49 000 responses so you know here's what are all the things that are built with react you have facebook airbnb you know you got instagram you got skype netflix dropbox twitter list goes on and a lot of these companies are using react and the company that invented react and javascript or not javascript but react was facebook okay facebook and invented react for themselves and then they kind of open sourced it and allowed everybody else to use it so here are the next here's the steps after that for you after you're done learning a framework the next thing you need to do is learn a css pre processor okay framework so for example you can learn tailwind css which can make writing your css a little bit easier for you you could learn bootstrap essentially the same goal sas style components material ui any of those things let me ask you guys have any of you guys had um who here well like just start with this who here has played with css or done something with css raise your hands or drop it in the comments a lot of you have done something with css before who here has done something with bootstrap before raise your hands or let me know okay bunch of people playing with the bootstrap who here has played with tailwind tailwind okay some people tailwind but a lot of hands are starting to go down okay okay bootstrap and tailwind yep so these these um frameworks just my pilots here but if you know so these things just make your lives easier okay that's the purpose of them the next thing i think that you should learn is git version control and what this does is allows you to be able to use a time machine as i like to say okay go back and forth in your code base if you delete something by mistake you could go back in time if your project breaks you could go back and forth in time git is very important i think everybody needs to learn it without it you can't really work on a team as a software developer okay so yeah if you build a functionality for an app like user authentication let's say and then you know you go and after that you build a feature in the app like a todo list feature now if your app breaks and the whole app just stops working you go when do i remember the app last working and you go oh when i built the user authentication feature so you could actually time travel your app back to when you built it okay so you could actually go from point b to point a and you could go from point a to point b so it's really nice that's kind of like in a video game where you could save checkpoints and then you can go to load whichever checkpoint you were last at um okay these two logos that i have here in front of me who knows what these are called which one is this one on the left okay which one is the one on the right okay so a lot of so this is where a lot of people end up getting confused let me ask you this question and answer as fast as you can um or get up and get the same thing oh damn nobody said yes wow nobody fell for it okay great yes good job trick question okay so they're not the same thing they're two different things git is version control it allows you to save your code go back and forth time machine for your code this is git not git lab this is git okay this over here github uh this is essentially dropbox for your code okay this is essentially where you store your code okay cool yep now we're gonna take a glimpse into web 3.0 and the blockchain okay you guys excited about this part because you guys some of you might have heard me talk about the front end part you guys might not have heard me talk about this so now we're getting into some brand new exciting territory yeah let's go angel let's go okay beautiful so let's kind of talk about this now so who knows what these are that just popped up on the screen there's a lot of crazy stuff that popped up on the screen what am i looking at name me some of them somebody says nft somebody says meta crypto bitcoin bitcoin nft's cryptos metaverse okay awesome eth the future okay so i'm going to circle and name them so what is this one what's this here what is this project called man i need you guys to start looking into some nft world because there's a lot going on there and i know we're going to talk about web development but i just can't not share this with you guys because it's my duty um guys seriously look into nft stuff because um we're gonna have a lot of millionaires coming out just from the nft space and it's also really risky so just be careful because i don't want you guys to lose your money so just drop something you're not afraid to lose and uh and and look into that space okay and whatever i said it's not gonna be financial advice um with nfts i don't know what the heck i'm talking about i'm just a dude with a microphone and on you youtube and zoom so uh disclaimer right there okay so this over here is the crypto punk project okay hopefully yep yep ton of you guys are saying that uh this is the project where this image right here how much does it cost who knows if you wanted to buy this image right here how much would it be kevin owens how much is this image my friend yeah so i can't hear you but um it is really expensive it is uh maybe maybe even a few million or like 800 000 or something like that um yep what about this right here that i'm i'm highlighting what is this yup this is solana okay so i'm going to just touch on some of this this is not important this is not going to be necessary for the project we're going to build this is just some extra information that i want to share with you guys because i think it's important um well actually let me just ask you guys this is it okay if i shared some of this extra information or you want me to just skip past this and keep going you guys give me the thumbs up is it okay if i share this okay okay awesome awesome awesome yeah cause sometimes i can go on tangents so i want to make sure that i don't go on on the tangents uh solana guys it's the sickest freaking um chain i think when it comes to uh the blockchain world it's the fastest gas fees are low as heck i think it's going to be the future um i think it's going to be even better than ether 2.0 which is going to launch mid 2022 so i would keep your eyes peeled for solana and projects on solana just because there's the gas fuse are low this over here is ethereum um yeah i because of the gas fees i'm not a huge fan but you know of course all the best projects are on here right this is uh this is windows i think and this is like apple i'm kidding i gonna get so much hate because i know a lot of you are on windows so just i was joking okay i love you um all right over here we got bitcoin this is board ape yacht project or whatever this is v friends and does anybody know which this one is by the way this project here this whole thing just becomes about uh this whole thing just becomes about nfts huh yeah neo tokyo this project was launched by alex becker so neo tokyo huge project v friends i'm depressed that i missed it okay and what's this logo right here this is very relevant for all developers and everybody what's this logo right here yes meta right meta and what's meta formerly known as facebook yes so heading into the meta world which is the web 3.0 you if facebook has changed their entire company's freaking name to meta what do you guys think is going to be happening do you guys think the developers are going to be staying in the web 2.0 stage or you guys think there's going to be a huge movement of web 3.0 coming soon massive movement massive opportunity i think if developers jump on it now you will get so much ahead of everybody else because everybody else will essentially be in the dinosaur stage um and i feel like you're going to be so much ahead of the curve if you jump into this space so whether you jump into it with meta and metaverse and create stuff in the metaverse okay or you jump into it in creating stuff on ethereum or creating your own nfts okay so these nfts guys that started here right somebody bought this nft for ten dollars and now it's like few million all right these projects here have exploded in value and guess what in this project guess what we're going to be having you build your very own nfts all right so you'll get to learn how you can launch your own nfts do your own drops and you know what one of you might kill it one of you might actually drop art that gets traction that might kill it okay that's possible who knows because that's how these projects take off so we might have some huge winner that comes out of this community and would it be cool if it were you would it be cool if you were the founder and creator because like look this is a freaking pixelated jpeg right this is like drawn by hands but like if you were the creator and you had a market cap of like 1 billion with your nfts that might be pretty cool okay so this is where we're kind of headed into this is what i wanted to show you guys at a high level this is the world of web 3.0 okay but this is the most real thing to everybody who's in the web 2.0 world which is facebook so if you know a facebook know that facebook is now heading into web 3 along with all this other stuff that's already there so just be on the lookout for it and i hope you guys are excited about it um i would actually get a sense um i want to get a sense if you guys are more excited about it or overwhelmed so either let me know excited or overwhelmed okay overall means you're like either scared or it's so much happening right excited is you're like man there's so much freaking opportunity here and i could see this isaac says both jesus says both alicia's excited zombies are both i'm ready let's go isaiah says yeah brittany so i feel you guys a bunch of it can feel overwhelming like there's a lot going on so i totally understand that okay and um i and i totally understand for those for those of you are excited because i am super excited you know i'm like man i want to learn about this every single day so i would say if you're feeling overwhelmed here's what i did i literally went on youtube watch videos like beginner videos on nfts and just like sit sat back and just learn and it was ton of fun so you might enjoy it and you might learn a bunch of stuff um i think just be open to learning you know and if you can jump into it it could be a huge opportunity for for every one of us that's in this you know on this call here on youtube now what we just talked about was cryptocurrencies nfts the metaverse that's known as web 3.0 okay but what is web 3.0 really web 3.0 is decentralization so there's a lot of benefits of web 3.0 right let me give you another benefit right here who here has ever put their money into like a savings account or some kind of bond or something where you were getting some interest on it like could be 0.00 something percent raise your hands if you've ever put your money anywhere we got like a tiny percentage of interest okay a bunch of people have done that can you guys tell me what a regular bank gives you an interest just like drop it in the chat and tell me what are some percentages that a average bank will give you um point zero zero zero one point zero zero zero one right point zero one point zero zero two so in one year if you put ten thousand dollars how much would you make back or if you put one thousand dollars in one year how much would you make back three cents three dollars right two dollars five dollars if you're lucky in the crypto space you could put your money right now in something like block five right and um again none of this is financial advice so just want to say that but if you put your money in block five uh my friend is earning nine percent interest on that okay fi you like five percent interest are average so just even that opportunity is huge right like there's so much happening that's why a lot of the world is moving there even if you don't know much you could still make like safer sounder investments the only thing is because it's new it's like oh is it like it might be risky so i'll wait but if you wait then you will come to the web 3 world when the interest go down to 0.01 percent interest right and then and then you're there so you guys see the kind of problem sometimes with waiting right where if you if you risk you can get a higher reward as well right so that's one of the things i would i would say keep in mind um in web you know here are some other fundamental differences right in web 2 and web 3.0 so web 2 the ownership is owned by the network yeah lisa exactly so a lot of the ownership is there's a centralized ownership so for example if um you have a central okay i'll give you an example a bank where you store your money let me ask you is that decentralized or is that centralized i'm just gonna i know i haven't explained it but i just want to throw some examples let me know if you think that's centralized or decentralized yes very good so it's centralized who has the ownership there do you have the ownership or does the bank have the ownership the bank let me ask you this if the bank decided to shut down and tomorrow just go sorry we don't have your money can you really do anything about it there's not much you can do about it they have your money right in the web 3.0 space um you are the owner okay there's no bank so you are the owner meaning that there's no bank that can go down where all of a sudden you could lose all your money the only way it would not work is if like 70 or 80 percent of the world decided to stop using the internet or just literally yeah like literally disconnected right and got off the network those are some of the only cases but that's like that's which is more which is more likely to happen a bank shutting down possibly or like 80 of the people just going i will never use the internet ever again right so um most people are gonna be there so this is this is why like you have the ownership you have the rights and you have ultimately actually more security than you do now with your bank okay then in terms of transparency there's a ton of transparency right so for example let's say you want to invest into some charity well when you invest into some charity in in a normal world like web 2.0 world you kind of have to just trust that that charity is going to invest that money in the right way right that's how it works you have to trust them in the web 3.0 world when you invest in if you put money into a charity you'll actually be able to see every single transaction that they make do you do you guys see how that could be beneficial right that that much transparency in the world is huge it's absolutely amazing right imagine if the government is on the blockchain you could see every dollar every tax dollar that they're taking from you you can see exactly where they're spending it wouldn't that be more valuable for a lot of people they'll put their minds at ease at the very least so there's a lot of power to the space that we're heading in right with web 3.0 and there's tons of ownership that's going to be really valuable people are going to start buying properties with this you know soon enough i believe people probably already are and now you might be wondering like how do i build on web 3.0 in the blockchain you guys want to learn how to build on here because like we're excited we're like this is the future this is amazing but it's like how do we actually build on here right because what's cool is you here's what's cool for you guys you guys are not just going to be the consumers of the space right you guys are going to be the creators of the space you guys are going to actually be building web 3.0 like that's what's crazy it's like they're high think about like you guys are going to be building the highways right so that's what's exciting about it um so here's how you normally do it okay you learn things like solidity have anybody ever have any of you guys ever heard of something called solidity nope nope nope okay it's all good some people yeah no no all good solidity is a programming language and it's designed to help you um do stuff with web3 okay it means if you wanted to create your own nft or if you wanted to create your own smart contract or if you wanted to do create your own marketplace you would have to do solidity uh to learn solidity is it's a tough process and it can take you years and it's it's very challenging okay so while this is a fantastic tool an amazing way i would say like right now this is not the way that we're gonna do it okay because we don't have do you guys have like one or two years to spend to do this with me and will you have spent one to two years before we get on the call tomorrow to work on the project okay but what if i could tell you that you don't need to do solidity and spend one to two years what if i could tell you by tomorrow you could actually build an nft and fully understand it and not have to learn and spend years would that be nicer for you yeah okay awesome so that's kind of where i'm getting at okay so again nothing wrong with it this is something definitely you could learn in the longer run but we want to give you guys options that are much easier for you that you can actually access and that's more touchable that's the point of this entire project because i want you to get involved into web 3.0 i want you to learn about it at a high level even if you're a beginner right that's the whole point of this so here we got a solution for you okay and the solution is third web okay we're gonna be using third web and why are we gonna be using third web can you guys tell me this and by the way it's completely free to use okay so doesn't cost you a freaking penny completely free why are we going to be using third web okay everybody tell calls you to drink some water oh yeah thanks i appreciate that i got some water right here yep it's not about the water yeah thank you lina yeah people are pretty involved with um my coughing i appreciate that and like defending me in the zoom like that's that's kind of nice i like that yeah so this will allow you to do it in this much simpler way and it essentially provides a sdk or an api to interface with all the complexity of like there's so much complexity in the web 3.0 world that it was scaring me to not jump into it honestly but for me third web made it really exciting because i'm like hey if they're jumping into it and and if we could do it with uh what they're offering because uh when this is how i discovered third web right like i came across them and i was going through it and they were like a build nft you could do this you could do this i'm like yeah maybe then i started actually we started this showed us how we can do it and i got to speak with the cto of this company his name is jake lou amazing guy and he was just giving me a breakdown of how to actually set it up and i was on a call with him and i remembered this i'm like oh it's gonna be like i know he probably thinks and cto by the way is chief technology officer and they're basically like the head of the developers that's what what they do and i was like on this call and i'm like i freaking know that he thinks it's gonna be simple and that he thinks i'm gonna be able to understand it but like i will have no idea but okay let's just speak so we spoke for 30 minutes to an hour and um and before i got started i said how long do you think it will take me to understand this because i'm like i have no idea how any web 3 stuff works i have no idea about nft's work with coding how long would it take me to learn this right and if i wanted to launch my own first project how long would it take and he's like it'll take you like 30 minutes to an hour and i'm like are you serious he's like yeah i'm like how he goes if you do the traditional route and you do it with solidity and you actually build your own thing that could take a while and that's what most people try to do it gets very complex because you're interfacing with the blockchain you're like creating your own smart contracts there's tons of complexity with the meta mask and all this other stuff right payments here they're basically handling all that for you which essentially means they're just giving you like simple set of commands for you to use you just use those and we'll show you what they are tomorrow you just use those and then you just build it so he walked me through it and i'm like are you serious you just need this and this and this and it works and he goes yeah like this is crazy he goes yeah and so i was so hyped i was so excited i was like okay all right i shared it with the team i shared it with david david helped us build this project so by the way guys give a huge shout out and a huge round of applause to david guys right now let's freaking do this thank you david he built an amazing project it's going to be amazing we're going to show it to you guys tomorrow and one more person i also want to acknowledge who actually put together all these slides and made them amazing i want to give a huge shout out guys to amanath who's also here on this call so let's just freaking do that right now amanda you the mvp brother awesome thank you guys for the love we appreciate you okay so going back to this right once i learned that i said okay cool this is nice this is doable i like this let's go through with it so that's what we're going to be doing with you guys does that make sense we're going to be doing it in a way that's much easier to understand and much more doable okay awesome and like i explained earlier right nfts you can build your own marketplaces you guys could launch your own token if you wanted all right and then you could also put your own splits so for example let's say um oh hi ali how are you doing i just saw you nice so for example let's say ally wants to make a project and she goes there's this rapper snoop dogg and snoop dogg wants a sick ass nft project so she builds a project out for him and she goes you know what and then snoop dogg and and ali is like yo we want to keep some of the royalty from each sale we make from this right so what ally can do is go negotiate a deal with snoop and go hey i get two percent for everything that sells using third web she can actually do that and then every single nft that sells guess who's making two percent royalty on it forever oh and let me ask you this too guess what happens if that person who sold that art resells or that art keeps reselling to like eight different owners guess who keeps getting the two percent royalty every single time on it because that's the cool thing about nfts it goes on kind of forever yeah so because that that's another amazing thing right because you can't do that with the regular world once the painting sells now you you kind of lose who the previous owner was but with nfts whoever the like original owner was they just keep getting royalties on that thing like permanently as long as that thing exists because you can track it all the way back to its original owner um okay awesome average blockchain developer by the way guys makes a hundred and nine thousand dollars a year which is significantly more than most other developers so i think that if you learn frontend skills combined with blockchain and web 3.0 you become really valuable in the marketplace that makes sense guys okay awesome yeah pretty crazy huh somebody was like yeah it's crazy yes exactly um yeah syntax great you go uh syntax says learn third web but don't neglect the actual blockchain technology guys learn solidity meta mask and the latest text related to web 3.0 i totally endorse that and i totally am behind that yes this is just to get you guys in the door okay now granted with this you could still build huge projects but this is to get you guys involved with it okay once you're involved with it you could take third web as far as you want or you could go ahead and just start learning solidity and all these things and do it on your own okay awesome and uh the jobs are kind of skyrocketing really really quickly as you can imagine for blockchain there's tons of cryptocurrency people one of the coolest intersections i've found is becoming a frontend developer at a blockchain company they're looking for tons of frontend developers one of our students joshua just got a job at teller making 48 thousand dollars a year as a junior developer his first job ever and he was a bartender previously and uh in just a couple of months he got a job and he's in the crypto space the teller is a is a company that's it's crypto related and he got a job because they were looking for front end developers so it's a really cool mashup of skills it's actually really valuable so if you have any questions uh comment them below um i'm gonna i'm gonna take them in just a second but here's what i want to say guys so before i continue guys let me know was this valuable so far for you guys everything that we covered in the last hour or whatever was this valuable for you guys give me a thumbs up give me something show me if it was valuable for you or if it wasn't give me a thumbs down let me know i want to hear your feedback okay we're getting some thumbs up we're getting yes yeah valuable amazing thank you guys i appreciate that that's huge so now here's what i want to say okay i want to leave you guys with some homework is it okay if i leave you guys with some homework okay awesome so um zachary paul says yes you're one of my favorite youtubers okay thank you appreciate it appreciate it so let me leave you guys something valuable okay homework for day one this is what i need you guys to do uh download visual studio code raise your hands if you already have visual studio code downloaded or drop it in the comments i want to see it okay cool a lot of people already have the visual studio code great if you don't bend it on phone cool um awesome all good all good in that case if you don't have visual studio code download it uh raise your hands if you have node node.js installed on your computer if you don't you can say no i don't that's fine tony says not yet isaac you have to have node you just went through a coding bootcamp you must have it because you do you do um you have react on there okay the only way to be playing with the react is because you have node unless i'm wrong isaac let me know yeah yeah so you have it you have it isaac you're i think you should be good okay uh as long as you can run react or if you type the command npx you should have it if you don't just go ahead and install it look it up online okay cool so this is uh this is where you can install it from number three uh raise your hands if you have meta mask already let me know if you have meta mask wow really a lot of people have it it's all good if you don't wow a lot of people nice i'mma get it tonight great metamask super easy to get well it's not super easy but simple it's a chrome extension we'll send you guys more instructions on it but if you literally just looked up how to install metamask you're most of you most of you all of you are smart enough to be able to install it okay so metamask get this down okay if you don't have metamask tomorrow will you be able to do the project with me tomorrow yes or no no no okay exactly if you don't have metamask you won't be able to do the project so i hope i know you don't want to miss out on this amazing project right you won on your portfolio so please make sure please please please come with this tomorrow i don't want you to like sit out and not do it and then fourth uh we need you to sign up for third web okay have any of you guys done that yet have you guys signed up yet raise your hands if you've done it yet if you haven't that's all good nope nope nope not yet not yet some people i signed up already did it okay amazing awesome signed up in discord no but will cool okay yup we got a lot of people here already did signed up we'll sign up tonight signed up on discord amazing all right so sign up on this because uh this is what you will need for tomorrow and i'd rather that we don't go over the signing up tomorrow that you go up you do it taken care of today so then we're ready to rock and roll tomorrow does that sound fair to you guys okay beautiful yep here's the link we dropped it in the chat as well so tomorrow's call guys is going to be a little bit longer because we're going to be building a big project and we're going to need to do it fast so tomorrow's call might be like three hours long just letting you guys know okay ahead of time so just schedule out your time if you're in the east coast who here is in east coast raise your hands or drop it okay so east coast right it's going to be it's going to be 8 00 pm to 11 p.m for y'all maybe even until midnight okay so it could be three to four hours i'm going to try to make it shorter but i also don't want to like not explain things okay central is 5 p.m central is 5 p.m meaning or sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry i'm wrong 7 p.m central if you're in chicago it starts at 7 p.m tomorrow if you're in new york it starts at 8 00 pm tomorrow if you're in california los angeles if you're in the west coast it starts at 5 00 p.m pacific okay 5 p.m pacific is when it starts cool okay cool uh who here is going to have the metamask and third web by tomorrow raise your hands or let me know okay me me me me me me me me me me me me all right i hope y'all are saying the same thing on on youtube on the youtubes on the interwebs i got everything me okay fantastic amazing love it awesome you had the web 2.0 people where am i living you want my exact address syntax says i'm in l.a i'm in marina del rey i'm i'm pretty much close to la um man if a lot of you guys are in l.a i might want to do a inperson coding event um i'll try to make it where you it doesn't cost you guys anything if you guys are down to do it in your la do let me know uh we could set something up actually if that's something you guys want to do and you're local to l.a or you're down to come to la for inperson event um can can david can you drop my uh my number so they can text me okay david will drop the number if you want to come down uh we could do something kind of informal but like go into coding and build stuff and just i'll be there to help you and whatever i think it'd be cool we could do something like in one or two weeks if you guys are cool with it so text me okay text me you're interested and then we could we could do it um in one to two weeks okay uh right before the new year i guess that would be a great way to do it what a great time to be alive yes yeah that's the number the the one that david put i'll also put that here so you guys can do it um and let's put that on youtube as well so everybody on youtube can do it if they want to text me cool so there you guys go okay that's it in terms of the homework and what you guys need to do hopefully that's clear for y'all um that's what that's what needs to be done outside of that i want to start taking on any questions you guys have anything that you guys have stepped away but is that for los angeles yeah i'm in i'm in la so yeah you can you can text me as well so if you're in los angeles shoot me a text saying something like i'm in la you know or la event or something like that whatever that'll tell me you're interested and then i'll be able to hit you up uh will i travel to houston if there are a quick one uh who is this joe here okay yeah go ahead joe so so so far we are annoying for the fangs and the fintech so this is the third segment now blockchain type of jobs or is it are both type of jobs uh is the blockchain within the fangs and the fintech um this is um yeah this is blockchain so this could still be part of fintech like there's there's fintech stuff right like for example block fi is fintech um yeah so i wouldn't really compare if this is fintech or not this is more like there are certain jobs that are more you know web developer and then there's certain jobs that are more heavy blockchain and so we're kind of i'm showing you guys the mixture of the two and i think there's a huge market there for you guys brac says um after this is there a boot camp that you offer yeah if you're interested in something like that do uh text me but i do have something to announce for you guys on this sunday so if you're interested in hearing anything um we have something exciting to share with you guys on sunday okay so make sure you show up then then what network should we select on third web uh select ring could be that's that's the easiest i use that one which which network it's called ring b r i n k e b i why um it's an etherium based thingy okay cool um does not work oh by the way we um that's a test network and then we david david can we also unmute everybody too don't do it yet but do we also have the power to unmute everybody on the call all at once nope nope damn okay i just wanted to everybody to go crazy i wanted to like put them on youtube and just have them go nuts i mean everybody can unmute themselves oh they can of course oh yeah we can copy all right i'm gonna i'm gonna do a couch i'm gonna do a countdown i'm gonna do a countdown countdown countdown countdown okay here we go five four and i want you guys all right five four three two one go crazy let's go back to uh meeting everybody awesome wow love the energy guys thank you for that energy what freaking uh crazy energy we got in here i love a chris taylor's uh video background i didn't know that was a thing that's super cool so yeah which um so what was the question they asked david it was like which um it was like which network uh do you want to choose but it's it's the ethereum rinkeby network that you want to go with okay cool done we're gonna do that okay so cool so that should answer your guys's question hopefully that's the network you guys can pick um for all of you guys that are still here are you guys in you know are you guys in the discord that we have for for all of you guys you guys should be in the discord and you guys should be able to communicate with people what i'd recommend is you know before you go to sleep today just make sure you communicate with people in discord start like getting a head start on setting everything up make sure you have node installed everything's who has all four of the things ready to go like you got meta mask you got like drop a check mark or a fire emoji or something if you got all four things done or that's pretty smart said two of four three or four four or four if you're done that's fine too we got people with three two four four four four four four three four okay perfect zero four it's all good you could do it after but thank you for your honesty i appreciate it two of four theo says aeon says two for four okay amazing four for four cool so by tomorrow hopefully we'll all have four for four and we'll be done we'll send you guys some instructions through email okay for how to like install everything if you don't have it already and uh that'll take care of take care of it all how did they join the discord david maybe do you guys want to link them david amanath if some people don't have access to discord we'll drop it in here and that'll be your invite so you could join it and then maybe we could let them know on youtube as well yeah i might have dropped the discord and then tonight we can even help you guys set up the metamask and like connecting the stuff yeah that could be unofficial just saying yeah if you guys are um oh now i see a lot of youtube stuff too i'm seeing all your guys comments awesome uh yeah if you guys are in discord you know david amanoth like we can be there as well and we can help you guys out to get set up i want you guys to start familiarizing yourself with other people around you because guys this is an amazing community how many other places do you know where this many people who are interested in coding get on a freaking zoom call how many other places do you know like this right so this is like a privilege for all of us to be here including myself so don't take it for granted this is what happens at events people just go oh it's a nice event it feels like it's gonna last forever but it won't this event will be over before you know it the energy that we create here the magic that we create here after these two three days it starts to dissipate so i want you to take advantage of this okay so instead of like if you think about a real event what does everybody do after the event is done everybody just goes back to their hotel rooms or they just leave right but i wanted to make a difference in you for a lifetime so what i'd rather you do is stay after the event talk to the people okay look around make a friend i want you to do this right now guys send two people a direct message right now in zoom chat do it right now direct message okay so you can click where it says everyone you could pick a person look around you pair up with somebody send two people messages hey let's get together and code do that right now let me know once that's done find who you want to message there's four pages of people that are on here you can scroll past okay the people with the videos on they're going to get chosen first because they're going to show up on the first page people with the videos off people are gonna have to look for you or find you for anybody that's messaged at least two people okay about coding or linking up let me know right now in the zoom chat that you've done so okay i want to be here until everybody's connected with each other and working with each other can only message hosts interesting oh i don't know is there a setting david that we could change for direct messaging that's interesting it's weird i don't know why that's the case can i change it um it should be it should be on if it's zoom is it zoom yeah let's see i don't yeah i don't know of a setting that allows that the heck shout out can um david want to look uh look it up maybe because anybody look up how to how to allow that that's weird shouldn't be like a hidden thing well wait which one which one um uh is it interesting that we can because i can direct message anybody right but it seems like everybody on this call can direct message anybody oh right not everybody can direct message anybody so guys while we figure that out here's what i want you to do okay try to just drop it in here right now i know it's gonna go crazy and it's gonna be hard to see but try tagging people and dropping it in here and then what you can do is you could do it on discord as well okay so kevin right joe diaz how are you bud siddharth would you like to connect okay deval says i got you chris taylor la hit me up okay people are dropping their phone number if you're near that area you could text these people so until we figure out how to send direct messages just drop it in here and then i want you to go inside of discord and be able to message each other and pair up okay find somebody you can pair up with find somebody that you can work with okay okay fantastic yeah do it on youtube as well anybody wants to code i have been learning for three months i'll show your comment over here teresa awesome yeah got your comment right here on youtube so if you're on if you're on youtube do the same thing jump into discord partner up with people people are dropping their usernames but i want everybody to have two to three partners for this event so when you come tomorrow you need to have one to two partners sorry not two to three but one to two partners all right one or two partners by the time you come in tomorrow okay that's a must because i need you to be paired up with some but it's going to get hard it's going to get challenging there's going to be a bunch of hurdles that can come in your way but when you're partnering up with somebody it's going to be great and if i make it nonoptional meaning if you don't have a partner and you can't prove it we kick you out of the zoom call i know everybody's going to be doing it okay mix is laughing yeah i know everybody's going to be doing it so we're going to make it that's not optional so if you want to jump on the zoom call you know uh you need to have one to two partners if you don't have one to two partners then you're gonna have to just watch it from youtube okay but i think that there's a huge benefit to being a part of this community and uh and being on the zoom okay amazing looks like everybody's starting to hit each other up you know message each other get connected derrick says quasi let's partner up nice might be able to do it you were the first one to think of it you know oh even cooler some of you guys could even link up in person to work on this how cool would that be that would be amazing some of you guys could link up in real life that would be awesome yeah um david can we put the or a monarch can we put the link of discord on youtube as well so everybody could get discord there please okay fantastic yeah new yorkers huh that's amazing uh i'm gonna just type in um i'm gonna make a little poll to see kind of where you guys um are yeah okay so all right let's see if this works so i just created a poll um i'm gonna launch it and let's see what we get here oh results are coming in hot got a lot of new york lots of california new york man we have at least um 20 some people in california ooh new york and california is a tie so close california is winning nice 62 people have answered the poll fantastic yo pablo what's going on nice background blur got the blur going man looks clean amazing guys i'm committed to you guys guys i don't want to leave until all of you guys have tried to pair up with somebody or connected with somebody whether it's here or through discord i want you guys to connect with one or two people so by tomorrow we have a partner when we come in um i think in future we'll even try to break it off and make teams for you guys that could be a lot of fun actually for a challenge to have teams david we should do that we just have to figure out what the best way would be to do it but we we might be able to figure that out okay exactly 27 people from new york and exactly 27 from california so uh you know i got couple of people from texas and then there's other states which i didn't put i apologize but for a lot of you guys you guys might be able to actually meet in person i think that might be really amazing andra says i think the team idea is great glenn yes it's going to be recorded absolutely nazir says new york trying to pair up admi nejas 2189 florida cody lewis florida instagrams for kick ass a lot nice we got we got people trying to connect to instagram yeah amira i know it's harder to team up through here so we're gonna david we didn't find anything on how to allow people to direct message uh robin was texting something to me on zoom but i was i wasn't able to catch it something that they could do is they can actually direct message through discord so like once they jump hold on hold on there's uh there's security hold on security um security is involved allow participants under allow participants it says to chat i mean yeah that's enabled uh it's probably a deeper setting than that i know zoom is messed up guys just join the discord easy enable chat and private i don't see private anywhere let's enable waiting room unmute themselves start video remove participants suspend participant activities um okay well all good all good so yeah so i think in the meantime wait robin sent me a direct message i mean they can send us direct messages yeah yeah yeah where are the mods we're the mods right for the ninjas not in the security box check the little three dots in the chat box uh allow participants i have they can chat with everyone um okay try typing now i made it so participants can chat with no one click the blue box and see if you can chat with anybody i don't think anybody can chat right if you can't chat give me a thumbs up your thumbs down yup okay perfect now i made it everyone see if you hit the blue button does it allow you to like message people directly or not yet no only admins not yet interesting that is like super weird i've never seen that okay so let's go here can you drop um david can you drop the discord again discord link and slash discord i think no drop the link drop the link here in in zoom chat okay cool so that's the link guys go to that link on discord we have the whole community live right now man what if we launch our own nft guys will you guys buy it that would just be i think that would be a stupid idea um okay here we go okay caught it here we go okay guys so not stupid let's do it good idea let's do it the community is behind you that could be actually pretty fun really it would be like a crazy thing that we could do okay guys so here we go i'm gonna share the screen with you guys so you can see uh my discord or can i actually share discord with you guys all right cool here we go so can you guys see it now yeah okay fantastic so here we go um all right let's bother everybody with that so i'm in the general uh channel so you guys can actually jump into the general channel and then amana do we have a channel for the challenge yes we do if you scroll down like you see the threeday reactions challenge challenging for challenge faq challenge announcements there you go challenge discussions yes okay so guys head over to the challenge discussions okay follow me to that room i'll see you guys there so jump in there if you jump in there let me know in the zoom chat that you're in there okay um could you share why don't i don't have the general channel so one other trick that you guys can do as well you could hit command k and if you hit command k or control k on windows hit command k and then you can type in general or you could type in like challenge and it will bring up some suggestions and you can go to challenge discussions like this too okay just in case you can't find it on the left hand side for whatever reason luna yes okay let's go to challenge discussions hopefully everybody should be here okay awesome so now we're here so now you guys can actually use this to connect with people as well okay you can click on
