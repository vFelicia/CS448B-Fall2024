hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom we are gonna see how this livestream goes there's a lot of new things that I'm trying out but basically I'm gonna be talking about me moving to California and kind of what the new plans are at clever programmer so we're gonna jump into that also I'm testing a lot of this new setup so bear with me please during this live stream because I'm gonna be figuring out if things are working or not and checking a lot of things out cool so it looks like I'm live on YouTube now I want to see if I'm live on Facebook my PC is being at my PC is a hundred percent maxed out how are you guys doing today you guys doing good hi guys hi hi hi hello how's the quality by the way is the quality coming out all right to you guys you know I want to make sure that it's actually showing up on Facebook as well cuz supposed to be live streaming on YouTube and Facebook cool we are live on Facebook as well actually so that's awesome hey Pedro hey Rodriguez how are you doing perfect on Facebook okay good good good good good good that's exactly what I wanted to know and I'm gonna do some magic here on Facebook could somebody do me a favor and put the link to this video in the comment like on Facebook if you can give me the link to this video that'd be really cool all my brother just joined nice okay he said that's on Facebook as well great great great bro could you give me the link to this video in the comments that'd be great Oh guys check this out this gets fancier this doesn't just stop here oh wait that's not the one I want let's change this guy whoops what happened with that guy oh well let's shoot that over nice okay cool I think that should be coming through to you guys all right sorry guys I'm a little quiet I'll try to say some of the thoughts that are coming at the top of my head that's not the right link let's see okay we have a lot of people on Facebook nice cool cool cool okay awesome we got a lot of people coming on all right hey guys how are you doing this is Kazi from clever programmer calm so basically what's going on is I am I have kind of decided that I want to move to this amazing state of California I was located in Chicago and that's where my office was and yeah and it's kind of crazy you know for you guys probably got you sick of seeing that white wall behind me and now it's not the white we have a little bit of a better background and and yeah and you know it's really cold it's really cold in Chicago it's like freezing so here it's a little bit nicer not that cold and I can actually walk around outside and and yeah not feel depressed and run into people and actually talk to people so yeah I like that a lot better you know here so far at least in the wintertime you know cool hi guys hi hi hi please don't spam in the chats that'd be great what up dog where are you from hi studios how are you doing hi hi hi and by the way if you guys have questions you want to throw up throw at me go for it by the way nobody linked me for the YouTube live what's going on there guys I haven't gone any no I'm not gonna miss the cold I can tell you that much I'm not gonna miss it nobody linked me the video hmm you guys are evil okay let me try another way I'm trying to do something cool but it won't work unless I get the link to the live video on Facebook so I'm gonna go get it usually I have people helping me with my live streams but today I don't cuz my friends are in Chicago and you know cluck Co some of you guys might know or Mustapha he a lot of times Halston in the live stream and he's not here so I'm feeling the pressure right now but let me try let me give it a try let's see here yeah everything is like loading super slow it's like the slowest load you can imagine on the planet I got to get something better than a laptop and if you guys have questions you know throw them my way and I'll take them on for you hi Sajid hi harsh geez okay yeah so hopefully it's not lagging too much or anything but yeah basically I want to I'm souping up all of the setup and making it really highquality everything for you guys so as you can see even the live streaming is gonna be looking a lot better than before and I just want to make sure that you know all the content you guys get it's like top quality and there's no sacrifice when it comes to quality and it's like everything is good while I'm here I'm gonna be basically now looking for a place and trying to find a nice place in California here and pretty much that's gonna turn into like a startup place so I'm gonna be there and then I have a few friends who are gonna come and live there and we're pretty much gonna be like running clever programmer you know together essentially as a team and so you're gonna see a lot better quality material and you're gonna see a lot more content kind of on the daily or yeah like I'm not sure if I'm gonna put out videos every single day but I'll probably put out more videos than once a week on YouTube for example and then also the quality of like all the courses and everything's gonna you know go next level so yeah I'm really excited about that I'm gonna go turn off this animation I just have it on because it's kind of cool let's see I still don't have that link on let's see Wow it's looking clean all right now I want to try something and crossing my fingers that it works well so we'll see we shall see my friend okay so sreeram asked is it possible to learn Python by own let me take so guys good questions on Facebook I'm gonna take questions on Facebook and then I'm gonna answer them for you guys okay so let's see all right guys while you have me here live with you I'd like to take on your questions and kind of answer them for you oneonone so take advantage of this opportunity you know like don't just put in like random like for example we have questions like how to become perfect coder that question is not gonna help anybody okay and it's too broad so what I want you to do is like come up with more specific questions because if I take your question answer it essentially like you're on a one on one call with me and if you were on a one on one call I mean you got to ask me one question that I could answer for you think about what could it be you know so yeah basically take advantage of this opportunity and come up with your good questions and write them down and put them in the comments and I'll answer them for you all right so I'm gonna put this comment and let's see if we'll be able to show this all right cool so Shriram Krish asks is it possible to learn Python by own I think what he's trying to say is is it possible to learn Python on your own right by yourself yes it's very possible a lot of people learn on their own and some of the tools that could help you is like a lot of these online resources right so you have Coursera you have Udacity you have EDX and the list goes on there's team treehouse and there are also a lot of books like the computer science book by John Zell it's a good one so yeah there are a lot of resources obviously the best resource on Python is clever programmer comm definitely take advantage of that if you're starting out I think it's the best resource to get started with so all you have to do is go to clever programmer comm and my free course will be there sign up for that free course and then it walks you through step by step for Python and we do it in like a projectbased way so we build projects okay and yeah that way you get to kind of learn it handson so definitely take advantage of that I'm gonna go and see if there are other comments that we have hey guys how's a live stream on YouTube it's saying something about bad quality but I just want to make sure if it's good it's complaining complaining about something not sure what all right let's see if there's another good question we got get comments all right that's a pretty good question and all right basically a question is what is the best way to start GUI programming with Python and let's see so GUI means a graphical user interface so it's basically like developing something where it's not just code by itself it's taking the code right kind of what's in your head and turning it into an application something that has clickable buttons essentially the code is connected with something you can feel and see and touch and click like buttons graphics on it that's essentially the idea behind GUI graphical user interface right for example if you're using a software like Final Cut Pro you don't have to write code you're working with actual software you can click buttons and then do things right if you have to upload an image somewhere you don't have to go and find the path of the file and exactly where it's located that'll be too much work you just click upload and then it gives you everything that's like you click point and click right that's GUI so the best way to learn it is you know look up tutorials on to kinter I have a course on this my olp course which is currently closed you can't access it right now but it goes through Kantor works but you can look online for tech enter in Python and it's spelled TK I and ter and it teaches you basically it's a framework to help you build local apps on your computer that are GUI apps so people can actually click on it and instead of having to write code they can make it work just by point click pressing the keyboard for example if you want to make a game like ping pong or pong on your computer you will use something like graphical user interface like GUI development and make that game in Python on your computer and John's ellsberg computer science Python programming I think it's called touches on it a little bit and then also online courses on to kinder touch on it and yeah I just want you to go and start throwing yourself in there and then take the code from those games and see the things that you can change in there right so like for example one thing you could do is just like find working code somewhere online that runs a game like pong or some other game copy paste it click the play button so it plays and your locum and then like start messing around like maybe there's a velocity variable and it says 80 on it change it to 20 does it slow down the speed of the ball when you hit it maybe there's a variable called paddle width if you change it to 10 instead of 60 does a paddle now become smaller so yeah like throw yourself in there and then kind of learn like that you know like earlier I was trying to livestream to my private group the profitable programmer group all the students who join that course it's currently closed and I was telling them to accelerate your success the secret to accelerating your success and getting success fast is accelerating your failure and if you can accelerate how fast you fail and how quickly you fail you'll be in a pretty good spot because you're going through the iterative pretty quickly you're learning what doesn't work and you're going to and then you improve so look to fail and look to fail fast fail fast fail often and that's how you'll improve a lot and how you'll get better a lot in everything in life coding fitness dating whatever it is just fail often and you'll improve okay that's how you get better at anything use fear and failure as your navigation in life for example if you go to the gym and you're just lifting five pound dumbbells you're always succeeding or if you're squatting an empty bar you're always succeeding but you're not improving there are two different things how you're gonna improve is by picking up a weight that's gonna push you to your limits to where you're gonna fail or it'll be close to failing and then you can use that as your navigation to then know okay here's how I can improve and go beyond this level so you definitely want to have something along the lines of that you know your fear and your failure as that navigation and use that when it comes to learning as well look to fail and look to jump into things quickly okay and don't wait around don't be like oh am I ready yet to do GUI development or am I ready to do X or Y just jump in and do it and fail in it and then you'll improve fast okay let's see if you have some good questions all right Rizvan Khan asks I have a question he says why do you prefer coding with the Mac than Windows I sometimes hear people saying it's better for Windows I love back and I am NOT a fan of Windows I have to like crazy Windows laptops like sitting right by me they're like super powerful and yeah I don't use them at all I I mean it's just personal preference guys everybody has a preference some practical reasons why I give you Wow well that I'll give you why I prefer Mac over Windows let me just say this first ultimately it doesn't matter you can become a coder using Windows or Mac okay so before you go crazy I just want to put that out there so don't break your budget and buy a Mac after listening to me I'm just gonna tell you personally my experience and why I like it more when you're coding and let's say you're using something like Python there are a few simple things that are already helpful first of all Python comes already installed on Macs so that's kind of useful but the more useful things are the terminal and the command line of Python command line is pretty much where you're gonna do most of your coding from okay once you become a little bit better you're gonna be doing a lot of stuff from the command line and if you're a beginner you might not be touching it right now but later it is something that's really important Windows command lines is really whack it's really really not that good okay let me put it like that if you have to follow a tutorial and you're trying to find a product let's say you're trying to follow a tutorial to do a Python project okay so you're looking up online and somebody's showing you how to build this app with Python or how to build this game with Python you're following along all those tutorials are made for mac or a bun or some else like some kind of Linux but for Windows a lot of the times they'll have like here's a simple way of doing it in Mac but if you want to do two windows click this link and then it takes you into a completely new place and it's a different way of doing it for Windows so a lot of the times tutorials are a little bit more difficult and different for Windows because of how you know even their paths and their variables and all of that work yeah I don't want to get too deep into it but suffice it to say dad's you're gonna save yourself a lot of headache and a lot of pain if you are coding on a different OS than a Windows but again it's definitely possible there are hundreds of thousands of developers that became developers using a laptop like a Windows laptop there are also some online solutions you can use to program in again this is not that big of a problem on your advance so I'm not talking about anybody who's advanced once you're advanced you'll make everything work but when you're more like beginner and intermediate and getting started the windows will just throw more hurdles your way that just makes certain things difficult ok so I'm gonna leave that at that and yeah let's move on on don't copy/paste questions there are some good questions I see but they're just like spamming it and yeah I'm not gonna incentivize that so just guys don't don't spam please that's a good question I'm trying to bring it onto my screen give me a second here okay Henry mom asks why do programmers and developers use multi screens that's a good question I actually have multi screens right now this one here and then this one here but obviously it's also because I'm broadcasting and I want to see what the hell's going on but why we a lot of times use more screens or like on will have an external monitor when we're coding is because when you're coding you have something like pycharm or sublime text or an atom open and then which is your coding editor and then you have a commandline tool open and then you also are doing research on something like stack overflow and then you might have something like github open you can't fit all of those screens into one I mean you can but it'll look really small especially on a laptop so a lot of times when you have multiple screens you can have coding unlike one side and then you have your research on the other side and this way you can code and look at the research at the same time okay simple answer for that alright let's take this question on oh yeah somebody asked me what else inspired you to move to California I forgot to mention there's a lot of stuff happening here like every there's a lot of like life here and a lot of people here and a lot of people to connect with so as being somebody who's creative and into connecting with people and building something big and being an entrepreneur this is like the hub this is where you want to be so I'm probably gonna be living in LA and there are a ton of other youtubers and content creators out there and when you connect with likeminded people or people who are better than you not just likeminded like people who are next level above you right I'm a student of life I don't want to be in any place where I am like you know at a spot where I don't have other people who are ahead of me or I can learn from and in in Chicago that's not it's not like that's the case but it's just that there's no like central hub for youtubers or people who create content or people who market online or people who make online courses it's like not that so in California in LA and I'm gonna be living in Hollywood there is there are a lot of people you can connect with and they're all trying to create content they're all like trying to better themselves and prove themselves that are like all goal oriented hustle want to be fit want to help the world want to grow their channels want to grow their business want to provide more value to the world like it just keeps going on so that's kind of what I want to do you know I want to be around that kind of energy I want to be around those people so I'm always inspired and I want to do better than what I have been doing you know and my goal is to build a bigger team as well for clever programmer and hear it this is the place to connect with other people as well and this is well what will help me like grow this channel even more and connect with better people so that's another one of the big reasons for for coming here you know I meet tons of youtubers here like every day and again it's not just about YouTube like I want to build a business and I mean tons of people who are building a business as well because clever programmer it's not just a YouTube channel you know like um there are a lot of coding channels but that's just all they are and our goal is to become bigger than that and that's what we're working on you know so we are we have our new course a profitable program before we had our Opie course which taught people how to create graphical user interfaces we had a course we have a course on learning basics of Python but then very quickly what we moved on to now is our new course a profitable programmer the goal here is to get you like realworld clients and actual business with Python and focus on getting you paid breaking out of your 9 to 5 getting you to you know it's not about like all this traveling you know it's some more important to me is that freedom and like not having shackles on me and I think that's what's important to a lot of you guys as well maybe it's important to you let me know but that's one of the goals to help people live the lifestyle they want you know and Python and programming and software developments kind of a tool for that is a vehicle for that end result and that's what I want to focus on and yeah even this new course that we're creating I mean I can already tell you it's the best Python course that there ever is going to be not in terms of like how much technical stuff am i teaching you and we're gonna build 3,000 apps but the goal here is to get you results and fast and then also the quality of the course like I'm so excited about this course honestly people our students just like went through week one and they're really excited and they'll love it and now week two is gonna be getting released soon and in this week they're gonna be covering like the fundamentals of Python week one is all about like mindset and hacks and yeah it's pretty powerful and some of the students in the in the course are already you know creating a group and then they're getting on those group calls and helping each other out and collaborating which I thought was pretty cool so good job on that guys I don't want to say a wrong name but I think I was like Thomas who's running the group so I hope I'm saying I hope that your name is Thomas and if you're listening to this thank you that that's a very very great great killer initiative good job on that and yeah everybody's connecting and learning from each other so it's pretty cool yeah another one of the things I'm gonna be doing on Facebook and Instagram is I'm gonna go live with the people that are on the stream there's a way on Facebook and Instagram to actually go live let me remove this thing here let's see if there any other questions let's see okay I'm gonna read some YouTube comments YouTube people are awesome and I need to give them love as well so let's see what's going on here what things to do I need to know to start learning Django fundamentals of Python and if you know like the basics of Python you're ready to learn Django yeah I see a good language to start I wouldn't recommend see I would recommend Python number one javascript is another good one to start with scratch if you have extra time start with scratch yeah all right I'm going to take some questions and answer them for your beautiful faces so let's go all right what is the best Python editor what is the best editor in Python let's take this question on where did I go just vanished hmm certain things are just not showing and sorry guys I'm trying to figure out this livestream stuff at the same time as answer your questions and run between all these things and it's just my tiny laptop today so sorry about any little problems we're having I'm trying my best to fix them for you and not drop the ball okay here it is what is the best editor in Python so there are different editors you have sublime text you could use atom my favorite one is pycharm not something I recommend if you're a beginner to use it I would say like start with the pure basics idle like IDL II start with that if you're starting out then promote yourself to something like sublime or atom then two three four months of using that I would say go to pycharm it's a beast and once you set it up it's when you can lock it in its I mean nothing even comes close I have my setup pretty dialed in with that but that took a long long time to just dial it in but yeah once you soup up your app I charm nothing even comes close but I would say wait on it first become proficient with programming and then get to the editor cuz the editor itself can be a whole new learning curve so you don't want to be a beginner and then also be learning how to use integrated development environment an IDE like PyCharm you want to just stick with basics okay so good question Meyer um yeah so guys this is kind of the reason I'm moving out here I think it's just cool and it's awesome and yeah you guys are gonna be seeing a lot of new content a lot of new cool stuff so stay excited for that thank you guys for coming here and watching this live stream my computer and everything is super slow and crashing so I can't even really see the things I need to be seeing and hopefully in the next livestream it'll be better and a little bit more streamlined for you guys okay so thank you guys so much for being here as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video and now we're gonna go and close it okay
