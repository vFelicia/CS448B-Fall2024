hey you what's up this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com and in this video i'm going to tackle robert lillyblatt's question essentially he wants to know what makes you a python expert he wrote a big message but that's the gist of that message so i'm going to tackle that one okay let's jump right into it so what defines an expert that's a good question and i've been getting that quite frequently now so i decided to just kind of answer it for you guys okay what defines again an expert somewhere else like in english or whatever there's no like one thing there's no specific thing that makes you an expert or the ultimate authority it's accumulation accumulation of multiple things so for example i wouldn't say years of experience though that certainly helps and that's what most people will use but having built projects that are useful around it that is something that takes you a step closer to being an expert but there's no list of like build a calculator app build this build this and now you're an expert but if you're working with like if you're creating multiple projects using python or you get proficient in speaking python like you get proficient in speaking any other language and you start start to create things that are actually useful to yourself and to other people and it's not you're not just stuck in the basic level anymore that's when you start to get into the level of being an expert okay once you start becoming very fluent with it so that's what you should be focusing on and there's no again there's no single defining line there's nothing that you just cross over and then all of a sudden you become an expert it takes time it takes obviously experience which comes with time and it takes a certain level of skill and building actual projects that are useful to you or other people okay that's how i'm gonna answer this question thank you guys for watching and i'll see you in the next video
