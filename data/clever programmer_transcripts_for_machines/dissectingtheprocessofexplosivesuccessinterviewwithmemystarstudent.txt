welcome to the happy mindset show episode number 2 today's episode is entitled believe in the process and today I have the pleasure of being joined by Cassie from clever programmer I first came across Cassie at the start of this year and what impressed me most about him was his energy and passion for teaching and just for helping other people and as a result that editor decided to sign up as a student with clever programmer and I took the opportunity to get onetoone mentoring with Cassie so Cassie for anybody who doesn't know who you are yet and what you do could you give us a brief introduction to this yeah for sure so I am I was a college student then I kind of stopped going to college I was because I started clever programmer and clever programmer is all about teaching people how to code and also the soft skills that are around it it's the negotiation skills that you know a lot of the times are not taught even in schools so that's why you have a lot of students who go through colleges come out with a lot of loan $50,000 $100,000 worth loans and yet they can't find a job when they come out so clever programmer is about like cutting the fat and teaching you the practical technical skills so you can get started and then get started actually making money with coding and now you know we started last year we had a zero students and I had zero subscribers on my youtube channel and to fast forward one year almost exactly one year actually and we have 50,000 students enrolled in our programs of clever programmer and I we have almost hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube and what started off with just what my initial dream was you know dreams of a young college student turned into like now a company we have about five or six people working and yeah it's been an amazing journey and that's what clever programmer is about you know helping people learn the practical skills so they can get jobs with software development to actually well when I'm hearing you there and how did you start up how did it like how did you get over the procrastination I suppose not believing in yourself at some state I'm presuming you didn't believe in yourself to the extent that you believe in yourself now so how did you get the momentum going from day one how did you why did it look like looking back in it now yeah odd to be honest the number one thing was what I was surrounded by and one of the things that was really important for me to understand was that none of my thoughts are my own and all of our thoughts are actually not our own you know so if you're watching this video you know whatever you're thinking right now you might think it's your own and unique but it's not it's really just affected by whatever you're around so if you're around a lot of people are kind of negative or whatever you're gonna be having those types of thoughts and same way for around positive happy upbeat people you're gonna have those thoughts so for me that was important to realize because I was just in this loop of go to school go to work come back home maybe watch something and then go to sleep and then rinse and repeat and then I started reading books and I realized that everybody who became a millionaire everybody can't became a billionaire everybody who became famous everybody who became a leader a public speaker influenced her greater relationships all of those people had to break out of these norms these normal cycles that everybody you know just finds acceptable and like these are your norms essentially and what I found out was that those were the people I was surrounded by you know everybody who kind of thought in a regular normal way and as long as that happened everything in your life would just be average you know so first I had to make the decision that in certain areas of my life I didn't want to be average anymore that started with you know in business I didn't want to be average in you know starting a YouTube channel I didn't want to be average and then what I started doing was listening to books and changing my habits so those were the key things for me that got me started so you know if I do you want me to expound on that a little bit more yeah a habit in there how'd you start up my experience of habits is that it builds on each other you don't just kind of go straight in trying to fix everything you just get a little habit and it builds momentum so what was your experience with that what habits and changing it around yeah yeah so the main thing that was for me was when I would go to college I had to wake up at a certain time like 7 8 a.m. and get on the train and the first habit that I started with and that was I think the most valuable was that free time I had instead of music I started listening to audible inaudible for those of you who don't know it's like books but audio version cuz it's really hard for me to just sit there and read the book cuz it takes like I'm I feel like I'm not doing anything else but just reading the book whereas when I'm inaudible when I'm driving to when I was driving to the train station I was listening to the book when I was walking to the train before going to college I was listening to my audiobook and then when I was on the train I would be listening to it and when I would get off the train and onto the bus I would still be listening to it so it's a lot of like listening to the book and kind of immersing myself so from the higher picture perspective it was replacing music with audible that was what was amazing and then the second habit that I changed was when I would be eating food instead of watching you know shows like Rick and Morty or Family Guy or house a cars Game of Thrones all I did was that during those 30 minutes that I would be eating I would watch tutorials so that was something that also helped me become the top 1% in the world for chess that was something that helped me become better at Jiu Jitsu like learning to fight that was something I did to become better at coding and essentially I almost felt like I didn't even have to spend any extra time so to speak it was just like these small habits and those were brought the biggest returns yeah very good at like how important is being a generalist like you've mentioned you you're you used to be number one in chess and you're on about jiujitsu and you've seen to have a very kind of broad spectrum of interests how important is being a generous to become a really good specialist because for me I see you as a specialist in coding and Python in particular but I also know you know a lot of other languages but Freya for you how important is having a general bigpicture view on things to become a really good specialist yeah there was a book I was reading Rich Dad Poor Dad and he in that book his rich dad says being being a specialist is for I don't know I forgot what the term you used but it's supposed to be like condescending or derogatory to the specialist and essentially says that you should be a little bit of a generalist so because it's very important to know the things that you don't know yet because here's the thing like let's say you're being a specialist right you'll only be improving very linearly and incrementally but sometimes when you look at a completely new technique or a new way of thinking or you go in some completely different direction you might explode explosively so you know for example you could be a Instagram specialist but then you start making YouTube videos and you get like millions of viewers on YouTube versus Instagram so you know it's like you get that explosive growth without you kind of even knowing that that was possible so I think that it's important to be a specialist but I don't think that you know well if you can if you go too deep too deep within something it's kind of like the law of diminishing returns so to speak so I think at some point you have to brighten broaden your horizons and check out what other possibilities are out there that you might not have known of and you could really get that explosive growth ooh and do you find like yes sorry yeah yeah like I'm gonna expand on that just a little bit more like for example I would be coding right so let's say something like just programming I'd be sitting there coding all day for 18 hours but then what I started doing was I got into lifting and health and I would spend a lot of time at the gym so I didn't even have to add much time to coat time to code so I went from like coding for let's say 18 or 15 hours a day to like 10 hours or 8 hours but in that 8 to 10 hours I was actually more productive and produce better results and learned a lot more because of lifting hmm you know working out so that's kind of like one aspect of broadening your horizons and how they can help you even in the things you're not we're supposed to be specializing in but they kind of help you from the peripheral yeah it gives you a break and it gives you more balance that that's been more yeah it even exactly it even helped me more than just spending more time doing coding problems you know yeah and I would imagine in your line of work you're an entrepreneur you've got a new business how do you deal with the facing the unknown because it's inevitable when you're innovating all the time when you're trying new things how do you deal with that how do you embrace that and accept that yep so the difference between somebody is an entrepreneur and somebody who just follows the normal path you know like elementary school high school college job promotion and then you die somebody who follows that path versus somebody who goes on a completely new path the only difference between the two and somebody who starts a business is that their tolerance to ambiguity that's really what it comes down to how much can you stand the unknown you know because you know it's scary like when I'm spending time making content and it takes me like I spend let's say one hour of just speaking fast you know I'm like I speak fast so in my videos where I'm coding I'm giving so much knowledge and so much value in it make an hourlong video and then as soon as I'm done I'm about to edit it and I find out that I forgot to hit record on my audio you know yeah and and then like I've already come back I just got back from school and work and it was exhausting and then I do this and this is what happens and I got to do it again and I have zero followers at the time is your subscribers like I don't know if it's gonna turn into anything I don't even know if I'm gonna make money off of it and yeah it's super scary so but it's like how much of that can you tolerate and that what will that's what will determine what will make you successful because before our clever programmer got successful and to everybody it looks like oh it's like an overnight success I mean you know maybe but also there were other businesses that have started that failed like one example is chess tastic which was my chess business that started and hopefully if you're watching this I still have the domain name so if you go on chess tastic com spelled see H es s ta stic com my website is still up and I would be literally spending I was 16 at that time 16 or 17 and I was trying to start this company and I would just be calling libraries all day just left and right you know hey hey this is Kazi from chess tastic I would love to start a chess program you know for students from six to ten years old and every phone call was just like sorry no sorry no sorry no and it took hundreds of those calls till one day we landed a program for chessick in a school and since I couldn't just do this alone it was really hard to get the right sources for where to call because a lot of schools also had already had programs there or didn't even have like any extracurricular activities for younger kids I had to actually learn computer programming that's where I started learning computer programming because what I did was programmatically go through a list of schools and get the ones that had extracurricular activities didn't already have a chess program and basically I brought all of those on like a Google spreadsheet with all their phone numbers and then I sorted by distance and how far they were from my house so so that's how you got into programming I didn't actually know that I go to that yeah we came from practical need that you wanted to become more efficient in finding people for exotic exactly yeah and and I remember I went to a computer programmer in those days I hired him because I couldn't program this on my own and I was pushing programming capabilities of Google Spreadsheets because Google spreadsheet you can code in it too but I was pushing those to the max and it couldn't do it anymore so I'm like okay I need to hire a programmer and remind you at this point I hadn't landed any schools yet any work yet so we had made $0 profit from this and I paid that programmer $400 to write a script like this for me and I remember I was working with and I was like holy Sh this is amazing oh my god like I was just getting so excited and he's like what like this is normal like he's just typing it I was like it's not a big deal but for me it was like wow you could do this with code it's like the most intelligent human being on the planet is by your side at all times for free why wouldn't you take advantage of that so when that happened you know you have to understand like the level of tolerance it takes is somebody who's not even making that much money it was young and I'm spending so much time into my chest a stick business making YouTube videos that weren't even getting that many views building a website taking a risk to call so many schools and hire a programmer for $400 and then we ended up getting our first client which you know who paid us $1,200 and so we made the money back later same thing when I was starting my clever programmer business I didn't have any money and I was taking out loans to freakin get my iMac so I can record video for you guys that make him high quality without even knowing I was gonna get any money on my return I bought lights professional lights my brother his name is will cause cause II he like edits videos for Netflix and stuff and he's really good at what he does so I remember asking him okay what kind of lights should I get equipment should I get and he was telling me that now I was paying buying those like essentially on loans so again more risk and more ambiguity like I don't know and then eventually you know it started picking up at some point like just a sec failed after like a year of hard work working with the team and everything but then for a clever programmer worked out well so how did you deal with just ethic failing did you look at it from a point of view of what did I learn here and move forward or did it actually hurt or was a mixture of gold oh I absolutely loved the whole experience and absolutely loved it I don't even understand when people are like like you know I had other people around me and they'd be like well you know what happened with your last business so why don't you just relax and hang out with us and I was just like what are you kidding me I learned skills that a CEO want or like when they're getting trained training companies have to pay like millions of dollars to train these people to teach them these skills essentially in my mind I was like becoming a millionaire like I put monetary value in my head to everything just to make it tangible so for example you know I'll be hanging out with somebody who had who has a lot of knowledge about things and even I'm hanging out with them and learning from them I'm thinking holy crap somebody like this who's in this position would be charging $500 to $1,000 an hour for this information during let's say a lesson or a meeting and I'm getting to hang out with them and learn all this so why shouldn't I spend more time with them it's essentially by spending five hours with them I've made $5,000 like I'm rich as hell so what like what is your view and money like from what I'm getting from listening to you it seems like you're approaching things from like it's an adventure and you don't seem to have as much fear around money and and paying things and and seeing the value to people and mentors and all this kind of stuff and real life experience so what is your kind of view on money and as well how important are mentors in the process and even paying a mentor to get valuable information how do you approach these things how would you look at it money is for me it was kind of like this play toy and the reason is cuz I never really had a normal job like I never had a ninetofive ever and I never will and there was a point in my life when I was about 16 or 17 something like that and I was gonna either go to or maybe 15 I can't remember but I was either gonna go the route of you know what my family always started off with which was like getting a security job or getting a chest job but the chest job was more like hourly and like more like freelancing and the pay difference was the chest job paid me $35 an hour whereas the other job paid me like $8 an hour or 825 an hour you know but it was fulltime and I remember going the chest job route and even that job was kind of like entrepreneurial like you never know what classes you're gonna get you actually have to work really hard to land other schools for the company so you can actually teach at those schools and even when you're running the class it's like I thought of it like public speaking so I was getting the chance to public speak did you have a public speaking in any stage or is that something to get over was that for something you didn't think of I still have fear of public speaking but I know like got more con when I start speaking I lose the fear I kind of know what makes me lose the fear which is like when I start talking and moving that helps me lose the fear but yeah I had not it's not that bad anymore we'll see when I'm in front of a crowd you know that would be a little bit different yeah but I think I'll be okay but yeah my it's you know it's hard to handle kids who are like 5 to 10 years old they're brutal they won't listen to you like you have to be authoritative and you have to show them that you can and you have to navigate through a lot of weird funky social situations with younger kids some of them just don't list and they don't care they're like human beings but without any politeness or political correctness so it's like you're dealing with either like really amazing or really like evil little human beings who have no fear and so once you get good at dealing with that you get good at dealing with a lot of difficult situations and public speaking situations and you had another question that I wanted to answer the mint or the the mentors yeah how important are they to you and yeah how important are they yeah so mint okay so the money thing that we were talking about earlier you know money was always like this I want to finish that off and then jump off to them onto the mentor question yeah but how I always saw money was this like really dynamic thing and it was basically an exchange of value that was happening so like let's say I was teaching you a lesson you know and I'm charging you fifty hundred dollars an hour or if you figured out a way to hang out with me essentially are making 100 dollars an hour every freaking hour without doing any work so you're becoming really rich but people just think of money in this super static way like you get money and you just collect it and you just save it up save it up and that's the only thing they know is money and how do you bet it you work a nine to five job and you just keep stashing this thing away yeah or you could hang out with really valuable people who could give you lots of freaking amazing valuable things that would cost you tens or twenty thousand dollars to get by yourself like there are people who are cha charge you $5,000 or $10,000 for one consultation now imagine you get to hang out with those people you're essentially making five to ten thousand dollars all the time sounds like a creative way to look at money and one thing yeah just one thing don't think you've know when I'm because a few years ago I was kind of thinking how do I find these mentors and then it's gonna be so hard how did you looking back and how did you come across these mentors how does it actually naturally come into your life as you mind moving towards things money I used money I what I did is instead of just stashing money like just big Tower and sitting on it what I did instead was all the money that I got let's say that I got money for four chests people were paying me $50 an hour or $35 an hour to do chess and it's not just for an hour I mean it's mostly 34 hours because drive time they're coming back but what I did is all the money that I got then let's say I wanted to learn a skill of table tennis or coding I hired mentor for coding and I paid them 35 or 50 dollars an hour you know system therapy up so uh yeah I was like one hour of my chess skill got me one hour of coding skill yeah and then what I wanted to do was get clients where I was charging more money so then if I just got to charge hundred dollars an hour to a client essentially I was getting two hours of a good programmers time yeah for one hour of my time and also if I got a good programmer at a cheaper price like let's say $30 $40 an hour essentially for you know one hour of my time I was getting two to three hours of somebody else's time now and I you know so people a lot of that times they'll be like oh why should I pay a lot of money let me just try to find the cheapest person possible but they forget that it's okay it's actually less valuable to you because if you get somebody for eight to ten dollars like they're not gonna be that great at their skill and you're losing like two to three hours of your time learning something that would have taken 15 minutes from somebody who's really good it's your time over money pretty much exactly yeah so instead of asking how could I hire somebody for really cheap think to yourself how can I make more money so I can hire more valuable person like that's really what it is and then you get your skills a lot faster in a shorter period of time exactly money the last thing I want to say end it off that that one with his money is just one way to hire a mentor that's what I was doing earlier now I'm becoming much better with just social skills and I'm trying to put myself in situations where I'm always either uncomfortable or challenged or feel intimidated and that's how I'm now connecting with really valuable people like you know even in LA that's what I'm trying to do so I'm connecting with people where they're making a lot of money or we're really successful and famous and now I'm learning those skills like that that's how I'm acquiring mentors now so either use money or use social skills perfect so let's get over to the technical skills no so if I want to learn a new skill one thing I've seen you do is talk about reverse engineering it so you look at the angle and you walk backwards could you explain that in the context of learning a coding programming language like Python for example just for the listeners what do you mean by reverse engineering so say for example what I did when I was working with you is that I wanted to learn Python we had a project we picked flasks and and I look at flasks and they broke it down into well you got the front end in the backend for the frontend of bootstrap okay when I went forward to go I know what you make you know I know what you mean okay so here's how I think of learning and I think the academic system has it completely dumb an unnatural way which I disagree with which is okay you want to learn soccer for your first time okay let's do this come to my class and then I'm gonna have go on my white chalk board and then I'm gonna write down notes and Syrian history about soccer for like the first few weeks and then the next week we go to kick the soccer ball and actually play with it what why no it's not gonna make any sense to you if you try to theoretically learn how to play soccer they're not gonna improve you have to play what soccer ball first then if you learn about it it's very relevant and everything makes sense so I think with learning what I try to do with coding when I'm teaching somebody coding I don't want to just start you off with bitwise operators and like weird esoteric knowledge that is only helpful for itself I want to start you off with let's see something complicated like a full website we make the entire website now you know holy crap like you can make a website with coding and oh my god this is real this is tangible you're excited and you've gone to play with it so everything makes sense in context now now what I do is now I take you and teach you bitwise operators and they're really boring stuff and guess what the boring stuff is not boring anymore because everything you're learning now you're like oh and I could use this to add this to my website or I could use this to add to this part of the code and it'll work so everything is in context not boring and it's relevant and you learn a lot faster like this so that's yeah so reverse engineer the way that you learn play bill learn I call it my eighty fifteen five instead of eighty twenty eighty percent of the time should be spent playing with something if you want to learn it like just naturally think about how animals learn to run to walk to hunt fifteen percent of the time should be spent actually trying to build something meaningful with it and five percent of the time should be spend just boring dry learning through a textbook or just watching a video passively perfect it actually now when you're talking about it the first thing I can remember when I did your beginners course in Python was the turtle module like remember kind of when I saw it like this is incredibly it was after a few days and that's where I really went like I can do this now so there's a huge thing for me I mean it's you getting immediate feedback too with the turtle because visually things are happening whereas most courses will have things we're just like some quantitative you have to get this math formula right and half the time you don't even know what you get the right result or the wrong result a visual that you can see what's happening and so it leads you in the right direction the other thing actually I do like about you too is that you recommend other courses and that actually supplement the knowledge that you recommend it courses in Udacity and Coursera and our other platforms which kind of supplement as I move along so it's not just all all action and stuff if there is some theory that's supplementing when I can understand it from the context that's right I know what I like and yes thing is I suppose how important it like from clever programming there's a community there the students there how important are other student than being in an environment where everybody's facing in the same direction everybody wants to learn a new skill oh and how do I find that if I feel like I'm in an area where nobody else is interested in programming how do I get over that and how do I find these people yeah oh my god it's so helpful like if you learned something by yourself something that would take you 15 days to learn let's say or 12 this learn by yourself if you're around people you'll learn that same thing in like two days maybe faster because oh so how you can actually get that where you can have those people around you is like I was at home and I would be learning this and I realized that it's gonna be really slow if I just learned this by myself so I'm gonna learn this with people and what I did is I got access to a coworking space I'm not sure if you know people who are watching this know what it is and if you don't know what it is coworking spaces are just like these places where you can pay hundred 200 ollars a month and essentially everybody just goes to work there so some of these people are like professionals that like you know maybe they're professional coders maybe they're professional video editors whatever they all go to this one space to work and you can just go there and work and so you'll find a lot of people who do coding there and you can learn from them and some of these are gonna mentor you that's how I found my first true mentor his name is Nick and I'm not so much in touch with him now I'm probably gonna call him soon after this maybe now that I remember but he was the reason I was able to learn programming so fast because he saw me and he took me under his wing and I met him at a place called ps1 in Chicago and it's a coworking space you can find spaces for even cheaper than hundred dollars a month but yeah coworking spaces are great and if you don't have the money for that meetup.com sorry man it's free it's like use it use those things go to those events they put events there you can go for free and also you can host your own meetup I have my own made up for clever programmer and I was getting people to my personal meetup and I got some clients that way as well hmm yeah I know I used me to quite a bit to add is a good recommendation now that you say that there's a coworking space that just open up and wrap mine is there recently that I saw and I didn't know that the term it was coworking spaces yeah I suppose the other thing is that I hear you talk about systems a lot and could you explain like how do i how would I develop a learning system is there something I can create straight away or is there something that develops over time okay so can you you want to be a little bit more specific than what you're asking I want to make sure that I answer specifically yeah like I suppose I want to learn I want to learn Python programming I'm starting off beginner level I've done the beginners course I want to take it further but I also wants to start developing a system so it makes it easier for me to keep doing it consistently every day and like half of this Pat carrot of carob doubt but I don't really know how to set up a system or I don't really even know what that means properly it yeah I guess I see what you're saying odd so I'm gonna give you a more general rule for this that's what I think you know um your viewers will also find very valuable it's the same thing with that you have with willpower and motivation and here's one example so willpower it's really hard to get that all the time and if you have your brain making decisions all the time you're gonna get exhausted and you're gonna make the easier decision okay let's say you're trying to diet and you keep having to make the decision to not eat cake you're gonna get exhausted you're gonna eat that damn cake now on the other hand let's say there's no cake at home at the house so you don't even have to make the decision yes or no that's better that's a system for getting healthier just don't have that food in your house don't let yourself you don't even give yourself that option same thing with willpower and motivation you know willpower is kind of like the energy you need to get the door moving and opening and a system or a system is like putting a doorknob once that door is open and now that door just stays opened okay so so let's say in the start you had to use willpower and a lot of energy to get you know start coding okay you have to learn a lot to make sure that it was the right thing for you you have to make sure that you weren't too dumb to learn it and once you start making progress in it that one day you decide to actually commit now that's you pushing and opening the door right the door is opening now what you have to do is put a doorknob in there because if you just keep holding it you're gonna get tired and the doors gonna close at some point so now doorknob is building a system in place that system for you could be scheduling it you know where you have it in your calendar that you're gonna be coding this time block so it's not even a choice like you just have to be doing it but let's say you don't have that discipline yet you need accountability so the other system you could put in place is go to meetup.com and for the next few weeks just booked out the damn events in advance so they're already in your calendar they're already booked out and you know you're gonna be going there and coding with them they have coding hours and they just have free working hours and you can go there just code during that time or book out a you know hire once a week you can do hourly session with a mentor online and even good mentor will cost you something like $50 an hour and you could do one session a week that's $200 a month it's not that much just freaking sell one thing on ebay every month extra and you get that $200 or put in a few extra hours at work and now you have one hour of mentoring every day already in your schedule you know you have to show up for it because you've paid for it and that's another trick to hold yourself accountable by paying for something so yeah those are the tools you can use and the systems you can build to make sure that that door is open and that doorknob is always there perfect for another thing that I think that you would have experienced would be compound compound learning and a lot of people we know about compounding in finance but I've also realized this compounding is applicable to learning and still starts building on top of each other and you've got points of references that you learned in other fields could you just speak a little bit about that kind of what's been your experience in the acceleration curve for learning new things because you've already learned things that are similar and you got strong reference points to learn a new thing from oh this is what I feel like the reason why for me it's better to code a lot at one point right like spend a lot of time doing that one thing rather than a little bit of time every day because um what happens with learning is that once it starts to click you start learning super fast like let's say that you just started off in chess and you have no idea how anything moves you have no idea how the rules work learning is very tough nothing makes sense if you even watch other people playing you're not gonna be learning it just hurts your head um but once let's see you get to a certain point where you go to your first tournament or maybe you just learned how to play how the pieces move in everything now you know other people other people are doing things you're a being you're like oh that's that trick they're using oh now I get what's happening so it's essentially like once you have that initial framework you start learning really fast and the better you are in something the faster you learn it and improve more so you know when you're trying to pick up a skill you want to get to that level where it's deep then when you're sort learning fast don't get frustrated in the start when you can't learn expect to not be able to learn in the start you know a lot of people will start picking up a skill like playing pool and right in there for a first game when they lose you know I'm talking about pool like snooker and when they lose they'll get really frustrated they're like oh I suck but once you lose like 50 games or 2030 games that's when you'll hit a point where you'll start learning fast and that's when you actually start improving super fast you just have to have that patience and go through that failure and the start and then you hit that sweet spot you go oh perfect so your view of the other is quite quite a bit different to the conventional senses it's oh dude I love failure I absolutely love failure if you don't fit like let's say you go to the gym and you're lifting like five pound dumbbells of course you're never failing but you're never improving you'll go home looking the same every time so if you can if you're failing you know when you're Jim for example if you're failing that's how you know that that's a weight you have to go to you know you have to work your way to I don't know why people see failure is so bad honestly if I don't fail at something I don't even like I don't even want to do it cuz I'm like that's all there is to it there's no depth to this thing so yeah enjoy failure use failure as your beacon to where you need to go it's like your GPS failure and fear is your GPS to life as well as the path to growth to its growth its growth is that my opinion a growth is what we're searching for and failure is a part of growth yes yes pretty much it yeah so where you are now what's the what's the current vision of recovery program are moving forward and what's the next thing that's coming up and both and some of the new things I want to do now is like run do public speaking events for a clever programmer where I'm meeting people in real life in different countries in different cities I don't even care if I get two people to show up at a certain spot like I want to go out there and like physically meet clever program or fans or just new people who are trying to learn because the difference that it makes being live is so much more than just even seeing video um and I want to try to do that and and help as many people as I can help myself in the process to like I'm learning more than even you guys you know in my videos when I'm speaking him that's why I like teaching because you learn so much and to be honest like I'm focusing less on actually the technical programming side because there's so much there's so many learning opportunities because what I'm realizing more and more is that it's not the technical things that are stopping people it's that behavior change to start learning coding programming to make a decision to do something to take action like those are the things that are stopping people I want to be specific more to the realm of computer programming so no not just general motivation like I want to motivate you guys to do coding you know become software developers but like I want to help people aim higher than just a job you know like I met this one friend who's making almost quartermillion dollars and he's about to work at snapchat now who's worked at Google and he's a software developer so I want to help people and tell them that they're it's not just sixfigure is not your barrier a software developer you can even make more money and then also that you can start your own company as a software developer you know so I want to teach people programming then later I'm gonna teach you how to maybe scale a freelancing agency that's one of the things I did in college I got so many clients for software development that I hired people who were high quality people and I basically was a middleman and just managed them and they did some of the software development and I was making money essentially just being a college so there are you know first you start off as a software developer then you can have your own freelancing agency if you want or run your own business and that's kind of the things that I want to teach people where I see the future of clever programmer going and I'm honestly really excited for it I even want to do boot camps with students where you know they fly out and we do like a boot camp with a group of students live you know just immersive like two to three days ten hours a day you know the whole life is about coding for those two or three days so yeah there are a lot of big things that I want to do moving forward yeah sounds great and what came up there now is what's your opinion on boot camps and the conventional computer science degree well what were you but where do you see it see things now do we need to glue them or I would say boot camps are better than I mean it's always tough but boot camps I prefer more than a college degree now I know there will be somebody will be like but college degrees for years long at boot camp is three months long well take the boot camp and then still keep learning don't stop learning you know just because a school system or a teacher is not teaching you it doesn't mean you stop learning also another important point I want to make it's college or both coding boot camp it's just one source of learning so always have multiple sources of learning like be learning by watching videos be learning by reading books be learning by building projects and then will be learning from a coding boot camp and be learning from a college so between college and coding boot camp prefer bootcamp because it's so immersive but just remember that after those three months still keep learning moving forward and bootcamp teaches you relevant skills it's always like uptodate most of the times and they teach you how to get a job right away whereas college focus is very little on the aspect of getting a job which is super weird because the only reason people graduate yes is to become knowledgeable but ultimately to get work and started getting paid for the things that they're doing you know yeah um yeah so my final question is what's your favorite book and and why because I happy I won is it that we were big on books and we love books and reading so I have so many favorite books can I mention multiple yep go freak go for it okay so depends where you are in life that's the important thing about books and what you need at that time so sometimes it's motivation you need and you'll recognize that when you're feeling low when you can't drag yourself out of bed when you can't produce content and you need that willpower and you can't say no to your friend who wants to hang out because you know you should be making the content or you should be writing a blog or you should be working on something but you're just like yeah okay fine let's go out let's do let's hang out for motivation and getting [ __ ] done read 10x by Grant Cardone amazing book one of the books that really changed my life for software developments just soft skills of software development and being more wellrounded getting the kick in the ass and then also kind of starting your own thing like YouTube channels and things like that Reid so software developers manual life manual by Johnson m'as okay I'm actually reading out of his books at the moment the complete software developers go ahead and I really find this stuff insightful it's not just coding it's also just your way of looking at things in Southfield and everything it's kind of combined into one hell yeah that was a reason my channel started by the way he's my he was my hero that's why my channel is called clever programmer sounds awfully similar to simple programmer and yeah now I'm gonna have more subs on him soon which is amazing because when I started I was I had zero and he was that like whatever subs um and hopefully I'll get to meet him one day and I'll I still see him as my mentor and I still respect him a lot so that's the second book I recommend if you want to become you know financially more financially independent and have better ways of thinking about money and life lessons I read Rich Dad Poor Dad unbelievable book completely will change your mind and how you think of money Rich Dad Poor Dad amazing book mmm 21 sleeping strategies I think it's called and that's a book that was another one that helped change my life because I started sleeping at 10 p.m. and I started waking up at 530 a.m. and the stuff that I got done by 10 or 11 a.m. I was already ahead of like 90% of the people in the world and then I had the rest of the day to conquer everything you know I'm 23 years old and from the last few years I've been hitting six figures doing software development now my business is hitting six figures and hopefully next year we'll be hitting seven figures so there's a sign that you know some of it is successful and has been giving me good results so that book is really good and then a few other books that aren't coming in my head right now but does that kind of answer the question well that's pretty well relman trees a good number to and I'll put the links to everything in the end in the notes in the video too even to your camera programmer calm is the site and if you want to go there and check out what Cassie is doing yeah I think that's a lot of information for one day it's really insightful stuff for for my Lister's in my audience and yeah just like thank our thank you again for taking the time to talk to us today and to give us your insights into how you've come about creating such a great a great thing in the world because people are actually doing more what you want to do that's what I've seen clever program where people are coming there they're also getting social skills is not just technical skills they're getting both they're getting a good balance so yeah thanks again for talking to us today no thanks so much this was unbelievable this brings so much value I want to be doing this actually more often honestly like this was freaking awesome yeah it's gonna bring so much value to your viewers like this was so good I'm gonna be watching this and getting value out of this yeah this is great and I want to use this for clever programmer as well as that cool yeah it's good with me perfect so until the next time and the next episode have fun and enjoy the process
