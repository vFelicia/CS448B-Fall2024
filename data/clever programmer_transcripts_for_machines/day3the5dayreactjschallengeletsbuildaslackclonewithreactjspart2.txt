buddy day three of the challenge and i am here with my boy daniel what is up guys we're super excited to start to get into this right away because we have amazing amazing stuff we got to do today right now so much content for you last date yesterday was amazing and we built so much we built a slack clone part one and today we're doing part what two pardos of the slack home guys so strap yourselves in for a bumpy ride cause it's gonna be good it's gonna be bumpy it's gonna be fun it's gonna be a roller coaster on the roller coaster let's go okay anyway so so let's take a look at what we got for day three of the challenge guys all right we're like okay i see everybody is in the live call that is amazing good to see you all all right so slack loan part dos as you know oh i like you guys at the same time let's go bro that's what i'm talking about man awesome that's pardos and are you ready if you're ready drop it down in the comments below let's get to it let's do it all right so quick reminder guys you guys know this is very important nozzle tells you all the time you got to throw the cell phone yes away and we are not liable for anything that happens to your cell phone

this bro yo and yesterday yesterday we had two people that donated let's go for a total of fifteen dollars bro we can go out to coffee bro let's go get some finally finally man you get some coffee most importantly guys so we had 30 000 13 000 playbacks which is amazing 620 concurrent viewers you guys are epic it's so crazy that we technically are biscuit coding at the same time with 620 people that's insane 620 new people that are learning that are coding with us and to me to me that is everything to me it is the reason why i do what i do right now for the impact man exactly exactly the world exactly all right moving on forward so here's what we are doing going to be building in this challenge as you guys know at this point slack clone and looks epic it looks sick and of course we're going to add some more features to it as we move on you can see you can sign in right here always you can always sign in and most importantly you can also have messages so this is a live so what is this called live uploading no this is live a real time alert always forget the name we gotta write it down right i know real time messaging guys just tell you kind of how you have an you know whatsapp messenger anywhere it's the same situation and don't forget the prizes guys first place prize full stack mastery bootcamp 15k worth guys it is something it is a lifechanging boot camp that you will have for free if you of course if you participate if you right so participate everything right participate and everything then you get the chance to win a 15k boot camp and also of course a no second place prize is what all the courses and clara programmer worth three thousand dollars and a third place prize is profitable but also by the way guys we will also be launching one we will be launching when soon are we keeping this a secret no we're launching on sunday all right all right we're watching on sunday again yeah so we're launching later on for you guys to go check it out so get pumped

the chat but don't spam if you spam adios i'm gonna slap it out of you and we'll just say bye bye to you participate all five days to be present very important do the homework of course whenever you stick to the homework that means you're engaged and then make the full project and if you add extra features oh that's a bonus awesome all right next up who is ready to put in there 100 and play through wait let's go go ahead comment below comment below let us know that you're all in ready to get started because we're about to jump into day number two day number three part two of the slack clone leave a comment right now i'm in it to win it let's go guys uh i want to see it agenda for today really important i'll skip through real quickly agenda let's go so day three today slack loan part dos okay what is what are we going to do channels with firebase so we're going to now connect the database which is going to be the backend portion of our slack clone right that's the fun part so you're going to get a taste of what it's like to be full stack developing full stack developer developer right so uh i know i did that that that accent that was good dude that was good yeah i thought it was good too all right we're going to put the message area guys okay we're going to put the message area that's going to be the the html css for it and then of course they force like clone part 3 last part we'll finish it all up with a banger we'll make it good we'll push it live and we'll just go yeah yeah yeah that's how we do okay done so uh day five roadmap to become a sixfigure developer this is gonna be a great day guys we're gonna recap what you need to be able to get to six figures as a developer yes always yes and day six oh oh the surprise surprise you see guys gotta have fun with these things guys all right so surprise stay tuned so make sure you stick around to all five days all right all right comprende good so show time guys who's ready let's get into it danielle you're ready i'm ready i don't know if you're ready i maybe then that kiss me i'm not ready i'm just kidding i'm ready let's go all right i'll get pumped up all right so the end okay we'll get started really quickly guys so make sure you guys you have your code uh very important if you do not have the code for this portion okay the article was uploaded to github i think we should have a link somewhere maybe somewhere maybe we could post it on youtube or maybe david if you're watching this maybe you can post it in the um description below somewhere i think description below but we should have a link to github which should be to our products that we have been working on from yesterday and so what do we do yesterday we'll check this out this is what we did right we built a slack clone that looks exactly like this right it looks really good right i mean it looks it really looks really really good right so look at this right that's part of one that's what we did um for today our goal is to get to kind of like this that's for today so our goal is to be able to number one create this portion create this portion that's not part two uh make these channels be actually firebase channel so they're actually channels that are coming from a database so finally get a taste on how to interact with a database with you know so it kind of this kind of gets updated automatically and on top of that you will be able to add your own channel for example if i click plus let's say which channel we want to add day three let's go day three let's say day three let's say day three of the challenge day three i'm gonna say okay right here and look at that now we have a new channel over here says day three see right there so cool right and that's in an actual database the data is being stored for a long period of time of course yes data is being always stored this is how epic that is okay cool so we got that that's day three next up what are we going to do is then we're going to make this and then also one thing i was going to add as well is we might also need and if we have time depending on the time we might also add this portion as well so we're getting closer and closer to finishing up the slack clone day by day and just a quick reminder guys if you happen to maybe have gotten lost during the video do not worry just keep watching the video keep seeing what it is that you know we're building out learn from this experience and you can always watch the replay so if you get lost or if we're going too fast don't worry sit down enjoy learn from this experience and you could rewatch the live and go through it at your own pace as you know guys this is recorded this is prerecorded guys very right so as right if so if you're stuck don't worry if you can't keep up don't worry most important thing is that you're being proactive with what you're doing right you're taking the time to learn something new and it may be hard and it's supposed to be hard right but again remember this guys it's very important nothing worth having in life comes easy that's the one big thing i personally live by and whenever something gets challenging it doesn't mean i quit doesn't mean i stop i just keep going okay that's the whole goal that's that's how i've shut up my life pretty much that's good that's been pretty good and now nas is crushing it right because he lives by those principles yes those crushes those principles are lead me to where i am exactly cool so guys all right let's go ahead and get started so as you know this is where we are right right now we have the login login uh well actually we have the chat section right here to get the chat session i want to go here so say for example room right here this should get us to root the chat section right here okay beautiful uh we have our code on the left hand side right there all right beautiful this is our current sidebar which we worked on yesterday correct and a lot of you guys actually posted a lot of amazing oh we don't have screenshots of our amazing slack clones from the previous ones yes let's make sure we have those next time okay because there are some really really cool ones i want to showcase like people actually had like different like literally different you know colors and everything it actually looked really cool whoa yeah really dope really dope so check this out see let's make sure we take a note of that make sure the next time we have that okay cool all right so uh for this one guys what's the first i'm gonna do well part one what i'm going to do is part one let's do part one let's go ahead and um add firebase so add our firebase section right so add firebase database that's what it's called so to do that guys just follow along with me it's pretty simple process all right here's what you need to do let's go ahead and go to firebase okay we'll go to firebase.com okay that's pretty much it firebase.com once your firebase let's go ahead and log in so i'm going to log in with this uh account right now so make sure you log in right so if you log in it's a again pretty simple process guys okay uh just click log in sign up if you're not signed up i'm going to go to console for my for my sake and i'm going to do add project that's what you need to do once you've added a project what's gonna happen is let's go ahead and do this let's call it slack clone slack what do we call slack loan what we should call slack clone slash challenge challenge oh right there all right cool beans cool beans as always all right so slide clone challenge next continue beautiful uh we don't need this specific portion it's analytics don't worry about that click project oh now screen the project and now we can dance and dance while it's creating while it's creating a dance and dance so by the way someone asked are we going to be building a search function as well since we had the search bar yesterday that's good question maybe we'll see maybe depends on how far we could get these next today and tomorrow and make good progress that was actually the next feature we can do about but if we don't that is a great functionality that you can build and look into right and the reason is because you want to make sure that you understand what it is you're building right because very often people struggle when they don't understand what it is they're building and they just fall tutorial but if you build these extra features by yourself you really get in there and really get to understand it yes yes yes yes yes yes exactly so guys by the way um right all right we're good all right let's get started guys so we have a project that was right ahead because the project is done click go ahead and click continue beautiful awesome that is continuing on that's what we need to do so why while it's doing that that's good so firebase guys is a database right it is what we're going to communicate with right for this portion let's go ahead and click create you see this web button right here click on this web button right here right there this web button click on this one and this is going to create uh the configuration which we need for you know for our website okay so let's go ahead and call this slack clone challenge challenge right there uh you can do firebase solution that's fine you can see click on this for now that's just fine click on register app right there boom so that's going to happen it's going to registration register our app app in firebase we don't need this person right here guys this is not needed okay this is not needed however we do need this stuff right here so a few things you see how it says npm install firebase tools we need to do that so let's do that right now i will go ahead in my section right here i'm going to open up it to integrate terminal i'm in my code so let's do that right now so right click open in integrated terminal okay and then and then i'm going to say npm installed i'm going to close up my section some say npm ah that's not what i want npm install we'll do at first we'll do firebase so the first thing you wanna install guys is firebase you see what as i'm highlighting right now right there ah no this is the first thing you wanna do is firebase right here so we'll do npm install firebase that should install firebase for us so that we can use it okay because if you can't use it then what's the point of it exactly so whenever usually whenever you try to use a tool you need to install its dependencies or you need to install it to libraries so you can actually use these external tools yes exactly and somebody said hey nas you're in source don't worry about it that doesn't matter when you do npm install it's going to install unknown modules here guys right and no matter if i'm in source or public as long as i'm in my project it's going to make sure to install it in no modules this is where all of our modules our firebase modules are installed so for example if i look into here okay you guys should see a b c d right there you see it where oh right there see that's the fireplace right there see so installed firebase every module that you install gets installed in nonmodules right this is how projects work they they get dependencies from those modules folder okay cool so that's all branno now we've got no firebase let's go and install firebase tools so i'm gonna do the same thing npm install dash g firebase tools but i will now use the dash g for now i'll just do it or only specific to this to this um what's it called to this uh project some of the npm install firebase tools okay yo check this out nas i don't know if you could highlight it oh let's go where's the craig craig craig matthews hey craig how you doing man thank you so much what is up what is up great to have you so much what is this two year old what is it two euro what is that i don't know is that i have no idea regardless thank you so much we couldn't appreciate it anymore yes thank you so we got the firebase tools we got firebase click next and here we don't need this just yet guys this is going to be for when we guess what i know this can be used for what is it going to be deployed what is deploying us deploy means you put our project live for everybody can see just how you you go to google.com it's live it's on the server we're going to put our project on the server later on that's going to be that's gonna be guys day three so instead of a local host you could send the url to your friend and they can open up your slack clone and if you open up your slide clone you guys can start chatting exactly continue to continue to console that's part one so now we have that okay now what we need to do is a few a few things let's go to project settings in here and if we have here you can see how there's cdn configuration we need to click on the configuration config button this right here guys is going to be the key the api key to our firebase right there this is the firebase key right there right see so we're going to go ahead and copy this so copy this portion right here and then what's going to happen is the following so let's go ahead and do this you still need the terminal oh yeah i can close it out no problem perfect yeah so at this point let's go ahead and do the following we inside the source inside source click right click new file and let's create firebase.js firebase.js perfect this is going to be the configuration for our firebase a few things we need to do here is the following so we need to import firebase as part one so we'll say import firebase from from firebase module remember how we installed the module well we're going to use it now so that's part one part two let's do the following thing let's paste in the config that we had on the righthand side so paste this in boom right there that's the config okay there's a config to our database and everybody everybody when you guys log in you will have a different configuration make sense make sense of course because you know because that's how it is so then we'll say then we'll initialize our firebase app so here's we'll do we'll say const cons we'll say firebase app is equal to what is equal to firebase dot initial initialize app boom right there and then we'll say the inside initialize app will pass in the config so we'll say firebase um config right there so i'm gonna copy this uh right there firebase config i'll paste into here but right there done okay so add that in we've got that next up let's go ahead and do the following so then we'll do we'll initialize our database so in order to access database we'll say i have to say like this so say const db is equal to we'll say firebase app firebase app right dot fire store so firestore what is firestore you know i i'm not sure what is firestore so firesource is the database firestore is the realtime database in firebase because firebase has many components has many resources there as you know there's ability to actually push it live you know to deploy your project visibility there's so many different things they've got right but in our case we're just using the firestore for now all right so we're going to initialize that does that make sense or do i need to make sense that makes sense okay and then since we get this database in order to be able to use it guys ever in our project we have to export it now so because when we export it then we can import it into different files and use it does that make sense very similar to any component right we always have the export all the way at the bottom of the component yes exactamente so export right there so we'll say export i will say ah no that's not how you spell export we'll explain export default db done done so that's understandable okay now we could use dbe everywhere we want everywhere we want everywhere anywhere ever so now we have a database guys check this out we've got our database okay we can extract the store here now you don't see anything yet but look at this okay let's go to cloud firestore which you see right here a key right here okay i came in here for spanish so right there cloud firestore click on cloud firestore right there cloud fire store there and inside this will go to create database click start in test mode right there click next click net enable for now okay yo yo guys by the way we are at 199 likes we're about to cross 200 likes let's go 200 likes and we crossed 200 likes that's what i'm talking about while firebase is loading yes as always cannot enable files for this project after you set this location you cannot um interesting click enable again let's try one time let's try it one more time oh oh now it's working right there for some reason i don't know why it wasn't working before so thank god because then we would have to debug some stuff right at the beginning i know right so we've got slack clone challenge so we've created our database so now let's create a collection now what is a collection can you explain or do you know the collection would a collection be the way we're gonna store data into this database yes think of a collection is like it's like um i don't know like a like a collection is like a notebook guys look at this you see how i'm gonna have a notebook on here in my hands collection is a notebook every single page contains some text or contains some data on it right there's nothing in here right but every page is a tone think of it as like its own entry right so whenever you want if we if our goal is to be able to get channels right right there's be one channel on one page this could be another channel on another page but the notebook is the collection of pages okay so in my notebook maybe i have some pages that are dedicated to recipes yes and they have other pages that are dedicated to just reflection and diaries well here's a cool thing every notebook will have a difference that will have a different title so for example let's say it's a recipes you'll have notebook just for recipes oh okay let's say and then you let's say you have something else let's say what else did you say uh i don't know your journal in your diary diary right then you have another notebook another collection for your diary so it's like a table almost if you think of it in coding that makes sense to me cool so let's go and do that so start collection and here we'll say rooms because we're going to uh for the channels we're just going to say rooms for now so rooms that's going to be and we're going to create our first room now when we create our first room again think of it as a room as just like a page guys we'll create a unique id because we need to be able to identify one page or one room with unique and then we'll say name right what should be our first name for a room uh programmer okay oh i see what you're saying the ones that we already had before yes exactly clever programmer so that's that's we're going to create our first for now okay let's click save look at this now now we have a collection right there rooms that's database inside this room we have one document imagine this as one page right one page has a unique id and that page has a name of clever programmer that's the room individual room individual collection yep cool so now how do we get those there's rooms good question so now let's go back to our code and we can now get this data guys this is so cool just pay attention just this is so freaking cool you have no idea all right look at this let's go back to here let's go to let's go to components and let's go to chat chat now now in the chat actually let's go to right now let's go to app.js for now okay and empty to yes let's go to we'll create a function to be able to get channels so to get rooms all right so let's go ahead and do that let's say see so let's go ahead and create a nutshell yes right there so we'll create a get channels function so i'm going to say const get channels guys right there get channels is equal to dust this this this that's our function now how do we grab the channels that's a good question well look at this i'm going to remember remember how we exported db inside firebase right here now we can import it perfect let's import it let's bring it in yes we'll save this import db from from look at this from where from firebase right far this this right here is coming directly from this right here makes sense yep cool so that's gonna be our firebase that's awesome now what do we do well to get a database here's what's going to happen we do db dot collection collection css users binary is going to be rooms because our collection of room is called rooms right there so we're going to get that database collection you see this is a collection you see how it's starting to make sense a little bit right yeah this is a collection it's a collection of rooms and then what's going to happen is it's something called on snapshot on snapshot now on snapchat it's basically a basically it's um a snapshot of like if you imagine you take a picture of right of us right it's a snapshot right at a one point in time right a snapshot is a snapshot of a picture of a database in terms of what it has inside of it does that make sense that makes perfect sense yes so on snapshot what we'll do is we'll do a snapshot and then this takes in a snapshot this is imagine this as a picture right well it's not a picture it's just a picture it's just it contains the data inside the collection cool and inside here here's will do this is where we will go ahead and console the log for now let's console the log what console.log uh snapshot.doc so here's what we'll do so the log snapshot snap shot dot docs this is going to give us the data for now i'm just going to go to console.login okay perfect i'm going to save this for now right and here's our react app now if i refresh this and i right click inspect download guys to go ahead and see the console really nothing's happening here we only have this area which doesn't not the most important thing but really there's nothing here do you see that i see now what do you do to actually have a consult the pro the reason why it's not there is because this kitchen is just a function well we need to call it we need to call functions it's called function so to call a function i can just do this correct i can just do get channels no problem right i could just do this no problem right so if i do this right you see there we go we get right there this is all we get exactly now someone just asked them questions if they if you can explain console.log so maybe since you just showed it you could quickly talk about it yes so console.log guys really important content unlock is imagine kind of like uh you're printing something just to test something out you see how we have a console right here for every single website there's a console the console is like basically the behind the scenes of what's happening uh what's going on in the you know in the project right so a lot of times developers they can console a lot of stuff to be able to test how the website is working to make sure if it's working properly right yeah so in real life how can we put this in real life in terms of practice like for me console could be like okay for me console will be like let's say i have a thought in my mind and i want to see if it works properly i will write down a piece of paper right it's a console right it's going from my brain to whatever's in here the console log is just imagine like it's it's you know you're just kind of logging um you know whatever you want yeah so you could just start to in this case just print out things onto the web onto the console to debug if you want so nas was able to make sure and print out snapshot dot docs and then if it shows up in the console you actually see the data in there so what he's doing is he's adding console.log hello see so now you see how it prints out hello and it also prints out the other thing that he's printing which is the snapshot dot dot yes so if you're looking to see what is the actual date inside of a variable or anything like that you can log it with console.log and if you go to the console of your website it'll show you what's actually being printed out or what text exactly exactly so you can see here for example again hello for now here right snapchat.docs print out inside this e portion that's it exactly and as many people are saying in the chat it's kind of like the print version so in java you have system.out.print and c plus plus you have the printf or in t you have you know so in different languages you have different ways of printing this is the one for javascript yes correct so we get the console log high we get the console that's all good now i mean we call the function here but the problem becomes here is that we call the function in the wrong time because you see how we're multi coding multiple times look at this you see we're calling it multiple times uh let me see this console.log save this look like hello hello hello you see that whoa that's bad because this app is kind of refreshed a lot of times so what we do to prevent that is we usually call use effect right with the use effect and what user effect does is pretty simple use effect basically calls this function anything inside of it only when our app is first loaded initialized right so what's going to happen i'm going to use the fact i'm going to do comma right here an array and this means that this right here means that call the function anything that's in here whenever it's initialized so if i say console.log log hello hello i'm you use effect i use effect right there okay so try this out by yourself guys right there this is not defined so this is not defined because we need to import it first so it's going to import that so we'll say so use effect is a function from react yeah you could use and then it gets called every time there's something that's updated correct correct okay exactly perfect react okay yo our boy victor diaz just donated five dollars he said you guys rock let's go oh thank you so much you know his name is the same thing same as joe diaz well but just spell differently i thought it was cool come on bro thank you so much victor appreciate you i appreciate it but look at this look at the difference look look bro look louise if i see that's being called once while hello that was here is being called multiple times and we want to avoid calling you multiple times exactly there's no need to no it's on youtube using the color one exactly so what we're going to do i'm going to remove this hello use effect and i'm going to say get channels i'm going to put this cat channels function into the user effect right here right there right so now if we go ahead and refresh this one more time you see the user fact look at this look at that now it's being called only once nice cool now the question becomes okay this looks weird this does not look like data we need we need to use yes it does not because here's what we need to do we need to call the doc data here's one so for this to work we need to go like this we need to go snapshot shot dot docs dot what the map we're going to loop through every single document this is how we need to loop through it that we're going to look through every single one i'm going to get the doc one doc right here right boom boom boom and then what's going to happen is that we're going to right here console.log for now doc.data for now so again the reason nas says for now is because console.log is a way that we can debug to make sure we get the right data once we've consoled logged in we see that's the right data now we're going to bring it in and look html and look guys check this out name clever programmer that's the one we have right and you see doctor data this is our first our first right our first what room our first and this guy's this comes directly from a firebase database so if we go back to here okay this is our room clever programmer let's create a new room let's call it a new document what should it be called a challenge day challenge so say name challenge react challenge boom right there click save you see now check this out if i go back to my react app oh let's go now we have cover programmer and the reaction this loops through all of our pages or all of the documents all of our documents inside of our if you if you're thinking about the notebook then yes it's pages yes yes pages it's literally going like this it's going it's going like this and so forth and it's actually showing them you see yeah it's cool pretty wild stuff so look at this guys now we have it right there look at that's so cool all right now to do that what we need to do we need to save this data now somehow okay all right save it how do we save it well we're saving into something called you state every component guys this app component has state right has a database what is state it's a database perfect okay sorry i asked you that i answered it keep doing that okay so it's a database okay so imagine this app component has its own database and you can kind of add data to it now how do we use it how do we use it bro tell me um use state use state well first we need to import it so let's go ahead and import use state so this is another function of react yes you can use another function react use state right there and use state has two things that allows to do it has the value itself and the function to to change it so here's what's gonna happen i will say here okay i'm gonna say it like this okay i will say it like this let me go to close this for now well i will say like that um i will say const let me go do that const const and i will say rooms comma set rooms is equal to use state state and i will pass in the array in here you see that yep all right so here's how that works use state imagine it's creating a new uh kind of a new database and it's creating a see a new database for this component called just the app component and it's adding a new section in here and this section the data for this section actually is the rooms right now this function right here is actually what's going to be able to change the data that's in here this changes the data that rooms function so we actually get two things back now to use that what's going to happen whenever you see remember how we did console.data well look at this we are going to do set rooms we're going to save the rooms okay set rooms on snapchat.map and what's going to happen is that we're going to return here return doc dot data why we return because when we return in here when we return in here let me see if it's all good yeah just add another parentheses where uh we're done with the red so you just add the yeah oh this one right here thank you boom there i almost forget that i don't know why so when we return right let's go ahead and refresh this good when we turned out the data it's going to return the data for every single element and when i do set rooms it's going to save the data inside the rooms function so find out do let's go ahead and do console.log log rooms look at this console.log rooms are we ready for this are you ready for this bro inspect element console and look at that rooms now has two two array object two obvious headers to be the ones we have in our database exactly guys how cool is that right one is cochlear programmer and otherwise called react.js challenge direct challenge right and that's inside the room so this right here is actually maps out to this perfect boom right there now beautiful but we're not done yet before because of the thing we also need to be able to get the unique id because we'll use nikodi to be able to change different rooms like when we go ahead and change it for rooms right so we need to get the unique id to do that here's what we'll do guys but decided to return.data we'll do return we'll create the object okay and we'll say here id doc.id doc.id okay comma name is doc dot data data dot name boom that name how's the house that being mapped out pretty simple guys that name let's go ahead and close this out that name is being mapped out from here this that name we get from the name that's in here you see that yep and so this cloud report will have this and then the id is gonna be the id of the document itself except can you go to firebase real quick to show them where the idea is yes right here so id this is how you do right here now we have a unique id correct or whatever data we have inside of this yeah so this id is going to be actually inside here so remember this dc4eli you see that right there check this out now because we're returning the id and we're saving it inside the rooms okay what's going to happen now is we go to here and if we refresh right right for this and we can select rooms now you have two items nice and we don't have the id um i didn't save it if i refresh it are you ready bro oh oh oh let's go remember how we had the e yep right there for e boom now what's the purpose of an id i don't you tell me while the id is completely unique so if you happen to create another channel with the same names react slap dash challenge it totally fine because you have a different identifier for that so ids are going to be very common when it comes to back end development because that is how you can uniquely identify a specific item or a specific record if you're looking at relational databases of course yes yes yes yes so this is a very important aspect of coding just in general okay guys so look now we got the ids cool all right we got the ids nice job all right we got that portion let's go and save that that's so good all right that's the start okay pardos what's part of those bro part two is we want to create them from the app now yes exactly well let's actually show them we have the rooms that's in here we have our app that's in here we have our channels that are here but these are not channels from where these are not channels from the database these are ones that we hard script right into or hardwired into our code exactly and we don't want that because then you can't really change it because that's what it's going to show every time someone logs in let's go you got that right my friend so what we are going to do is instead of these ideas we're going to replace them with database ids you ready for this bro yes sir you tell me how to do it all right go do it so we have rooms in here the really cool part is because we have rooms in the app we can actually pass it down to guys to multiple components we can pass down data between components between different you know objects different you know containers so in our case we have rooms let's pass down rooms into the chat so inside the ch uh no not chat sidebar because our rooms are where they're inside the sidebar you see that right there our channels so inside the sidebar we'll say rooms it's kind of like arguments in the function rooms is equal to rooms rooms right there now we're passing down data from app.js down to where the sidebar sidebar.yes exactly okay now inside the sidebar we have to now take it you have to accept it now how do we do that well it's something called props guys props right every component has props imagine like a parameters so if i do props in my case let's do console props again being consoled log very important aspect and so the log props props right there okay save that inspect them on the chat right here console okay see clear this out refresh it look at that now if i props look at that you see props the props has a room argument with an array that we passed 10. perfect boom boom so props stands for properties correct properties and those would be the properties of a specific component exactly so that is how you're able to pass in arguments parameters whatever language you've been used to before if you're not and just that's just how you pass in data from one place to another place yes exactly all right now this props has a actual room so we can use that attribute okay ready for this bro are you ready for this bro i am ready i hope you read this bro i'm watching okay now to loop through props just how we loop through data in here guys we will do the same thing for channels here's what we'll do i'm gonna create i'm gonna use a jsx functionality and we'll do props props the rooms the map to loop through it that map right and we'll say item that's for every single one room okay this is going to get us one room and this will return what this will return this channel so it's going to copy this channel boom and we'll paste the channel in here right there now so this returns one channel component one little channel style style component see that right there yep now how do we actually put the item data into here well it depends what data do we want from the item well the one that we want is the name oh so usually pretty much when you're trying to access an attribute of an object we're going to do the object dot the attribute name yes we'll use dot notation so as we'll do we'll use something like this we'll use like this and we'll do item dot name boom right there and now we can do let's kind of remove this channel right here boom boom boom what's going to happen now is it's going to loop through every single rooms object that we have in the database it's going to get grab that one object it's going to put that and create a new channel just like that how sick is that you ready for this bro i'm ready oh hold on oh my god sorry see if i heal too loud and look at this as i scroll down ready ready oh let's go this is how it's done guys are you still pumped with me guys 269 likes guys let's get to 300 300 300 likes right now i know you guys got this 300 likes come on let's go right now we just get did our first part with database you just entered my database guys you implemented a database how sick is that all right so moving forward right just to recap what happened here right we this this stuff right here is coming from a database directly react challenge and look at this if i now add one more let's do one more what what should we add now um do this one team nas and daniel team knowles and daniel [Laughter] team daniel daniel right there team nothing daniel save that look at that now that's satan here are you ready for this bro i have this do it oh let's go team nas and then because our application is now actually going to firebase getting the data and then putting it on the channels and because it's firebase guys it's real time so whenever you are whenever you are updating something in the database what's going to happen is this gets run again and this is why we have an update instantaneously i did not even have to refresh my page it's called real time database guys real time remember that important importante all right so we got that part two that we're going to create for today is how to now add a new channel so here's part two how to add a new channel yes from your slack yes add a new channel from slack clone because we saw we could go to firebase and add it there but that doesn't make sense yes yes yes yes yes yes yes something said isn't it due to the usefx statement no not necessarily guys the reason why we don't have to refresh is because this to be the collection is a real time is a web it's got a web hook actually it's called uh yeah and what's happening is that every time inside inside the snapshot right here every time the firebase gets updated it hits it hits this function no basically tells this function to run again and this runs again so that's how cool it is all right cool awesome to create a new channel we'll do a few things we have our sidebar let's now go to chat g uh where am i at inside the sidebar let's create a function called add channel let's do that let's do it so say const add channel is equal to the following okay add channels that's a function okay now so this function how do we end the channels that's the big question well are we gonna want to update the list um well yes but also need to call database as well because the database has the actual data not just the list that's inside of our application exactly so let's go ahead and do that so add channel and here we'll do the following we'll do db we'll well the first thing is we need to prompt the user for the channel so we'll say const prompt name prompt name is equal to prompt prompt and we'll call it enter channel name boom channel name right there okay now the console.log prompt name prompt name right there problem name because you ready for this bro yep so we can solo log prompt name now from there how do we actually call this function well we're going to want to call it whenever the user takes an action to add a channel where well i'm assuming it's a little plus sign right there you know it bro you know it you know it bro that's what i'm talking about so if we look at the plus where's our plus icon it's actually here and i cross second okay now for this first second to work here we'll do we can do an unclick function unclick and we're gonna do on click unclick equals and we simply call add channel this is the power off react js my friends okay i can call functions on the click of anything i want click anything i want i can do that so add channel save this and you're ready for this bro yeah oh and if i click okay so it's cancelled for now i will say inspect element because we're logging something yes as long as something plus oh okay oh this is our prompt we just put in you see so now we have the actual information and you have to access it exactly and you exactly know why now console.log is so important because it's a great way for us to test things exactly okay cool so we're prompting that okay let's go ahead and save that so after that we need to be able to save that in our database so we'll say if if channel if prompt name prompt name exists okay if it's not null if it actually exists if people suddenly put something in it db.collection and we'll say to get the rooms collection again instead of now doing on snapshot we will do the add and then the ad will give it an object and this object will be named what is it prompt aim all right so look db undefined okay why is it imported no it's not so we gotta do like this we'll say import db from now i need to import from database so we gotta go back like this and say firebase firebase boom boom right there the reason why we say this guys is becomes because cyber.js is inside the components you see this right here sidebar is here our firebase isn't is outside the components folder so this right here goes outside the components folder and goes into the firebase.js that's how that works beautiful all right we got that portion beautiful whew let's go got that portion now let's test it out a channel is being called test out this function okay uno dos stress you ready for this let's do it plus okay what should we call it uh we work we are cool we're pretty cool yeah we're pretty cool i'll say so quick okay go to firebase let's make sure it's actually down here and we're not lying to them hold on oh right right so now we have the ability to get the data from firebase and add data yes get us to 300 likes for that guys 294 likes come on guys you guys got this come on that's just six more likes i think i think this deserves six more let's deserve six more likes guys we're almost there like six more likes and we've already done so much like holy holy crap what oh wait 295 i was looking at the wrong 295 oh you're looking at mom 2.95 come on 289 and we are at 300 oh man you guys are epic cool all right so uh at this point on this one danielle holy crap oh come on bro you know that you know the drill [Laughter] every time we pause and that's what's the volume up we gotta dance i think this and every time it's like people are like pumped let's go we did it let's go i'm so freaking pumped oh it's amazing cool all right look at this so again the way this kind of works guys is i just want to kind of give you around on the way it works okay if i go ahead and do my text tool let's say we have uh let me go ahead and do force mode on so we have firebase in here firebase and we have our app in here right this is our app okay and what's going to happen is that let's say we have the new message new message okay or let's say new channel my bad new channel okay this is how that works so new channel is being added okay if i not do brush tool whenever you add a new channel guys that gives it to database firebase right this is why within firebase we see the actual channel the firebase tell the app that we have an update and an app then shows us view and the app then shows it to us on the view and this is the process and it's a continuous circle it's a continuous circle nonstop new channel new data updates a database database updates the app up updates the view boom voila and the reason we have firebase again is so that we could store this data for a long period of time because if you have a chat conversation or a new channel you don't want it to just disappear the next time you log in you want it to be there and remain there so you need to store it into a firebase database to do that persistent storage it's called persistent storage guys ah okay moving forward we are going to do the following thing let's work on the chat now this is the fun part the fun part guys now we work on the chat so let's go to app.gs okay at the gs okay actually let's go not to add the js let's go to chat.gs this is what we're working on from now from the let's point out all right chatterjee is going to have a few things so if we look at our app that we we are trying to build okay what do we have daniel well we have something that kind of gives the channel summary we have a header and i have a header right there a channel header okay what else do we have we have uh input right there and what else do we have inside here the text area the text area guys so you can see there's three components that we need to build guys kind of three components that we need to go ahead and build this one uh this one this one and this one that's it okay so let's do that inside our component it's going to create the container the container is going to contain everything inside the chat so it's a container let me close this out i don't need this anymore container and for this one for the container we'll close this out right here so that you don't have that good container import style because i'm going to use stock opponent so i'll say import styled from what from styled dash components yo nas check it out what we have another lovely person who just sent us five dollars we have you thank you so much we love the dancing pair that you have there it's trying to copyright dance moves look at that oh let's go guys if you guys copy our dance moves guys tag us on instagram that'll be sick how could that be huh yeah challenge with uh with some dancing huh that'd be fun thank you so much pete we greatly appreciate you and everyone else watching this yes so we have the container here somebody said check it in if you want to call the jacket container that's fine completely no problem okay let's go we'll use style components and we'll do const container as you guys know the drill now we do styled that div okay that's all okay inside the container what's going to happen well we have three components right first one is going to be what the first is going to be the the header so we'll say we'll give it the header section we'll go to the header section then underneath the header section what are we going to have the chat area the message we'll say the message container message container we'll say message container right there cool then i need the message container what are we going to have the input chat area yes we'll call it the chat input chat input right there boom okay chat input now okay now this message let's go ahead and comment this production now we don't need this just yet okay okay container now inside the header what's going to happen inside the ah no no no bad bad bad bad bad but this guy is right here my bad is inside it's after the header right here not bad oh yeah yeah because we want the container yes to give it styled uh component to everything yeah exactly so let me go ahead and put that back to here my bad side one you you need me to put this after the header or right there so you have the message container after the header and the chat input after message container so those three components just how we showed it before okay so i'm going to show it so you see boom right there this gonna be here this gonna be here this then this right here is gonna be this one comprende wait what's this area what let me go ahead hey let's go wait thank you close me yeah [Laughter] all right we got that portion uh let's go ahead and do now create it so we'll say const const header is equal to styled dot div dot diff boom okay nothing so far okay nothing so far then same because kits will say const message message container is equal to what styled dot just keep that in mind right it's it's a pattern you see the pattern here as part of the video developer guys you have to remember patterns patterns are very important to become a developer right this is the key always now we do have a question that was saying we seem to be putting all these style components after the export uh rd lewic is asking if this is a standard or if you could put it above the return function or where is the best place to put these so it's actually it's actually very good to put it underneath the export there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever because when javascript reads the file it reads the whole file the export just simply a way for like it allows the chat to be exported that's pretty much it but when javascript goes in and sees this header and knows this header is actually this of course of course so so i think it's cool putting on the bottom because it kind of separates your code out so you know everything after the export is going to be styled components and everything before it's going to be your actual component exactly correct correct so we have the message container now let's go do a chat input for now const chat input yeah so great question by the way if you have more of those questions keep on asking them because we want to give you guys as much value as possible beautiful start the day all right we got the header we've got the message container we've got the chat input no problem all right if you go to our react app of course there's nothing here guys as you know right if i go to header right there's pretty much nothing here so now to actually make those full things work um remember how i used grid before we're going to use grid here too check this out grid is going what's going to split it up into three rows three rows okay so look at this container and i will say display grid in here display grid okay boom display grid all right now to define three rows guys we're going to use grid template rosa rose grid templars so we'll say grid template rows like so and to define every row we give it a height a height for the tumblers the height for our first row so this is our first second and third row our first row height is going to be 64 pixels that's going to be the header 64 pixels our second row is actually going to be auto why because our second row was the message container right it's the massive containers with this portion and that's going to expand if the height if the slack is bigger the master creation is going to get bigger does that make sense that makes total sense yes exactly and then the third row the third row is going to be something called min content meaning meaning meaning this portion right here this third row is going to take up as much space as a minimum as it needs so if the height of this input box is this much that's going that's going to be the height of the row makes sense that makes sense good awesome good let's continue on so we got this portion let's go ahead and go to the header now and if we look at the header if i do background color for example background color what what gabriel just donated two euros telling us please dad bro are you serious bro dude i guess we're monkeys bro hold on bro just give him give it give we'll wait for the beat drop wait for the beat drop bro all right we'll wait for that for the beat back we're about to do we come here to code if we come here to dance bro gabriel we're here to code man but we'll do it so background thank you we'll say orange right there okay save that look at this you see we defined look at this bro see define the header right there see and now it's orange because we give it a temporary 64 pixel height voila and now our message container if we do that let's say uh let's see background color background we can say gray see because our message continued is auto and this is and our chat input is just mint content and because we don't have anything there right now that content is zero exactly so let's go ahead and remove this great icon we don't need this anymore at all we don't need this background orange instead inside the header we'll we'll create the content and what and what content do we have here you gotta do it for oh gabrielle oh my god it's funny we got donations today oh my god one day we'll get like a guys who could actually i'm curious if you guys give us a 20 donation we'll dance we just we did it for two bro we're bumping up the price we're bumping up the price for the donation bumping up the price 20 euros 20 euros a 20 dance 20 euros donation bro people are creating the channels look at this oh no you gave him the firebase thing ah they got us dude what are we going to do um let me see go back to what are they what are they doing oh no it's okay we'll stop they hacked us it's okay guys it's okay i'll stop it we'll stop it from from actually don't worry look at this if i go to client firestore now i can actually pause it for a second here you guys hack this yes so we'll do right now we'll do just read we'll do the forget the right for now nice i'll just read it so guys thank you i can't you can't read right for now that's funny though come on you guys that is funny not cool so you can't write anymore they got us hard man okay let's see this one now we know but now we know the now we know the guys don't do it just yet okay give us some time all right there you go delete document start delete all right we are cool how cool is this channel very cool channel delete delete delete all right that's it now you guys cannot oh my god that's funny bro well team nas daniel react challenge a little delete document oh you see how quick we work guys you guys think you're so smart but we can just hey really document here too and then dance right there really as well all right cool so let's go back to our that's it no more guys we still have one more lull that's okay that's fine that's fine that's fine so okay all right at this point at this point somebody said spam it guys don't spam it guys no need to spam guys no cool don't worry we blocked you so you can't spam anymore this is why i was ready for this actually i was partially ready for that honestly dude when you just dropped yeah the db stuff i was like i was like should we like block this out or what should we do here yeah yeah so channel so now let's go ahead and do this right let's create this section right here this section is going to be called channel okay and then and then this channel has two sections one is this section right here and then second section is this section right here details okay so say this one's gonna be channel section and then and after that we're gonna be channel details channel details right here one right there all right let's create a style that there for both of those so here we'll say channel const channel is equal to by the way guys if you actually are spamming if you're saying like spam we're gonna block you and you won't be able to watch this anymore just so you know okay i don't like that he doesn't like it nobody likes it it only makes it works for everybody so if you say bad stuff if you spam i'm not even gonna be sad about it i'm just gonna block you i'm gonna throw you out guys we want productive conversations things are going to move people forward not things that are going to hold everyone else back and distract people so guys keep it clean keep it positive motivate others motivate yourself let's be productive yeah so channel now is the channel details so const channel details right there is also going to be style that do is equal to styled that div right there okay good it's not the div awesome after that after that is what's going to happen okay if i go to here now nothing is there of course no problem that's okay now inside the channel it's gonna be two things one's gonna be the channel name channel name channel info that's going to be that this box right here this company one announcement it's kind of information about the channel itself so we'll say then we'll say channel info boom right there channel info now none of those are available so let's create those right now so enhanced channel name is equal to style.div okay and then const channel info is equal to what styled that div as well boom boom done now hashtag clever is there for the channel info we'll go we'll do this one now so we'll accompany with announcements so you guys can place that into yourself as well so do company with announcements all right booed and you can see there's nothing interesting or crazy that's in here okay that not the most important thing but what's going to happen is that we now can actually modify and modify the styling of this right so let's think about now the channel the channel itself okay the channel itself the channel name will give it a font weight of of what or font weight of 700. yeah something big something that's noticeable exactly so font weight want weight of 700 so that's the weight of of uh what's it called found by 700 okay cool all right refresh this good it's almost 700 now for the channel info let's change it up as well and for this one we'll give it a font width of 400 right there font weight of 400 okay good okay and then we'll say give it a different color we'll definitely we'll give it give it a color of the following it's gonna be six zero six zero six zero this is a very lightweight like gray right there guys you see and we're going to make a fun side we're going to make a smaller font size with a font size of 13 pixels okay and then we'll do margin top desktop and that's going to be what 8 pixels right okay look at this right there see now that's there that's there now all good right but here's the problem but here's the problem right now we need to add some spacing here and here and how do we do that margin and padding hey now should we use module should we use padding it's a good question i think we're going to use padding on this one because we would want the header to cover the entire top yes exactly so let's go ahead and use padding in our case we're adding the header section you see this header section so let's do this we'll give it a padding left inside the header where's the header right there see this header we'll give it a padding left so go to the header we'll say padding left and we'll give it 20 pixels right there done you see now good next up let's give this one also a penny right of 20 pixels as well padding right 20 pixels now because we know the header is 64 pixels height we need to center it now now how do we do that check this out i will use display flex display flex right so flex okay and inside here display flex of course now it's kind of like right it's still fine no problem display flex oop i want that display flex all still good now in display flex of the header i will give it how do i align it vertically centered tell me i think we've done this a couple times uhhuh was this the grid yeah huh it was a great no actually it's not the good news not the grid no because flex is what left to right right no flax is just oh align items there we go there's so many alignment things man it's it's hard to keep it on top of mind line items items center right there save that right there and look at that now it's centered boom right there boom okay one more thing let's add a small border below right here so here's what we'll do we'll do border bottom so say border dash bottom you say border dash bottom okay and in our case we'll say border bottom and here's we'll do one pixel solid and this is going to be our color or right there guys on pixel solid that's going to be our color boom okay cool we got that portion that's awesome oh let's go look at this bro you see this bro holy whoa yeah let's clean it up exactly mr clean yes exactly so now we've got this portion that's next up work on this details portion right there all right that's going to be the child details in here the channel details are going to have a few things the first thing is going to be a deal for details so we'll say here a div right so say details for now then we're gonna have an icon the info icon you're ready for this bro yeah info icon now how do we get this icon material do you i i yo you are yes yes any cool icon you could probably go to material ui and find it guys okay let's do it we'll tell you why icon guys we are currently at 322 likes help us out let's defeat this youtube algorithm and just tell us how what i just like he said like yo we're going to war with this youtube algorithm guys we need your likes to beat it always because i mean i guess i mean think about it right how else are we supposed to spread out spread our knowledge right our knowledge and positivity why did frankie bring this here i don't know frankie this is your fault why are you doing this thank you father frankie's making us fat uhhuh always but we still love him so so look okay let's show you live i'll tell you i what's going to happen is let's go ahead and search up for info you see i have this field we have info outlined right here i can click info outline this gives me the code i will copy this code now paste this code in here done and now i can use it now check this out if i go back to my app let's use the info outline icon close this part out actually i can still use it no problem inside here i will say how do you guys remember how we do this we'll say what info outlined icon right there close this out and look if i save this oh let's go you see right here so good yes yes we win yes but they are currently aligned how bad bad one on top of each other to prevent that what we need to do guys is if you go to channel details look at this channel details right in order to do that what do you guys in the comments guys what do you guys think we should do here guys to to make a line kind of like one after the other one after the other how do we do that i think we have to flex on them no don't give the frankie this is good oh my god it's his fault for being here now it's time we're over here eating all the frankie snacks thank you yes actually i'll be great display flex okay and look at this now look at this no it's now it's from left to right you see that right there okay good next up how do we go ahead and line them vertically centered well we just did that and not quizzed me so i remember align items hey let's go right there center center oh look at that see beautiful now okay one more thing here's another test for you bro one more test okay no more test please yes yes test okay okay how do we put this all the way on the right hand side uh i remember we did something with absolute position and relative position no that's not right all right well we did that before but i guess we're not going to do that [Laughter] we also did something with grids no it's not right so here's what we'll do we'll go we will go to go ahead in order we'll go to header and we will actually use justify content to push these away from each other you see the header is this whole thing you see and i can actually push these components away from each other by doing by doing something called justify content space between justify content content space between boom oh you see that beautiful as always as always now one more thing i have for you bro how do we change yo you said the last one was the last test bro [Laughter] how do we change the color of this color color we just changed the color guys i like how it says position says absolute positioning not necessarily guys so let's go ahead and change the color of this thank you so thank you frankie we love you so to change the color of this we'll go to channel details in here and we'll give it this color right here right there boom save that look at that now this color is a channel color right there and same as goes for which color same goes for that actually icon color but here's my issue bro you know my issue is what's your issue bro but here she has this these details icon are very close to each other should we add some spacing in between wow um can we add some padding we can add some padding you can also add some margin but the problem is that you see this icon is an icon how do i add marge to this icon pay attention really closely what i'm doing about do here i'm going to create a new component called info okay info right there okay then with this component i will go down and i'm going to say the following i will say here const info pay attention is equal to styled but not style.div instead it's styled info outlined component instead i'm saying it's styled this icon right here what's gonna happen is this basically imports the icon itself and i can apply css style to that icon individually so all the previous stylings that it had before you can build upon those exactly so i'll can anna do something like for example margin right i can say margin right uh margin left actually and i can give the margin left off 10 pixels oh right there and look at this now i know there's two icons now i know no no no but if i remove this one the original one boom save that boom right there and this icon now has inspect element look at this this icon now has this icon has all the previous stuff plus margin left 10 pixels boom right there see right there maps too boom you want to create beautiful cs you want to create beautiful style components these are the things that you need to learn yeah something ask wanna add the details we can also add the details that's your that's up to you guys i decided because i wanted to show you how style components work i decided to do it this way that was just the only issue but you can also edit the details it was more for learning purposes more for learning purposes exactly now we have details we have this and this looks pretty good i would say so it looks amazing it's amazing okay cool next up next up is going to be what wow um let's go it's gonna be this one right here hmm okay are you ready bro let's do it okay okay now for the chat the message container not necessarily the most important thing let's go ahead and do the chat input for this chat input though i'm not going to use the style components guys instead of that instead i'm going to create its own component because it's going to have a lot of functionality within it okay okay so let's do this inside of components let's components call a new file and we'll call it chat input dot gs right there jump with the js okay let's do rfc to create the component rfc rfc is a shortcut shortcut right there okay we create a component save that component let's go back to our where was it chat back to our chat let's import that chat input so i'll say import import right there oh that's nice i want that import chat input input input and put from and we'll say chat input right there there because this directly comes from where input right there see okay now we're gonna replace this with chat input boom right there okay we can now remove this one right here we don't need this anymore okay okay and now we have this an input now inside this one let's go to login up not just input yep and we'll say chat input if i save this go to react oh let's go now that is here you see that right there you want to add a little background to that so we could see of course bro because now now that we actually have something the min with container let's call this a container right there container let's import style for style components you guys know the drill at this point you know the drill oh from style dash components boom okay go ahead style components that's awesome that's awesome oh okay stock opponents oh my god what if i make my thing style components okay i'm gonna go to const container is equal to styled what that div and that's gonna be background oh dude oh come on this music is too addicting bro i know man who picked this music i have no idea dude i need to get one of these soundboards from my room so just like i wake up just yeah i agree so look at that orange just right there see right there so i just want to clarify again because na showed us a really cool attribute which is called the min content so this is going to change on how much content you have in there so if you were to make the text bigger or smaller if you were to add more things this height is going to keep adjusting to the minimum amount height needed to cover all the content inside of this exactly yes yeah exactly that is a really good explanation yes daniel that's correct thank you thank you okay inside the chat input what are we going to create a few things guys well the first one we're going to create is going to be the input container which is going to be this input container that uh kind of like uh encapsulates the whole form for the message make sense all right all right let's go ahead and do this so we'll say okay let's create our new style component called input container input container right there okay good all right inside this input container this whole thing is actually gonna be a form so we'll say form form and we're gonna make this in form knots why the reason why we're going to make this a form is because a form allows us gives a functionality to where when we hit the enter button on here on the keyboard guys right it will actually allow us to call a function on the submit of the form right otherwise we have to add some extra functionality if we don't use a form but if we use a form then when we enter when we hit enter enter enter when we enter when we hit enter we can simply call it function and then do whatever you want make sense i love it that makes total sense because you're typing a message and when you click the button you want it to send that message so form simplifies i'll create an input call input type text right there okay and then we'll make a placeholder placeholder is equal to message here message here dot dot dot phone right there god this this music is way too good bro oh message here okay and after that what's going to happen is inside the form let's create a button called the send button right the send button is going to be this button right here this button right here guys okay so do that will they say send button send button bouton right there don't that's gonna send button inside the same button we need to go ahead and get this logo the send logo yeah let's get it from material ui ui let's go so send okay somewhat there send outline do we also send field which one should we use this one or this one i like the filled one i like the fill in two right okay let's use the send send field right there so we'll say send okay let's import that into our code boom sends to icon and we'll do inside here we'll simply say send send it send it oh come on remember that that was a joke for a long time dude yeah send it bro yeah so sendai can now of course we none of this stuff is defined so it's defined right now so here we'll say const what const up input container container implication is equal to style.div oh boom okay good style of div okay all right next up is gonna be uh like a horse so let's go send button send button is equal to what send button is equal to style that do style div right there okay exactly also as well not the most again not the most important thing okay guys here okay so that's gonna be the same button and then at that point that's pretty much it for now let's go ahead and remove this refresh this oh look at this how beautiful is this huh bro and and again just reinforcing what we talked about the main content before if you're just adding things it's going to keep adjusting yes it's going to keep it beautiful beautiful the height this height adjusts right this height will always adjust as well depending on how the height of this that's why this is called auto auto on the show real quick you just kind of just want to like bring it down so if i go to chad yes right there this auto and then so what happens if you start to kind of minimize this window up and down will this just shrink yeah so so if i go to here let me see boom see this right here so that that one has 64 pic the header 64 pixels constant yes content it's always gonna be 64 pixels yes the middle is auto so that one can adjust yes and then the bottom part is min height so it's always going to cover the minimum amount of area that needs to encapsulate everything yes dope makes total makes no sense no again this is important because this makes things mobile friendly right very well friendly this allows you to now have small screens big screens and it's available to be out there so that's why i just wanted to reemphasize this point always guys we got 352 likes let's get to 400 let's go hey guys if we get to 400 likes we'll dance for you but what we said 20 donations bro we get 400 likes how about that all right 400 likes 400 likes so everybody if you want to see some dancing guys let's get to 400 likes and we'll do some dancing how about that like even invite your friends to like it yes send the link out tell them yo just like this video real quick you only have to watch it just like it and we need to beat the youtube algorithm mmhmm okay and book a container so that's so good now let's go and send style it sell our input container which is basically the former here okay okay a few things first okay a few things first this container back on orange you see how in our actual app it floats you see how it floats see the bottom here because it has a padding guys because it has a padding so we'll do this we'll do here padding left heading left 20 pixels pending right 20 pixels okay and then finally petting bottom cutting bottom is going to be what patting bottom 24 pixels right there so if i say you see this now just move that right there see so back on orange let me go put this back here boom now you see because it created a padding for all these different components right here that's within the input within the container so the input container now is going to be kind of like padded right here you see you make sense cool awesome up next so that's all good on the input container let's go ahead and do this the input container has a few things well the apple container guys has a border you see this border around it let's make that border so we'll say border here we'll say border okay and we'll give a border of one pixel solid and here's the color guys check out this color it's a cool color hashtag this that's the color we'll use now let's go back to here hey we have ourselves a border now it looks hideous right now right now but but but we need to get some nice curves oh we like curves curves you like curves yes smooth as they like to say smooth so to add curves we'll say border radius radius and here we'll do border radius of four pixels oh smooth look at that so smooth all right cool up next let's now edit the form this form contains the input right if we think about this the input which is this one and the icon which is this one and they're currently kind of on top of each other and how do we make them from left to right now instead of that display flex let's go so we'll say now to target the form as we'll do we'll say form inside the input container and we'll give a display flex 37 by the way display flex perhaps no let's go let's get to guys whatever you do do not share this video no share this video reverse psychology bro oh do not share this video with a friend so do not get the url on top and text it to a friend and tell them to like it do not oh my god bro okay so let's give it a height of 42 pixels so that we have 40 pixels that's amazing and look i see now we're here look at this the send button is here the input is here okay great now from left to right that's all beautiful now let's go ahead and do the following let's now align them center so i want to i want this button to be centered vertically make sense how do i do that guys in the comments well we do it by align items and by the way we did get a question i think would be good to address by rd and he says i notice that you spend a lot of time on ui design is this a standard compared to back end code what do you mean by that say one time uh he notices that we're spending a lot of time with the ui design is this standard compared to like spending the time with the back end stuff and the back end code notice you spent a lot of time in your design is this standard compared to back end code um and backing code you don't work on your design much no no i think you're just saying like tam time allocation and to answer that question it's going to be it depends because in this case we don't have a very complicated back end we're just going to be storing the channel names along with some of the text or the the specific things that people are chatting with correct so it's not gonna be too complicated but we're spending a lot of focus on the ui design because again this is gonna be very cool to make very attractive and show because we want to show how you use react js exactly i want to show just how cool programming is in general it's like magic guys it's like you're an inventor like he's an inventor i'm an inventor i got this idea i can put it into use you have an idea you can put it into use and that's like you know i don't have to know anything crazy i don't have to know how to saw things or how to you know wire things no i just need to know how to type on a keyboard that's the really cool part about this all right yeah and to add to that there might be a very complicated project that does need a lot of attention in the back end so sometimes maybe they bring on the team of people where someone works on the back end some work on the front end it's very integrated it's just gonna depend on the project to answer your question always always so now let's do this guys okay now for this portion okay a few things let's give it a padding left because here's the thing how do we go ahead and push this input more from the left hand side yes so we'll padding left panning left we'll do 10 pixels done okay good all right now let's go ahead and make this input actually a width of 100 how do we do that guys how do we push the send button all the way to the end right here and make this input the whole thing how do you do that what do you think what do you think how do that what do you think i don't know you tell me what do you think you tell me what do you say i know you tell me bro what do you think i know here's what i know well we we're going to target now the input let's talk at the input and the cool thing about flex guys is that you can tell flags the importance of something so for example for the input i can say flex one right here look at this boom you see that right there now the input here guys the input right here let me go ahead and show it to you guys so you guys can see it maybe this little bit better now this input right here boom right there see it has a flux of one meaning this input is the most important part in this section meaning it's going to take up as much width as it possibly can that's how you say flex one okay if i set flag 0.5 okay for example see it's gonna take up zero point five if i say flex one it's gonna take up as much as it can what do you do 0.75 0.75 cool right that's pretty cool flex one right there awesome so we got that portion that's all good let's now go ahead and do the following let's remove this hideous border from this input so we'll say border border is none boom done save that boom now see the border is gone beautiful it's gone yeah next up let's go ahead and do a let's change the font size so say font size font size 13 pixels oh right there so look at this now now look at that i can type now guys holy beautiful holy isn't my macaroni okay what oh come on bro i don't know what came out of your mouth i don't know either sometimes but sometimes you can have fun you know yeah cool so we have that portion that's so good okay next up from that point on what we are going to do you see how when i in focus on this you see how the focus outline is like uh blue i want to remove that blue okay let's remove that blue right here to remove that blue is we do input focus input focus focus focus focus focus in in here we see the pharmacy outline none save that boom and if i focus now oh you see no more blue outline you see that right there now it's beautiful now it's very beautiful guys it's very beautiful now okay the last part that we have to do guys is this portion is the this send button right here it was a one before last is this send button right here are you excited for this bro i'm super excited are you excited for this guys let's make the send button by the way we are almost at 400 likes guys come on 400 likes come on in the world and we'll do a dance come on 400 likes let's go all right so we're 384 okay let's get the following we got this let's work on the send button the send button is right here okay here's our staff assign button let's go ahead and do the following so we'll say const send button let's give it some stuff the send button itself guys is a container it's a div right here okay it's a diff now this div is going to have a background color of green and this is the color color it's going to have so this one right here oh this is the back of color it's going to have boom right there you see that right there bro you see that bro i see it i see it oh see clearly it looks weird but i see it i know unless we're weird but we can change it how how but look at this we can the first things first is let's go ahead and make it a nice lean round okay so we'll say border radius make it smooth we'll say border radius two pixels so border radius radius ds is equal to two pixels and look at this i'm gonna zoom in on here for a second zoom in horrible let's call the radius rios rios right there save that boom oh you see border radius now it still does not look that good because of course you know it's like weird and so forth let's give the width and height let's give it a width what you see how guys as we are doing this stuff css is what makes it so easy for us to do this kind of stuff right we're just modifying it with css and then it just shows it up on the view which is a really cool part 32 pixels and again with css a lot of has to do with just practice practice practice and just testing things out and see how they will work out that's pretty much it width height of 30 pixels height of 32 pixels okay good 32 pixels okay now now it's going to be a little bit better would you group me down a little bit yeah just sit down just attack all right now let's make this button centered what did we do bro um well first we got to center vertically and then what and then we got to center it horizontally beautiful but before we do that what do we have to say we have to say uh line items maybe okay and then then and then um and then uh grid and then just display flex guys display flex so we'll say here display display flex okay okay to make sure to this it's a flex content once i make it flex content i can do things like justify content to align it horizontally just remember that right so center i can do now align item center align items to line how vertically bro vertically now look at this oh you see that's beautiful now won't you say so beautiful yes a lot of people saying display facts that's amazing cool we got that portion let's now make this the following let's uh add some margin to the right here sideways so how do we now here's my question to you how do we push this how do we push this whole div from the right hand side we got some margin beautiful yes margin right right what eight pixels five pixels five pixels oh see it skin you see but given this space we're already starting to make it look so much better okay amazing beautiful next up let's go ahead and make it a cursor pointer so cursor point to make sure like as we hover it becomes like a hand cursor pointer boom save that and you see how as i hold it and that becomes the hand you see that right there that's a hand now you click it now it's like a button it feels like it's a button now next up let's give it a the following let's change the width of this actual uh what is this called icon icon to do that i will inspect element and you can see that this icon has a class of look at this mi svg icon root this icon i will target that class by the following i will say here dot entergy root and here's what i'll do now i'll say width width let me say this width guys off 18 pixels now it's smaller boom see now it's smaller right now okay so we got that however how to change the color of the initial icon actual icon um would we have to go to the icon css and add a color thing yes we have to now create our own style component with the icon just how did the last time so here's what we'll do we'll do send right there just did the last time send boom boom save send right here good we got that portion all right let's create send send right here so we'll say const const send is equal to styled what that div boom right there style that dip okay style that dip you see that bro yep cool start the dip uh but actually not stop the div but actually style the icon look at this you have to pass the icon yeah the sand icon wait are we 400 oh 3900 3.99 bro hey let's go we're at 400 likes that is what i'm talking about guys that's amazing so i know all right they paid us to dance dude i've never been a paid professional dancer before so i appreciate you guys giving me the opportunity to make two euros for dancing we've always paid goals in the office we always paid to dance but now you know yeah yeah yeah wrong game maybe maybe maybe maybe that's yeah we should start a youtube channel nas and daniel dancing exactly okay stylus and icon let's make this a thousand icon let's make that guys um right here and we'll make that what let's not change the color the color now this icon is going to be the following boom boom done oh it looks better yeah now let's remove this sand icon boom save that boom look at how cool this looks guys just by small change but are you ready bro oh wait we got a quick question about what just happened here um besides style.div and style passing in a parameter which would be like the icons what are some other styles like style.button or things that we could do with compression styling but there are some other things that we could do uh rd louis i keep saying lui it's like luke or luck i don't know how to pronounce that sorry correctly shown it you can do style that button there's basically any element you have an html div spin p tag right h1 tag anything so if you so as long as it's an h um a html element you can do it so for example here so we've been doing div because if you remember nas has been adding it to containers yes containers or divs or at least he's been making containers i'm going to start the span i can do style.div right i can do a styled.p i'm going to style that button pretty much anything right as long as it is an html element that is that is the only requirement make sense yup okay good do it cool hope that answered your question man keep asking those great questions that's actually a good question yes okay he has some good questions these great questions yeah cool so now we have the message here that's amazing we have our thing here okay but i want to have a ad hover state so when when i hover over this i want to have it be like a it's a it's a more you know it's it's more pleasant you know what i mean like you want to be more pleasant right so here's what we'll do on the hover on the hover off what on the hover off the send button we'll change the background color to this save that and look at this now are you ready for this bro vermont oh oh that's so good it's so good though right it's so satisfying that when something changes that makes you know like okay i'm about to click on this make sense cool okay the user experience exactly user experience exactly so we got that portion that's amazing let's go ahead and uh i don't want that oh i don't want that good so we got that portion that's so good and pretty much at this point guys we're done we're done look at this we're done with this we're done with this what do you do now do we do now um now oh my god that was improvised we just we're done so we have to dance okay good um a few things guys uh dance smash the like button exactly smash that like button destroy the like button as you like to say guys break it yes break it if you have to um the next thing i want to focus on is actually going to be this portion look at this let me kind of change this up i want to cut i want to crest to create this portion right here right now okay this is called the message okay i know we're at this point we're almost to two hours and we'll be able to finish this in about what about next 10 minutes okay yep so this is a little bit bonus guys we weren't sure we're gonna get into this today but it looks like we're at a good pace looks like everyone's still engaging yes so we're gonna dive into this part because this is gonna build on tomorrow's activity exactly so i'll do that right now okay first things first in our app okay what do we need to do which one is our do we just build this one this one i think is this one right yes this one yeah yeah this one cool all right um inside now let's go back to chat yes and we have this message container which is all great no problem okay inside of my secretary let's create an individual message so we'll have an individual message let's go ahead and do this and we'll say message okay right there message and you can see it appears here correct yes first here well let's actually create a message component because every single message that you see here for example i always have to expand this one you see everything message is its own message component this is where components are going to be so useful because we're going to reuse that portion okay so similar to what we did with the channels before we just have a component for a message and then we can just put in whatever data we want and use it all over there exactly so let's go inside the components let's create a chat message so components new file by the way guys let's get to 500 likes and we'll dance again so chat message dot js yes let's do rfce right there right there save that chat message okay save that oh good we have the component for the chat message let's go check the gs and let's import the component in here so we'll say here import chat message from where from what from where oh we just created the chat message message exactly okay now let's use that chat message so we'll use that right here chat message chat message boom right there you see chat message the chat message now is going to be this component let's go and say type this out chat message component save that and boom like this you see chat message component is now in here guys hopefully you understand that okay cool all right let's now work on the chat message if java is going to have a few things the first is the first thing is always going to be the container container okay container okay cool container is all good okay now not defined no problem let's go ahead import style components you know the drill so import styled from what from what bro from style components dash components okay from style components okay that's okay that's all good and let's now do const what container is equal to what styled what that div and that's it style.diff makes sense okay okay cool so let's give it a background color for now let's get the background color of for example background let's give the orange background background okay for now orange okay there we go now you have was one chat message right here comprende beautiful beautiful very beautiful okay all right so so here's the thing what do we do now the container is now going to have a few things well the first it's going to have is the avatar right so if i go on my slack clone which is my built one we have the avatar and we have the the name and so forth so let's do this right now so let's go ahead and uh create the avatar so we'll say here we'll click on call for avatar so user avatar avatar okay good save that inside the avatar it will have the image so we'll say image image source is equal to something and that's going to be image source for now again don't worry about that user avatar and don't worry about just yet after that we'll have the actual message content so we have message content content right there and this message content is going to have a few things the first thing is going to have is just a name name right which is going to be what you think about this what do we have this name and then the actual text which is this portion right here under the name is going to be the text text boom right there name let's say for example thank you so much monitor we appreciate the live i love you amanda shout out to monitor he's one of the guys in the back end yeah we don't see his face sometimes but you see all of his work because guys he puts in so much work into clever programmers i just want to give him that shout out guys the reason why a lot of you guys are even like for example here and how you get notifications kind of for you know he's posting the homework right between all that between notifications this guy is doing so much together with david and just the whole team you know jesse and sheila and everybody like and frankie of course i mean if i don't name it it's pretty much everybody they're all working so hard so make sure the guys just say thank you to the cp team down below in the comments i really appreciate that because you know yes we're on the front here and you guys see our faces but behind the scenes there's a lot that's going on this is the reason why we're able to put out so much and do so much in terms of challenge and and be able to handle everybody right otherwise if we're just one person that just then we can it's really hard right you need the team to be able to do this yes so just say thank you love you guys i love everybody on the team they're the best team in the world so um yeah cool so let's go ahead rafikaze for now let's do rafi rafikaze right here for the text let's go ahead and do uh okay how's the challenge okay this challenge this is the best challenge best challenge right there cool so cool when you go to here of course a lot of these things is not as not defined which is no problem let's go ahead and define this so we'll say here we'll say user avatar const user avatar is equal to what style.div okay style. okay user avatar and now inside that we'll go ahead and do the folder right we'll say what message content let's go ahead and do messages like const message content message content ah put that to the top so you guys can see it message content is equal to also dot div style okay then after that we need to go ahead and create the name now inside here i can actually do a span right you can actually do a span like this check this out guys let's do you know how we did message that like name div i can just i could use const name ezekiel 2 styled dot span just for a change of you know just for small change okay and same thing is going to go for text const text is equal to styled dot span that's it okay saw that span okay all good next uh no just text right there this text okay so we got the user avatar we got the span okay uh okay thank god it's not broken okay so now we have the container uh don't worry about that though no guys don't worry about that all right let's make this a little bit smaller so we can watch what we're doing i'm gonna make just a little bit less okay cool all right this is the best challenge right here name and so forth all right for this to work now let's go ahead and add an image what's an is you ready for this add an image we can actually generate in a get a random a random look at this a random random user look at this guys random views generator this will generate aw user for example this is new new new new doesn't matter right so general and abuser this is funny holy moly hey cafe rossi cafe rossi hector byron amanda i'm going to use this amanda she's amanda here helping me address hopefully i hope this hobby is not a real name i don't know i really don't know but she looks like amanda i don't know why [Laughter] sorry man i mean it's out there you know so what can we say image source okay command v and that's going to be the person right here see that's image source to jpeg so if we save this okay amanda's right there okay cool that's amanda right there amanda is now very popular at this point that's funny now with this specific portion a few things are going to happen we need to make the user avatar kind of a certain width and height does that make sense so user avatar let's do this we'll say here here it's going to be width width is going to be what weight is going to be 36 pixels and height is also going to be 36 pixels boom now i know amanda is not fit the box unfortunately but why well there's a few reasons why is because the image actually is still overflowing right if i inspect element you can see here that amanda yeah this is the div you see but the amanda's overflowing so here's what we do inside the user avatar i say image now and i say look at this width of a hundred percent save that boom right there you see right there beautiful beautiful okay let's add a small border is we'll do border radius here border radius radius radius ah radius off let's say two pixels save that and now now amanda here does not have you see if i if i zoom in there's really no like curvature curve right now smooth no smooth so here's what we'll do to prevent that we'll do overflow hidden one right there over nice by the right or flow hidden save that and look at that now amanda you see that has a curve you see that right there there's a curve right there that's good right here clean yeah reason why is because unless it's overflow hidden then basically then the the edges guys the edges are kind of outside the container and so you need to say no if they're outside if they're overflowing then hide them and that's what makes the curvature okay cool all right we got that portion now let's go ahead and move all this stuff together into its own little thing so for the container number one i want to do is i want to remove this background it looks hideous okay the first thing i want to do is i want to add some padding so oh we just got another five dollar donation by oh c i t solutions he said you guys rock keep making some great work love you guys easy it solutions thank you so much for that donation we greatly appreciate you guys what two hours in they're still here guys thank you so much for that that means so much yeah that means a lot that really doesn't matter let's go to c what does it say thanks thanks asks oh my god that's funny cool so let's do this we'll do padding okay we'll do 8 pixels 8 pixels comma 20 pixels now what does this mean 8 20 pixels this means that eight pixels is actually vertical padding 20 places is horizontal padding so basically mean left and right this is a shortcut you got a shortcut you want to you want to learn right this is a vertical top and bottom this is left and right second number so we'll do 20 pixels here 20 pixels here eight pixels here episodes here understandable beautiful beautiful okay next up so you see how we have the user avatar on the left hand side and the rafikanzi stuff is in the bottom but we want to make it from left to right so here's what we can do i can say in the container i can do what to make that work yes you got this people somebody's like i can watch this all night holy that's awesome thank you so we'll say display flex here okay and look at this oh you see that the rafikaze is now here and then from left to right beautiful okay now from that point on his will do from this point on let's think a little bit about um the message content this is the message this is the content right there this needs to go where below rafakaze correct it needs to go here so to do that let's go to message content we'll make it also display flex and guys in the comments how do we make it kind of go from top to bottom pretty simple display flex okay okay you see it's still not from top to bottom what do we do in that case tell me well we do what we do flex direction flex direction to change the direction of the flow flex direction is going to be now column oh you see that beautiful little by little we are changing this up you see that that's awesome bro cool next up let's do the following and under office kaza you see how we also in here we have like this date portion right here let's change this let's actually copy this date okay cop this date let's put it into a span right here um boom right there from left to right boom right there so now if i go ahead and do this oh yes all right let's now let a little bit a little bit of margin so for the avatar so the user avatar will do margin right to push everything to the right so margin right right we'll make it what my margin by 8 pixels that pushes everything to the right beautiful okay beautiful next up let's focus on what the name itself so the name the name itself is gonna be font weight font weight of what of 900 okay save that so this is all 900 now all good but don't worry about it we'll change the the span right here to now change up this span inside this span we'll say span and we'll make that spin what font weight weight of let's say 400 right there see and let's now change the color of this we'll do the color of this pan to be what to be this one actually ccc no not cc bro i like cc this one right here 97 right there without the one you don't need that actually rgb 97 right there i did 7 97 look at that see right there boom right there beautiful okay awesome now let's go ahead and change the the font size of this we'll say font size font size font size is going to be what 15 pixels okay it's a little bit smaller that's it that's all it's all that's all we're looking for okay let's give this a bigger line height so we'll say line height line height of 1.4 just to make it a little bit bigger okay just to add some space into it you see what i mean it's looking gorgeous it looks beautiful bro it looks amazing who made this who made this mask bro but apparently we did made it okay awesome next step because you can see how you see now this image is above and then this is kind of below so this image and this text is not centered you see that bro this is kind of more above this component i see so how do we make it centered line items oh let's go oh this guy knows what he's doing i'm learning guys line items sorry center oh look at that see now this image is centered beautiful beautiful all right cool now let's focus on this the text portion the text portion is pretty much this is the best challenge lasa adds a little margin to the span so we'll do span i will do here we'll do margin right let's also do eight pixels eight pixels like so oh my boom there might be eight pixels let's save that and does not change here for some reason um nice for the right maybe a padding let's see margin left let's do marginal nothing here margin dash left let's do eight pixels here okay margie left eight pixels on this one that creates that beautiful this is the best challenge and look at this now this looks very much similar to that okay i think the the margin right that is the whole span so cool we got that portion look at that now we have this let's change up the font size of the text a little bit maybe of this span so we'll say font size here font size here maybe let's make that 13 pixels just make it a little bit smaller and that's it look at this that's it we now have our first chat look at that look at this bro guys we have done it we are almost at 430 likes let's get to 450 likes we've done what we need to do force part two of the slack clone now at this point guys who's ready for some homework oh my god homework time all right we've done so much guys and you know what's so funny i'm so glad that we went ahead and we we canceled this part out dude it'd be bad now next time you have to be careful with that stuff well be careful yes so at this point guys look at this ah okay we completed this now it's firebase we got this we have the chat for your homework that's the following okay i'm gonna do text okay homework time homework okay okay for part one i want you the following why so complete day two complete part two complete part two part two of the slack clone right so of course make sure that up to date okay for number two i want you add a hover effect effect two okay perfect exactly add a hover effect to checked to the message itself okay right part three i want you the following i want you guys to go ahead and customize customize how the chat looks fire looks by yourself drop a fire if you're gonna customize yours so exactly okay and if you can this is a bonus guys if you can for part four add additional no buttons for the send message section what do i mean by that let me show you what i mean with that okay so the first things first is let me show you what i mean by the hover effect you see when i hover over this you see how it has this gray section when i hover this i want you guys to be able to have this hover effect that's part one okay so a clue might be very similar to the green button exactly kind of how i have that green button hover effect right here same thing correct okay that's part one okay part two what do we say part two is add ah so that's part two i don't have a fact part three classifies how the chat looks by yourself so maybe you wanna maybe customize this chat right maybe you wanna customize this uh the chat for you know this chat window maybe you wanna be different color who knows make it your own guys okay make it your own make it make it customizable that's always so much fun than just having to be playing know what i mean that's part one part part four part four add additional buttons for the second message section so what do i mean by that here's the thing if you look at slack okay let's look at slack guys images okay slack at the bottom look at this at the bottom at the bottom here you see how uh you see how at the bottom right here let me show it to you you see how at the bottom right here you we have all of these all these icons if you guys can this is a bonus if you can i highly recommend that you add these icons right here how they're gonna get these outcomes right here you see the bottom these are icons you can add the a icon this icon this icon this icon it is up to you i know we currently have the same button only here but that's okay you can make it your own how does that again this is your application you would customize it whatever you want however you want whichever way you want okay so we got that portion guys okay we can elaborate on number three number three customize how the chat looks by yourself so for example maybe you want to go ahead and customize the background if i do inspect element on the chat itself let's do chat okay maybe i want to change the chat color to be a background color background let's see gray who knows right whatever you want to do right maybe you want to be dark or black who knows right customize the chat section the chat section is which section it is this section right here oh wait right here i wasn't showing you guys so my bad so when i say class of the chat i'm saying look at this guys do background let's say here background black for example or maybe it's gray right but make it look nice okay maybe look nice customize however however this portion looks okay customize that and that's it so just this section right here makes sense cool all right we got that so before i move on guys go ahead and please please go ahead and screenshot this right now just right now so you guys have the homework all right squeeze this right now and again of course we'll put make the facebook post and uh and the homework post for you guys you still have enjoyed the challenge what are you doing click the link below join the challenge so that you can see

so i know yeah there's one more for this guys please if you guys can this would be really cool guys for you make this section right here this section the bottom you see b i this right here just how we did this section right here i recommend you try to implement that as well so again this might require some customization on your part i recommend you you try it if you can no problem it's a bonus right it's just a bonus okay but customize the section for where you have the chat right and then the other stuff other things that's pretty much it for the homework guys if you have any questions let

drop it drop a little drop a drop i'm going to let amanda that was like oh let's dance let's go what is that song i have no idea what the song dude someone just posted it's called the sound by duck ma what is it let me see deadline for the homework good question deadline for the homework guys it's going to be at the end of this challenge so you guys go ahead and do the homeworks right but the whole home we're going to be in this challenge i highly recommend you keep track of your homework so for example as you're doing this maybe do it by for example by tomorrow that way by tomorrow what is this the actual one yeah yo i'm going to drop it down i'll drop the link in the chat because yeah yeah people get people gay asking we had no clue but someone actually just put it yes so the homework uh like i said like i said the homework is uh i would highly recommend you do it today and so that but tomorrow when we do part three the last part of slack clone we can go ahead and stay and stay on top of things and have your updated slack and just finish it up fully so so someone asked how can we turn off firebase so that we're not being charged for it uh guys for uh five is actually free it's free so if you actually just simply add firebase it's completely free for you there's no no problem whatsoever it's not paid um for the first year it's completely free so just yeah perfect someone aaron asked can you show us how to do dark modes at the very bottom can you show us how to do dark mode now aaron we're gonna try to get to some extra functionality towards the end of tomorrow depending on how fast we wrap up the entire project we might do that or we might do a search function and kind of dive into that but if not this is something nice i don't see it um i think uh he was at the bottom of put more okay i don't see it anyways his name is aaron um but if not these are things that you can have in mind of things that you want to implement right and you know if you just talk to people inside the community you might also find other people that might be interested in implementing that as well like you go to the slack community or sorry the discord community you could go to facebook like guys i want to implement dark modes anyone else that's interested and people like yeah i'm interested and together you guys could figure it out yes guys so dark mode guys guys again dark mode is pretty simple to implement okay guys you can for example just how we set the background color of these specific sections okay you can change the background color for example this section let's say maybe this section you set the background color for example to maybe like gray who knows let me just think about this for example here let's say the background color of this is going to be like see right there now i'm making making it dark you see it right there bro see right there 277 i might do the same thing for example on on this one okay cool cool maybe let's do the same thing on here boom dark mode you see down here so we'll do maybe change it to there beautiful you see now it's starting to make into dark mode right there see maybe for example the chat now the chat message maybe i make that into for example maybe maybe that's like color for example color background color of this specific hole this whole thing for example maybe the background background of this for example is gray no not gray i don't want dark gray no no no no no no no no no dim grape let's just say gray for example but i will change it up in a second here so just say it's like let me just think about this maybe it's like this who knows right and then what you can do is you can change the color of the actual text so like color to be white see right there see now it's like dark mode you see it right there so it's so much easier now right dark mode and now you made this too white made this to white and so right there i just changed up to dark mode for you guys right now of course you still might need to change this message in here so for example this message you might change this one to be like for example maybe background color transparent boom done see done just like that it's so simple so simple guys just think about how would you go and this is pretty cool it's a pretty cool dark mode looks good yeah it looks pretty good i would say so awesome all right any other questions you guys have any questions where's my quest where's my chat where the jedi i don't know bro were you showing the screen right now no i was i wasn't working i just changed yeah yeah so yeah i think coding was spent hey swears in the house man says google for dogma you will find tutorials that is how i got it nice that's awesome nice job swen okay but when you inspect glass name my gibberish names okay these their names their gibberish names because of react right they are not jewish names when you go ahead you would change it up in the actual classes when you go back to the component the gibberish names temporarily because that's how react works okay okay we can do what we're getting the monist dude daniel's neck automatically moves to the beach i know it's always like dude it's gonna have the music right here in my headphones so i'm always sunday said you can make a component instead um of a style div and go about it like so and have the style components under yeah that's that's that's true as well that's really good as well must be correct yes okay uh because they are dynamically created by stackable yes correct marios yes that is right there they now create a buy style components maybe create a function that allows the user to switch that would be cool if you guys can do that that'd be awesome right so that means basically the css will change depending on you know the the component and so forth depending on if you have it like on or off so i kind of like that i like it that will probably you have to use something like use state for example for dark mode versus light mode right so like dark mode falls and so a lot of your css will depend on the like if the dark mode variable is true or false bro dude it's cause the monitor keeps smash oh gosh oh we just hit 450 live oh let's go oh my god it's funny my face says today's lesson was dope awesome awesome does firebase host websites yes it does guys this beat is coming let's go mallow yeah that's that's a great way yes the one from the portfolio so we have the portfolio which you guys gave to you you can kind of use that as well to to do that nice 550 likes dance party time guys steve i'm a parttime dancer guys not a parttime dj i use a parttime dj yes yes yes uh mongodb is very similar to firebase correct but firebase consists of other things mongodb is a little more functional around in terms of how you can query it but it's pretty similar firebase on the other hand allows us to have realtime communication which is a really cool part of the box so there's a lot more to that amazing cool next up let's see we'll see any questions i think it's pretty much it guys i think guys guys we will end it there all i can say to you guys is it has been amazing again look out for the homework post look out for
