hey guys what is up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and you're watching code Khadem e part 12 okay so let's get started and pick back up from student becomes teacher this is where objectoriented programming is gonna come into play okay if you ever heard that phrase objectoriented programming or OOP Oh P this is kind of where it comes from so let's see how these guys go about it welcome to this challenge course until now we've been leading you by the hand and working on some short and relatively easy projects I do agree with that that they do hold you by the hand a lot this is a challenge so be ready we have faith in you ready we're going to switch it up a bit and allow you to be the teacher of your own class make a gradebook for all your students the example above is just to remind you how to create a dictionary and then to access to items stored by the cat key so again you guys are Pro ID pros at this now because of how much practice we've done create a variable animal sounds store a dictionary even in the dictionary we have what is this called it's called a key and what is this whole thing called it's called a value and then the datatype here is a list with multiple elements inside of it meow and purr so if I access the cat key from animal sounds I'll get back the value meow and purr and then this comma separates the next key value pair and then that comma separates the next key value pair and it's legal also to have a trailing comma just like they have it right here create three dictionaries Lloyd Alice and Tyler okay these are all dictionaries so if a dictionary that's how you create a dictionary this is not set give each dictionary the keys name homework quizzes and tests okay so we are gonna have a key name with name Lloyd then we're gonna have a key homework with an empty that that right there okay and we're gonna separate it out nicely so it's easier to read quizzes we're gonna have an empty list just like the set and for a test we are also going to have an empty list so we I'm just gonna copy and paste this delete that and just change the names here so I don't have to do all of the work again Tyler here we go change the name this is Alice go here change that Alice this is Tyler and I've changed that with Tyler that's done I have the name and other keys should be an empty list the name key does not have the name Lloyd okay so it should actually be capital L I miss that my fault Alice and Tyler okay that part is done now fill out your Lloyd dictionary with the appropriate scores save some time with filled out the rest for you so here you can see for Alice we have the name Alice for homework we have two scores one hundred ninety two ninety eight 100 maybe this means that there were four homework assignments four quizzes that means there were probably three quizzes assignments where she got the score of 82 83 and 91 and for tasks probably two tasks where she got closer and and then well above an eight she got a 97 we're assuming it's of course based on 60d and 90 is an a so they want us to fill in that information I'm going to copy and paste it so I save some time I don't want have to type it out it says make sure to include the decimal point so your grades are stored as floats so what they're basically saying is that don't do this but do this okay what's the difference what's the difference between 88 or rather do I show you in okay let me show you really quickly in Python 2 what the difference is so if I open up a terminal here on my computer I'll show you guys maybe in some other video how you can use terminals but this is a Python 2 environment that I have opened up here now I'll show you the difference between maybe 88 and 8.0 or 80 8.0 and 88 so let's do 88 and this should not be divided by this should not be divisible by 3 but you see you get a 29 but not if I called it 88 point 0 I get the Cremora correct answer which is twenty nine point three three three so floating number tells it when you're dividing like hey I want it to be shown in the decimal place I like basically I don't want just integer division okay so in Python 2 that is important so that is one point why they're using floating numbers and they're saying this will be important later put it together now let's put the three dictionaries in a list together so we got three dictionaries and they want us to put like lloyd one dictionary and alice and the other dictionary and Tyler or Tyler also so they want us to put all three dictionaries in a list and call this list students okay so that's cool now Lloyd Alice and Tyler actually something a lot more complex and very simple things that you're used to doing up until now right so let's go and practice with them and play around so I can say print Lloyd if I printed Lloyd it or I'm sorry I should say print students of zero so the first element of students is gonna give me Lloyd which is actually a dictionary of the homework tasks quizzes and name and to access those things I can simply since this whole part right this whole part is basically this dictionary right here right it's just that dictionary how would I access homework from that dictionary I would just index it and say homework right pass in that key and if I did that I would get back that homework right there so let's go back so since that this whole part of Alice is that dictionary I can effectively just index it right over here and I can say homework and this will give me the homework scores let's say I wanted this Homer score of the third homework right I would put a two here because we start from zero zero one two two is the third element so I will go like this and I get back 75 so if you look into load which is student of zero and if you go all up to Lloyd line one and you look at homework and you look at the third element you indeed get a 75 so this whole part the values to 75 it prints it out to the screen and nice okay let's go back so we have done that where they told us to create a list all right for each student in your students list print out the students data as follows okay so this is gonna be pretty cool we're gonna be using some loops and doing some really cool things so let's get to it okay how will we print out these things I would say for student in students write print well all these dictionaries notice have the same keys right so the first time we were looping through this list students again this variable is arbitrary I can call it whatever but I'm calling it students because each item in this list represents a student so it makes most sense to call a student and it's a Python convention and you're sealed is you'll see this very commonly it'll be like for singular in plural so for student in students for orange in oranges for you get the point okay so here what we're gonna do is we're gonna set for student and students print students because that's the or I'm sorry print that's dude and and we'll pass in the key right because student really is a dictionary so this Lloyd here is actually a dictionary so I'm basically doing dictionary and then key right that was our dictionary and then key and that will give our value so I'm doing that's two Princeton's name now I can do print students homework because that's the order to want it in I will set print student quizzes to put a parenthesis here I'm getting you guys used to using print as a function right so when you switch to Python 3 you will be used to it and I say when because I know once you get a job as a Python developer and in your future career if your company is using Python 3 we'll be good to know Python 3 right and eventually all companies and everybody will switch to Python 3 ok let's go right here and paste it and let's run this loop you can see that it's printing out that students what is that premiere yeah students name then it prints out that students homework and quizzes then tests so here Lloyd you can see his homework you can see his quizzes you can see his tests then the loop switches to Alice right which is a dictionary and then this part switches to Alice it looks up Alice name this part gets evaluated to Alice but as a string Alice right because this value here is the string and then it shows Alice right there and same thing happens with the homework and I think you get the idea but I'm not gonna go through the entire thing okay so let's get out of that cool hopefully this video wouldn't stop because my hard drive is getting full almost it's okay to be average they say is it really I thought it's not okay to be average alright so when teaching a class it's important to take the students averages in order so again they're now talking about this right five divided by two gives you two 5.0 divided by two gives you 2.5 float of 5 divided by 2 also gives you a 2.5 5.0 is a float and calling float on 5 also gives you a float basically turns that 5 into a 5.0 so this float effectively turned float using the float function on 5 effectively turns that into this line right there and then you get 5.0 divided by 2 and you get to 0.5 so it's important to remember that in Python 2 especially that when you do division it by default does integer division which means that 5 divided by 2 will give you 2 instead of 2.5 okay so write a function define a called average that has one argument numbers usually whenever I think plural in Python I'm thinking okay it's gonna be a list or a dictionary or a set or something with multiple things of values in it and not just one integer okay we define a function called average as one argument numbers inside the function call the built in sum function with the numbers list as a parameter store the result in a variable total so we'll create a variable called total and what we'll do is we'll call some on numbers what that means is if I had a list called numbers with numbers 1 2 3 4 and 5 I can call the function sum on my numbers I'm gonna have to do print so it can print it out and once I run this piece of code you can see that it sums it up 1 plus 2 of 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus four plus five is indeed 15 and therefore you get 15 so some function just sums all of the numbers in a given list okay store the result in a variable called total like the example of juice float to convert total and store the result in total so what I can do is I can call float right here but that will probably confuse you guys a little bit so I'm gonna make it simpler I'm gonna say new total is just equal to float of total all that does is really like put a decimal place in front of total so it says Python make sure that this is saved as a float number because I also want when I do some division with it I also want to keep the decimal values it's important for me and so we say that's okay divide the total by the length of the numbers list use the built in length function so how do I get an average of anything well you just add those things up and you divide by how many there are so to get an average of one plus two plus three plus four plus five I would say one plus two plus three plus four plus five fifteen right and then I'll divide it by how many things there are so if I count I have one two three four five elements in this list I'll say five so 15 divided by 5 that gives me back three so the average of numbers does effectively give me back three and you can also visually look at it three lines right in the middle so you can know that this has an average of three but if it was a little bit more complicated or for some different number now three would not be the average but if you did the math how I told you to do it it would work so don't be lazy if averages aren't so natural to go ahead and actually compute the average of this add all of the five numbers and then divide by five so that's what they want you to do okay one quick way to do it is well how can you write a certain thing that always knows how many numbers to divide by right so if I wanna do average of let's say numbers how would I do that hmm well I will use one function to help me which will sum up the number so now I know already this is 15 but how do I get where does 15 divided by 5 I know I can hard code it okay but what if there was only one number in the list now you would have 1 divided by 5 which gives you a nonsensical answer because that would not be the average of that so how can we get the number of the items in the list and divide by that even if the list is dynamic or it keeps changing well that is why the Len function was built that tells you how many items there are so we take the sum of all the numbers and we divide by the length of the items in the list so how many items are in this case this part turns out to be 15 this part turns out to be 5 nice and easy we get the average of let's call it of numbers is 3 so let's see what they want us to do divide total by the length of the numbers list use the builtin Len function to calculate that so I'm going to say that um I'm gonna say return total by the length to buy total by D so in this case they just want us to divide total by the length of the numbers list because we've already summed it right so I'm gonna say total divided by the length of that list that we passed this function so again this is a function that's taking in a parameter make sure you understand what that is the parameter here is numbers okay not that means that when we call this function we have to give it one argument one thing in the parentheses and then it goes through and does something with it a challenge I give you is write a function that takes in that sums up two numbers okay it takes in as input two numbers and returns their sum so I challenge you to write that and I'm gonna quickly show you the answer so positive videos if you want to try it but here would be the answer to that define I'll call that function sum a be return a plus B that's it okay but this which this is my way of checking if you know what you're doing this is a good way to check your knowledge about functions okay so I think that should be good start next lesson just wait and see so I assume this has to do something waits there nice little lame jokes sneaking in now we need to compute a student's average using weighted averages so students weighted averages right what does a weighted average mean well does a hundred on your homework mean the same thing as a hundred on your test absolutely not maybe 20 of your homework assignments or more might mean that right maybe if you do 20 homework assignments you get a 100 that might mean one test score of 100 so a tests are a big deal so they need to be weighted differently when we're calculating the actual grade so that's what they're doing here right there using 0.9 times average of cost of apples so here they're taking the average cost of the apple so they just create a function called average to make their life easier and so did we and now once you make something a function you should use that function so they're using the average function to compute the cost of the apple and then they're multiplying that by 0.9 and then they're doing the same thing for bananas down here right you see that division sign so they're doing the same thing for bananas right here except they're multiplying it by what 0.1 this probably means that they hate bananas or for some reason they value apples more so they're multiplying it a higher number and for bananas it's you know the inverse of what I just said okay in the above example we create okay we weigh the average cost of bananas by 90% right 0.9 is 90% and the average cost of bananas by 10% so I'm sorry this is not division this is continuation okay I'm throwing you guys off this just means lion continuation this is a really ugly thing to do and you should try to avoid doing this at all costs it if you must that it makes a code harder to read and as you can see I made a mistake when I was reading it this is pretty much you could just ignore it okay this takes no effect so it's basically 0.9 times average cost of Apple plus 0.1 times average cost of bananas write a function called get average that takes a student dictionary like lloyd Alice Tyler as input and returns his/her weighted average okay so step one we define a function called get average okay define get average here takes in one argument call student make a variable homework that stores the average average of student homework so effectively what this is doing this function get average here is that we give it a student name let's say we give it a Lloyd right and then what it would do is it'll store in homework the average of that students homework score so it will do that homework right we'll go to the value that we get if we use the dictionary lloyd with the key homework we get back this calling the average function on that list right there right calling this average function so what it does is it takes this gives that to the average definition of the function or yeah gives that right there to average and then on line 22 it replaces this with that the sum of all of this would be what 90 plus 97 plus 75 plus 92 that gives you 350 for this flow total turns that into 350 4.0 because a float and then you get 3 5 4.0 it divided by length of numbers in this case the length of numbers is 4 and you get back 3/5 4/4 88.5 and once that is returned this part here gets turned into 88.5 and so then homework gets stored as 88.5 how cool is that right programming is so cool we define these algorithms once and then then do monstrous amounts of work in less than milliseconds right I find that really cool and what we're doing is we're creating our own functions and then we are already read to leverage it right we're already leveraging that in our continuous functions that we're writing so that is the definition of good code how reusable it can be all right so repeat step two for quizzes and tests okay so now we do the same thing for define gets Oh step two for quizzes and tests okay so step two is just this and here I will change this with quizzes and the variable I'll change it with oh I'm sorry with quizzes and then I'll do the same thing right here tasks okay that's some keyboard and enjoying skills that I've developed over the years multiply the three averages by their weights and return the sum of those three so multiply the averages by their three by their weights and return the sum of those three so now I will say weighted I'm gonna write this code in a cleaner way because they want us to write everything on one line weighted homework is equal to homework times well it's at 10% homework is 10% which means well I'm sorry this means 10% okay I'm not gonna write the zero but you can if you want point one is just 10% but okay I'll write the zero there to just make it very clear what it is okay and then I will do weighted quizzes is equal to quizzes multiplied by you know 30% weighted tasks equal to tests multiplied by 60% you get the idea and now we'll just return weighted homework + weighted quizzes + weighted tests all right is that what they want us to do they didn't say a return but I returned it anyways sending a letter great work now let's write get letter great function that takes a number scores then put and returns a string with the letter grade that the student should receive okay so now what they want us to do is create a function that will take in whatever this average grade is that the student got and convert it to a letter okay so that's pretty cool right we get back let's say cemani we turned that into a c slap that onto the report card or a loop continues running goes to the next student sees he got 85 in our case might be lloyd or whoever Alice sees that you know she got a 75 slaps a C sends it next gets Tyler season 95 slaps on an A and sends that card a report card to his father and father is happy and up in arms okay define a function called get let's her grade okay I have to do des right it's a function that has one argument called score expect score to be a number so score is going to be a number if this was professional code I would write some documentation as in something like I would say per am score is an int you know something like that but I'm not going to do that right now score to be number inside your function test score using a chain of ifelse ifelse statements like so if score is greater than or equal to zero right we have to translate English to code that's what you'll have to do if you have a job or you're just trying to create a fun game first you'll have to think of it in English then translate it into code then it's easier so if score is nine year above right I'm just writing that in Python nothing special I'm saying if score is greater than or equal to ninety I also return a else if score is greater than or equal to 80 return b else if score is greater than or equal to 70 return c else if score is greater than or equal to 60 return d and now for the last one okay how i think of it is this is an if statement this is a condition and then this is what happens when that condition is true for your else statements you don't need a condition so you can just write else like this so now think about it should we write another else if statement which is lfii LIF or should we write an else statement what do you think we should write an else statement we could write an L lift statement saying if score is less than 60 write anything less than 60 give them an F but why write more code when we can keep it more elegant and just say else and say return f right that makes it real elegant and that's all that get letter should do finally test your function call get letter Glade function of the result of print the resulting grade so print and I'm gonna call the get letter grade function and it takes in a score so it's dependent on a score so I'll do get average pass LOI to get average and my parentheses should be correct so this part will get the average and it'll get evaluated to some number let's say 85 I don't know what it is and then the get letter grade function gets called on a 5 that goes through that loop it converts that to be and that's what should actually erratically happen and print out B let's say so let's give this bad boy a try and actually we did get a B I didn't know what Lloyd's average was gonna be but that's what we ended up getting okay now just to blow your minds I'm gonna take you through actually what the algorithm is doing the whole nine yards if you don't want to do it you want to want to watch this part because you were like I'm sure I got it down skip it but I will walk through it really quickly so you can know what's going on okay this will give you a very good idea of everything that's happening under the hood okay so let's say we call these functions in this order okay now get average function gets called okay get average function gets called so we go to get average it gets it goes here it passes in lloyd because to get average we gave the argument lloyd so everywhere it says get average it passes in everywhere it sees student it in Lloyd so this turns into Lloyd this turns into Lloyd this turns into Lloyd and then it starts getting evaluated right so this part gets evaluated to Lloyd's homework which is this this part gets evaluated the next part gets evaluated to Lloyd's quizzes which is right here and the third part gets evaluated to Lloyd's test and we get back a 7590 here now actually it happens in a different order right this whole part gets evaluated first but just to make things simple I'm keeping it like this now we have the average function being called on this list right here so what happens here is we pass this list to the average functions everywhere you see numbers that list gets past so we pass that list this sum right here calculates this to 90 plus 97 plus 95 I think those 354 right yeah we've done this before 354 this part makes at 350 4.0 this part makes it three fifty four point zero divided by four 354 divided by point zero divided by four makes it eighty eight point five that returns eighty eight point five so further Lloyd's homework we get eighty eight point five now for Lloyd's average the same thing happens we for we pass in this argument to the function average so it passes this guy what was it before and feel like I deleted something okay so let's just keep it now on in total this numbers changes to that so the sum function gets called it sums up all those numbers that gives you a two to two right here we put in two two two in here this turns it into a two to two point zero we get to two two point zero divided by the length of this list right here the length you know numbers the length of that list is actually 3 so 2 2 2 divided by 3 gives you 74 right so effectively we have 74 I forgot what the other score was it was 354 divided by how many homeworks that he have 4 right it was 88.5 so 88.5 i'm just gonna keep that up there to keep track of it a little bit now for test the same thing happens for lloyd wright we pass in this test right here this test gets put right there now it goes to average it passes in that list to the argument average everywhere you see numbers you get that sum of 75 plus 90 gives you back 165 right 165 it gets called on this float of 165 that gives you one sixty five point zero one sixty five point zero divided by the length of the numbers which is to 165 divided by two gives you eighty two point five so we get back in eighty two point five and ultimately we end up so test is eighty two point five when we computed quizzes it was seventyfour when we computed homework it was eighty eight point five right these were the values then effectively what happened right around these lines of code meant these lines of code run so we take ten of 88.5 88.5 times 0.1 you get eight point eight five so this pole part turns into eight point eight five four quizzes what's seventy four thirty percent of seventy four that part turns into what was it just to doublecheck it turns into twenty two point two this part right here turns into eighty two point five times point six forty nine point five so what do we have here eight point five plus twenty two point two plus forty nine point five eight point eight five plus twenty two point two plus forty nine point five eighty point five five right so it returns eighty point five five so this whole part gets evaluated to idiy eight point eighty point five five and then this function gets called now get letter grade function so this eighty point five five gets call gets passed to the function get letter grade so now score is eighty point five five and it goes if score is greater than or equal to ninety score is actually eighty point five five so this part evaluates to false these lines of code don't run then it goes to line 42 else if score is greater than or equal to 80 score is eighty point five five is eighty point five five greater than or equal to 80 true this part of valor is so true and so it returns be this whole part gets evaluated to be and it ultimately prints out B to the screen which is what you guys got right there so this video whoa oh boy I hopefully that just blew your mind right that was that was really powerful there's a lot of brain work involved that's going on there but when you're writing all the stepbystep and you're writing and methodically you're not doing all that in your head all the time right once you're done writing it computer takes care of all the logic and all the hard work I mean computer takes care of all the hard work you just write the logic part and when you do it step by step it's simple first step write a thing that does average second step write a thing that gets averaged and waits two homeworks based on the average function we previously created third step write a get letter great function which uses our previous two functions and get letter grade all its job is to return to take a score a number and convert it basically to a letter right you guys that was a very exhaustive video but if you've stuck through it and saw the explanation step by step I guarantee you you now have a better understanding than 99.999999% of the people who've made it this far in the codecademy school course because they don't take the time to go through the fundamentals you have taken that time and put in that effort to get past those types of fundamentals and sit through and watch it your neural pathways in your brain are getting stronger because of that right so what that means is all of this stuff is gonna be more normal to you now it's gonna be more natural to you you're not gonna have to squeeze your brain all the time to think about it that's why I'm trying to create a pattern recognition here constantly going through if statements constantly going through loops and functions arguments all of that alright that's it for code Academy part 12 I will see you in the next video code Academy part 13 this is Kazi from clever programmer com see you in the next video
