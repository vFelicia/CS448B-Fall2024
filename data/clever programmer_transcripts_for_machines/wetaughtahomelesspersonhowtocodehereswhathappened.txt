so we're going to code up a really really simple application i'm going to have you do all the typing all right i'll hold the laptop and you can type it so first thing i want you to do what's up guys this is luke here and we've got aaron what's up guys it's been a while and what we're going to do is we're going to be teaching a homeless person how to code we're going to be building a age calculator app where you just put in the year you were born and spits out your age so really simple can be really exciting kind of spontaneous but let's go for it we're out here in portland oregon before we start please go down right now hit like subscribe comment all that stuff support the channel we're doing this just for you guys let's do this i think you might want to learn how to code he's showing some initiatives some good work ethic and uh we'll see if he's up for it right let's go yeah we want to teach somebody if you're interested step number two yeah it turned out to be harder than we thought but we're gonna keep searching let's keep looking walking through the streets of portland yo what about those guys actually they look kind of tired good time man what's your name bro michael what's up michael nice to meet you yep this is uh frankie frankie luke nice to meet you how are you doing we're gonna teach this man how to code we're gonna code a really short program um and we'll just see how it goes what do you know about coding and development do you know anything about it nothing you never you know tried coding or anything in your past never okay have you used a smartphone something like that yeah those those are made out of code right so everything that is in the smartphone pretty much was made from people that code yes like every piece of technology has like code running on it so we're gonna put up an app together okay sure all right awesome dude okay so so we're going to code up a really really simple application i'm going to have you do all the typing all right i'll hold the laptop and you can type it so first thing i want you to do is i want you to type print the word print and hit delete and then print rint and then an open and open calling uh you gotta hit the shift key so hit delete it's all right bro right so hit that nice and then hold the shift key and then hit the nine there you go and now you wanna put a quotation mark okay so put hold the shift key and this button again all right awesome now just pick a phrase a phrase huh yeah what do you want to say awesome okay so now i want you to save it so this dot means it hasn't saved it we have unsaved changes i want you to hold command and hit s for save so command s sic okay so now it's saved alright so we actually this is what this is a one line of code what i want you to do is i want you to use the trackpad here and click on this green um thing here we're actually going to run your code okay so what this is gonna do is this is gonna print what you said to the screen which it came out right there okay so it says print how are you and that's what you said so if we changed it here then this would actually change all right okay awesome okay let's let's keep going so i have a little a little apple i want you to build i want us to build an age calculator so i want an app where we can put in the year we were born and then it'll spit out our age all right let's go for it so start with getting uh is that your age give or take you're 44 years old yeah perfect okay now let's give it a save so command s and this should be the final app so let's run it one more time and we'll see it in action down there at the bottom right let's run the code yep all right perfect so it prompts you what year were you born uh let's type in you want to type in your year or my year matter don't matter okay let's put in my age okay so let's put in 1994 and hit enter and there's my age 27. so we we successfully created a age calculator app here with michael how did that feel man kind of cool kind of interesting kind of new you know never done this before you're coding man like you're literally coding like people who work at big companies and stuff they they know how to code and this is what they do on a daytoday basis and they they help create apps for people like on the phones or on laptops so it's gonna be harder or easier i didn't think i don't know didn't think didn't think much of it just didn't know what to expect all right got it well well awesome michael you wanna zoom in yep let me see what year were you born 1977 age 44 damn all right awesome well successful successful coding session michael thank you come on bro you're pretty chill we talked to a bunch of people yeah they were talking to people some some people yeah some people were like

learn to code doesn't matter who you are uh it's really simple easy bear to entry of course it's uh there's a high skill ceiling never ends but anybody can jump into it and get started it's really that simple so if you ever you know considered starting to code then you know now is the best time uh just click the link in the description you know you can check us out we help people how to code check out other videos on the channel whatever you want uh you know type script javascript python anything you want and that's it guys thank you so much have a good day you
