coding is not hard you are just weak that's a problem a lot of the people that are coming on this channel are talking to me they're like three months you can't get a job in six months I didn't invent coding boot camps they exist for a reason because people are doing that and getting jobs I didn't need a code of boot camp I did it by myself for free I had coaches I had coaches who helped but you can definitely do it most of you were don't have a job right now it's nobody else's fault but yours you are the reason why you don't have a job in an economy and in a country and in a place where there's zero excuse for you to have a job software developer if you have any level of skill people are desperate to give you money to become a software developer at their company but most of you are so goddamn bad as a developer that you can't get a job and nobody's gonna tell you that truth because everybody's too scared but that's the truth that's the reason why you're not getting a job you're literally just getting one client one person to just say one company that has an unlimited budget that just has to say yes I need you here's what's happening one you're really bad at coding that's one of the reasons why you're not getting a job second you're not trying hard enough most of you who don't have a job are sitting there and just waiting for a job to fall in your lap if you don't have a job you should be applying to places like it's your goddamn job 24 7 all day and not stopping the reason why you're not getting a job is because you're not applying somebody with half of a brain cell can get a job if they just attempted long enough and hard enough that would be a person somewhere they'll be like you know what this person is obsessive they seemed to be a fast learner and they really want this let me just give it to them you know why because I bet I could train this person and they could smoke that other developer that just wants to clock out go to their home and just do random stuff and not be growing whereas this person will literally kill themselves to improve I'm willing to give this person a chance and to those of you guys here's why it's happening and here's why it's so confusing for so many of you that are on this channel that I don't even want you here anymore there's some of you right not all of you the people who are supporting and are here I love you but there are a lot of people who are just like I don't understand how he did it it doesn't make any sense let me explain the reason why it's hurting your brain and how I was able to achieve a lot of those things in three months and being on a run rate of a hundred thousand dollars or more per year how at 20 or 21 years old I was able to quit out of college and my own Professor came up to me and asking me for career advice when I was taking computer science class everybody was watching my my coding tutorials on YouTube to pass the python course when that was happening I was like yeah maybe I should quit and pursue this goddamn thing and teach it to others because people do want to learn this and I can change their lives and there are a lot of people whose lives have been changed and then I'll grow a team and then we as a team went together and we started helping people and we started changing their lives and then I started doing something dumb and started watering my message down and trying to be super polite on social media and trying to be no what I'm doing by doing that is I'm not allowing you to rise up to a new level and become better become a better developer become a better human being and get a job of your dreams and live the life of your dreams what happened with me was no coincidence the reason why I had such a fire was because I grew up watching my mom in pain for years and years because we got in a car crash her L4 and L5 got got fractured which are your you know your your bones in your back she was in agony that led to her getting a lot of medical problems and I didn't want to be sitting there and watching her in agony and feeling helpless for the rest of my life and I'm like I have my whole family and nobody can really we can't support her with what we have and multiple of our people in in my you know my family had multiple jobs and we just couldn't support him we couldn't really do what she needed I remember going with my mom to Cook County Hospital in Chicago sitting there and waiting six hours at a time 10 hours at a time multiple times a week while I was 13 or 14 years old when you go through that I used to cry so much because my mom was in pain and just watching her in agony that I thought at some point that I would have died because I loved her more than anybody else in the world and to see somebody you love suffer every day made me just want to like the pain was so much I couldn't live through it at some point I learned how to be calm in the face of that pain be there to support her be there to support everybody else in my family and I was like this there is a better way I'm going to learn how to get useful valuable skills so I can make money money is the reason why I started learning coding okay what kept me there was I ended up falling in love with coding and enjoying out of it so my fire is way different than a lot of you a lot of you are like three months this is not possible he's just lying you are projecting your own weakness and your shortcomings and limitations on me and it doesn't matter to me because those aren't my limitations and I became a goddamn beast at coding why because I would put in 15 to 18 hours a day and I realize I was sitting there and I'm like could a lot of these people is this right was I was this not right like I it made me doubt myself and go back and think about my own coding journey and think man when I was when I was going through my coding Journey am I am I simplifying it more than than what the people need like am I am I making it sound too easy for people is it is it yeah and I thought about it and I'm like it was easy for me but maybe I'm not clarifying certain things right for me I was spending 15 to 17 hours a day and it felt easy because I enjoyed it and I'm obsessive I'm an extremely fast learner and when I have belief I just go all in I know nothing but to go all in and I went all in and I became extremely good at it because that's all I did I obsessed take anybody for three months have them doing something for 15 to 17 hours a day they will become incredibly good will they become the best in the world no because it takes more than that to become best in the world will they become um well they all of a sudden be equivalent of somebody who has a decade of experience no it's not what I'm saying but just understand why it happened for somebody like me in three to four months and why could happen for you but the the difference isn't you're not gonna put in your one hour a day coming back from your nursing job or from your truck driving job or from your it job some of you who don't even have a job you're not gonna come back from whatever you were doing tired exhausted and just I'm gonna put it one hour a day consistency is the way to go all the best people in the world are consistent no nobody who was the best in the world did it through consistency did did it through being relentless obsessive and going harder than anybody else in the world like Kobe wasn't just like I'm gonna come in yeah I'll just come in from 9am to nine uh 10 a.m just follow the training that my coach teaches me no Kobe was coming in 3 A.M 3 30 a.m 4 AM whatever is an insane time ungodly hour training before anybody else was there there's stories about people being scared when they would see Kobe Bryant they'd be like I didn't even know he was in the locker room and and they were they were there so understand that the people who are winning in life the people who you want to emulate they're obsessed consistency is not Obsession okay let me let me say it like this if you want average results and you're okay with that just want to have mediocre results have a job that pays you 60k I've just worklife balance and I need to be able to go home and just relax and shut everything off at four or five PM great all of those of you I'm literally not talking to any of you because I don't care I don't know what that life is like for many years I try to assimilate myself with that crowd I don't know what that's like if you can do that and spend a lot of time it doesn't have to 15 hours a day but like when you sit down and code just immerse yourself in it and just do it like enjoy it build a thing that you want to build try at least like give it a try all of the reasons that I've had extreme results right all these YouTubers online that have coding channels I don't know what they're doing but like at 25 I became a millionaire like I learned coding I started making six figures and started teaching that I became a millionaire once I started my coding channels all of these things are results of obsessing and just being the best at what you do not everybody's getting these results but not everybody's as obsessed I had a mansion in Beverly Hills where my whole team was I have a girlfriend that's like the most beautiful girl her Talent is amazing her Integrity amazing she's loyalists like she's killing it in life in every area she's a pro boxer pro athlete synchronized swimmer now she's on TV everywhere but what I'm telling you is all of these areas they're crafted in an exceptional way because I have an extremely high set of Standards now I have a epic ass place in La I'm about to get another place in Colombia I'm about to fly my entire team out there and we're and and we're going to be creating amazing content on this channel and I'm gonna start building multiple other brands on their personal brand because I want to achieve more and I want to Excel and I just want to be the best at what I do and I want to give it my best because I wouldn't serve you if I didn't if I wasn't at my best if I'm scared and I'm weak and I'm not doing the that I want to do so now I'm committed to doing this that is a crazy challenge for me every day and I want to go for exceptional results the reason I'm telling you this is not to brag but it's just to make it super clear if you want to get these results understand and have the right expectations every day every live living eating breathing moment was session it was watching the learning from the people surrounding myself with coding friends coding mentors anybody and everybody that could help me every dollar I made from coding I went on code mentor and paid it right back so somebody could teach me coding if I made a hundred dollars I spent eighty dollars on somebody to coach me because I knew I was gonna spend that money on some dump anyway a car a watch or whatever but those things are liabilities I'd rather invest in myself as Alex hermosi says not SMP but SM mean SN me 500 which is an investment in yourself instead of taking the excess cash you have and putting into the S P 500 I want you to put it into the sne 500 take that 500 every single month and you plowed into you so I looked at life like that and I was just like yo let me just keep reinvesting into my skill set and go absolutely ham relentlessly investing into my own skill set and when I did that my skill sets started skyrocketing every dollar I made I poured it back into me to either improve my speaking skills or my coding skills and I just became better so I was investing time money energy everything that I had into that one goal and then I achieved it way faster than a lot of people that I know geez yeah um be realistic coffee that's one of the things I've got in my whole life and it's just as you can tell I don't like it I love you I want to just give you this message I hope it inspires you I hope that it drives you to do more be more and get more and do it for not just yourself all these selfish little wimps online the reason why a lot of you are just doing just like is this right like so much of it is for just you that's why you can't give it that much effort either honestly right um a lot of people are just okay with just achieving a certain amount whatever I broke me not for me but I don't care as long as it inspires one person that is it
