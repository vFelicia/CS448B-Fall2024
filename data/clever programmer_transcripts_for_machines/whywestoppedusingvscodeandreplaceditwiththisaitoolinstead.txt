we stopped using visual studio code and we replaced it with this tool and I know this is a controversial title and you're going to be like oh my God kaz's back with the clickbaits I know you're going to be mad at us you're going to be Nas kzy what the are you guys talking about I don't believe you but but just listen up I will'll show you too I'm going to screens share in a second and we'll share all of this stuff with you but I just want to give you context Nas is a real senior developer okay Nas when you discovered this this is something you yourself are finding yourself using every single day I don't use views code anymore that at all right yes um and the funniest thing that happened was is actually came out of like a few Instagram reels that we made yes so one of the problems I faced was I have a lot of code in my code base and I constantly find myself giving that context to AI like Chad GPT so Chad GPT or Claude can work with me yeah so I ended up creating a script that would go through my code base Clump everything together and then I could take that txt file that had all the code M drop that into Claude or chpt and then go hey write me this new feature like login or authentication that was taking a lot of time and you made a reel on that and that reel actually blew up it got like half a million views yes yeah that real got crazy views because people wanted because I realized it wasn't just me other people had the same problem and they kept having to give all that context um and so when I posted that reel what people started recommending was they started recommending this other magical IDE and some of you guys probably already know it and then they started recommending they're like hey use this other thing that already has AI built in and my first question was why wouldn't I just use copilot because that's integrated inside of 99% of you guys probably do use copal at this point yes and you probably use it to its fullest extent and you probably are seeing the limitations of it you're trying to for example write some code right or you're trying to ask copal to write you some code but the problem I be you might be facing is well it doesn't know the full context of your code right and that was one of the biggest issues I personally had and that's why I also always had to copy the whole file from one you know the whole file copy another file copy another file into the whole CPT context give it to chpt and then ask a questions and that was extremely tedious man yes but then you showed me this tool and everything for me changed yes and it was the comments that actually shared it with us okay so they talked about this tool and it's called cursor IDE yes and this Tool uh if I show it to you it will look this it looks like um this is not a sponsored video or anything like that no not sponsor we just love the tool so much and we want to share with you with as many people as possible yeah just because it's like why not we want you guys to be become better coders better developers hence you make better code overall so yeah yeah and this is something we just started using and maybe maybe copilot works better than this I have no idea I just I switched to this and I I've just been kind of mind blown so um first of all it looks a lot like Visual Studio code if you're looking at it because it was forked from Visual Studio code and then they're built on top of it um and my favorite things is like I can just write code like directly within here so for example if I'm like hey um you know like let's say that I want to just take this guy and I want to wrap it in a TR catch because for some reason this debounce code fails I just grab that I hit command K and I'll just say wrap this in a tri catch for example and I'll hit enter and within this it will write it and it's already showing me what has changed so the red is it's deleted the edit node and the update node dimensional lines M and then the green is the new stuff that it's added and now if I want to accept it I just hit accept so it does that brilliantly well I do not know if copilot does that it might it does does it does that part of does okay great so maybe you do not need to use this at all I will just say that okay I've just been stuck on using this and it blows my mind how well it operates have you used copilot heavily like but this in this style in this style I have used copilot where this becomes very different is actually the part that's on the right side of the on the right side that you see here on the chat so if if you look at the chat here on the right that's something that copal just completely misses like if you want something to you know copal to write something you have to use special key to actually write it and the biggest problem is it it just does not know the full context now the cool part here is let's just say here so we have this edit node function so you can maybe highlight that right y right here yep edit node and the edit note is coming from a specific file so go called nodes context so click on the edit node here uhhuh awesome see use nodes and edges beautiful yep and that's coming from Context no edges cont exactly so let's just say we want to change something up in here and we want to say hey um instead of using edit node use create node because we we have a create node function inside use node and edges so what we do uhhuh so it's actually inside the use noes create edges there's a create node function okay yeah so if you click into that use create nodes scroll up up up up up up and then there's create note right right there cool yep awesome awesome so let's just say start of editing a node we want to create the node so how will we use CHP or copile usually you have to like reference the one file then reference another file now with this this is so different let's go back to the text node go back to the text node command P awesome and then the right hit that little plus icon awesome and so what we want to say is the following is like um use right use and then hit at oh yeah the ad is pretty sick copilot have that no that's what go ad is sick dude I can write like if I I can literally write a function name here and it will auto complete and if I hit enter it's referencing that exact function EXA exactly you can reference a function you can reference a file you can reference a folder but then hit that ad again uhhuh you can reference a piece of code you can even reference the web you can even reference the docs there's even like oh dude you know what I do yes I actually reference the get diff oh yeah to actually write the the diff in the thing so I go with the diff of working State and I go use this to write my commit message yes and I'll hit enter and it'll actually look at the diff of what's changed and then it'll use that to write the get that's crazy but anyway Sor that's so cool that's like Co pet is has talked about actually end that feature but like it's just they have not released it at all yet so and and by the way um Chad gbt an open ey doesn't endorse companies and invest in them but they are actually investing in this is one the which is kind of crazy yeah keep going I'm sorry I keep interrupting no no it's okay it's okay this is great stuff guys so this is one of the big use use cases right is like using git functionality to get like the git diff maybe let's just say you want to do this is diff of the working state right which is the working state of the thing awesome so let's just say you made some changes and you want to be able to get a diff of that so you can add it to your pull request this is what you will get the second thing is let's go back to the functionality we're talking about which is use uhhuh at and let's use the nodes and edges context yeah boom boom cool and great and replace edit node inside debounce edit node uh just say edit node I understand I understand edit node inside inside debound with create node create node should I reference the actual create node uh it should kind of know yeah yeah yeah because we've already given it contct yeah let's hope it does now and then there's two things here right so maybe want to explain what is this stuff on the bottom right here so if you can maybe like do boom Oh don't don't function oh there we go this stuff here no no no like GPT for all mention image all that stuff oh yeah so for example like um I can add in an image if I wanted to M and if I actually hit command enter it will go through the entire code Bas so then you don't have to do that script that I made manually that I would feed GPT all the time so you can command enter and sometimes it could show you like the code you need to add to five different files yes and then you hit apply and then it starts adding it to five different files but okay so continue with the example do you want me to hit enter at this point or what do you want me just hit uh yeah just go ahead and hit enter at this point okay so I'll hit enter and now it's starting to do its generation and boom there it is right uhhuh and that's it so it tolds you here to replace a te a text node make sure to create the create node blah blah blah and then if you hit apply you see on the bottom says apply yep so I'll hit apply here and then it'll start applying it to this boom done now create note is coming through create note create not you know what's sick yeah so I love this I'll tell you actually um if do you want to expand on this no go ahead Okay cool so I'll share this with you so this is an amazing use case of it and this reminded me of like similar use case that I actually had today so I wanted to create a new node for articles right so like for example like if we go to um we're not open on uh cell. apppp okay so let's see if I can open this here real quick so we have um is this fine to share sure okay cool so this and this okay so we have different types of nodes uh in our app right now right we have the um uh this is the the code that we have is for this app this app that we're building called popy AI yes PL and so we have like different types of nodes like we have um stuff that can handle YouTube videos stuff that can handle Loom videos so for example like if I go ahead here and I paste uh what's your uh command V what's your clipboard oh um can you do it yep option command V there okay so let's go youtube.com and if I go to some kind of a YouTube video a YouTube video and I paste this like Alex Orosi video for example yep um what's going to happen is it's going to paste this node right so this is an example of a YouTube node and I want to I wanted to create a similar node MH but for article and if we actually follow the logic of this YouTube node it's actually like quite involved so I'll give you an example so like for example let's say I go here and I go tell me how the YouTube node works because it's not like the code is in one file it's the code is across like many different files and it's kind of complicated as a developer for me to wrap my mind around it so I just hit command enter so it could go through like the entire code base yeah and it will go through and it'll tell me like hey I actually have one YouTube nodejs file MH then the next thing I actually have on the top it says on the top there we go yeah so I have um my YouTube node right I'm using my light YouTube embed it's not actually walking me through walk me through MH how it's also being registered uh how paste is being handled Etc oh wait hold on command space yeah yeah yeah so I'm going to cancel generation and I'm going to command command enter and so just going to go through all of it yeah this this is where by the way it adds all the context from all the files yes so now this is really important for me right so first it told me hey look this is the definition of like YouTube node and that's chilling in your YouTube node is here so cool I can go here and I can see how this YouTube node is working great yeah next is telling me hey when you do that paste thing that you did that's actually coming from handle YouTube paste so this is the code that checks if the pattern matches a YouTube video or a YouTube short and then it goes and hits our backend yep gets the transcript right gets the transcript um and then it pastes that and then it even tells me hey to registered this YouTube node in our nodes context and edges we're actually registering our YouTube yep sorry noes context uh edges and context and then type node types node types it's here that's weird huh node types just context the bottom there we go that's weird the command F was cuz I think you were doing YouTube oh unchecked this ah case sensitive okay cool cool cool so there we go so now it's showing me exactly how it's working right so when I actually want to add a new note so now let's say I want to go hey I want to create an article node meaning like if I take an article like a link from a website and I paste it it should be able to detect the pattern yep it should be able to make it similar to the YouTube node look at how the logic workers Works across five different files and make something very similar for me cook all of that up yep so then I go make me this but for an article node make sure to follow all the steps of how the YouTube node works just replicate that and now I'll just hit command enter And even though I won't do a perfect job and get it all set up it will get me going in a very good direction so when I was setting it up actually this is looking like the correct code because I have it already set up I just didn't push it yet yeah yeah yeah and so oh get push get push main Force push yeah so it's like I got my article node good to go yeah it's telling me that this is how I can register this nice that's exactly by the way just so you guys know for context when we talk about like registering so if you can hover over that register stuff the not type stuff right so how that works by the way is because we use a tool called react flow um and you need to register every single type of component right so if you look at the YouTube node there's like there's audio node and so forth you have to register it here and then it knows how to connect the dots between the actual react component and then what is saved in database so it tells me that I need to register that um and then what it does is it's also telling me hey this is how handle articles that so good right because it's looking crazy good it's looking at the YouTube handle paste and how the YouTube is handling its paste and so it's going and it's going okay here's how we're going to handle the paste for articles and then it goes and adds that to the global handle paste where're routing in YouTube and then it throws that in there which is where you really hated it initially yeah exactly like I'm like what the is this and so now I can actually even um you know so for example like right now if I actually hit apply yeah it'll automatically take me to this nodes and edges file and apply this particular change wow um and for these other ones the reason why it's not letting me apply right away it's cuz those files don't exist create those files uh and then if I obviously don't want this change I just go no hit reject the full on the top yeah but then so this stuff I'm not sure if you could do it in let's say I'm not sure if you could do this in copilot I honestly I I'll be honest I haven't even looked that deeply into copilot you guys might actually tell me that you can do all of this and more and maybe I'll check it out and maybe we're the ones who suck and don't know what the we're talking about that's possible yeah but so far cursor ID has blown my goddamn mind with how well works and I'm just such a power user of it and like the things I can do like I don't know if co pilot has this where you can iterate over stuff yeah like does copilot have that so for example like let's say I um you know go to which one were we in at the start which one oh the text node we were I think in here right yes so now like let's say I have it in a TR catch yeah and let's say I want to go here I'm just going to say console log key moments with Emojis or actually I'll say console log key moments right and if I hit enter it'll like run it and then you can actually like stack this so now I can add a followup instruction I actually add it with Emojis yeah beautiful yeah I like that and then it'll keep everything had and then it'll build on top of it yeah it doesn't it's it's not as clean in like and you can go stack so deep there are times where I'm like TW like not 20 but like five or eight followup instructions deep crazy that's crazy and it's so valuable cuz you iteratively build it out and it doesn't lose anything that it had oh I'm sorry I'm sorry they weren't seeing any of that so here so like this is what I did I said console log key moments yeah and then it added the console logs and then I said actually add emojis then it went back and then it added the Emojis mhm um you know I can also say like add an emoji at the end just so everybody could see it and if I hit enter it'll go ahead and then like it had the instructions of add an emoji before before yeah for some is not adding it now um at the end of the at the end of the console log add it at the end of the console log as well okay yeah all breaks and demos hey okay there we go there we go now it's awesome cool so it's like it iteratively like Stacks it yeah but what's really also really cool is the fact that I don't know if that's possible here but I mean it was here um is let's just say you do uh accept right just for a second here and let's we do command K as well so I just want to show it to you really quickly the other part that's really cool is um again you know there's a ways you can go through different histories which is awesome which is what you did maybe you've done before oh I didn't know that yeah or you can also do you can also ask a question like a quick question so for example like tell me like how this works yeah why we need debound here you know and so to ask a question option enter option enter and so it's not going to actually change the code because sometimes you don't need to change the code you just want to understand fully why you know it's doing what it's doing and it's explaining to me hey the bonance is used here to limit the frequency of edit node and update node Dimensions blah blah blah right makes complete sense but it gets even better because you know you have the ability to change the actual GPT models maybe it's GPT 40 GPT 4 there's even a way you can actually use CLA as well yeah so they have Integrations with claw to on top of GPT 40 and I imagine some point they might even use gem if they wanted to as well so you can add your own models to you can add your own models as well so it's so it's just so um how dynamic in terms of what you can do with it um like you see right just enable Opus for example and then you have access I will say I'm I'm going to be honest their Opus is like it's it's it's just GPT like I swear to God it gives me the same exact answers that GPT gives because I use actual CLA uhh and it's never that so their CLA sucks ass um and you need to work on that I actually yeah like when I am actually like when I need the highest quality of code uhhuh I will eventually go to Claud uhhuh if GPT just cannot get past it makes sense but the other thing as well on top of that I'm going to add on that to that is like I never used this I ever used this part right here the rules for AI all of us outp put your answers in Portuguese oh what the heck we just came from Brazil which is so funny but you can just specify hey always use functional react components don't use class components cuz there's so many times where I've had co palet from vs code and be like hey create a clean component for me it would create a class component for me and I'm like I don't need that no yeah really yeah all the time and I'm like I don't need that yeah I've always wondered like what are good rules for me to sit here I haven't thought about it too much I haven't ran into like recurring enough problems yet at least that I felt like that I need to have you thought of any use cases for this yet the functional react stuff besides that for me it um I haven't ran into it doing a lot of classbased components myself yeah I don't know um no I haven't ran into too big too big of an issue this but it's good to know I wonder what people will say in the comments cuz I'm sure some people will have good use cases for where to use these rules and I would like to learn and the other thing I'm going to say as well is this what this what what I also noticed um copout of course as you guys start to type stuff right um of course it's going to start to recommend what kind of stuff to type and it uses the context of not just your current um page but also different M different pages so only the only your other opened pages I opened Pages you think so yeah that's what I I watch from YouTube videos for copilot oh for copilot you're talking about copilot right U I'm talking talking about this this oh cuz you said copilot oh okay my bad I could be wrong I I mix it up I mix it up okay okay I'm dumb go ahead but like yeah I've noticed that also the the way it also gives suggestions is so smart like if I do for example con uh loading for example here right um Bo loading set like it's just so smart the way it creates these suggestions I don't get those type of suggestions inside Coop palet um let's just say later on we actually want to do where we set I mean another cool one that I don't know if copilot does it is it will add multiple lines of Auto suggestion like it'll even edit existing things and autoc complete them because it starts to see what pattern you're exactly it just knows the pattern and it's so well right here for example it's recommending set loading to false which makes sense cuz we're on blur right or here for example it might said loading to true so again um this is just a very simple use case of this of course um and the use cases there are much much much bigger but there's all the time where I want to change some stuff for example let's just say here I want to go ahead and I just do like a div boom right like just like spinner like it just how did it know but spinner cuz I set the loading as a use St right it created a spinner uh div for me how cool is that you guys right yeah and so and then you might be like hey only show the spinner when there is a you know loading State you see suggestion right away when it's loading then you do loading spinner like so good I have not got that with Co palid it it there they have this like preview Auto complete view like you saw it was so cool and I'm always like that's so interesting how they do that I don't think any other editor does that one I absolutely love this and like like I was a big co pilot user and I know what you guys are going to say like guys there's also extensions for V code that will do the same thing cuz it we got a lot of hate from that on Undead re as well which is like there's an extension that we do it yes that's right you can just use an extension there's many tools out there you can use this is just one of them this is the one that we just loved yeah and there's an amazing team behind it as well that we you know we haven't ever talked to them yet which would be amazing for a to chat with them hey guys hit us up H us oh that's actually cool I'd love the podcast with though it' be such a great podcast even if we did it in purpose person that'd be amazing too that would be really cool MH so yeah this is a product that we really enjoy you can check it out um and hey you guys are watching sponsor this content wink wink um but in the meantime we'll sponsor our own content um so if you interestingly enough want to take this video that you're actually watching yeah um and talk to it and take notes from it you know try to understand what's being covered so for example like if I'm ever watching a hormozi video you know I don't know if you know who he is or like if you're watching a developer video you can just talk to that video so I just brought this chat I'm just going to connect this YouTube video yeah and I'm just going to say hey what are three key insights from this video and it will start to give me those instantly MH um and I can you ever not erase it and I can say that what are uh uh give it to me with quotes also that way you can make sure that it's not hallucinating yeah perfect be like hey biil Will exist because this is how human beings learn and that sounds like something horoi would say um if you watch this video say something but what's cool as well is like what we made this tool for is you know for it's kind of like a visual collaborative version of GPT is kind of how we're thinking about it yeah um and the it gives the ability to not just understand and learn but to also create so if we if we can take this video and be like hey uh create for us a basic um you know a basic Twitter post let's just say out of this um you can do that as well and then you can you also record your own voice so let's just say you learned from this video yourself and then you record your own voice right I'll for example just say I just started hit I just hit recording by the way and you can see it moving and I'll be like hey the key lessons I learned from Heros videos that I want to actually start implementing is he says biases exist so in my business I want to be mindful of where I have biases and what type of employees I have biases towards because Step One is I want eliminate those so then I can hire better Talent yeah uh let's say personal Excellence I can go to step three and the action step I might want to take from this is I want to set really high standards for myself so then everybody else on my team automatically follows that without me having to tell them that I'll hit stop so now this is a voice recording mhm that we just finished MH and what is it doing right now NZ it is actually uploading the voice recording of course then is transcribing the voice recording and it's understanding it and it's even getting the title for it as well cool and uh can I talk to this voice recording yes you can so just connect it yep and you can connect by the way as many things as you would like pretty much um to here and at this point now you got these two knowledge bases that you can create you can use to create anything you want at this point so what are the action steps I want to take from my audio message so now it knows about my audio message yep and it's saying saying identify biases be mindful of biases in your business and work to eliminate them y two set high standards and three lead by example yep does that sound kind of about Prett much what just said i' be actually interested to see what would happen if you're like hey use the audio um use the audio message to create a Twitter post and reference um quotes from Alex heroi video just as a thought yeah um so that's actually really good so let's give it a try I like to say text message because it makes the writing really tight and it works really well for uh it'll work really well for Twitter too uh hey team inspired by Hero's videos and focusing oning remember biases will exist because that is how human beings learn let's set High personal lead by example personal example is the ultimate Rebellion let's strive to be better than any bias that's okay that that text text yeah that tweet tweet is okay tweet it's not the best uh take the values from Hermos video and turn them into uh Twitter posts uh with bullet points um and so let's give this a try yeah yeah again again because there's only three of them um we mentioned three or to you only use three key points you can actually ask it to use more key points uh from the video and feel free to elaborate nice awesome so now you're getting something longer now where it starts to shine is like if you if I mean if you're depends if you're using it for writing right if you're using it for key insights you got your key insights but if you're starting to use it for writing you still want to use a lot of your own voice because ai's voice is still like a little cringy mhm and I tend to avoid it being used as a voice cuz like you saw how like the AI is like oh hate team inspired by her's videos I'm focusing so bad so that's how 99% of these these AI writing tools are pretty much so like AI will yeah so like AI will do that and I like to avoid them by using my own voice so when I'm writing the tack that I like to use is I say hey specifically use my words and do not change them and I give it very strict parameters but let's say you're not using it for writing because like let's you're you're a developer you're using it for insights and to learn so if you're watching this exact video that you know you're watching right now and you take its URL you know you grab it and you pop it in here you can talk to you can be like hey what are the action St items these guys are blabbering on about for cursor IDE like why should I use it and it'll instantly tell you and then you can build on that knowledge base if you want to use it or not yeah and then you can of course you can like on the right side we have we created like a almost like a a writing uh platform it's like a notion like experi no experience so you can actually copy whatever you have in the in the right there paste it in boom done right so uh and that will always be there with you so you can expand on it so it's great if you're writing a book if you're writing an essay you name it and it's just a very very visual way of interacting with AI I feel if you're a developer you're likely taking notes so like you when you're watching all this content and you're extrapolating all this stuff you want to take notes just take him here and then if you want to get rid of it and not see it just close it out or open it again yep um anyways if you want to check this out we're working on this product right now so far we have 10 of you join this is super cool we launched this about a week or two weeks ago and now we're starting to share more and more you can go to get poppy. a/ launch actually one we could go yes exactly and if you go here it'll tell you about how it works and it'll tell you what are the things you can do so for example here's a use case of me talking to Andrew huberman's videos and talking about stress and adrenaline um if you want to go down rabbit holes and watch kurs Gart videos you can it understands images as well um here's me talking to Mr BEAST's podcast and pulling and saving myself eight hours yep and so and then I also have a bunch of deeper use cases here that I was just documenting or my team was documenting of their whole life so you know it's like I'm using it to write my life's philosophies and I have a loom video that just takes a boring Deep dive so you can technically understand how to use it better mhm uh here's an example of me planning a trip to Brazil and I literally have these decision like I'm a nerd right so I have like these decisionmaking processes of like for my system on how to book the trips for us mhm and I have all my information about the like all both of our information cuz we're going to Brazil where we're staying pictures from the Airbnb the WiFi password everything yeah so then I can just talk to my GPT I don't have to worry about all this other information yep I can just talk to my GPT and be like how much is our Airbnb and it's like 1,700 bucks for two weeks I'm like what gate or where do I board you will board at Terminal 2 where am I flying what's my WiFi password blah blah blah exactly and also it'll tell me everything um you know if you're doing it for project management you can use it for that like you can see that I pasted literally a image conversation with my friend mhm and it's picking that up so I don't know exactly what are all the use cases you guys would come up with or would think of yep uh but I'm sure that you guys would come up with some amazing stuff and then here's another interesting use case of me being sick and actually using it to create a fitness plan based off of like two Fitness influencers that are really trust and value MH and I basically put their videos and then talked to GPT to formulate a fitness plan that I could do while I was sick yeah so uh if you want to check it out go ahead to this page um we have link will be down below underneath underneath this video and cursor IDE helped us make this so yes let's go we circled it back fully around any closing statements that's it if you guys have any questions let us know down below but on that subscribe like comment we are currently on a very cool Indie called Indie hacker um what is it called Indie hackers uh mode of just building products and building amazing tools so yeah yeah follow us on all social medias and yeah yeah love you guys peace peace
