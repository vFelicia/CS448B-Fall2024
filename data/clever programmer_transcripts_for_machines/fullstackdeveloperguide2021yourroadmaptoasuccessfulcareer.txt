i'm here with your boy sonny and your boy nas what is up everybody guys we are so excited to bring you the full stack developer guide the ultimate manifesto of developer guides for you are you guys ready are you ready guys we are so excited to bring this value bombs to you what are we going to be covering in this sonny so guys we're going to be covering front end development backend development a bit of devops we've got some stuff involved around which language do you pick i know a lot of there's a lot of different things out there like different frontend languages back in languages we're going to go through a bunch of them why and which ones you need to be worried about and take like put your time towards um yeah nice what do you have to say about that yeah it's going to be well what i got to say is we're going to cover the front end we're going to cover the back end we're going to give you guys the road map on how to go ahead and get to become a full stack developer that is the goal here guys yep and guys lots of technologies okay so just to roadmap a little bit we're going to be talking about react javascript firebase things like material ui command line angular bootstrap node making money with freelancing mongodb so we're going to talk about things like c nosql and sql right over here java python and heroku git and amazon services is going to be another one of those things we're going to touch base on in frameworks like vue.js or which editors you should use packages like npm and many more things so with that said guys let's actually just start moving forward so it's gonna be your roadmap to becoming a full stack developer in 2020 um and let me put us right over here so you guys can see us okay awesome so let's move forward now what should they do nas before we continue guys here's what i want you to do i literally want you to take your phone okay take this phone right here right here and i literally want you to chug it to chug it right away from you chug it on your bed chuck it out your window okay smash it out of your window just break your phone well most of all the guys focus because it's going to be very important put your phone under not disturb and let's get this going yep exactly all right so a lot of people are like where do i begin guys first thing we want to say is it doesn't matter just start and we want we do want to talk about what does it mean what does it mean when somebody says full stack what is the meaning of that so sunny talk us through what it means when somebody says full stack so when somebody says full stack guys they're talking about some so we're talking about frontend development backend development and then a few extra additions to that so we're talking about things like databases how you can push information into a database pull it from a database set that all up and then we're also talking about something called devops so some of you guys might actually not know what devops is we're going to go ahead and cover that today and show you why it's useful why people get paid a lot of money to know these sort of skills and we're also going to cover um some interesting things like mobile app development so that all comes under what we call a full stack development developer and yeah with that said i hope you guys are excited and here are the salaries guys for people who are becoming developers in united states for full stack developers salaries so if we look over here years by experience united states now it doesn't matter if you have less than one year of experience you can still be looking at about 92 000 a year and between and any more than that and you're talking about a lot of income like 136 000 or more now i know a lot of you guys are gonna be like but i am not in united states how can i do this doesn't my life suck uh no i mean like you can still get jobs in different places like united states remote jobs you guys can get jobs in other countries as well like germany or united kingdom or canada so there are lots of markets that are actually available to you now what are what is what am i looking at over here now is with these top companies so these top companies guys right we got what we got tesla we got cisco we got idc technologies right fannie mae and what you can see right you know the the salary right even though the average salary right now we have is 92k right which you can go if you go for those top companies you're you're looking at 173k 148k 145 so you're looking at around 150k average 70. my bad we were blocking it but now you guys should be able to see it yeah it's just simply insane from what from literally from that's a crazy salary right so yeah just something to definitely something to think about yep let's move forward now what's this sunny so on this page uh my screen's a bit slow so front end versus back end and we're looking at the two people slapping each other [Laughter] so this is a very interesting image okay guys you're going to have a lot of like heat between front end developers and back end developers but what we want to show you today is that if you actually go ahead and master the skills of a front end developer and you pick up some backend developments because all you flip it around and do it the other way whichever side you prefer we're going to show you why that's so valuable and why you can take that skill and run with it with that said guys if you're interested in learning frontend development i'm actually going to be jumping on a react coaching call inside of proper javascript right now so the link is in the description and with that i'm going to be hopping onto that coaching call right now if you're interested to go check it out and i'll leave you guys to go and crush this hey peace out sunny yeah peace out sunny thanks for jumping in guys and if you guys give it up for sunny and just smash the like button for sunny all right smash the like button and subscribe break that like button all right now finally nas can get his uh logo underneath him peace out sonny boom there we go popped in place all right hey hey we got more room for each other bro look at all this room what am i gonna do nice let's keep it rocking and rolling you guys so let's start we're going to start off with front end now let's take it away all right guys so the three most important things guys when you're thinking about front end right you're thinking about the front end view right what you see on the website and that includes what that includes html that includes css and that includes the javascript and those three are the most important things that you guys need to learn as the base foundation for a frontend developer beautiful okay i tried to give you some nice words that went along with it and now here are the job opportunities and salaries for developers so we already checked them out and i just want to show you guys some more so keep in mind guys i know a lot of you are have less than one year of experience in coding so that's why we want to show you opportunities where even with less than one year experience but a lot of hard work these salaries are possible for you okay and there are 45 000 jobs or more available right this second for developers and even if you go on a platform like upwork and just type in the word javascript for example you'll see a ton of job opportunities available to you guys so that's gonna be really really huge all right let's keep it moving forward okay so what am i looking at here with the stack overflow so guys check this out so stackoverflow does surveys every single year at hundreds of thousands of developers and javascript html css you know are literally always for the past few years have been at the top of the list right so that tells you it's just the popularity and the growth the most likely you're gonna have as you know as as the years go by and you know in the next five ten years right so i think that's just a lot super popular and it's important now what i touched on earlier for you guys it doesn't matter what countries you're in you can still be part of these job markets you could be part of usa part of canada germany united kingdom so your country doesn't really matter whether you are currently in you uh your uruguay or kenya or you are in dubai like it doesn't you know or saudi arabia or wherever like turkey your country doesn't matter you can always work for these types of countries if you want a higher paying salary and guys here are the top companies that are actually using javascript so what are these companies here now i got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay groupon right tesla netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal insane guys and half of them we already built clones for half of them already so oh yeah yeah building tons of clones for all of these now guys if you guys are enjoying this video and you want to do help us and do us a huge favor we want this video to go out to as many people as possible so please if you could just go ahead and smash that like button and just with that we can send this video out to so many other people who are trying to become developers get promotions land their dream jobs or become freelancers and start their own companies and we can all do that and be a part of it just by hitting that like button so this video goes out to them now moving forward this is overall just so guys front when we say full stack it's front end combined with backhand so let's dive into front end first now when you look at front end nowadays it it has gone like a little bit more complex than it used to be there's a lot of things you guys have to kind of know about for example of course you have to know about html css and javascript but within css these are some of the things you might have to start knowing about within javascript you might have to start knowing about frameworks like angular vue js or react i mean we will talk a lot about react a lot of our channel is pretty heavy on react as you guys will see in libraries well do you want bootstrap material ui or semantic and then in tools are you looking at npm webpack and chrome dev tools those are all and that's just that's not even all of it you know and in this video we'll go deeper into it but this is just to kind of show you guys the overall road map we're going to be looking at when we're talking about front end go ahead nas all right so guys good question what can you do with javascript first things is you can build web applications right so web applications include things like guys facebook that's a web app right we can build native apps i don't know if you know tesla the actual app for your ios and android is built with react which is insane right and you can also build server apps so server apps are your backend applications using node.js and those are very popular as well right exactly they're super powerful and now let's get into the technical nitty gritty so when it comes to html just learn the basics make a page make it work don't over complicate it so keep it simple and just get started now moving forward when we're talking about css vishal thank you for the first donation really appreciate that buddy learn how to use different layouts flexbox responsive design media queries and this is going to be part of css as you guys like learn it and then in javascript nas what's happening what we got we got obviously we got data types right so like your var your lat your cons right you've got your functions and the es6 is a very big part of it right so you have to know all the new es6 standards you got dom manipulation you got scope you got your fetch api you also got your async of weight yeah so much along with that but very important as well yeah and we're talking about es6 and those things we are also talking about things like for example you guys have probably seen these arrow functions you know that's just like a little example of what we're talking about okay cool so let's move forward now we're not going to cover too much visual and design stuff because in our if you guys want to go deep into our front end developer guide we did produce one last week i believe you guys can go on our channel and check out our front end developer guide and we just go really deep into a lot of front end stuff and this one we're gonna get to more of the back end stuff so then we can give you guys that as well so definitely check that one out now when we're looking at what is a framework [Laughter] you know what is going on here and oh by the way bojack joined um profit with javascript yesterday and he actually just said in the co in the chat he goes really loving profit with javascript so far thank you bro that's awesome i appreciate it that is amazing i was super pumped when i saw him join yesterday i was so happy wow so awesome now let's keep going so we remember we touch base on some of the front end stuff and we will touch on frameworks now so now the most popular frameworks are which ones nas we got angular obviously right then we also got vue and then we got our favorite one quasi react hey yeah and i think you know what one as you can see from here right a lot of companies are using the all three frameworks are both very popular you got for example angularjs used by companies like the guardian upwork paypal sunny react gs airbnb instagram by ubereats and then ujs alibaba grammarly giblet and guys and so much more that's just the starting of it right um so yeah all very important all very uh popular uh frameworks yep and i wrote which one is our favorite i wrote it underneath which should you choose so when it comes to framework there's a big war between the most loved frameworks the most dreaded and the most wanted under the most wanted you will see my beautiful friend react.js it is by far the most wanted and then underneath it you will see other ones like vue or angular django and all of that now all these frameworks guys are super powerful they're really really powerful but react right now is on this type of trend like you know those exponential curves that they taught us in school angular is a little bit on the downward trend and the view is doing okay the reason for that you guys is angular is a lot more opinionated and it's a framework view is a framework react is actually just a library so it's pretty much like you're just using javascript so it's extremely lightweight and then it's super powerful which is why companies like instagram and facebook are using it so this is the trend that i was referring to you guys can see here is react and then here is the react curve and this is modern according to google trends and these are actually the downloads per year and then you guys can see where downloads from where i think i don't know actually not exactly sure but here's angular i think sorry the thing is just download the general just downloading the actual library itself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what yeah um so there you go so when you think react you know react for the win so that's what we're going with and it has a really nice componentbased design to it so nas go for it yeah so one of the big things guys in react is all about managing data that's you know that's what kind of sets react apart from a lot of these like framework frameworks and it's something called redux and it's a little bit hard to understand but we're going to go to there so let's go ahead to the next thing so redux context api that is when you were able to for example properly you know store data think of it as like you know data a local data of your on your application and then kind of use it throughout your whole app so whenever you change one thing for example on the one side of the app right another thing will be able to change as well so it kind of talks in sync with each other exactly and managing data in react you guys can look into mobx as well which is kind of like next level of things but it's bleeding edge but you know it's just something optional for you to look into and as bruce buffer apparently says we have tons of live bills that we've put on youtube and you guys can check them out so we actually did a zoom clone build we did spotify clone build with react we built tick tock with react we built youtube clone with react we built tinder with react and we build a bunch of other things like netflix would react right over here and we built instagram with react and a real time chat app for facebook messenger and just yesterday we built slack realtime chat app with react so guys if you are looking to learn and react you are in the right place or if you're looking to learn just javascript in general you're in the right place yeah and i think and if you guys have any suggestions for us on what you want to see in terms of next like a next clone in react literally drop that in the comments below yep take it away nas all right so back in development so let's get so guys front end development was the first thing that we cover right that is the first part of full stack developer now the backend right that is the backend part of the application so that is the server side part of the application and so and this is like the salary of the backend developer individually you can see 127 k average salary which is pretty much comparable with the front developer just maybe a little bit higher now yeah exactly even a little bit higher sometimes yeah yeah so huge keep going all right so with backend development guys what language do we use right that's a good question so there's a lot we have python we have javascript we have go typescript rust java and so much more but i think we'll kind of differentiates back end is like now is what frameworks are we going to use right as you can see python's top one javascript's second so let's see which ones we can actually what frameworks go along with those languages so node.js one of the one of the most popular ones interestingly enough guys netflix yes netflix actually uses node.js for their whole backend structure the whole backend development structure so node.js next thing we have what let's go keep going let's keep going and so javascript as you can see right javascript is node.js and javascript allows us to do frontend and back at the same time right that was react right for front end and then back in is with node.js so very popular with that yeah so javascript can the great thing about learning javascript is it's kind of a hack like it's a little trick you're essentially learning front end and back end at the same time so if you get a javascript you're kind of getting good at both simultaneously and that makes you a full stack developer basically yep yeah and yeah keep going yeah next thing we got we got another big big popular language and then we got a bust programming language then that was next one go link java right and then yeah golden java and now at this point we've covered the let's now talk about how we store data that's a full stack developer yep so now guys here we got sql that allows you to store data and then we also have no sql on the other side so when we're talking about storing data in very basic terms think about it like a video game where you have saves and you can have checkpoints if you couldn't store data you couldn't have all the likes showing up under your instagram post if you couldn't store data you couldn't come back the next day and your instagram post would be gone yep so essentially that's storing data for some reason it took me the longest time to understand what a database was because it always just sounded complicated super complicated but it's really just a savings checkpoint in a video game okay and if you couldn't store data you won't be able to see this youtube video oh yeah yeah exactly that's a big point and so if you have so nosql database right what's cool about those is they are highly scalable they have high availability really fast performance replication and then big data capability so let's go up to here nosql and then we also got c so this is when we say nosql and sql these are the two that we got right here all right these are the two things so it's always a thing that people are debating between which way they want to go sunny and i often times kind of just go with firebase which is essentially no c it's a nosql and a sql hybrid which we'll talk about later but you know sql you got your relational tables in sql also you have to have all the tables and columns kind of predefined whereas in nosql you have a lot more flexibility you can map things out on the fly so if you're building things for your own self honestly i think it's a lot more fun to use nosql just because you're not really bounded by a lot of things and you can kind of play around with data and all of that and um and then yeah if you can switch it to a sequel at some point if you want yeah but i want to make a small addition guys both are important and both are important to learn a lot of companies are using nosql a lot of companies are also using sql so yeah definitely consider that too right like nosql you know no they're examples of nosql are like mongodb right mongodb and then you have firebase things like that and then sql you have my sequel you got postgresql yep yep those are two two top ones yeah so they're like really big all right and then you guys got graphql which is you know you start getting into the api type of world but i think graphql is important to learn there's mongodb firebase now uh nas you can talk about this so what is firebase and why is it so useful for full stack so we touched on guys that firebase is what it's a nosql database right but the reason why it's such a big part is because it is actually something called so actually go go to the right go to the right keep going keep going one more time it is a real time database that means that as you update things you will be you can basically create realtime applications like you know messenger right clone or whatsapp clone really easily without having to do like crazy you know coding or anything like that and that's what separates firebase from a lot of these other databases exactly and i already know a bunch of people are messaging like hey why don't we use aws and probably a lot of you are thinking if you have a choice guys between aws on one side and firebase on the other choose firebase the reason is firebase is just a easier aws yeah that's how i put it okay it's easy simple aws it has pretty much all the functionality you'll ever need okay look firebase is being used by companies like instacart and twitch so it's not that it's for little people or just if you're making a small app you could build very powerful things with firebase but we like to go with it just because it's so much simpler and easier i've done both aws and firebase and i choose firebase all the time just because with aws there's a lot of admin headache you have to deal with there's a lot of dev op stuff that you have to learn about which you know as a developer you kind of just want to develop and move forward and we're going to talk about a lot of other things with firebase as well in just a second so for example it is scalable so if you want to have 100 million users or whatever your app will scale to match that yeah and um this is what is the real data realtime database that firebase has and then if you want to even add things like machine learning or whatever you can actually just add that with firebase i'm sure just like aws has those types of functionalities and the really powerful thing about firebase you guys is you can build full backends without even doing anything with node without even doing anything like that you can actually just do cloud functions and cloud yeah cloud functions allow did you know this by the way now i didn't even know this honestly oh really so yeah you could actually do full on everything like if you want to build a payment gateway with stripe sunny and i actually built it with uh firebase with outfit that's insane okay okay yeah so you guys can do everything with just react and firebase and literally have a scalable app to 100 million people and you know just handle everything like that firebase can also do storage for you so if your app has images firebase can optimize those images or media files for you and handle everything so this is why you know i really am a big advocate for it it's just like how aws has lambda firebase has cloud functions which is essentially the same functionality but just much easier to and you um user friendly nozzle you want to touch on this yeah no as a firebase is application it's like a really simply set up you know app to be able to authenticate or like log in you know you can log in i'm sorry i have to cut you off for a second your audio is cutting off maybe you can turn off your video and your audio would be better because your connection i think is dropping a little bit but i will i will speak to this point a little bit guys so authentication you can do all types of authentication like google facebook twitter github email or even phone all of these types of authentication you could do with firebase you guys and it's so easy it's all like few lines of code and one click of a button and boom you have google authentication built in as a matter of fact yesterday we built a clone for yo what did we build a clone on frankie yesterday what did we build look it up um slack so yesterday we built slack clone so realtime chat app using firebase and that clone that we built even had user authentication with a using firebase uh with google it had google user authentication so you guys can definitely use firebase for all of these types of things as well yeah thank you guys for reminding me everybody's yelling at me they're like slack hendricks is slack current is slack so thank you guys so much appreciate that all right so nas can you speak now let's try it so talk about this maybe cloud functions and let's see if your audio is working yeah so you know cloud function is basically it's you're able to create similar is very small functionalities and hopefully that you probably guys can hear me well now very small functionalities it's kind of like aws lambda functions except this is now with google and so you can create what kind of what kind of small applications can they create with that quasi you could create actually as big of applications as you want like crazy so i mean you can literally build a application like twitch using so this is guys this is getting into the world of server serverless um and when you get into serverless architecture i think this is where all modern development is actually going and if you guys want to be on the true bleeding edge and be one of the most highly paid and sought after people please start learning all serverless as of today as of now because your app can scale and you don't have to pay for anything that's not being used so if you have functions in your app that are not being run if you just host them on let's say heroku well you have to pay for every single function every single line of code that you have in your app now contrast that with using cloud functions unless a user actually activates that function uh maybe like let's say they charge their card and you have like a stripe function that runs to charge their card for the transaction that piece of code will not run until the user interacts with it it's almost like it's sleeping and then as soon as they use it boom now it runs and it gets activated and you get charged for it at that time so you can take a big company and instead of them spending 100 million dollars a year you can cut them down to maybe 50 million dollars a year just by moving to a serverless architecture and it's so much more scalable programming like this is a lot more fun a lot more bugfree and errorfree so really look into serverless architectures and again your app you can build as massive of an app or as small of an app as you can think of using cloud functions yeah yeah so let's move here now firebase also has all your storage okay so basically you can store everything all your media can be stored here and then it also can help you optimize your images and videos as well so i'm gonna move on to the next and it has your regular analytics that you expect to see in your app and it has all of those built in and much easier to use than aws you guys i built applications with aws and to this day i'm trying to figure out how to use the freaking cloud cloud log or whatever it's so freaking complicated dude it's very complicated man i still myself like have a hard time with this all i know is how to launch an ec2 instance that's pretty much it yeah and i don't know why they don't just make everything super super simple and basic but with this you guys it comes built in so as long as soon as you launch app you don't have to do anything it automatically adds all the google analytics from start of your app and all the react clones that we actually built have google analytics installed in them and it tracks them and then when it comes to testing this is the best set of testing suite that you could ever imagine it could literally test your app concurrently on like thousands of different types of devices for you and then it tells you the results of all of those tests and lets you know if there's any problems with it or if it's not responsive or whatever there may be and yeah so you can do a b testing with firebase cloud messaging inapp messaging and uh you know it's time for firebase to sponsor us so guys please reach out to them yeah fire come on let's go yep so somebody's saying yep people can one use firebase for production yes you can use firebase for production you guys this is why i'm saying like instacart right instacart uses firebase and twitch uses firebase and a lot of big companies use it and somebody said how much uh does firebase support sms whatsapp push notifications or or twofactor authentication so push notifications that's something else you have to look for something else for push notifications but firebase will be able there to to save the notifications there so um yeah and in fact twofactor application as well you can just set up factor auth with firebase because that is where you have google authentication you know facebook authentication and both of those support to factor off exactly now you guys i do want to mention one thing if you guys are interested in learning about all of these things like javascript and you are also interested in let me actually take you off nas just because i think it's gonna cut you off so you can quit your video actually if you want okay if you guys are interested in learning how to become a developer and go from zero to your first one hundred thousand dollars and whether you do that in six months twelve months or three years or five years i wanted we wanted to put together a full road map for you a stepbystep guide so what i recommend is definitely go ahead and check this video out we've put together a free exclusive training for you and it's called top three mistakes to avoid when becoming a javascript developer and it gives you a full roadmap how you can take your javascript or any coding skills and then turn that into cash so the link is actually in the description below and you guys can just go ahead click register at the bottom and register for this training and again it's a free training just super value packed so i did want to let you guys know of that hopefully that is valuable to you with that said let's continue so firebase guys it's free fast and easy to use alright so as easy as that now let's talk devops nas all right guys so what is devops now if you actually have an idea what it is drop that in the comments below but in general what devops is it is how my friends is how you go from developing an application to actually then putting it to live right think of it as like let's say you just developed facebook right and you want to put a lot for everybody to see and use right the whole process between development to putting it there is devops right and that includes things like for example right like building it right so if you right there right yeah section and then you go ahead and go to continuous integration and then go ahead and go to deployment and then you operate then you get feedback right and based on feedback you can then continues and continues and continues and if you go to the next slide and we're gonna touch base on all of these types of technologies as well so like you're gonna need to learn about things like docker or kubernetes or jira and you guys might have heard of selenium or jenkins all of this type of stuff right gate github gitlab all of these are things that you kind of have to know like git for example is a need every developer needs to know this so let's move on to the next one yeah for the this one what is continuous integration now right this is where you guys we talked about get right this is where your your version control of your application so think of it like that's where you store your code okay so that kind of it all kind of comes from there then your code gets uploaded to github okay from github what we can do is we can actually do unit testing now what is unit testing kazi unit testing is you basically take any part of your code and especially if you guys are doing functional programming you want to write tests for it and they should go and test if your application or your functions are behaving how you would expect it to behave so let's just say you made a simple form with user login where they could click enter their username password hit login and enter the site now you might have a test running using selenium or cypress data or whatever testing unit you want to use that testing thing will go and open a browser type in the correct username type in the correct password and hit log in if that works your test will pass if it doesn't log you in it will go your test has broken so then it will alert you send you a notification maybe on your mobile device a notification on your slack channel so the entire team knows that there's something wrong and then you know that you have a bug and then you can actually start fixing it so unit testing is really important because especially once your code base gets bigger and bigger what if you have i think it's easy to keep track of if you have 100 lines of code but what if your application you're working on has 10 000 lines of code or 1 million lines of code very hard to test it unless you have unit testing built in from day one and it's basically there guys so that to prevent any problems when it does go live okay from a unit testing you have code analysis so you can actually basically check hey how did this develop write the code wasn't clearly written or wasn't written and so you can you can get kind of there code and now then what you got you got test coverage so it appears first in a testing right and what happens here is that how much what percentage of my code is covered with testing with unit tests right is it fifty percent understanding is a seventy percent yeah and if if a certain test coverage passed right a lot for example other companies i was i'll just say really quickly a copy that i worked with we had to make sure that we had 70 test coverage right if that was passed then the last part what we did is we did a what we did a release okay that is when the application goes live and and so guys that whole circle that you see that is continuous integration a very big part of development and actually a lot of fun i'm not kidding i actually love it it's a lot of fun like especially if you get the hang of it test driven development they call it tdd yeah it's a lot of fun you guys once you actually learn how this thing works because oftentimes what i really like about test room and development is it can actually help you write code instead of be your enemy so the right way to do it if you want to do tests everybody has a different way but what you can do is you can actually write the test first i'll give you a very simple example let's say you wanted to make a sum function that just took a and b and combine them together so you could give this function 1 and 2 and you should get back a 3. now you could actually write a test case for it before you even start writing this function and that will tell you somebody like reading the test and let them know like okay the data types this should take is numbers it should take two arguments it should return what the result should look like of what it should return you can see at it in the test cases so then when you're actually writing the code it makes it very very clear for you uh on what it is you're trying to achieve with your code it makes you very thoughtful of it yeah all right let's keep going let's keep going with that all right so let's go so github introduced something called github actions and now it's now it's built in um with continuous integration now have you looked a lot into github actions what the little still i hear a lot of people like in the development blood people still aokay so yeah but it's pretty it's pretty clean guys how it like allows you to do lots of workflows in an automated way something to definitely look into anything any times you guys have new releases of things i think it's good to kind of jump on it even as a hobby play around with it because if it's something truly useful it can give you a big edge on other developers like one big thing you guys can do one big thing you guys can do is like for example let's say you just pushed your code right to github you can create a github action that will right away deploy to like right so that's just something that you can you know wanna you can use yup exactly now let's continue so let's talk dev stuff now there are lots of different things like design libraries so the big ones are material ui semantic and bootstrap these are the most popular libraries ever and they all actually support react and they have native react you know things that are built in so you can actually install bootstrap into your react app and then use it natively or you could install material ui natively and use it with your react app so let's continue now what is node and what is npm nas all right so guys right that node is the backend kind of the framework back in applications okay and npm actually goes hand in hand with node to install packages so let's say there's a maybe there is a reaction there's like a bootstrap you know uh package you want to install or maybe there's your ui package onto so npm is there to manage all your packages that you need to install and that's pretty much it honestly that's the difference the difference between those yup exactly and now a lot of people have a fight between npm or yarn guys just pick one they're both amazing and that's just honestly on npm and just pick npm you just just continue with it yeah that's it just pick npm and you're good to go now which code editor should i use adam i've used adam i've used sublime i've used visual studio code sublime [ __ ] sublime just because of how many times it asks me to pay for it um adam is really good but you know you know what i'm talking about right now is that yeah it's okay there we go yeah guys give some fire down in the comments for vs code yep so vs code then extensions are so easy but if i could just name one extension that puts it above everything is live yeah like just that one extension will clearly prove to you why vs code is superior to pretty much every other editor out there on the planet just that alone but there's tons of other i'll i love it for it's lightweight along with its being super extensible i can install vim with one click and i'm just up and running and so much more so vs code is the way to go and here are these extensions you must use these are like highly recommended so first of all i would highly recommend you guys get live share especially if you code with somebody another one i really like and use a lot is prettier so this is for every single time i hit save my code automatically gets formatted brackets because when i switched over to javascript it was so annoying how many squiggly brackets and semicolons you guys have in python it's all within indentation so it always confused me just to all the squigglies like which squiggly is closing which squiggly you know it was like give me a headache this solves that problem because every squiggly or every bracket gets every parentheses you have gets a color and then you can see oh the red one matches and closes the red one i'm good to go and the last one here that i want to talk about is uh so of course live server get this extension as well so then you can just have kind of hard reloading built in and then this one is the react one for es7 snippets and this allows you to do cool things where you can actually write in something like rfce hit tab and then boom it just like writes a full component for you in react so that's insane yeah super nice so those are the so the in when it comes to linters and formatters you need is you know prettier we talked about it and then eslint and then seven snippets and we've talked about this live code sharing or pair programming super useful for that and now you might be asking how do i learn so how do you learn nas and what are we seeing here yeah guys so the first thing the first and easiest way to learn is obviously going to be through youtube just as you are doing it here guys you are learning through a youtube platform that's number one and second way is going to be through what let's keep going on the next slide that is going to be through community yeah a very important i always say that community is probably one of the most important things that developer can have so right so for example join a slack community of developers join a discorded community of developers a facebook community linkedin community internet community any of those communities you're going to connect make friends and also learn a lot but hold on hold on give it a second give it a second you will have the opportunity to potentially even get a job as well that is the biggest one okay and then with those communities in mind the third community is going to be what let's keep going the next one amazing community all right take it our community is lit as [ __ ] let me actually show you guys let me show you um actually a nice transition into our community nice slides whoever did them i think sunny huh so guys look at this community it's always just lit like sonya deep just shared his experience and he goes an elearning company here in my country paid me paid him to take youtube sessions to learn coding that is sick so boom there is go ahead and somewhat deep actually you guys don't don't know here but somehow deep actually got a job at expedia whoa are you serious yep yeah we get a job at expedia as a developer i think two months two months after joining javascript after joining profile javascript bro oh that makes me so happy bro i know right guys i gotta get on a call with this guy guys give somebody give somebody but like a like or give somebody a high five in the comments below because he's killing it let's party for something deep you guys i know we don't have nas here but i'll do the dancing for him hey hey let's go let's go wait wait wait oh [ __ ] nas is here wait okay we can see you in the middle nice so guys samia deep this is awesome guys the community is just really really great so you guys can see whether you're posting technical questions we are responding to you and helping you out or you guys can be posting and sharing your wins the coaching calls homework assignments guys at the end of the day look it doesn't matter i'm just going to get real with you here doesn't matter whether you join the profit of a javascript community or any other community what's important is that you become a part of a community you become a part of a family essentially if you think about dancers how they get good at it is they join a dancing community people who become really people who become really good at anything are parts of like community they're around those people who have the skill that you want to have or did they want to have and so that's the key thing here for you guys that's the thing that is important and kazi how can they join the community like this by the way oh if you guys want to join our profit with javascript community it's very simple you guys you can go to this page over here here is the link at the top the link is going to be also in the description but it's our course called profit with javascript and really the biggest thing about this course if i can just give you one thing is that we actually you know of course we give you the technical training and the live calls which are huge but we actually help you make an income with it that's our number one goal we want you to have your skills on this side meet practicality and ability to make an income that's profit with javascript in a nutshell so if you're even slightly curious go ahead and check this page out and watch this video it's lit and with that said let's just jump back into the training dope dope dope now what is tutorial hell now people talk about this often do you know about this i don't know about this i've been there guys if you let us know in the comments but basically it's just you want to become a developer right you're learning a lot of new things and at the same time what's going on is you're just watching a lot of youtube tutorials one stop one after the other one after the other and so you definitely definitely want to get away from that right build watch the target at the same time build a project joining another community so i think nas is slightly wrong on this one i think what this actually is is once a developer passes away and they were a bad developer that's where they go to go to tutorial hell now guys you want to master the fundamentals all right make sure you master them and don't move past until you master them and this is everybody's nightmare i think this is actually what happens when you die as a developer and you were a bad developer you know this is what your eternity just loops over again and again and again so things like this make sure you understand them like what is a git merge and how to deal with it i i i think that if you i honestly think that if somebody's an expert at git merge they can just get a job just for knowing how to get merged as an expert yeah definitely good like i feel like it's that important or get pushed you know push or get pulled you know exactly and here we got we got some other stuff uh steve says no they become a project manager that's hilarious the hell did i go to now why you need to know get and hit up github you guys get is how i think of it is a time machine also in a video game you have saves and checkpoints when your character dies wouldn't it suck that after you spent 10 hours into a game you would have to start from zero that would suck that's why developers invented uh savings and checkpoint so when you your character dies in a video game you can start from the last checkpoint when it comes to get in your software if you don't do that you're not really saving along the way so if your code breaks at some point application breaks you can never go back to when things were working and you're permanently screwed and the company can lose millions of dollars but if you understand how git works essentially just like a time machine so you can actually go back in time to when things were working just fine and you can also be working with other developers at the same time working on three different features so developer one can be working on the ability to add user login developer two can be adding the functionality for the app to be hosted online or or something right and then at some point they can actually merge both of those things at the same time and now both of those functionalities are added simultaneously into the app so git is an extremely important thing to learn and one important note i want to make is get is i repeat not git is not github yeah well wait so what is the difference i thought it was github so the difference between git and github you guys is github is literally think of it like dropbox for code think of it like google drive for code you just save your code on github that is it get is what is version control so if you get in an interview and you don't know the difference i will come and fire you yeah good luck good luck i online version forget that's pretty much it yup exactly now what is a pre processor you guys so preprocessors are things that allows you to process your css so there are things like sas and they gave you some additional functionality post css and less what was cool what's cool about them is they can allow you to do really like fancy things in a fast way and they also give you ability to add in variables to your css but a lot of that functionality now is coming natively where now you can actually just add variables in your css so nas do you know what the point of using a preprocessor for you would be yeah so for sas we actually initially enough we actually went over with this in a recent coaching call but the reason why you you would use for example like sas or last or post css guys is because think of it as like it's like i see it as like css on steroids and it is what makes css scalable meaning you can write huge application with css right for example for example one one big thing you got to consider is like bootstrap or material ui how do you think they are written they are written with sas right because there you can have variables you can have mixins we call it right you can have it's like basically having javascript functionality inside css oh that's actually a great way to put it so javascript basically javascript in css almost yeah functionality in css nice okay hopefully that makes it really clear for you guys i think that's a great explanation for using these types of things like sass or less yep beautiful yeah all right let's move forward now style components nas what are these so style components that is what we have in react right and basically what you would do is you would create components and you would actually style the components within javascript right so when you build react applications um you don't necessarily build you sometimes you build sometimes you do have css within css files but sometimes you can also have css within the javascript file too that's something you should guys look into like if you're gonna learn react you're gonna learn style components yep and react uses something called jsx which allows you to be able to do all those things in javascript as well exactly dope and then we also and what are css modules uh the css modules that is basically you can create i i like to call them partials right so you can so for example if you have sas that that you know if using sas you can create kind of think of it as like you know a module for variables in css you can create a module for you know a specific you know let's say let's say it's you know the header right yeah and then you can create the main module we call let's say you call it the main module and then main module what does it do it imports all of the other partial modules okay so the header module the variable modules right it's almost like component based like how to react yeah it's like component based css almost yeah but yeah you basically split it up and that's it yeah so think of it like uh how components are to react right css modules are to css so kind of like that you guys could use them exactly dope and then we have bam have you ever used spam and ons and do you know what a good reason to use bam is so guys i actually have never learned about bam until somebody came along yes talks about it all the time sunny is a very big proponent of that yeah so yeah cause actually you go ahead and talk about it because i know i know you you've had dealt more with it at this point with yeah i use it a lot more i use it with sunny a bunch and bam guys it's a really clean way for having naming conventions it will also allow you to do things in a way where they're like you won't have conflicts as your app starts to scale it will have co naming conventions that are very very sensible and the name itself most of the times will make it extremely clear what it's doing so it's going to be really good for debugging it's going to be really good for other developers to be able to read your code they will instantly understand what all of your css designs and what all of your classes are meant to do so definitely learn bam it's going to help you out tremendously yeah and what's pwa by the way guys we are almost at a thousand likes guys let's get that to a thousand i think we're 800 right now come on let's go we're at 954 yes yo guys we're at 954. if you guys if you guys could help us break that thousand like mark that would be huge thank you guys so much and we're currently at six six six people live the devil's number what is happening wow oh i think maybe we were talking about tutorial hell and we started detracting like a javascript satan oh man we got to be careful now now what is this pwa stuff yeah so that's progressive we call this guys progressive web applications okay and the and we i like to call them as one page apps right so if you think about it actually actually for example facebook is a progressive web app netflix is a progressive web app youtube is a progressive web app yeah why is it a progressive web is because it's actually one page but when you go to different like for example it's actually one think of it as one html page right but yeah but as you go to different pages certain blocks change yeah so guys did you notice for example that when you go for example on youtube did you notice that you when you go to for example video the header pretty much stays the same right the header at the top is the same yeah that is what makes it a progressive web app yep because it's one page and only certain components change as you kind of go to a different you know a different page on this site itself right yeah and yeah and it's very popular nowadays it is basically when you're going to learn how to become a fullstack developer you're going to be learning progressive applications super powerful and i think let me see actually so features of pewa it allows you to make full responsive and ads in browser compatibility it has connectivity independence so your app can actually work offline as well it has a app like interface can you can add it to your home screen it has push notifications which for some reason are only for android right now so i think apple needs to step up their game and then it allows you to make it fast using service workers now let's go on to type checkers and this is always a big battle between things like typescript and flow so typescript is essentially just think of it like a supercharged uh javascript yep okay because what typescript is you guys is if i was to draw it out right if we have this here and then i'm gonna make another circle inside of it yeah now the smaller circle inside of it is javascript the bigger circle is typescript so technically speaking typescript is actually is a superset of javascript so by definition oh crap my thing is blocking so now you guys should be able to see it so by definition it's actually javascript and then some and what it allows you to do is add in a lot of type checking that you know a lot of people really like languages like java it's strongly typed you can see what data types are going to be returned with every function it is a lot less buggy when you write your code and people love that functionality so they thought about how could they actually bring that to javascript so then it's less buggy more scalable and they introduced typescript yeah yeah so for big companies actually it's actually it's very popular so you know when you're thinking about tesla are you thinking about all these companies who are using react they're going to be using typescript yep omkar says now we see our path is slowly lighting up thank you so much for this session yep now let's go yeah you guys can learn typescript and you guys so felipe asks should i learn start learning typescript instead of javascript now remember it's up it is built on top of javascript so there's no way you can detach the two they're both the same typescript is just more but i would say but i would say my recommendation to to felipe because that's another question first right javascript first hundred percent typescript could come later don't worry about that just yet yeah yeah just get really good with javascript you guys and then move on to it and you guys can use it now so this is the fight that's happening between typescript and flow and we know who the winner is you guys another word for typescript you guys know another word another way of saying typescript it's actually hype script oh isn't it um damn man where's my sound stuff go i wanted to play the freaking air horns who stole my sounds all right i'm gonna play it right now all right there we go so yeah so typescript is super popular and the trend is just going like stupid which is why a lot of people are actually calling it hype script so i would i would just if i had to pick between the two i would just pick typescript and call it a day okay yeah yeah i'd agree with that let's move on now people talk about dino what's the hype about knowledge do you know about this you want to speak to it you want me to talk about it i don't know too much about dino guys okay cool so there is npm right there's npm and npm was pretty awesome but then the creator of npm was like hey man i found a lot of weird things about npm and i want to like take it to the next level and then he ended up creating dino but until it takes off and it starts being super popular and big companies start using it guys keep learning npm because npm is not going to be going anywhere anytime soon as a hobby and for fun you can start picking up dino just for you know you want to do something cutting edge new shiny object but keep learning npm guys keep learning npm and just keep stick to npm for now now webpacks you want to speak to this yeah so webpack guys is you know it's basically think of it as like it's a task manager for javascript so you know how you saw a lot of those like preprocessors so webpack is what allows you for example to use sas it allows you to for example magnify javascript so when i say modify i mean like compress javascript okay and this is what allows you to build you know progressive applications or single page applications okay and the reason why that is is because it's like a layer above your application okay so it runs the server right it runs any tasks that are needed in terms of like processing your css processing your javascript processing your html all that stuff webpack does and you know it's definitely one i would say i would say one of the biggest like developer tools that's used in you know in big in applications hundred percent yeah nice okay so definitely so when it comes to learning this should we say definitely learn this hundred percent web so in the case there's a few there's webpack there's golf and then there's grunt webpack is the biggest one highly recommend you i would say focus on that one so focus on webpack yes okay got it awesome so focus on webpack and then you guys can learn about other ones too but webpack is the most popular yep beautiful and then dev tools nas what is this do i need to know chrome i mean why can't i become a developer without knowing devtools bro what are you talking about oh man man chrome chrome chrome guys if you don't know chrome dev tools i don't know man um let's just say that you have to understand how to use chrome debugger how to use you know chrome console and just being able to use um chrome as a way to debug your website okay just take your lives at that you know so you just need it for debugging yeah super powerful and guys i'm just going to give you one little hack anyway so learn console.log which is very important and here's another one console.table use this one guys it's just like this is like a little pro tip i'll throw in there yeah amazing for visualizing your objects and arrays as a table and it's just such a nice little trick you guys can use yeah and console the log everything also the log your life yep yeah all right react so using the react profiler have you used this now do you know what this is i have not used react profile now okay guys so use react profiler and now native apps and react native guys if you do if you want to build native apps it's really easy to do it to react as pretty much all the apps that you build with react are almost native and ready to go and be translated into a mobile app anyway yeah i think i said react actually tesla app is built with react native oh really tesla is yep yep okay damn let me put that tesla build damn nice okay cool so let's move forward now electron is for desktop apps and uh here are some of the things that are built with electron.js okay so electron is it allows you to build desktop apps with javascript okay build holy i'm looking at right now right now so vs code vs code which slack what slack you didn't know that what no way yeah all of this stuff i was actually just gonna like write all of these out that they're all actually built with this wow insane yep and um steve is saying something awesome he's like about 75 only about 75 is usable from react to react native so if you want to make something completely native that's something you guys should learn which is react native itself and um oh i know what the profiler is guys i'm sorry i don't know why i acted like an idiot where so the react profiler it is a chrome extension you guys can get and you can go to pretty much any app and use it in your chrome uh where you guys have your chrome console and inspector tools you can actually have a react profiler and it allows you to see how that app is built you can see all the components and everything along those lines okay so i see yeah so electron js is pretty damn sick to to learn i think you guys should definitely take a look into it if something along those lines interests you to make desktop apps now we're going to get into testing frameworks so now let's go for it yeah so obviously there's there's three three types of testing we have number one unit testing number two integration testing and then three functional testing so jest is definitely what is one of the testing frameworks that you can use for example for example with like react okay and then if you if we keep going on uh enzyme right you know you can looks like airbnb actually uses jest as well to test to test their code because their application is written in they're even using it to test their ui yeah yeah yeah yeah so some very a very powerful powerful tool there yep so support for hooks and the one you guys should use which is actually like super highly recommended and one of the best is this one cypress so if you guys want to use this is actually even better than selenium you guys so if you want to use something use cyprus.io for testing gotcha and allows you to test anything that runs in a browser and then of course you have selenium and there's also selenium for react so you guys can use selenium to test react apps and then there is something called server side rendering so a lot of the times if you guys want to go from a you know if you guys want to get to that senior level developer server side rendering is one of those things you guys should actually really learn about and understand and one of the tools you can use for it is called next.js so this is i was going to say vishnu vishnu has just donated 40 i'm not sure what what how much money that is 40 something did you see that yep thank you so much vishnu for the donation really appreciate you and let me see i'll take you guys to next.js actually and let's actually take a look at that website so boom here we go oh it's by versal nice okay so this is what it is it's a react framework for prerender sites and it's the jam stack for the enterprise so you guys can see it has file system routing so i can actually like switch between app really really fast and it will do all of the rendering and everything server side so then when the user goes it's extremely fast the reason to learn it is to make your apps really really fast at a very high level in an english version of server side rendering is it's like a cr it basically allows you to make super lightning fast apps okay and think about it think of it as like you have a cached version of your app like your whole html app yes it's the cached version and you're right away displaying to the user as the as they are loading it exactly it also has next.js also has automatic cloud code splitting so if your app is online and there's bunch of stuff that's not being used or a bunch of files that the user is not using it will upload them without uploading those things so that way it's going to be super lightweight as it gets uploaded it'll know like whatever is not being used it just won't upload that for those parts so that's super powerful will save you a ton of space and make your app really really fast so why use it it's good for static exporting prerendering it requires pretty much no configuration on your end it's fully extensible allows you to do css in javascript it is ready for production and here are the companies that are using it next.js so trulia netflix github twitch docker starbucks hulu and the list goes on so definitely something you guys should look into and then here i think that you can even go to their showcase and uh they show you like what are all the so here's like jobs.netflix.com page is built with next.js yeah so you can see and you can see basically just how fast it loads all the data right away yeah right again because it is a static pretty much site let's see what type of jobs uh netflix have because i'm about to get a job there bro i'm about to leave clever programmer let's apply yeah let's apply forget about these live streams yeah uh i mean over bye guys yeah guys sorry i'm gonna apply here all right so let's go back do you guys want some music in these live streams guys what are you guys thinking because i'm thinking we should start adding some music to this thing and make it a lot more like upbeat maybe some dubstep in the back savage i'm just gonna be i'm just gonna be dancing all the time man yeah i want to add music to this stuff bro he goes you guys are doing great really looking forward to learn and enhance my technical skills from you guys thank you so much appreciate you all right somebody asks how to choose between client side and server side you there's you're going to have to learn both if you want to build full stack applications yeah and some there's a client side first and then learn server side trust me yeah run learn yeah exactly that's a good order to do it in do you want to speak to static side generators nas yeah so static slide generators is it's kind of kind of what you guys saw with next js but imagine you kind of have imagine you have a website right that shows some data right um well what what happens is that excite generator will actually take the data from a database create a static html site and then we'll be able to display to a user okay yeah and again the reason why we do this is because of speed okay so instead of us trying to go every time a user tries to get some you know a site instead of us trying to go to the database grabbing grabbing data from a database and then you know show the html the html is right there displayed for them and so that my friends is why kind of like you use aesthetic side generators yep exactly now there are the most popular static side generator right now is gatsby very very powerful i think helpful to learn that this is for server side so this is next.js there's jekyll next is i believe it's basically like next js but for vue you got hugo gatsby so one thing i'll recommend is if you want to do static site use gatsby if you want uh speed in a dynamic app that you're building and you want more scalability pick next js so i think between these these are the two i would recommend for you guys yeah and it gatsby actually works very nicely with react as well so that's true yep so there you go and uh if you guys are still not sure how to get started uh let's all we can talk about how to make money as a developer so this in we covered this in a lot of detail in the last live stream we're not going to go too much into detail on this but one of the ways you guys can actually make an income is by teaching coding to people and i'm going to just list out some platforms that are good for this if you guys are interested you can pause it and view this but i already covered a lot of this in front of developer guide so i'll just talk about like some resources you guys can go is facebook groups instagram wise and take lessons people per hour craigslist upwork fiverr or linkedin or some other ones you guys can take a screenshot of this but these are really good resources for going and getting jobs as a developer even if you're a beginner and you don't have actual job because getting a fulltime job guys will take you a long time will take you you know most for most people it takes them one to two years so in the start i think what i recommend is you learn coding and then you can teach it to other people and charge them whether they're high school students college students boo they're going to coding boot camp you can definitely help them and just with these two platforms alone wise and and take lessons i personally before i started clever programmer was able to scale my income to 104 000 per year and then i added in craigslist and this is where i started actually i used craigslist to freelance and i started adding and with craigslist i was able to take my income even above that so i i would use it to land contracts or freelancing clients so that gave me another source of income and those are the ones i really really recommend for you guys as well if you guys want to go more on the freelancing side then you can go heavier on upwork nice number two way of making an income from coding is how nas freelancing guys so that means basically you are a person and you are getting work by yourself from clients right so you're going up you're using websites like upwork like freelancer.com like toptail and you're literally just kind of going there seeing what work needs to be done and then applying and then saying hey guys hey hey client i can actually do this work and this is how much i charge and that's pretty much it so it's very it's very much different from because it's just like basically it's project by project basis yep exactly and then of course you guys can go the route which is step three for a lot of people is getting a permanent job or you know even if it's not permanent getting a fulltime job essentially and so that's really like level three like if i had to put it i think you could teach people as a beginner um number two you can freelance as kind of intermediate developer and then i think for full time you need to be a little bit more advanced because nobody's going to like want to pay you a lot of money if you're either not advanced or not you know have some experience so freelancing and teaching how allows you to get that experience i'm going to also go through this pretty fast but i think that you should go in this order learn coding then learn to coach and that should put you at 3k per month income learn the freelance that should put you at 5k a month income so this stacks on top of each other so this 3k and 5k you should be at 8k a month and um and again guys it's very rare for people but if you actually follow this roadmap and put in the work it's very possible for you and then if you have a job you can be making 7k a month from a job but at which point you could choose to keep all three sources of income or say no to all your clients say no to all this and just be happy with the 7k a month or you could keep your freelancing plus this and now you have 13k a month coming in or you could choose to say no to your freelancing keep some clients on the side they're teaching coding to and this and now that puts you at 10k really like whatever flavor suits you but the potential if you put in ridiculous hours of work and time that your potential income could really be 15k a month or more so with that said you guys if you guys want to be able
