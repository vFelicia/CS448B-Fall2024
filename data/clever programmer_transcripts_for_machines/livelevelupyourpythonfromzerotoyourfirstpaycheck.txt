hi YouTube hey guys what is up how's it going this sis Kazi from clever programmer comm we finally figured out how to go live we had our computers crashing we have to like change the laptops we had to like get a new like install all these software but that's good hopefully we got it we're about 1 or 2 minute pastor a time but other than that it should be good in this livestream we will be helping you level up your Python from zero to your first paycheck so if you're a complete beginner you're in the right place if you're intermediate you're in the right place and if you're somebody who's even more advanced but doesn't know how to get that cash and get those clients for your skill set you are in the right place how is everybody doing today so I'm asking you Instagram I'm asking you Facebook and I'm asking you YouTube how is everybody doing ya know for now and just enjoy but tomorrow we're gonna the course is gonna be launching tomorrow at like midnight Chicago time and if if you're in India or something will be earlier thank you thank you since Instagram likes to hear me gulp I got some kombucha I got some kombucha today guys on YouTube if you guys want to check this out it's really good energy I don't even know how do you define this thing here's what it says on it renew rebalance rebuild reclaim rekindle and recharge hopefully that gives you guys something on this but of how I liked it but it just gives me a lot of energy and it's weird it doesn't even have caffeine or anything but I like it so whatever alright okay it sounds like everybody is doing good people are like nice haircut Kazi awesome Diane Jones is like I make my own kombucha awesome if you make your own feel free to send it out to us just look up clever programmer on instagram we have our office address feel free to send us a shipment of kombucha and we would love it oh there are some people that are getting confused this is not the actual big webinar okay this is a live stream where we're gonna I'm gonna tell you what the webinar is about and I'm also gonna take on your questions like question and answer so this is a lot of oneonone interaction you guys will get with me today Instagram Facebook YouTube and then the live webinar goes tomorrow at 11 p.m. so tomorrow at midnight almost 11 p.m. is the first showing and the second showing so there's one showing it's Sunday night 11 p.m. and then the second one where I go live is Monday morning at 11 a.m. yeah this guy's this webinar is gonna be really really cool spent a lot of time putting it together and I'm gonna be there live we already have how many people do we have registered so far yeah we have almost 2,500 people registered for this webinar just to put it into perspective the last time I think we did a webinar a really big webinar we had about like 700 people I think like 700 people registered and we're right now two days away from the webinar so we still have two solid days to go so with 2500 people I expect about three four thousand people to register and then that's it so it's pretty much one day one day and like 15 hours left to sign up and so yeah I recommend that if you guys are here the link is in the description bio on Instagram Facebook the link is at the bottom and go and check it out alright go sign up to it and show up to it I'll answer your questions there as well and in that webinar what you guys are gonna be getting is you know there there was part one of my video I launched the profitable programmer masterclass and so it had part one where we found out your Python earning potential and we found out like what the job market is for Python developers we figured out your lifestyle and then in the second one we figured it out why most programmers or write too many programmers are broke and how you can avoid it and in the third one what did we talk about Mustafar oh yeah he's making a cigar story cool so yeah if you guys are following us on instagram if you see Instagram story some of it is me some of it as my friend must have fought but in the third one we go a lot deeper into giving you the Python client getting system so I give you how to get clients and what's a fullon roadmap from getting a client attracted to you all the way to not only getting your money but putting that testimonial on your portfolio so in the webinar if you missed all three of those videos that were epic and you shouldn't have missed them but if you've missed them on the webinar we're gonna have we're gonna cover kind of all those videos in a short time we're gonna cover what they were about the most important points oh yeah and in the second video also you hand you a portfolio as well and then after that I'm gonna talk about my new course and my new course launches tomorrow or actually in two days but tomorrow I'm gonna be talking about my course on the webinar as well okay and taking your guys's questions so right now I will take on your guys's questions and then we'll go from there hi hope for all oh yeah the other day what I did on Instagram was I went live on Instagram and then I just you can apparently go live with other people on Instagram and so what I did is I just went live with a bunch of people so there was I talked to pre Nam I talked to Oprah all I talked to to other people their names are slipping me but yeah I just went live with them and then what Instagram does is it splits the screen in half for both of you and you're live and you're interviewing you're talking with them and everybody else in the audience can hear you so I'm answering your questions live it's a really cool feature and also Instagram was built off of what who knows what Instagram was built off of what programming language was used my friend here is raising his hand if you guys know type it in in the comments all right uh crew Todd Patel crew ptarth yes the varam says both Sunday and Monday webinars covers same topics on two different timings or two different days yes they're both they're just different timings but they cover the same main topic since I'm live I don't know what kind of crazy should I'm saying on either of the webinar knowing me I'm always like I'll go on these crazy tangents and these like deep thoughts so if you miss one or the other I don't know there might be some material that you miss but the main topic will be there okay so the main thing you won't miss if you join wear it one or the other okay cool we have a lot of people saying Python so it looks like these people know the power of Python that's really good yep Instagram is made off of Python and that's what we were using to go livestream with them um let me ask you guys some simple Python questions let's see where your guys are at and it's okay if you guys are completely at level zero or never written a line of code before because again that's what I'm here to help you with and my course is here to help you whether you're at zero intermediate or maybe even advanced because we had advanced web developer and her name is aframe she she's awesome she was on we did an interview with her and she saved her company over twenty three thousand dollars with Python after taking my course so even if you're experienced you could still get a lot of value out of it now let me ask you guys some Python questions let's see if you have to put a bunch of things all right somewhere what data type would you use okay so let's say is just like a bunch of student names and it's Bob and Billy and John and dadadada the list of student goes on what data type would you use to store that information okay just a simple question all right Sam good job Sam you got it yeah Sam is is in my in my course so I'm not but Sam I'm disappointed that you're saying the word irate because that's a more java word but other but no your idea is right okay cool cool cool cool so most of the people said Nicholas says in a notepad no but in Python what data type to be used so that's funny yes everybody who says list good job and the list look like those brackets okay so it's like how am i imagine list to be is like a bucket and you just throw a bunch of things in there I have this plastic bag here so you can just imagine a list to be like this plastic bag and I take my infamous Mike you guys know this Mike and I just take it and boom I take my kombucha and I throw it in there boom this paper bag in Python we call it a list all right we call it a list now when I put things in this bag when I put this when I put this in a bag does the back here about the order of it like meaning if I put a lot of things in here and then I go back and look in this bag is it really easy for me to take out the things in the same order as I put them in oh and everybody who says we're a good job array is the right answer as well there's just different way of calling it okay yeah okay so we're getting a lot of people saying we got somebody on Facebook saying no Matt MEC says not unless you remember the order on Instagram and then we have people on YouTube saying no and nope and no Adi Bakar Bukhari Deathwish and Keon hope yeah so you guys are right there is no way to know the order maybe unless you remember it but it's too complicated like a plastic bag doesn't care about the order so a list though in Python remembers the order you put things in okay so imagine if this plastic bag had a way of telling you which thing was on position one which thing was on position two and which thing was on position three okay it remembers the order now can you guys think of where we would use something like lists in real life like let's say fate like on Facebook or Instagram or you know some some website that we all use where do you think you could give me an example of where a list is used in Python okay Justin says friends list on Facebook that's really good example Spotify to arrange the songs that's a really good example Sam kyon hope I butchered your name I'm sorry I'm sorry such as our life my name always gets messed up unfortunately friends list some people are saying storing names shopping listing and ecommerce storing contacts storing data keeping track of book index friends list on Facebook names phone numbers emails okay what you post on your timeline on Facebook very good student profile okay good good you guys are now getting the idea okay yes like images yes good good good so on on platforms okay again if you guys have something to write would you write this [ __ ] down this is exciting okay so you know exactly where a lot of these things are used so then when you're learning about it in Python it's not just boring and it's like I'm just learning about list a datatype structure it has more context and it's more fun so okay so let's take something like a list right and on Instagram you could use it to store images now if you put things in a list it's not like a paper bag right because in paper bag you don't remember what order you used but list remembers to order now the order is important because if I go on my Instagram I want to make sure that my recent pictures are at the top and my oldest pictures are all them at the bottom where else does order matter when I go on Facebook and I look at everything on somebody's Facebook wall I want to see the recent Facebook post at the top and everything else at the bottom right the oldest Facebook post where else is order important when I order when I was put things into my shopping cart I want them to be in the right order or when I review my recent orders on Amazon and see everything that bought I want to go down the list like boom boom boom boom boom and see which thing was purchased when you know what's the time of it so those are some examples in real life wirless reviews now how about Netflix okay we have all these movies we got to store them somewhere so maybe we could use a list for that okay so always be thinking about this however in somewhere like Netflix we don't necessarily care about the order that much okay so maybe my gain is a little bit low iPhone storage full all right let's see hello hello hello um how is the audio doing on YouTube are you guys able to hear me clearly or is it a little low yeah what Steph says I love Netflix yeah what's up bro how's it going tenzin just joined my live stream on instagram it's my good friend what about creating an MVP for your company mmhmm sorting good Bharath seems like it seems like Bharat Bharat knows a thing or two about what we're talking about okay we have somebody asking for different books so I'm gonna give you guys a book okay don't go anywhere hold up a second all right don't freak out I'm right here got a book this is a book recommendation I have used this book to learn Python and this is a book I'd like to recommend to people so for the people who are asking for a book here you go that's hilarious so Tenzin just said just at Walmart doing grocery my grocery list doesn't care about order it's a little yeah so your grocery list doesn't care about ordering doesn't need to if it had to care about order it would just be inefficient and because it ultimately wouldn't matter so yeah there are other good books out there like learn Python the hard way what I most love about you Kazi it's your mic god Paulo broke my heart okay say it's clear what about learning Python the hard way yep luck [ __ ] that is a good book I am a fan of this to be honest because it goes through like building actual projects I mean learn Python the hard way does as well but I'm a fan of I don't know I'm just a fan of this you created these games and stuff and I like it you know I kind of nerd out on this book a little bit you create like tennis simulations and here's just a rule of thumb with books I talked with my good friend Ben marks he works at Google and he writes code and Python every single day and he was telling me that when you are using Python or sorry when you are learning coding and you're trying to learn it from a book one of the best things to do is just go to a book with a lot of exercise and my friend um Jude said the same thing okay um Jude is one of the founding engineers at code Academy and if any of you guys have used repple it or have seen me use droplet repl i.t um Jude was the founder of it okay so um Jude also says find books that just have a lot of exercises in them so if you're gonna get a Python or coding book just pick it up and just go through it and just see how many exercises it has and if it looks like you're working on a lot of handson exercises and projects then you're in a good place the author of this book is john's l jo hn ze ll e john's l ha was ml hi how are you doing man how's it going I love the way you speak English so much it's easy to understand you're the first speaker I can understand what you say without using subtitles beautiful um yes I I sound sometimes crazy in real life trying to enunciate every word so clearly but hopefully it comes off clear to you guys and you guys understand it well so thank you for letting me know that and that helps me try to just focus on speaking clearly more um you could get the book from Amazon somebody just asked where do people get the book from you can go on Amazon and get it or I don't know if you have some coding stores nearby I it's such a thing exists the coding stores if it doesn't then we got to open it I mean guys after this course launch is over we're gonna be trying to open up a coding store near you yeah Graham you know it grinding on a Saturday night got a date coming up soon but whatever you know it's its grind time baby you guys are more important get it from PDF okay I want to learn how to code but all the courses are in other languages any suggestions Python is awesome again my course is gonna be opening up soon so if you are excited about it you want to find out more about it how the course works what it covers what kind of practical applications we'll be building how I'll be showing you where to go and get your clients how I'll be showing you how to land those clients how I'll be giving you the exact roadmap to become a developer in 90 days it's hard work it's hard work don't get me wrong if you think this is like oh I'm just gonna go there and it's just all gonna work and I'm just gonna make money it's just gonna shower on me that's not gonna happen but if you follow the roadmap and you work on the things that I'm laying out for you since we're gonna be learning and building practical stuff at the same time by the end you're gonna be ready to get that job so if you're interested make sure to show your face on that webinar alright the link is in the description below I'm gonna take out take a little time out and have you guys register for that webinar because that webinar is awesome it's called level up your Python from zero to your first paycheck I want to get all of you guys in there and give you all this mindblowing content there's something you don't want to miss out so on YouTube once you sign up you know type in one Instagram once you sign up for this webinar the link is in the bio type in one or say I signed up and same thing goes for you Facebook once you sign up say that you have signed up that's hilarious some people would like to learn for their own company purposes while I'm asking hold on what was your question maybe I missed it hi marriage how are you doing hamish body yay haha Jesus yeah the whole family's here that's awesome are there any iTunes U courses you would recommend unfortunately I never took any coding course on iTunes U but I can recommend you a podcast it's called slipping my mind programming throwdown I used to listen to that all the time in when I was going to college and I would be taking the train and I would be like I would have my headsets and be listening to programming throwdown they talk about like and advanced stuff and some of it is not even relevant but I just enjoy it a lot I know my friend Tenzin he hates it and he hated me for recommending it to him but I don't know Mike out on that and I enjoy it okay cool Azim says I've signed up good good good good we got a bunch of people saying 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 good good good what kind of skill is required everybody wants to know the price of the course that's I'm also gonna tell you guys the price of the course it hasn't been finalized but if you're on the webinar you will find out okay everybody on the webinar you will find out what level of skill is required if you're talking about the course you can be at zero skill never even Thank You Renee that's awesome thank you for writing that but yeah if you even have zero skills you're good one and a half day he'll have too much time ugh [ __ ] yeah I know you're excited buddy but don't worry that time is almost here and we're gonna be launching it soon and so at this point guys if you're here sign up for that webinar once you're done signing up for the webinar make sure to go and put it in your calendar I've even set up and this was a pain I had to literally make an account on Twilio and go through all this other stuff but I I made it so you guys even get like text reminders so make sure that you know you put in all that stuff in the webinar when you're registering and then put in your phone number as well and then I'll personally send out a text to you so that you can get a reminder before it starts the webinar you don't need any skill level to come to the webinar you can have zero coding skills even if you're more intermediate or advanced that's totally okay we're not we're not coding in the webinar all right let me see best website to learn Django there are a couple of good resources for Django one of them being one of my good friends Justin Mitchell from coding for entrepreneurs and he has a lot of stuff on Django and he also has a YouTube channel on Django in this course we're gonna be covering a lot of Django so yeah I think this will be the best Jenga course available we'll be going we're and but in this course we're not just covering a framework we're covering like how to actually do web development with Python so while specific frameworks are important I'm gonna be showing you guys how to become a good web developer and then I'll help you choose your specific framework so we'll have some stuff in a framework like flask and then we'll have some stuff in a framework like Django awesome we got a lot of people signing up for the webinar great how many people do we have now registered for the webinar good job somebody else just registered awesome it's good to know let me actually or actually hold on oh no I don't have my phone thank you thank you thank you let me let me get that bad boy let's see let's see here what is going on okay okay sweet so we are about to hit the 2500 registrants mark that's good so if you guys have signed up good job awesome I even have a special video that I'm gonna be making for you guys that you people who registered on the webinar are gonna get no no I'm not cool and then for everybody else if you haven't registered go register and yeah and if you send this out a cool email or something will try to read it live on the webinar yeah we got lots of comments on that profitable programmer master class we hit like over a thousand comments we had about 20,000 plus people watch watch right at about 20,000 plus people go through the profitable programmer master class yeah that was insane that happened last week so if you guys missed it not a problem if you come to the webinar we will be touching on those you won't the whole thing isn't gonna be there but we'll be touching on the most important and meaty things from that because I know a lot of you might not have that much time a lot of you might be busy so that's gonna be your best chance now let me ask you guys another let's do another Python question should we do another Python question all right first of all let's do that should we do another Python question for you guys yeah seem knowing knowing Opie's good ok it's still hard to hear right ok um I just moved the gain up a little bit more do you want to have like a headset in or something so you can hear it I don't know if you're gonna get do you think you're gonna get feedback from this no like the annoying feedback okay yeah check it out all right cool so let's so let's do this okay so what about if you need to store information and again guys these questions are basic and even if you don't know them that's totally fine but it's starting good to start thinking about this stuff so let's say that you have you know where what kind of data type in Python would you use to store let's say names and then phone numbers that go with them okay so you have name and then you have a phone number then you have another name and then you have another phone number so then when you later want to look it up you can just try to look up the name and they'll give you the phone number that's associated with it so what kind of bucket in Python would you throw that into and in a little bit I'll make it a multiple choice so for those of you guys who totally have no idea that's okay you'll find out somebody's had sequel hold on you're getting a little advanced and we are talking about Python right now okay cool so we actually have a bunch of people who know about this datatype awesome awesome so we have somebody saying dictionary array is not the right answer Muhammad list is close but it's not list so it's either between lists and dictionaries and since I just said it's not list obviously it's not list so yeah everybody who said dictionary good job okay not a big deal if you didn't know this one but dictionaries where you can just put a key we call it four and that's your in our case we'll put the key as a name make the key whatever something that's easy to remember so we'll put name as the key and the value get out of it as a phone number now on Netflix on Netflix the key would be the name of the movie and the value might be the actual movie itself okay can you guys give me some realworld examples of a dictionary of a key and a value maybe it's I don't know in groceries store you found it maybe on Amazon maybe on Instagram maybe on something else can you give me an example of where we might use dictionary in real world student number spotify everywhere walmart price list I have no idea some people are saying some people are saying snapchat let's see username and passwords okay good registration and login that's another good one okay so that's a good way to think about it your username is a key and your password is the value all right phone contacts same thing the name is the key and the phone number is a value so if you go down the list and then other things in real life if you look up a specific order and you click on it maybe the price is the value okay so in real world we have lists and dictionaries being used all around us even though sometimes when you're coding and they're teaching you about data types like lists and dictionaries you can't relate you're like what how are we using this in real world so it's important whenever you're learning something have that you know that context in mind you know have the real context of why you're doing this and how this could be helpful to you and for dictionaries the symbol is like this okay in Python I'm just gonna type that in for you guys so it's kind of like a squiggly squiggly thing yep good job Sri SRI's EV MJ Saudagar pricelist azim says student ID good bus ticket good job yep curly braket good what does that joke how does it go why do Java developers wear glasses who knows this one why do Java developers wear glasses man this kombucha is good did you look this up huh nobody on Facebook got it ah okay we got first person on Instagram who got it good we got somebody on Instagram who got it as well another person to see the brackets good andreas got it Muhammad Farhan got it good Ibrahim got it Grundy got it as well good yep it's because they can't see sharp mmhmm Java is hard I mean don't get me wrong all these languages are good and pop and useful and powerful right but my biggest problems come with don't care somebody starting out and they're learning why to do something like print hello world the easiest thing on the planet you have to make a class and you have to compile and you have to learn how to use the terminal and there's not a good place to just run it in the browser like what's up with that that's my problem when it comes to languages like Java C C++ and all these other languages they're great but why did they make it so hard like javascript for example makes your life pretty easy you could go in your Chrome right now and run JavaScript and boom you're running it and then Python is the same way you can go to a simple website like repple it and there's a terminal and you get instant feedback and you can be running your code ok you could go into your command line and most of the most of mac books or most every Apple product every Apple computer already comes with Python installed and then on windows installing it takes like 2 seconds so even if you want to run it locally and you don't need to make a class you don't need to make you don't need to know how this whole commandline things work you'd pretty much don't need to know anything you can run the code right away cool all right let me take some of your guys's questions Stefan says hey man I have a question for you I really want to learn programming and I really started once but I lost my passion and motivation for for it does that mean I'm not for it or what you're gonna lose passion and motivation and then it's gonna come back it's it's like like I'm Jude said a sine wave it's a horrible way to describe it only people who do math or know anything about math will get it but it's like waves you know you'll get really motivated and you'll be like yeah motivated and then you start going down and then all of a sudden you feel motivated and passionate again and then it goes down it comes in cycles but motivation can be reversed engineered so motivation and passion is not what you guys think it is it's not this random thing that happens by luck all of it could actually be reversed engineered and you could turn into a system and make yourself be motivated and passionate so for example as human beings we are really dumb okay we are really really really really stupid as human beings here's what that means whatever is happening around us influences us and what you think are your thoughts aren't actually not your thoughts at all these are thoughts that you have based on the environment that you're in the people that you're around the media that you're consuming that's what is that's what those thoughts are actually comprised of they're not your own they're just a mixture of all these and that unique combination that gets marinated that's inside your head that's what you think is the unique you and are your thoughts now knowing that we could be really depressed that we are really stupid or knowing that be really happy because we could reverseengineer it a lot of things in our life so for example if I feel less passionate or motivated when I'm driving I don't listen to music because it's a waste of time listening to music it's sometimes good if you're using it to get yourself palmtree of working on something to get yourself focus but if you're driving it's just a waste of time why not listen to books on something like audible why not when you're in a train and you got your headsets in or you're doing a commute listen to books and you could listen to books that motivate you or talk about coding or programming that's one thing you could do here's another amazing crazy hack that's lifechanging when you are at home and you're about to eat your food why waste all that time just sitting there eating food looking at a wall or what do some of us do we eat food while watching house of cards while watching stranger things or suits or I don't know whatever news channels or cat videos or just you stuff on YouTube or surfing the internet whatever it may be for you instead of doing that why not watch cool stuff you could be building with code or maybe there's a new problem in coding that you've hit and now you're stuck so you're looking up how to solve it or you're looking at coding tutorials and you're eating food and looking at that at the same time alright so if you replace your car time and all that other nonsense just release your music with stuff about coding and you're watching stuff about coding and coming up with new ideas those are the easiest hacks so you can start implementing right now or also you could go to local meetups where there are other people who think about coding who dream about coding who love it and want to build amazing things now this is something important to you and you start applying all three of these things I just told you you know changing the circle of your friends because you know they say the five friends around you right the five closest people to you you're not only just the average of them but quantifiably that it's actually measurable and your average salary is also the average of the five people around you and how much they make okay so for those of you who like to think very objectively like me even if you don't believe that other whole thing about you're the average of the five closest people to you if you look around what their salaries are and you see what your salary is you're like whoa we're all really close that should be you know that should tell you something so if those people are not about coding or not passionate about their life or not trying to reach their goals or not trying to move themselves forward or not motivated and not motivating you and not believing in you maybe just maybe it's time to expand that inner circle to other people and those people who don't care for you or are there for you to make yourself feel comfortable but don't really push you or challenge you or move you to do new things maybe just maybe it's time to cut them out all right so you combine replacing music with books you combine or placing Netflix and the stupid [ __ ] you watch and you waste your time an average American spends 40 hours a week and my phone just died so my live stream is dead let's figure out what's going on with this bad boy but think about this okay average American spends 40 hours a week on TV so most of us complain about not having time we have time we just spend it on a lot of weird things and I'm not putting myself above it I do it all the time that's why I have these things in the back of my head because while I am teaching you and sharing this with you I'm mostly getting the most benefit for myself because it reminds me to do these things because I'm the one also who's not spending time doing the right things so if we can our habits we can reverse engineer being motivated and passionate and being at that level that we want to be at and we don't have to condemn ourselves anymore for not having that passion or that motivation hopefully that answers your question okay so somebody so he just said um you have a wife and she needs time to and of course she does but also keep in mind people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people like Grant Cardone also have a wife but they're run like multiple businesses there are multi millionaires they change the lives of millions of people they work nonstop yet they still find the time to keep up with their health they still spend quality time with their children and to still spend quality time with their family so don't lie to yourself that you don't have time I'm not gonna lie to myself that I don't have time we mess up but we just need to be honest with why we're making those mistakes okay that's where your real change is gonna come from if you can't look at yourself in the mirror and be honest with yourself don't expect anybody else to change your life I can't change your life that person next you can't change your life and if you're not gonna be honest with yourself you can't change your life either so start from there start from being honest with yourself exactly where you are in your relationship in your career in your life your friends near you right you're a girlfriend boyfriend your wife husband whatever start there and just go through the list and see what level each of those things are at are you happy making the money or making every year are you happy being able to just go from paycheck to paycheck are you happy doing things in a way that's average where you know you could be doing better if you're not then there are things that need to change and to start that change you need to start by being honest with yourself okay because if you make excuses and if you let yourself off the hook and you say things like oh but I have this too so that needs time too while that is true you have those 24 hours if you juice them and you melt them you can get a lot done alright you can get a lot done like I'm gonna tell you from my personal experience and I'm not amazing or anything I am you know I was a dumb college kid and now I'm just a kid who's trying to run clever programmer and make sure you guys get massive value out of it but when I was building clever programmer you know this is the fastest channel to go from zero to a hundred thousand subscribers for coding ever how did that happen was was there magic involved no I was spending like hundreds of hours a week I was still spending time with my family I still kept up with my friends you guys still see my friends in my Instagram Facebook stories on snapchat and even on YouTube and even on my live streams from time to time I still kept up with my family I still kept up with my friends I still had a job I was doing I was a coaching students for programming and chess and video editing and all kinds of stuff and students from 20 years of age to 60 years of age students who were going to kindergarten to students who were 45 years old and doing their PhD program for analytics and needed to use Python for machine learning I was also playing chess competitively at the time and going to tournaments I was also going to ping pong tournaments at the same time I was building this channel like a maniac okay I was also in a relationship at that time I was also going to the gym I was also getting really good sleep and now we have a fullon company what started as a dream just a hope and dream and aspirations and I was like maybe you know one day people will look at this and get value out of it maybe clever programmer will be able to provide value to other people maybe I can help somebody who's not just me and a lot of these things that I learned I can share this with other people because I was I don't want to hold this to myself because I thought what's the point of being alive if you can't provide value to others and if others don't know about you and what started as a dream a year ago right now we have hundreds of thousands of students on our YouTube we have millions of people of viewers on YouTube we have a lot of people on an Instagram Facebook and we have over hundreds hundreds of thousands of students who've went through our coding courses and people have gotten jobs people have gone promoted at their work people have gone internships for you know as Python Django people have who are web developers have saved their company over twenty three thousand dollars people have become Python web developers and now even have clients people have done things there was a person who was a freelancer CG generalist and after taking my course he was able to do something that was taking the other team in Brazil seven days to do he was able to automate it with Python in four hours and made $1,200 all right so all of this stuff happening and getting people results and making sure to be there with my students and always being there with you guys and listening to you guys and responding to your emails and your comments and whatever things you guys have in your live chat and providing free content for a full year nonstop day in and day out every Monday at 1100 a.m. you would get a video there were weeks where I was making seven videos a week for you guys without asking for a cent I still made time for all of those things right and I'm not even close to somebody like you know all these other people I'm sure they're people who are on this livestream who work way more than I do and are way way way way more productive but I'm just sharing from my personal experience that it's possible to make that time it's possible to have that time for yourself 24 hours is way more than enough in a day but you just need to be true and honest to yourself look yourself in the mirror and go exactly where you are don't lie don't [ __ ] yourself don't hang out with people who just make you feel comfortable because I'm telling you they're not your true friends they're just there to make you feel comfortable and that's it you want people who give you a reality check who are your cool friends and support you and make joke around and have fun but at the same time push you in the right direction and if you have that and you reverse engineer your way to be motivated and to be passionate and instead of listening to music you listen to books and while you're driving or while you're driving driving and when you're watching Netflix replacing that what learning and getting online trainings whether it's on more motivation or selfdevelopment or coding work on yourself alright be honest with yourself and you'll see yourself improving and trust me you don't need 24 hours in a day 24 hours in a day is more than enough time to help you achieve your dreams alright but you just have to start by being honest with yourself my left here is really enjoying this is it coming out of only one year you heard in both yours right okay um guys at this

bonuses you'll only get if you are on the webinar all right and I'm gonna give you a hint on one of the bonuses this is the bonus that helped me land my first client with Python in less than 90 days and the same client who paid me twenty thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents for less than two months of work I'm gonna and that's what this bonus is related to and that's just one of the bonuses there are other bonuses that you're gonna get if you come to this live webinar so make sure to sign up cuz there's gonna be a lot of valuable things you're gonna be getting Kazi is everything awesome mmhmm how did you learn Django my mentor helped me honestly because all these online courses are just absolutely confusing and either too advanced or to beginner ish and more some of them are just all over the place so yeah my mentor inperson helped me and then not only what I learned from that mentor but that inspired me to refine it and create the system and the road map for you guys so now I want to share that with you huh Cinelli ask what will the time be on okay's video ended in UK I'm not sure the exact conversion at the top of my head but if you go to my webinar registration page so the 11 p.m. one will be 5 a.m. in UK and what else so one is 5 a.m. your time in UK and the other one is 6 hours ahead right I assume so it's a 11 a.m. then it should be a 5 p.m. so one is that 5 a.m. for you in UK and the 1 is that 5 p.m. for you alright yeah and so it's the same day for them for UK how about India can you check their ten and a half hours ahead of Chicago time okay so 1030 a.m. for the first webinar and what about the second time so the second time is 930 p.m. for people in India okay so 500 a.m. to 500 p.m. for UK those are the two times for India the two timings are 1030 should be 930 a.m. and 930 p.m. right to 10 and a half hours ahead all right so it's 1030 a.m. in India and then the next one is 1030 p.m. so those are the two times oh my timezone is Chicago central Chicago in Chicago so it's CST okay Central Standard Time so 11 a.m. in 1100 p.m. so November 12th 11 a.m. and November 13th at 1100 am too many timings sorry basically for me it's this Sunday night at 11 p.m. and then Monday morning at 11 a.m. awesome Constantine says I signed up it will be 11 a.m. for me so I'll be fresh and energized good don't put Monday and Sunday because for some people both of them are happening on Sunday for example for people in India it's happening the same day and for other people so just put the dates no no no no that's it no it's too confusing oh my god guys seriously just go if you can't figure it out man I don't know if maybe you shouldn't be coming to this webinar seriously go to the actual page we have this little we have this little feature okay because we're software developers we added this little feature that says convert to other time zones click on that and then it lets you convert it to your time zone so you can figure it out or just google it but yet she's got way too confusing the link is in the description so YouTube you shouldn't be doing anything right now you shouldn't be watching this video you shouldn't be waiting for me to say anything it's time to sign up for this webinar all right pause everything you're doing close out all the other tabs go sign up for this webinar on YouTube and Facebook go sign up for this webinar that's what you guys should be doing and then in the meantime I'll answer some other questions as well but boom boom boom sign up sign up for the webinar man I look like a legend drinking that calm butch up hmm all right somebody's complaining about answers and stuff okay let's see Marko's who says if i did not miss if i'm not mistaken since you're learning Python 16 hours a day for two months may I know how much workload you take per day so that's how long yep Renee you're right 11 sorry the other way 1100 p.m. and 1100 a.m. 1100 please just click the link on the description is confusing the hell out of everybody ok damn alright so if I'm not mistaken learning Python 16 hours a day I mean I know how much workload you take per day ok so I was coding a lot every day to get better but it was also because I didn't really have that much mentoring you know I had one mentor who barely got time and then he would help put me in the right path and I had to just do pretty much everything by myself had I had completely like the right path I wouldn't need to spend very minimal amount of time to actually be able to do practical stuff that gets me jobs all right I'm not saying I would be a great coder I would just be a competent coder who can start actually getting practical work and that's a place I want to put you out so especially with my course I want to set you up to a point where and take you beyond this point as well but what I want to do for you is get you to the point where you're learning basics and practical things at the same time so you're ready to get your first client and from there you start actually improving your coding skills and I'll show you what you need to be doing constantly improving your coding skills but the first most important thing is having a portfolio having projects in that portfolio and being able to show your clients that and knowing those practical skills then you can actually land those clients and make that money and get that paycheck after that if you want to get really good you want to learn about recursive Fibonacci solutions or you know do all these crazy problems on project oil or hacker rank or wherever else then you can do them on your own time ok but instead of before getting into the all the nerdy nittygritty I want to give you the practical stuff show you how to get clients start making money so you can relax breathe eat and then you can become a nerd trust me I love nothing more than nerding out when it comes to coding all right all right all right Marcus coos laughing okay fish says I've signed up for tomorrow good awesome awesome yeah move to California man I don't know what you're doing in Kansas California is awesome yeah the website I don't know what you mean by it's designed for US and Canadian citizens only Oh like the time yeah it is but yeah just convert it to your own times guys I'm sorry I'll try to add more times but there's no good way to do it without just adding a massive amount of information on there and confusing everybody so I try to put simple things I try to tell you it's est and then I have the feature to say convert to other time zones or you can go on your own just google it and hit convert to other time zones Dovie says signed up I'm pumped love all your efforts get pumped this webinar has a potential to change your life so I'm gonna say this on the webinar as well but when you come here we're not screwing around you have your phone off or on Do Not Disturb all right you have your other tabs closed and bring something to write with you okay so I have I bring a legal pad all right I have a legal pad where I write it I just stuff into my brain like nothing else so bring something to write with you pen and paper or if not maybe just write it on your laptop but be and do not disturb mode and yeah because this stuff has the potential to change your life it has taken me years to put all of this stuff together for you so make sure you show up and and just get as much value as you can and it's free okay awesome awesome would you say it would be hard for a foreigner to get a job in USA with web development that's a question I get a lot and I've been getting this question a lot from people in India so all my students were in India guys it's no different than getting a job from while you're in US okay getting clients is the same process you can get clients for in United States and UK or wherever else and I show you that in the course so don't be worried about if you're in a specific place you're limited to some kind of you know lower money or whatever okay or you're not gonna get as much work or you have to be stuck with a specific programming language don't worry about that it's the same way and it works everywhere the same way all right and that's the beauty of being a developer because you can work remotely and most of the companies now choose to work remotely Dovie Glassman says man I'm confused is it free or not the webinar the webinar is free the course isn't it's a paid course but the webinar is free so show up to it and get massive value out of it let's see The Drifter somebody's asking me the question last time all right so draft drifter asks hmm I have I misunderstood something or what do you get when you enroll to the VIP waiting list for the 90 days client course doesn't that mean it's free what you get for getting on the VIP waiting list first of all you get my bonus for how I became a software developer in less than three months so you get that bonus video that's one the second thing you get is it says you'll be notified as soon as the course is open so one way to get notified is on live streams which is great that you're here but let's say you weren't here you would still be getting those emails for when the course is open and I would be making sure that you don't miss out on it all right so though that would be the big benefit of signing up for the VIP waitlist but right now there is no VIP waitlist because the course is opening up in just a few days alright so the time is here the time is now keep in mind once the course opens it only has five days until we take students and after that it's over all right there's no more new enrollments even though you have lifetime access to the course but it's kind of like a college class once everybody enters I don't want to focus on getting new students in I want to take that group of students and make them as badass and more as skilled and getting them jobs and getting them those practical skills as possible okay so I'm gonna kind of maximize what we do with that group of students who gets inside within those that those five days and if you come to the webinar I'll break down everything about the course exactly what you will be getting in the course I'll break down what we've covered in the profitable program or masterclass and we'll also have a Q&A section so we take your questions and answer them alright draft drifters Jesus these guys were teaming up Marcus cool and draft drifter love it love it love it love it signed up and bookmarked wife should be we're hit that time so I can pay full attention good job send your wife on a massage you know send her somewhere pay $70 for a nice massage where she could go and get it and in that time you could focus in on the video whatever it takes to focus on the video okay and the girls and the wives in here send your husbands and your boyfriend somewhere and be here be with us be with the clever programmer community and we just really have amazing lifechanging stuff for you guys I mean I don't know how else to put it mmm okay let's see Renee is saying she does bunch of questions so let me see she said you should use government funding to offer it for free I use it to oversee u.s. MVM FG recruiting for a major energy company vocational schools or where it's at Jesus that's just scary to me and I don't even know what that means but Renee is not somebody I want to mess with it's basically a boot camp right but better less cumbersome the idea of this boot camp essentially or this course is I was realizing too many people had jobs too many people had kids too many people had already other other things that they needed to be doing other commitments so this course I designed it in a way where it's just hyper massively practical that's not a word but I just made it up and it's just insanely practical so meaning even if you can spend a few hours in a week and do the things that I outlined you will get results again I want to keep all the people away who think this is gonna be easy and they're just gonna come in and get all these results without putting in work guys it's not that so if that's what you're thinking don't even bother showing up to the webinar I'm just gonna say that right now but if you follow all those things right you've only are looking to spend a few hours in a week so I wanted to make sure that it's for somebody who can use Python for side hustling or freelancing or trying to get a job fulltime all right patty Pugh says yeah I have to kick my fiance off the computer I usually watch you on my phone yeah this one it's ok fiance take the El on this one but you're gonna take many double use later other than that Winston says so will there only be five days to register for the course absolutely 5 days only then the enrollments are closed so keep in mind I've only opened this course up twice in one year I opened this up sometime in April the first time for five days then I shut it down then I hope those students get results then in June we had a team at clever programmer so we had more people than just me working at clever programmer so we opened the course in June and we closed it and we got lots of students and then we helped lots of students get results because also we didn't had a bigger team now our team is even bigger and we're ready to help you crush it even more this time so this is our third time launching it after about four or five months and it's only going to be open for five days and after that we closed it down and the next time we're gonna be opening it won't be any earlier than four to five months okay all right guys thank you so much for coming other I keep looking at the questions you guys questions are awesome and I'm just gonna keep answering them thank you thank you thank you hi Maryam hello thank you guys for coming so much as always I love your faces off thank you and at this point we're well over the 1 hour mark but I want to be here for you guys so that's it thank you guys so much I love your face off and YouTube I'll see you in the next video
