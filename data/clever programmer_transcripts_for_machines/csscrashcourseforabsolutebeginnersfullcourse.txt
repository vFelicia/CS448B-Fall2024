welcome to the CSS flexbox crash course how you make images fit into a flexbox how do you add multiple cats in a row and then when you keep hitting the cat generator button it actually puts the cats where you want them and it doesn't actually go out of the box and those images come into the right place how do you put your age and days or a button like click me and a button like delete and then they fit into the right places right grids and nothing kind of spills over or kind of gets messed up this is your instructor Rafa Kazi from clever programmer comm and this is Aaron also from clever programmer comm and what are we gonna be teaching them a lot of cool stuff CSS flexbox some of the theory about it at first is to go over it but then a couple cool projects all right what else we have planned that's about right so we're gonna go through the theory in the start and make sure you get the theory down and then we're gonna actually build some projects to some mini projects and we're going to be building those later into the video so for now let's jump into the meat and potatoes I have put together an incredible mindblowing threepart master class that will show you stepbystep exactly what you need to do what the opportunity in your life as a Python developer can look like what your earning potential can look like and what are the exact steps you need to take to make this happen in your life please keep in mind this training I've put together for you is absolutely free of charge completely free all I'm gonna need from you is your name and your email address and once you pop that in I'm gonna send this training over to you right away with that said the link is gonna be in the video below in the description so go ahead and click that link I'll also try to put it here on the screen in the video thank you so much for watching as always I love your face and I'll see you in the next video hey you welcome back now what I want to talk about in this video is what the heck is CSS and give you intuitive I always have trouble saying that word understanding of how it works and what it actually does okay so CSS stands for cascading style sheet fancy word I never use it but it all it means is giving your website some design design some pizazz okay so it's like imagine if you are going out to a fancy dinner you can go completely naked that's one way and the second way that you can go is actually dress up in really fancy clothing okay and designing your website or not designing your website using CSS and just having HTML it's kind of like being naked in today's day and age okay it's inappropriate it's not acceptable you'll be judged and your value on the social ladder will be lowered and you don't want that when it comes to your website because that's what will happen online right people who come to your website they won't find you credible they might not hire you as a Python developer and it could be embarrassing it could be shameful and your time will be wasted so you definitely need absolutely need to learn this and know what's the heck this is cool with that said let me give you an example so here is the website with CSS sort of what I just showed you and what it looks like and it looks beautiful the form is beautiful when you click it it goes beautiful blue when you hover over you know gives it a little thing and you hover over you know so it's nice here is the same website without any CSS okay so notice the navigation bar and what happened to that and notice how nothing is centered notice how it's kind of weird and notice that this button when you hover over nothing happens and all of this kind of looks pretty ugly right and like and and check it out it runs from left to right forever pretty hard on your eyes and this is the case for many other websites right have you ever had that happen where you go to youtube.com or facebook.com and you see it like in this format kind of right that has happened to me a few times and why that happens actually is because it hasn't loaded its CSS file and so it'll happen and then when you refresh boom it looks like normal Facebook again or it looks like normal Google again okay and now I want to give you you know now I've give you an example let's just show you how it actually works okay so I like to just open code pen because it's kind of just chill and you can follow along really easily or you can just follow along in your local text editor doesn't matter if you want to know how I put my stuff to the lefthand side I click Change View and I do this left one okay I like that one a lot so let's just take a H let's just take h1 tag right and let's say hello hi there now I can do a few things with this h1 tag I can style it and make it look you know change the color of it for example okay so right now it says hello hi there so I'm gonna change it to another color I'm gonna change it to let's say green so what I can do is inside of this h1 tag I can actually pass in the style attribute and I can say color colon green semicolon save and you can see that the color turned Green okay so this is one way of styling my code and this is essentially writing CSS inside of my HTML code okay another way I could do this is in my HTML I could have a style tag like this and inside of this style tag I can say that my h1 right and why I want to show you this way is because like imagine if I had multiple h1 and let's say I wanted them all to be green well what I would have to do is I would have to add in a style attribute and color green and style attribute and color green and everywhere on my website I had h1 tag I would have to repeat that process over and over again now a cool a better way to deal with this is to say style of the top style tag and then in there actually say that for the h1 tag I want to just color it green like this ok and notice every h1 tag got colored green now there's some important terminology here that I'm going to say now for the first time and what I want you to do is write it down or type it in somewhere and remember it because this is important okay so this is a tag right this h1 that I wrote here this is called a selector so what I'm doing is I'm selecting all the h1 tags now what if I wanted to select h2 tags I would change this to h2 ok this is just a declaration code block so whatever goes in between these squigglies that doesn't really matter and I can I can do more things as well like for example I can change the font weight okay I can change the font size okay so let's try something you know crazy and let's see if it does anything cool it changed the size so all h1 tags from now on are going to be 70 pixels okay if I want to make this color black I can make it black if I want to make it yellow I can do that too maybe you want to give it like some kind of hex code right so I have this Chrome extension that allows me to pick any color I want so let's say I want some color from this page I'm gonna click here I'm gonna click on that color picker and I'm gonna say pick color from page and I'll just let's say pick some random color let's just say I want to pick this white color or let's see if I can yeah let's actually pick this gray color it's a cool color did it pick it did it pick it oh it's not picking it okay let's try this gray one right here okay so it picked the background of this right and it copied it so what I can do is in color I'll just paste that and now you can see that it's the same gray that's in that inside that HTML CSS box that's now here okay so I'm grabbing that selector now I can go further and I can get different kinds of selectors as well okay five for example create a div and I put this h1 you know inside that div or I can call this body as well right so if I have my body tag then what I can do is write in that style I can also say that hey if you're within the then maybe I want to align the text and I want to center align it so there you go so now everything that's in the body will be Center aligned and all each one has the this attribute alright so you can see that that got Center aligned now in this video the point was just to kind of give you a feel for what CSS is and how it works okay at a very basic level now we're gonna get more advanced with it and I'm gonna show you how to create buttons that when you hover over the change colors how to add borders around images how to make your tables look better there's gonna be a lot of things that we're gonna be covering okay so in this video my my I I'm not trying to fry your brain here is just to kind of give you an idea of how it works now one other thing I'm gonna share with you before I end this video is that notice everything that's in the style tag right I could keep it inside the HTML but what if I want to create multiple HTML files well then I would need to paste that style code everywhere over and over again and that'll be redundant so what I would like to do is actually take this code cut it and paste it in the CSS delete the style from there and so HTML then only deals with HTML part and the CSS deals with the CSS part okay so this way your code is nice and segmented and you can easily deal with the logic so your design goes in the CSS file and your rest of your code will go in your HTML file okay so in the upcoming video I'll also show you how to set this up locally how to create a CSS file and Link it to your HTML file and everything and beyond we're gonna do all of that stepbystep that's it for this video thank you so much for watching as always I'll see you in the next video hey you welcome back so in this video we're gonna talk about the setup and how as a developer right if you're working on CSS or you're working on HTML or you're building a frontend project what your workflow looks like but in this I'm gonna just go over it again but it's gonna be like more of a recap so again I got my chrome popped up to my right alright I'm gonna pop open my vs code visual studio you could use whatever text editor you want I just recently discovered Visual Studio code and they recently made it available for Mac and they did some massive updates and it looks beautiful so I just use this now I'm gonna just open a folder so I'll go to HTML crash course and you know I can open up whichever folder I want so I'm just gonna open that one up and let's get out of here and in this one I can create a new folder and start writing some CSS okay so we'll just play around with some CSS and just see how it feels and you'll start to get a hang of it and then I'll even show you that as a developer you're not writing all this code all the time unless you just do front end all the time right you're not writing all a lot of this code from scratch you can actually use stuff from online and other plate other tools you could use and I'm gonna share those with you as well so let's say I create a new file and we'll just call it Kazi dot HTML okay and I will go to my Chrome I will hit command o I will go to github HTML crash course and Kazi that HTML I will open it okay so it's the currently a blank file like I expected I'll hit doc tab autocomplete I will delete that stuff cuz we don't need that for now I will call this new file or new video and I will hit refresh and at the top you can see in the tab so that's that's not CSS right now but I'll show you how to add CSS with it okay so and I'll show you how to link your style sheet as well so now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna create a folder and we're gonna call this folder practice CSS okay and in this folder I will throw Kazi in there okay so I will hit I'll move it in there now inside of this folder I'm going to create another folder and I will call the Styles and inside of the folder Styles I will create a new file and I'll call it styles.css now this is very important how I structured it so pay attention and a lot you know you might make this mistake where you might put styles as CSS kind of outside of that folder or somewhere else so just make sure you're aware of that and what I want to do now is let's say I write some CSS in here right so I'll say hey make all the H ones gonna be color here and I can also do something pretty cool and I'll show you h1 and I can say h1 a and make the color of this let's say red alright so a visual studio again it's pretty cool I can hover over this and click this and like look it shows me that the color of this is red and sometimes what it'll do it is it'll even pop up like color meter and you can just play around with it visually you know like it just brought it up right now I still am figuring out how the heck it actually brings it up but sometimes it brings it up and then you can just control it from there anyway let's go back to our code and Kazi that HTML so in here if I write an h1 right and I say practice CSS header1 this should be this should be green okay so I have to open this file again so I'm gonna because the I change where the file is located so now it's not in this directory any more users clever programmer github HTML crash course slash Kazi now it's in slash practice CSS slash ecology dot HTML okay I can also I could have just went from here HTML crash course clicked on practice CSS and open it from here okay I'm just making you practice with some pads and how they work alright so now we got we got this header over here so let's go to our so now why is it not green right that might be one other questions you might have I hate like hey and styles that CSS you have a green but it's not green well if I actually write it here and SS style equals color green and i refresh you'll notice that it turns green right but I don't have it here I have it in a file and the reason is that that file is not connected to this okay another way I could do this is in the head I could write the style tag that's where actually you would put the style tag and in here I can say make h1 and make the color of this green and now when i refresh it's gonna be green I can say make it red and I can go here and it'll be red ok so let me delete this again but what I would like to do is that keep the style in the Styles that CSS file so I hit command B to hide the toolbar on the left hand side so now when I connect the stylesheet to my HTML how do I do that I just go inside of my head I do style hit tab or sorry go here hit link hit tab and yes it's a style sheet so I'm gonna leave it as is and for the link I'm gonna provide a local link so how do the paths work well currently right I'm inside of kazi HTML so this is a file so I'm gonna go to styles and then inside of styles I want to go to styles that CSS salt styles / styles and you can see it's Auto completing it already and now that style sheet is connected and linked to my current HTML file and if I hit refresh here you'll see it turns green I'll zoom in just a little bit more so it's easier for you to see now what if I want it you know when it's a if it's a link I want this to be let's say red okay and I've essentially done that so I'm gonna show you what that means so we'll create h1 and we'll create a link and this link will say practice or sorry this this link will just not go anywhere for now and the text of this where the content of this will read link header 1 so you can see that the link has a header 1 that's red okay and how I did this is I say hey dig in to an h1 tag and if that h1 tag and if there's an a tag or a link tag within that h1 then color it red okay because I'll show you if I have a normal a tag and it is like normal a tag like that look it looks like a normal link okay whereas the header one looks a little different so again these are the you know h1 is a selector and I can you know use that to select it and I can do the same thing and take even further right so I can say that h1 or or I can say that for h2 link on hover what I want you to do is color orange so now what's gonna happen is that if you have a h2 tag and it's a link and when you hover on that link it's gonna turn orange all right so we will comp this guy we will paste it here we will turn this whoops in turn h2 okay you see that mmm when I hover over it it turns orange you can you can do a lot more right so this is just with this is just you know how would work with h1 h2 but if I wanted to let's say now do this with images and let's just let's just grab an image and chess board okay I'll try to grab a smaller image you know nothing too huge and let's just grab this guy actually yeah why not this guy or you know I like checkmates and one so I'm gonna do checkmate in one so these are all positions where your one move away from checkmating you can use these to practice your skills as well paste that here refresh and we see the board okay actually let's see where the checkmate is I think it's white to move in this position oops and okay so I see the checkmate so I would move this Queen all the way here and it's a checkmate because the King cannot take my queen Knight will capture and this Bishop cannot take my Queen because the rook will capture the King so it's a pin alright now what I want to do is let's say I want to maybe add a little bit of shadow or a border around it and make it look you know let's say a little bit nicer I can do that as well so I want to show you now some new kinds of selectors you can use okay so here we'll use an iid and I will give this an ID of let's just say chest um you know made mate in one all right whatever I'll just give this an ID and I'll go to styles a CSS and I will say one and we'll say borderradius and we'll give it like four pixels or something okay did something happen I don't know let's try with more did you guys notice something changed right it became a little bit more rounded around the edges let's try something ridiculous so maybe because he's a difference you see that so now it changed even more so let's just make it a hundred pixels and let's see what it does okay so you can see that there is a pretty obvious change that's taking place but it's a little too much so maybe I want to make it round it and I just want to make it like a little bit rounded not too much now what if I want to add shadows and what if I want to add more and more things around the image okay so for example let's say you add another image like this right and you don't provide it an idea of and let's just say you you leave it as is and let's go back you can actually see the difference between the two and I'm just gonna add another brake line here yeah so brake line I had it so then it can go below it and you you can see that they look much different one has run in corners one does not and so selector I'm using here is an ID okay I can use this ID here again actually let me it's re let me remove the brake line because I think it's just it's not that hopeful refresh so as soon as I use that ID you can see that the rounded corners are here as well so this ID is a form of a selector and I can select things with that ID I can also select things with a class so now I can create a class and I can say chess board so as soon as it is it is a chess board maybe I want to give it a certain radius and if it's a meeting one I want to do something special okay so let's just look at it online okay how to add shadow in CSS okay and let's see what comes up so I'm gonna try to Google things as you would naturally and normally Google things okay I'm not gonna be like well today I want you to go to mdn or Wikipedia cuz that's what people refer you to and yeah it's cool but nobody nobody learns like that like if you're starting out you're just googling stuff that's coming to your mind naturally and then you'll see how I use these as well okay so let's just go here and let's see they got something called box shadow okay okay cool we have some examples of box shadows being used here right there kind of over the top something that doesn't look that good we'll just add in a random box shadow and see how it works box shadow and let's just make it 10 pixels apparently it takes in a color let's go to w3schools and it's saying box shadow you can give it a width a height and or sorry a height and width and you can even give it a color okay so you can pass in like multiple parameters for it so let's just kind of copy this guy and let's just paste it here and let's see what happens and what it does okay and you notice that this shadow got added here now I can also just make it Orange right I can can I make this ten pixels and try I can okay it's a little over at the top but that's totally cool now you can also add shadows all around it in a square because right now it's to one side of it if you want it to add it you could do that too so here let's do this now okay well we're gonna do is I deleted that line the border radius line from weight Mayton one and I'm going to now make maintenance all right so to turn things into a class you have to make them into a dot so it's not gonna have a hash tag anymore that's for IDs and I'll take this chessboard and I'll put it up here now I want to show you something different if something's just a part of a chessboard class right so let's say I do this and I say class equals chessboard like that and refresh you'll notice that it has that radius because chessboard has a border radius so you'll see that it has a little circular radius going on now what I can also do is for this one once you can see the difference I can say class is equal to chess board space mate in one okay and notice how this is inheriting from two different classes one is chess board two is Mayton one now if I wanted to look up checkmate in two images I could maybe give them a different oh okay I thought that was actually my video that popped up but that wasn't so if I wanted checkmate in two image to look differently I can copy that image address and I can do something similar paste it in here and and for class I can create a new class okay and try this pause it and and design your mate and to class to look different than the maintenance okay so give that a try right now okay and what I'm gonna do so I already kind of gave you the answer there and now for the class I'm gonna do chess board mate in to refresh and now you can see that the mate so this one the first one is just inheriting from the chessboard class the second one is chess board class and a mate in one class and then this bottom one here is it's getting it from chess board that's what you have the rounded corners and you got the mate in two and it has that little red thing going on okay and you can do that with classes you can go deeper and deeper and deeper with them and inherit from whatever you need does that make sense so this way it's kind of a nice way of of just seeing how all of this works together and I want you to practice that with things too and I want you to practice some things that might break so let's just try something maybe we'll see if it breaks or it doesn't you know who knows let's just give it a try so what I'm gonna say is that if it's a meet in right on hover maybe the boarders show up okay so let's just refresh mmm that's kind of cool right when you hover over it the boarders show up but otherwise it does not okay how about this we can do something else so I'm gonna leave this as is and and notice I'm just actually playing this around with you live right now okay this is not even structured and the reason why I'm doing this is so you can get a sense of how I'm doing it and the things that I'm enjoying and how I'm actually discovering this stuff and then when you're watching it I want you to feel the same thing that when you're doing this don't be so restrict it to exactly what a tutorial teaches you right play around with and get a feel for it that's where you're gonna make the biggest progress every time I've literally just sat down and taking notes I end up finding out that I haven't made real true progress but when I work on something on my own and then I have it there at the end that's when I make real progress okay cool so boxshadow now we can also make the box shadows cooler we can make them a little bit more different so first I'm gonna make it so right now and hover it doesn't do it but I can make it that on hover if you'll hover on the chess board right so let's do that I'll do chess board and I will do hover and I will say that on hover what should take place is you know it should just show that it's active or that you're actually currently looking at it and maybe there's a box shadow okay and let's just make it ten ten ten ten and let's see what happens I have you know I have to see it and just refresh and so now anything that has a class of chess board if you hover over it it should create a box shadow on it and look at that right it creates a yellow box shadow around those images so it knows that those are selected now could we make it the box shadows a little bit better yes we can and let's try it out so there's a thing called CSS Matic and you can go there and it lets you it lets you create different kinds of boxes okay and lets you do it visually so whether you want to actually create a radius and you want to see you know you want to make it look a certain way so see I can make this box look a certain way right give it a little huh just a little bit of all of it but what I'm gonna go in this box shadow now let's see if we can make a box shadow that's you know kind of even and like a little bit like that you know and again this is a little bit over the top but it's just to make sure that it pops out and you can see it so here I did it now I'm gonna copy this code zoom in a little bit so I guess you could see it a little bit better but here so I made something I'm going to now copy the code that it has given me and that code I will just pop in here okay now do I have to know what all of that code means absolutely not okay I just know where to paste it like I I don't even know how to make box shadows like these because that's to be honest that's not what I spend my time doing like I'm spending that time building backend in Python or building AP is or doing something more frontend is not really a lot of my thing I don't spend a lot of time doing it but do I know how to put together a beautifullooking website and use the right resources for them or at least how to research yes and that skill is a lot more important than even you knowing all of this just kind of at the back of your head alright so now I got this you know if I had to guess what these here mean I would assume that it has to do with compatibility between different browsers so you know if you're on Mozilla or WebKit whatever that is probably just gives you some make sure that there's compatibility on all different platforms but if you remove that I'm sure that it'll still look the same so I'm gonna hit save we'll go back here and we'll refresh and so on hover now that box shadow looks a little bit more calmer than our one that was like pretty aggressive right and if you want to color it something you can you can do that too if I delete these I'm sure they'll still work okay that that line is just for adding some extra compatibility and if I want to change this because this looks intimidating you're like oh RGBA are so confusing sure you can change it to orange if you want now when you hover over it has that little orange or make it green and you hover over it has a little green you could do this with images if you want to put cat images you want to put whatever for me I just enjoy chess so I will you know I just choose to do do the chess one and I also found the checkmate here it's rook takes here pawn takes Queen takes checkmate sorry I just love chess okay so you can see that you know we've put together a pretty cool cheesy looking website right now but if that's because we're just playing with a lot of this right we're not worrying about design patterns we're not worried about like what's a minimalistic clean looking website we'll work on a lot of that but for now it's important for you to just get messy and play with it you're like think of it like a you're like a little baby right what is that there's this video that you might have seen and it's like this little baby he's sitting on a countertop and his hands are filled with peanut butter right peanut butter and his entire body is just filled with peanut butter he literally looks like a mummy okay a little fat baby and his diaper and there's like peanut butter all over his body and his mom comes in and she's recording which is like what have you done and he's just looking at her he's like oh and she just like messy right fake peanut butter everywhere like in his eyes like on his in his hair and it's just a disgusting mess yeah but does he care no he's just having fun and he's probably learning what peanut butter is and he's just learning in my best texture and he's just learning about life and just feeling it out but as we grow older and we go to these academic schools or we're going into these professional environments it's like oh you have to take like extremely precise notes and don't ask any questions and don't open your mouth and just shut up the whole time and if you ask something that's kind of dumb everybody else will laugh at you I want you to forget that I want you to take the baby approach and just get messy with it okay do whatever you want try to break the CSS you know look up different tags different selectors you could use play around with it right what about different divs like just Dave having a different background or a different color how about styling your span tags so if you had something in the spent it would look different okay let me show you something something else real quick so let's say that you want to put bullet points somewhere right so I'm gonna I'm just gonna put bullet points at the top and I will say ul and I'll go here I'll say Li and we'll have you know first bullet point and then we'll say whoops and I'll go here and I'll say second bullet point well hit refresh and you can see that I got bullet points here now could you make it in a way so if I hovered over those bullet points they turned orange give it a try right now give it a try right now make those bullet points orange now could you make it so if that bullet point is actually a link it has a color of pink but only if a bullet point is a link not just any link a bullet point that's a link it's pink could you make it so only the unordered lists link bullet point is pink okay let me say that again only an unordered list link bullet point is pink nothing else so for example if I do a ordered list like this and I say and I make this into a link and I say link bullet link ordered bullet point okay this should not be pink only the unordered list bullet point shouldn't be pink so I'm gonna go here I'll paste this okay and again ul is unordered list Oh L is an ordered list so how would you do that well check it out I can go in my Styles at CSS I can drill into UL kul is a selector tag so just you all after the UL I drill into that line and after that Ally I drill into the a and then in here I can say that this should be pink right so color pink save save there you go okay can you do can you do something where the a bullet point or doesn't actually even have bullets next to it or can you do it that link actually doesn't have an underline in there how would you do it I haven't taught it to you so you can look cause II you haven't taught it to me and just give up you get really angry or let's do this okay how to remove underline from links CSS okay you saw it was automatically completing to at some point and styling removing the underline from hyperlinks okay door word don't mean would I say it's a good resource to use for everything no but when I do it when I type it in and this comes up let me just check out what they're saying looking in here let's see does this anything about remove oh that's cool so again as I discovered things you should discover things like this too alright so I'm in here and I can see that link tag you can make it a certain way you can also do if the link is visited what it should look like so if somebody's already clicked on a link then maybe the style of that link should change so if I copy this guy and I go into my styles and I paste this here and I go back to my thing you know maybe the links that I've already visited locus look a little bit different go back and I deleted it cool so that was a cool new thing I learned they also have hover that's fine now note is this text declaration and it says textdecorationnone alright textdecorationnone which means that like if you have textdecorationunderline it'll put an underline on that link okay so i can override a links and how it looks I can say text decoration and I can say none okay so it's still a link but it doesn't have a underline on that anymore so this was a cool resource how about you know Stack Overflow this is always a really good resource and look what it says textdecorationnone you know ignore the the rest of the comment there's like other stuff going on he's talking about important and blah blah but for CSS he's asking hey how can I remove the blue underline and it comes to textdecorationnone okay and look we've put together something pretty cool this turns orange this has different box shadows I hover over it does different things pretty awesome now in the upcoming videos we are going to start building on a project okay and I'll show you what you need to do and everything that you need to learn to get it done and then I'm also gonna show you the solution and walk you through building it stepbystep so even if you don't get the solution and you build it with me you're gonna learn a lot alright and it's gonna be a lot of fun and I'll try to build it mostly from you know kind of scratch together with you so you can watch me go through mistakes and my thought process and how I overcome them if you like this style of learning right this is less structured than like bullet point everything just showing to you it's like we're working through things together and we're coming together if you like this style of learning comment below if you like it and what you like about it if you don't then comment below and do let me know that's it for this video thank you so much for watching as always and I'll you in the next video all right awesome so up until now you've done quite a bit of stuff right you went up in here and you know you build this little project which is kind of cool to be honest but here I want to show you some really awesome stuff okay so I want you to learn how to become a detective now I want you to look at websites like you're almost solving a case alright so you're kind of that criminally put my seat down a little bit cool it's like you're a criminal that's not what I meant I meant I want you to look at it like you're a detective okay and solve it like a detective and don't be a criminal unless your website is criminally good then that's okay so on this website let's say that I have no idea how the hell you did this okay I have no idea how you built this website I have no idea what fonts you use and have no idea how you added that boxshadow and stuff I can come to it just be like oh this is a great website and then just X out and leave and never come back or like a detective I can pay attention and I can actually figure out exactly what you did and wouldn't that be awesome that you could go to other people's website and figure out exactly what they did to make it and then use that for your own website so let me show you what I mean so let's just say that this was a website that I had built and you were just coming to it for the first time and you were like okay this is cool when I hover over the boards it makes it green how did you do that okay let's right click here and we'll click inspect okay and inside of inspect what we'll see is that we have this image tag so when I hover over it it tells me that oh this board is just part of the image this is that image okay and it's even showing me what that image looks like over here and if your dog is not at the bottom click these three collapsible dots and then select right or bottom out whoops I'm gonna hit inspect again spoked and I'll click these collapsibles and put them down that's all so here it's showing me the HTML code that was made to bring this picture up and it's showing me and when I hover over the link it actually shows me what the image looks like what matches this image something ok cool I get where you got the image from I can actually change the image if I want so I can double click into it or I can leave it as is which is cool now this board is part of the chess board class and I'm like interesting a chess board class cool well over here when I go into style when I'm looking at your Styles what I notice is that essentially part of this class in this class chess board all it has is it says border radius 30 pixels which is exactly what we have over here on the left hand side now what I can do is actually turn it off and when I turn it off it shows me their styles on how would the look if the chess board class wasn't activated or didn't even exist and I couldn't be like oh so that's what this person is doing with the chess board class or with the borderradius attribute hmm interesting that's what that does cool now how come there's this orange border around this board let's go figure out what's the situation there right so I can I can acts out of it okay I can even go into hovers and I can actually activate something which is which is kind of cool I can be like hey active focus ok visited hover on hover what does it look like activate the hover mode of this and it's showing us that chess board hover has this ok so the force element state we have forced element state to be in hover and it shows us that this is the code that goes behind it which says chess board hover and this green thing which you can actually see right over here you know like interesting so if I write this code that's what that will do and if I write this code that's what that will do but this will only work on hover interesting what else can I figure it out about this okay so I can now look at this board right here the one on the right hand side Islands hit inspect and I'll hit inspect and it tells me that it's part of the chessboard class and it's part of the maintenance of it's part of two classes and I have both of them activated and it tells me that there's a chessboard class and there's a meet in one class and the main one class what it does is it adds a box shadow so I'm like oh interesting if I turn off that box shadow it goes away how's that box shadow working it says 5px 10px followed by orange cool can I turn this orange into something else oh that's what that looks like interesting what if I change this five pixels to 10 pixels mmm that's what that does what if I add another 10 pixels right here and another 10 pixels right here with that what does that do okay what if I add another 50 pixel right here what does that do hmm not the best looking thing but maybe I'm learning something I'm picking up how this actually works now I can still activate it or deactivate it cool and you see exactly what classes you need okay is a chessboard class I'm eight in one class classes in CSS are represented by this little period an ID will be like a hash tag okay so I've learned a lot so far now I can also go and see how this link an ordered bullet point is working if I wanted to right I can go to this link and I can say okay unordered list I can highlight I can highlight this and I can be like I can click it and once I click it on the right hand side it shows me how the styling is working for it okay so in the styling I can see that it says hey the under the UL under that line and then under the a style it to be pink I can activate it deactivate and it tells me that text decoration is none when I deactivate that line it shows me the default actually has underline so I go there interesting similarly I can go on to this website the project you're supposed to be building write a clever program reddit github that I oh I can go to this and I can say this font is interesting what font actually is it so I can hit inspect and then under inspect I can actually see what type of font it is okay so I can click or click here and it's telling me what font size it is h1 2.5 r.e.m and I can see what type of font it is so lets see if i scroll down it's selling me the font family so it's telling me i found family it's telling me the line height is selling me the font weight and all of that so i'm like interesting we're using railway sansserif alright it's telling me it's on line 22 under whatever this file is so actually it might actually even take me to the file so now I'm actually looking straight up at the styles at CSS file and I can see that under our content I can see the font that was used the line height that was used to font weight that was used to max width and all of that ok so just to give you an example let me fullscreen this guy so you can see him better you can actually even use a tool like font face ninja and once you hover over it it tells you what font is being used so you can already see it says railway ok railway is a cool font and you can see that it says it's in medium about 40 pixels and 48 pixel line height okay line height means when you press Enter you know how separated are this so it has good spacing and it makes it really legible so you can be like okay cool now what you can do is if you want that same font on the chest project or whatever that I was making here I can go to font stock Google com and I can find railway so I can search for railway and here it is I can go to railway and I can say select this font it popped up at the bottom zoom in a little bit more here and once it pops up I can just copy this thing so I'm gonna just go an import copy it like this so if if I wanted to put it directly into my HTML I would copy it with the style tag but since I want to put it only in my CSS I will put it like this okay so I'll put it in my CSS file all the way at the top okay and and to activate this thing right I'll actually say that whatever is in my body make it this font now let's go back here let's refresh and as soon as i refresh you can see the font looks better right and now when I right click on this and inspect hopefully and then it shows up in body look at the font railway sansserif and it's looking a lot better in my opinion you'd be like Oh interesting not this guy this guy right over here okay and you can also go to Rafa cause ecomm if you want inspiration from my actual one that I'm using as my business or maybe for whatever reason clever programmer that github that I oh isn't working so you can see how like a detective I can just go figure out each component of the puzzle right and including maybe I can even figure out how to put this nav bar at the top which I want to leave to you as a challenge alright so I've shown you how I would as a detective figure out a lot of these things and I would change a lot of these things but I also want to leave some of these things to you okay other tools I want to give you is you know I can go to this code and I can actually do view page source and when I do view page source it even shows me all the HTML code that was used to build that page now if you go on a really popular website or really website that's visited about a lot of people or it's really big usually their HTML files aren't gonna look this simple usually their HTML files are going to look quite a bit complicated so you know it's not but for ours that we're making it's gonna look pretty simple the HTML code is straight up okay and you can use that to figure out okay how this thing actually works okay you got image tags you got a unordered list you got an ordered list simple enough okay go try that with my website okay clutter program but I github at i/o and see how far you can get in recreating this website one of the things you might need to learn still is how to add a background image here I'll show you real quickly okay let's say I want a background image right I can simply go like this in the body I can say background image and I can provide a URL for a jpg file let's see if I have a jpg I do I'll hit refresh and you can see that now it's not the prettiest image to add to your background but it works okay I can add another you know like if I want to add a pattern kind of like I have on this website here you can see a lot of full screen you can just look up online like minimalistic background patterns and you can use that background image to add as a pattern in the backend now you might have some other questions like hey how do you add padding or how do you actually make this like centered or not to one side or the other one thing I do want to show you is called padding so let's say I'm like what if I wanted all of this to be in the middle right not like if I'm fullscreen this website you see how it's all the way to the left what if I wanted everything to be kind of like mostly in the middle well what I can do is I'll just leave it here for your purposes what I can do for this is I can say pad or actually even max with oh I have to put a semicolon here so it completes it and I can say 600 pixels and then margin I can say zero okay so actually instead of putting a zero there let's put a Auto dare come right back and hit refresh and you can see now that this is now moved more in the middle okay and if I do 800 pixels right and I hit refresh okay so it's like how why do I want this to be let's try 500 cool so you can see that now it's most of it is being aligned in the middle maybe I want to try it 300 okay and now it's even more in the middle and it's reading top down just like that okay so this is what I'm gonna give you use this use the chrome dev tools to put together this website another thing that's gonna be a challenge for you is how did I build the navbar I'm gonna actually give you the resource for that okay navbar CSS w3k literally go to this and use this to put the navbar together okay you can use a vertical navigation bar if you want or build a horizontal navigation bar okay so I actually built a horizontal one just using that and it looks pretty damn good right so just use that for now build your navigation bar put the page together it looks like a really clean page and at the end you know for this you're gonna actually have to use bootstrap a little bit so if you can google that part of it and figure out how to put together a bootstrap form then you can build this but if you don't figure that bootstrap part the bootstrap part is just gonna be at the end okay pretty much nowhere else if you can't figure that out don't kill yourself over it just try to get as close to mine as you can this is more art than science alright so I don't want you to beat yourself up or be like hey I didn't get exactly right as long as you can get close you'll be good our solutions are gonna look a lot different you know when you see my solution but just give it a try and then I'll show you how I put this together and then you can use that to learn as well alright so this project is gonna be a lot of fun and by the way when you click these links nothing really changes okay so it's gonna be a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed this process enjoy working on this project I'm really excited I can't wait to see what you put together that's it for this video and I'll see you in the next video hey you welcome welcome we're going to touch on CSS and bootstrap woohoo what a surprise I know I know but we are gonna be building one big project and in this big project you're gonna learn get a deep understanding of how CSS works how to create forms how to create beautiful buttons how to create stuff where when you hover over it colors change and just beautiful are static websites that you can model after learning this because honestly what I believe deeply is that instead of working on like seven different small projects I don't think that's a good idea what is a good idea is working deeply but on one project and this is something I recommend even as you go on in your journey to learn whenever you learn something and you want to apply it work on one big project and work on it really deeply I've had some really close friends with me or learning coding but to this day they're like okay coders and the real reason behind that is because they just dabble in like 10 different projects just a little bit or just half way but one of the reasons why I was to improve my skills and get him to a really high level was because I would get in that project one project and work on it for a long time and I'm talking about there were some projects I worked on for three to six months even a year long and it doesn't necessarily have to be that long for you but even if you work on one project for like a few days a week a month versus multiple other projects for like half a day superimportant okay with that said let's jump into what we're gonna be making this week okay one big project we're gonna make this week so I got this idea from this personal brand I actually started Rafa Kazi comm and this is a business that actually I'm gonna be building and it's gonna be there to help other people build their businesses leveraging the power of YouTube okay so you can see my little tagline here or not little actually a really powerful tagline here how to build your authority overcome obscurity scale your business and build an audience of ideal buyers for your products and services I have some experience in this I started clever programmer I have you here I have other people here so I thought why not let's get it started okay and this is a real website and I'm offering this lead magnet to people which is essentially a free gift for them to give me their email address and generally how these businesses work or you get people's emails essentially their contact information and then the people who are interested in your product when you release your product you can actually eventually sell your product or service right so just like you you got a lot of free value a lot of information for me and you're like I'm winning this is awesome this is great how do I get more well I'm like okay there's some highlevel stuff I've made for you maybe the profitable programmer or some other course you might be in and here's how you can get it there's a price for it you pay it you purchase it and there you go okay so we exchange value at the end of the day and that's what this new business model is about it's teaching you how to actually scale for yourself and so I thought for this CSS project for this week to CSS bootstrap project would it be cool to use the knowledge we've already built about HTML and then leverage CSS and bootstrap to actually make a page like this but actually even better than this because III took the time to actually model this page and what I ended up building looks even better than this and so I think you're gonna have a lot of fun working on this okay just like I did so let me go right here so check out so this is a new page again same tagline but now at the top you can see that there is a navigation bar and when I hover over it it has like specific styling that goes along with it and the background pattern looks pretty cool right this is bland it's just white and here we have some subtle minimalistic pattern going on at the background and you know the writing is a lot easier to read on this page in my opinion because the other page it reads from left to right a lot and here it's mostly in the middle so you read through it easier and by the time I get down here you can see that I have a nice little form and this button that says yes gave me first of all it looks really nice this button and second of all when I hover over it notice what happens it changes colors right it changes colors so how does this happen and how does what I hover over this it changes colors and everything right so this is what we're gonna be learning we're gonna be learning a lot more things but eventually our goal is to actually build a replica of this and if you want to check it out I've hosted this online and a cool thing I haven't I didn't even mention till now it's not gonna be one of those projects that you do on freakin Udacity or Coursera or EDX where they always make it sound super cool and by the time you get to it it's like this super terribly lame check that you can like that has like two basic kindergartner things right this one is a real project modeled after my real website were actually have traffic going and not only that but you are going to actually have it hosted online so if you notice that this is hosted online and you can actually go to this link by going to clever program or not github do hopefully this link will still be up by the time you're viewing this video and you should be able to see it there and underneath this video I'll link to the project or somewhere in this module I'll link the project so the solution is there for you so you can always go and look at the right code and what I did to build it okay though I wouldn't say it look at the solution now look at it later alright I hope you're excited we're gonna have a lot of fun learning how to build this and learning some ins and outs of CSS along the way of bootstrap along the way and some cool tips and tricks and another thing I want to focus on is while I want to show you that exact code that was used to build this project what I'm really interested in showing you is the real development workflow of a developer okay so that's what a lot of people don't show a lot of them just make a course and as a teacher teach you what I want to teach you as is not just a teacher but if you were sitting next to me and you were working we used to literally we're watching me work I want to show you how that looks like or if you watched a real software developer work what would that look like okay and you guys might have this in your head or you might have this in your head that you know the software developer you create everything from scratch but that's really far from the truth I paid a lot for is knowing what to copy and paste okay and so that's a very real skill set and I'm gonna be teaching you that as well and so it's just gonna be a lot of fun all right and we're gonna work together we're gonna make mistakes together and we're gonna learn together so by the end of this I want you to have a natural feeling towards how to go about it you know it shouldn't just be that the two things you learn in this course are those are it I leave you the tools to be able to expand your knowledge even when you finish this course okay with that said that's it for this video thank you so much for watching and as always I'll see you in the next video hi welcome in this video we will do something really amazing and you will have a lot of fun because what I'm gonna be doing is building this from complete scratch so I'm not even gonna use my notes there's nothing like that we're just gonna be working on it together trying to make this website and what you're gonna find is a lot deeper insight then even if you just wash me literally write the solution there's gonna be some points where I'm gonna get something wrong something right doesn't matter but I'm gonna work through it and I want you to verbally see how I work through it and see how you even look up solutions online now what I want you to understand is I'm not a frontend developer my front end developer skills suck but I can put together a badass website because I know what to use and where to use it because I know how coding works I can put together a website that looks beautiful cuz I'll even think I'll even figure out how frontend coding works okay it's just all about understanding how these things fit together so let's get started and we're gonna clone this bad boy right here this one this website that I was showing you okay so I'm gonna fullscreen this thing so you can see it one more time and we're gonna put that to the right side and we're gonna start from scratch in our guess code so I'm gonna create a new folder here and it will just call it clone the site okay you can call it whatever you want here I will create a new folder call it styles and inside of styles I'll create a new file called styles that's CSS you should be familiar with this now and then inside of clone Kazi i'll create a new file and I'll call it index.html and we'll get started writing code now in our Chrome I will go here I'll open and clone Kazi site index.html I'll open that and Chrome so you should see this blank page right here and we'll get started okay so first we'll start off with this headline and we'll go from there okay and now I'm literally thinking about it kind of from scratch again okay so before this video I tried to clear my mind so I could start with as blank of a slate as possible and think my way through it kind of out loud and you could work alongside me on this alright so I'm just gonna go through this page a little bit okay so I see that this is probably paragraph and this is some kind of a header so what header is this I'll hit inspect and just find out real quick so it's h1 and here's some styling that is being used for h1 that I can see and let's look at the font so the fonts are better being used is railway sansserif and all of this ok cool so now this part is important I'm gonna try to actually just copy this part okay and and you know again I can I can take this mark off is that right way to say take more take this mark off whatever so I can take this mark off and you can see that when I change it how it affects our writing so this is with the railway San serif font family on and when I turned this off I can't see how much of a difference there but in my paragraphs I can hopefully see the difference here okay one is readable but it's a little close this gives it a nice little breathing room so now I know what line hide used for fontweight you know this makes it way a little bit more okay cool so I'm gonna kind of paste that in here alright now what I know oh I'm sorry I gotta go in my Styles that CSS okay I'm gonna paste it in here so now one thing I already know is that I'm gonna have this class and it's called like our content you could call it whatever you want you could call it something totally different and this is a font family this is the line height font weight and you know let's see what this max width stuff is all about right so notice that when I put it on look at what it does right changes the width here and padding at the top so we'll try to build this from scratch as we go okay I'm gonna remove this but I know a few things already and we need to get the railway font so we'll go to fonts at google.com I rail away right here I will hit the plus sign and copied it okay and I'll click it I will grab the import code I'll paste it in my styles at CSS all the way at the top and then this is the font family okay so I'm gonna go in here and I'll say that anything that goes in the body actually give it that font style okay so I'll say give it that font now let's go to our HTML code I'll hit dock I'll delete these for now and we'll call this cause ease website clone or Khali's website you can call it your own website and when i refresh this you'll see at the top at the tab now says cause ease website so that's good alright so let's get the copy from here the headline and then we'll just put the h1 we'll paste the headline okay and I'm gonna refresh now going into my stylesheet I will make sure that my body has the railway font so fontfamily railway okay I have this now I'll refresh and hmm that's weird there are a few problems that we notice here first of all it starts from all the way to the left goes all the way to the right and notice this this starts in the middle and also it doesn't look like it has the rail railway font so what's going on there right because like even if I delete this and hit save and come here and refresh it looks the same and when I do this and save and refresh it still looks the same so what's the deal well it's because I haven't linked a stylesheet yet so in my head I'm gonna go and I'll say link and I'll simply link that stylesheet so now when I hit refresh you can see that the railway font is coming in and if actually right click and hit inspect it should show me that the railway font is coming in okay so now I have the font looking somewhat you know good now let's do a few more things so my font looks good but it's still reading a lot from the left and then reading it all the way to the right so it seems a little too much so what I will do is I'll say like Pat it a little bit okay so let me do padding left and I'll do you know 40 pixels let's come here and let's refresh so you can see it added a little bit of padding here and it pushed it to the right now padding can be cool but the problem is that when you on a mobile device it can look pretty weird you know it's like reading every single word on it on its own line and it's okay in terms of centering something so what I'll do is I'll give it a max width of say you know 200 pixels just tried 200 pixels and then I'll say margin as auto okay so this is a cool way of making things centered so you can see that it gave it a width and then the rest of it it just says do it Auto so it kind of starts it from the middle and that's essentially the width that it has now let's make this let's give it a little bit more width so I'll do 400 and hit refresh now it reads it in the middle pretty much perfectly but it's still but we need to give it a little bit more like for example you can read business and build an audience on the same line except we business and build an audience for us reads on two different lines so now I know that I still have to make it so it has a little bit more width and let's try 600 here okay products and services products and services cool it's it looks like it's reading in a similar fashion okay how to build your authority the ability that's already great let's see if anything else needs changing so ours is really at the top if you can see and this one kind of has like some space from the top this is just completely touching it so we need to add some padding on the top okay padding top and let's add about 20 pixels it was refresh cool and it looks like it gave it a little bit of room and that's kind of what we want and then this image on this website when I rightclick I can actually inspect the image and this gives me the URL for the image so I'll just use this URL and I'll go in my index and then I will say image I'll paste that image in and I'll hit refresh or refresh so you can see that this image right now looks really really huge and that's not what we want so in my image I'm gonna add in a height attribute and I'll just say 500 and I'll add in a width attribute and we'll just give it 300 okay and you can put quotes around it or not doesn't really matter okay so now it looks a little bit more normal but it looks a little bit squished so we'll give it a little bit more 400 see how that looks compared to it still doesn't look that good when I inspect this image I see that it's a 700 and with 500 so I'm gonna do that for mine to 700 give it 500 save refresh and now it looks a little bit better right and even if I fullscreen the thing it still looks in the center and even if I make it shorter half the screen it still looks like it's in center okay cool so we got the image now what else do we need we need to add the page copyright all of this copyright here and what I recommend is just straight up copying all of this like this or what you can do is go to the page source and copy it from there so that way it'll copy all the line breaks and everything because there are some line breaks in here okay so if you spend time doing all of that it might take you a second though it could be good practice but oops I'm gonna go here also a view page source and everything starting from this PTAC here's what you're right now all the way to this P tag I'll just copy and I'll paste right here I'll hit save we'll go to our website and refresh and you can see now that that copy is on our page okay cool so it's looking good except the lines in between make it a little bit harder to read so we need to give it a little bit more line height okay so I'll go to my Styles at CSS and we'll add some some line height so I'll say lineheight 1.2 e em fresh okay do anything let's just do something crazy 400 a.m. and you can see that there's a huge difference here right let's try to fresh okay to is looking looking pretty good let's try 2.3 and now it looks like the page has some room to breathe maybe it's even too much it just depends on your taste but when I read these paragraphs I think it's good to give it a little bit breathing room so so far I like how things look they look really good but I feel that reading it this tax doesn't look like it's powerful it looks it was very thin and I don't really like my eyes don't really enjoy reading it as much as this should so what I would want to do honestly is probably make them weigh a little bit more so you can see that when I do 900 it just becomes darker and if I do like 100 and go here it becomes really light so I like how 900 looks okay maybe you can even go 950 that's up to you but I personally prefer my text to be kind of dark and feel like it has weight so when somebody's reading it they can go mmm okay there's like there's like power behind it okay so the text is looking pretty good the fonts are looking pretty good now I just need to add that little this thing and then the call to action okay so first we're gonna we're gonna do that calltoaction part this part I'm going to add at the end because this requires bootstrap so I'll show you that later well first let's just go and add this thing so under this P tag I will add an h2 because that's not an h1 okay notice and save that copy hit Reef and okay I got this that's good and now I just need to make sure that I have I'm gonna again add this at the end you can add this from the regular forms that I showed you so you can certainly do that for now just leave it blank say input is a you know text or email and we could put the placeholder to be email address okay and then underneath we can say button okay and the button can call yes gimme whoops so here you saw that whoops I have the email address and then it says yes gimme right there okay so I'm just putting like a basic form right now later you can you can make the form cooler like if you want to do something like where I hover over this button maybe it turns orange that's not that hard to do right I can I can um just say something like button on hover you know make make the color orange or something right so now it changes the font color to be orange let's try if we can do background color okay and now the entire button turns orange so you can do something like that for now just yeah or not doesn't really matter we're gonna again create the final version of this at the end we're not gonna pay too much attention to that now so our page is looking clean very readable very nice now let's add that pattern in the background okay so what I'll do is I'll just grab a I'll look up minimalistic minimalistic background patterns and I'll just kind of see what comes up where I got it from was like this subtle patterns thing and so you can get that one or you can get this tictactoe one to be honest I like it a lot might might even like it more so you can actually preview them too which is awesome if you hit pretty view you can see in the back pretty cool so you can have this one too but that's that's a little too much so I'll hit download and now that it's downloaded what I'll do is in here I'll create a new folder I'll just call it images okay and I'll take this image okay the tictactoe image I'll go in the folder HTML crash course clone Kazi site I'll go in image isn't just paste it in here okay you can even link to the online image but you can you can just do it locally to just totally fine we'll go back and inside the body I'll say background image and I'll use URL and since Stiles isn't so inside here notice that next is styles at CSS there are no other files okay so if I from styles at CSS say hey go to images and then inside of images get the pattern image it's gonna be like what the hell are you talking about I don't know where images is so we need to give this a path okay an absolute path or a relative path so for example right if you are and in your house right now you have Starbucks to the right of you what I'll tell you is like hey leave your home walk to the right at Starbucks is right there that's an example of a relative path okay another example would be if you have Panera Bread to the left of you but like walk downstairs go to the Left Panera Bread is right there now if I have to give you an absolute path I might say hey on 20 40 you know Hollywood Street that's where Starbucks is or that's where Panera Bread is now that's the absolute path no matter where you are in the world and the country and state you know where that address is so just like that on your computer each thing has a relative path and an absolute path so what do I mean by that for example this going from you know if you're if you're in this index file the relative paths of the styles are CSS it simply Styles / styles that CSS okay it's a relative path but if I want to get the absolute path you can even see it right now when I hover over it shows me but the absolute path actually says I'll show you what I mean okay I'll open up my terminal so you can see this more clearly all right so I'll go into my github folder all going to HTML crash course folder I'll go into clone clone Kazi folder and and to get into styles I can just do CD styles okay which means change directory into style so I can do this see these styles and him and hit whoops styles and hit enter and I'll go into it or I can go inside of it in another way okay so check it out what I do PDW here's my absolute path right now and I'm gonna now go into styles now when I do PWD you can see that my full addressed and location is user slash clever programmer slash github slash HTML crash course slash clone Kazi underscore site / styles so that's another so that's so so you just saw I got in two styles but just doing CD styles now when I do CD and let's say I'm home I'm really far away I can even go inside of styles directly in one go instead of going into one folder then another folder than or another folder I can just go straight to this entire address I can just do this I can say CD paste that address hit enter I'm in styles again okay so it doesn't matter where I was in the first place now because I'm in my clone Kazi site and I want to get access to that image which is in images right here to take Tac Toe the first thing I actually need to do okay oops actually let's go in here so I'm in Styles at CSS I need to first go back a folder so then I'll be in clone Kazi site directory then I need to go inside of images and then get access to the folder so he'll here's how I'll do it I'm gonna do dot dot and that means go back one directory okay and I'll show you what I mean by that again in here so if I can do show me where I'm at I can do CD github so now I'm in github right so I'll do PWD and they'll show me that I'm in slash user slash clever programmer slash get up if I do dot dot and I do PWD again it'll show me I'm in slash user slash clever programmer so you see I went back a directory by doing dot dot that's what two dots does so I'm gonna go back one directory then I'll say going to images and then after that I'll say what's the name of the image take Tac Toe tictactoe dot PNG okay like that and when I hit refresh you'll notice that that tictactoe image is now linked so looks a lot better to be honest with you looks pretty beautiful so far now at this point it seems like all we really need is that navbar at the top and betterlooking form thing and our page is good to go so let's do that let's get that navbar so okay let's just go online how to get navigation bar CSS okay that's what I would Google and let's just go in here in w3schools and here's a navigation bar that's cool here's another navigation bar I like this grey one a little bit this one is cool too but I like the darker one so there's all kinds of different navigation bars there's like vertical ones and then there's horizontal ones so we're gonna go and grab the horizontal one so let's see which one so it's this one okay I wanna grab and it gives me the code for the bar and if I just read the code I'll try to understand and see how it's working so I noticed that here they have the UL which is unordered list so what they're actually using here is an unordered list okay but how does it look like a navigation bar so what the heck are they're doing well what they're doing is that they're making the unordered list but maybe they're making it in a way that instead of the unordered list writing things from the top to down it's writing things from the top to right okay so I'm left to right instead of top down so in just unreal is going this way and why does it look like this well behind this unordered list you can actually just put this grey background right and and you could put some padding so then so did this text home is not all the way to the left and not all of it at the top so we put some padding and from the top so it looks like it's in the middle and we put some padding on the left so it looks like it's in the middle from the left or the right equally and then what we can do is on hover it gets this color and then on hover news can get that color okay all of these at their own color so that's kind of what it looks like this code is doing so what we'll do is we'll we'll copy all of this okay and then so now here's another important part right you copy paste code and then you have to know how to use it now the only way you can know how to use it is when you understand how this all works which at this point hopefully you've seen enough to know how this is kind of working okay and just kind of get a feel for it so you well in my HTML if I make a bullet point list that's that this thing is already gonna be working okay so let's let's just give it a try let's put a are you a list here and let's just see what happens like I'll say hi um say bye and bring this guy here refresh and this is how this list is looking right now not exactly what we want it's because I actually didn't save that Styles at CSS now that I've saved it and I hit refresh it looks like it's coming up now there's not a lot of padding here as you can see zoom in there's not a lot of padding here so we need to make sure that we add some padding so let's go back and see how their example is working okay Liz alright so when the padding actually gets added is when Li a bullet point is a link so if it's a regular bullet point it'll look regular you notice this over here but if you drill in to a li and drill in with a link that's what it'll actually look like this styling is gonna get applied okay you can see over here so now let's actually make these links so I will have the same thing I'll say a and I'll say hi and we'll do a and we'll do bi and I'll come over here I'll hit refresh and notice that styling got applied to it okay this dialing right here boom boom boom boom but if I have a regular link that outside of the unordered list like a regular link like this hello it still just looks like a regular link it's only the link that's inside of a life so you see how with CSS you can get deep into selectors right you can point it and get narrower and narrower with it so it's pretty cool I will delete this guy refresh again and that padding seems pretty cool now what if you're like hey I'm not exactly sure how all of this is working it's kind of confusing me well I'll explain to you how this is working okay pretty pretty straightforward first of all notice textdecoration is none all right so I'm gonna hover over these links they don't have an underlined what else padding I'm adding 14 pixels from the top and 16 pixels from the left okay so what this is doing is actually adding 14 pixels at the top 14 pixels at the bottom so it's sandwiched in the thing in the middle from the perspective of the top and the bottom this 16 pixel here what it's doing is adding 16 pixels padding from the left and 16 pixel padding from the right so from the perspective from of left and right it's making it in the middle so as so it's like perfectly in the middle okay so so to speak how you can check it is you can right click inspect and just turn off the padding and see what happens okay and even from here you can actually change the padding so I can go right here and I can say padding make it 20 make it 15 make it 300 make it 10 10 what does that do so you can see how this works and maybe if you like something more you can come back to your code and make the following change and if I change the 16 what's happening heading a lot more spacing in the middle you can also change the color you can make it freakin green if you want right doubleclick Green okay and you can see an ounce of green hit refresh and now it's back to normal okay what is this displayblock thing doing let's let's delete it so block is like making it a little bit wider right textaligncenter attack is that doing doesn't seem like it's doing much right now a padding is definitely doing something text decoration is doing that so cool now you've learned what each of these pieces are doing that's how you're supposed to learn okay not sit there freaking reading documentation for three days so now I know what this guy is doing but what what is this you all doing right does that totally make sense to us right now maybe maybe not let's check it out let's hit this guy so when we hit this guy you'll notice that before there were bullet points by default but by doing liststyletypenone it's now removing those bullet points cool what is this margin0 thing doing I see there's a little bit movement so it's doing something not exactly sure what when I do padding0 it's making sure that the UL has no padding by default so it's overriding its padding cool and what is this overflow doing apparently you can't even see this without the overflowhidden right so when I make sure the overflow is hidden and background color important right so you want to have that background color otherwise you apparently can't even see this thing so those are two of the important things that you kind of need in there okay cool and then how is this working so when you hover over it it's changing colors it's getting a little bit darker well what's actually taking place there is that you have on a li when on an li link if you hover on a bullet point link this happens okay so it's a very specific situation when that actually takes place you can even make it that the freakin background image changes to something else you know you hover over and the background image changes to cat you can do whatever you want you could add multiple lines of code in here okay so on my website it says Rafa Kazi and then it says courses and then it says Heiner me so I'm gonna go back here I'll say Rafa Kazi I will say courses and then I will say hire me okay cool let's look at it Rafa Kazi courses hire me there's one little problem the bar is not running along there's padding at the top which we don't really want and when I scroll up and now and the bar is there with dust but I'm gonna scroll up and down here the bar doesn't actually stay there so those are the few changes that we're gonna need to make also notice that this is orange you're active in here it's not so we'll figure out what's taking place there in just a second okay so first thing I want to do is I want to make sure that this bar is by itself and not doing this weird thing that it's doing here hmm so how would I actually go and fix this the problem I think that's happening here is that this bar remember how we created this body right and everything everything that's in this body it's supposed to be centered well this navigation thing that we made is actually in that body right inside of the body tag and because of that it's also being centered so we need to do is we need to make sure that the the content of the website that's on the page is somehow being handled in a specific way where it's being centered because the content is what needs to be centered right and then the navigation bar shouldn't be part of that content and it shouldn't be kind of separate so how do we do that well how about this let's do this let's make sure that the navigation bar is in its own div and we'll just give it a class of navigation we don't know if we're gonna use this class or not okay and so we've put the navigation in its own class that's not gonna do anything okay right now so even if you're refresh '''l things gonna happen and we're gonna put all of the content in another div and we'll just call this class our content call it whatever you want I'll go at the bottom whoops and put it right here okay cool all right now if again if I hit refresh nothing is taking place but here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna go in styles I'll create a class called our content and inside of this class I'll add this stuff because we only want our content to be centered now let's hit refresh and you'll notice that the navbar now runs across fine which is what we want and our content is centered so that's pretty good but for whatever reason there's still that padding at the top either you can notice right so we need to not remove that padding we can hit inspect on this navbar and let's actually see there's this padding on the top if I remove that padding notice the bar goes up higher so let's actually do that so this padding this doesn't need to be added to the navbar but it needs to be added to the content because we don't want this how to start from right over here it's gonna make it look really murky and mixed in with the navigation bar so we like that that padding is there so what we'll do is we'll take this padding and we'll add it right here now notice that for our content I don't actually need to add the font settings in here and the reason for that is because it's inheriting from the body okay because our content is give and that's underneath body it's inheriting the the fonts from the style of the body okay and now when I hit refresh look the bar is a lot higher it's still not perfectly at the top but it's still a lot higher okay let's hit inspect and and you'll see that the it says inherited from body okay that's where the font is actually coming from cool let's go right here so it's it's looking better at this point so because of the line height let's go nope not the line height okay now let's work on something else so the bar is looking decent well troubleshoot this little space here at the top and that little space to the left and what's going on there in a second now let's make sure that this thing the word says Rafa Kazi turns orange when we Aurora's orange the entire time okay since we're on the home page so what I'm gonna do is that for now I'm just gonna provide anchor tags okay so I'll say Rafi this part doesn't have anything to do with it turning orange by the way okay so I'll hit refresh here and now I'm gonna click higher me you'll see at the top it has that anchor tag and I had courses it'll say courses when hit Raphael said this so anchor tags are cool to add just to make sure that your links are working without actually directing you to another website because that's annoying sometimes and that's also somehow sometimes they do that you know you've seen on websites right where you it's like a one page website and you click something and it takes you all the way down here well how that works is you can actually provide this an ID of you know hash tag courses or something and so when you click here you can make it so that it it takes you to this div here okay it's kind of like a selector so you can just give it the action hey take me right there all right let's make this guy orange now so I'll go back to that website CSS navigation let's see if what it says about an active link right so here I'm on the CSS so as the CSS pages green how do we do that so here's an example active slash current navigation link it's just this line of code cool we'll add it in somewhere close to that paste it and just say orange in our case so notice that because it says dot it's a class and I'll go in here and what I'll do is I'll just make this bullet point and make it from the class that's active go back here hit refresh there we go good all right so now you'll see that this thing is perfectly orange just like what we wanted okay orange or not orange or sorry yeah orange cool so our navbar is looking a lot better pretty much exactly what we want okay hovers you click on it whatever and so right now since we're working on the index page that's why this is orange if you were on the courses HTML page and on that page you'll have the same navigation thing but instead of putting class active on Rafi you'll put class active on courses and so then courses will be orange on that page so when you click on this it'll take you to the courses out HTML page and this actually will be orange the whole time all right good now what we need to do is add in the bootstrap functionality so then that way this looks beautiful and this button actually looks more beautiful okay and you'll see what bootstrap is bootstrap is literally just a CSS file it's just like a really big CSS file and you can actually just get access to it so you know how we have made all these classes our content button hover this special UL one us as CSS is what is used to made Twitter or sorry bootstrap is what is used to make you know Twitter as well and you just get access to a lot of built in classes in CSS and built in divs and all that stuff and so you can just use their already created styles so for example right where we're creating this form or we're creating this button we could actually just use a button right from bootstrap and we don't have to design our own button we can just say something like button class bootstrap button for example and it'll turn the button into a beautiful button that you didn't have to write any CSS for it just kind of happened automatically okay and that's what we're going after so I'm gonna come in here and I'll add in bootstrap functionality so what we'll do is we'll go strap CDN click right here and here is bootstrap complete CSS okay so you can download this file if you want but I don't want to download the file I just want to get it so I can link to it and now if I go online actually paste this link in it's just a big CSS file okay just a giant CSS file and that's all of this it's all of bootstrap you could download it and put it locally on your computer I just like to link to it so now let's go here we're gonna say a link that's it okay so this is an example of a local CSS file this is an example of a CSS file that's actually hosted online okay I'll hit refresh and now notice it the CSS God or the styling automatically got a little bit better right you notice what actually happened at the top now there's no spacing anymore and there's no beaded padding at the top CS bootstrap automatically comes with a lot of intelligent built in things and when I hover over it turns blue gets that underlined which makes it look nicer to be honest it changed the font a little bit which is totally fine not that big of a deal and at the bottom here we still are running into this problem where this form is not looking nice so we're kind of use some bootstrap bootstrap built and stuff so what I'll do is I'll just literally type in how to make a form in bootstrap okay that's actually what I would Google because I'm not sitting there making bootstrap forms all day so I'll just forget I come across this and this is a coollooking form that's kind of what I want I want to email address and I want a submit button so I'm gonna just pop this guy completely and I'll replace my form with that form and I'll hit save I mean needs to be like this there we go that looks properly indented I'll hit refresh and now look at that look at that it's looking really clean if you want it like this you could leave it like this if you don't want the password1 right we can just go in here to lead this this this and this and that should remove the password okay this is the entire email thing so if you deleted this it'll delete all of the email stuff and if you delete this it'll remove the check box and we don't need the check box we'll remove that I hit refresh this check box is not gone so you could leave it like this if you want but what I like is just the email bar with the yes give me button okay you could you could decide to keep this button if you want I don't really like it and I also don't see the reason to put this email address at the top it says enter email pretty clear I think what it's asking for so what I'll do is first of all I'll so notice something now okay if I do this right and I don't give it a class and I hit save and hit refresh this is your regular button that comes with a regular CSS okay if I give it the class that it had this is a class that's actually being used from bootstrap and even when you hover over it bootstrap has its own default I can even look it up crap default bootstrap buttons alright and you can go there and it'll show you all kinds of buns so to get this button you're gonna have to do button buttons secondary class this class right here okay if you want to get this danger button all you just have to do is button button danger these class is already built in isn't that nice you get beautiful buttons that you don't have to design that just come already built in there's all kinds of other cool stuff that you can do buttons you want a large button you want a small button maybe if you want to icon on the button you could put different kinds of icons on them too so we'll just go back to our website for now and I'm gonna change this button to say yes gimme refresh so now I got that button that's cool I don't need this line because I don't need to have that label I don't care we I don't even need this ID stuff you know if you need it for later I don't need this aria whatever so I'm gonna delete it okay and for placeholder I'm just gonna say email address so I got the email address right here and this is clean enough if you want to keep it like this but I just want to change a few more things and I want to add the bun to the right of it so I'll so then now that is gone and I want this bun to the right how do I put this button to the right oh my god do I have to notice from scratch no do I even know this realistically honestly right now how to add this button to the right not really and I don't care I can look it up a line button on same line I'll just write like what I would write as a normal human bootstrap CSS okay just fill it with keywords here comes up Stack Overflow link it says why don't buttons and inputs a line well in bootstrap I tried something simple like this and apparently he got something that doesn't align really well okay so look at this and then look at his button you know why he got 236 up votes by the way getting the equivalent of 236 up votes on Stack Overflow is like probably a billion people viewed this thing because it's such high quality like not a lot of people will vote but when you get this many votes it's like a lot of people and you can actually see right here view 281 thousand times okay so something that's people look up a lot the same reason why developers you Stack Overflow I use tackler flow a lot for this reason I get my answers like this and now he has some answer and those guys like if you want to group the button on the left side use this if you want to group the button on the right side use this so cool I'll look at this and basically he's putting the class into an input group so that's the div that he's actually using cool so here instead of using a form group it seems like we're gonna be using an input crew okay that's one insight I got from it and then when he's making the button what he's doing is that he's doing okay so input type we have input type we don't want the tax type because email will actually have an email field and what's cool about an email field is that this is something that comes built in with HTML is Allah LeMat automatically check for it so if I try to hit submit it'll say hey please include an @ and when I tried to hit it again it'll say hey please enter off part following the @ sign if I do this you know it'll it'll go okay cool so it has a few things built into it let's go back so my input type is there which is totally fine but what I need and this div actually needs to close here okay so the button and everything else needs to be included in that div the email and the button needs to be included in that div what else type button go all right now I need a span tag this is important so span class equals input group button delete this go here paste it here and oh sorry indenting is just important for it makes it more readable and let's go back refresh and boom I got this email address this is to the side of it crate 20 to go can I go into a deep rabbit hole and figure out how it works yeah do I need to know don't really care all right so now our text is not looking as good as this text so we got to just see all right what's going on do some more trial and error and get to the bottom of this situation so we'll hit well head inspect and see what's going on with our styling so lion hi 2.5 a.m. what's our line height 2.3 m so we can make it 2.5 let's go back here let's sit refresh would it make a difference if we added here yes it does so we'll make sure that we have the line height here so our line height is now looking much better and a lot more readable see there's a lot of like trial and error and you try some things and see how that work and what actually takes place okay let's just double check if our font family is even being used so let's go here let's paste this whoops so for whatever reason our font family was not being used now it should be being used let's put the weight here as well refresh now the weight is being used okay now our stuff is actually looking a lot better than it was looking before is there anything else we need from here that it's not doing alright so another thing is that notice on this page we have some space here and then notice on our current website the one we're working on there's no space at the bottom so we're gonna add some padding in the bottom as well padding bottom let's go here let's make sure all our divs are closing correctly if this div is closing here forum is closing this div is closing span is closing stiff body okay and now we got some spacing action going on at the bottom we can actually add some more spacing I think I'll make it look better so now we got some more even some more spacing so now I think this looks good and the font is looking good you can still change it if you want to whatever hire me and all the buttons are working and there you have it okay we just made a pretty cool website really modern hypermodern minimalistic from scratch and it looks beautiful and this was some of the frontend part now you get better at frontend and you learned the backend skills and you use a website that people would want to use and on the backend you have cool stuff happening you know if you're learning Python or whatever it is you could make really powerful apps okay and now you have the ability to make apps that people will actually want to use and people would want to play around with right and yeah that's it thank you for working on this project I really hope you enjoyed it that's it for this video and as always I'll see you in the next video all right so here we have a basic HTML file okay you can I mean you should know some basics of HTML and CSS if you're watching this video if you don't know them then go and watch like the CSS crash course in HTML crash course that we have and then outside of that so these are the two files what they look like now we are currently on a platform called scrim ba' which another cool thing about this is you'll be able to go back to this exact video on scrim bo you can scroll to any point and you can play with the code at any point you could play with our code and change things and see what differences it makes boom we're gonna be going over a complete guide to flexbox the CSS tricks because these guys are awesome so we're gonna be covering some of what they're talking about and we're gonna be coding this up together all right now for you we have put together a basic index basic HTML file very very tiny with a container and just some items and then we have a basic styling file which has certain properties like for example we want the container to be standing out so on the right hand side you can see the container has a yellow golden border just so you can see that that's a container then all the divs inside of the container just has a little bit of styling so we have added like for example if I change it to 1 or 3 the size of the font changes and then main things are the items so we have a brown purple and black and brown purple and black right to the right hand side now what we want to do is we want to show you how flex flex boxes will actually help you with your code so the first thing you want to do to activate flex box is the main command that you need is the equivalent of like turning on a switch and then turning on a switch and then turning off a switch yeah so display flex yep basically like importing the Flex box functionality pretty much just like importing a library blah blah blah so that just activated it right correct as they can see on the right side yep so display flex flex will activate the Flex box now what has happened effectively is that container has turned into a flex box so any items that go inside of this container will have some of the flex box properties and now you can actually call them yeah so it's pretty much it automatically just sticks it all into a row and it automatically starts by default it's default settings is just to have like while you're resizing stuff it or does it I don't know I don't actually know the complete defaults but pretty much it's just activated and now I can set all the settings you want yep so obviously we have the Flex direction of flex row now let's go to CSS tricks and let's see what it's saying obviously it says the first thing you need is just a display flex because otherwise it won't be activated with this now it has been activated enables a flex content for all its direct children and let's now discuss what the Flex direction does right so we have flex direction you can go left to right which is the default which is what Rho is now if we go back here if you go flex Direction this one this is Rho reverse if I do reverse this just gets flipped over like this we have column right here so if I change this to call them boom you have it in columns okay now if I do column reverse you can see that it just flipped it but in a column now where this could be helpful for example is you could say anything that has a width less than 800 or with less than 600 meaning like kind of when you're on a mobile device or something you can say hey make it a column mmm if you are on a medium size device like a tablet or a large size device like a desktop you could say do a row so that's where these things could come in handy and now you don't have to do that ugly part of the math that normally you have to do here you don't need any math you just use flexbox and it handles all the messy math for you in one word yep so let's leave this here row no wrapper when I was the default but let's just leave it like let like this and let's go here and let's do justify content and we can do justify content and let's just talk about what justify content does okay so let's go to justify content right here and you could have justified content like left justified you could have it maybe more right justified by doing flex and or centered I personally like the space around or spaced evenly quite a bit so let's just give it a try it let's go justify content and we will do flex start which is the default so if I hit save it won't really change much but now let's do end and you can see how things just moved over to the right now let's go from flex and instead of flex and we will go space which one you want to do between yeah sure we're gonna try all of them so space between space evenly mmhmm okay and then you have space around so there you have how you can justify content and again if I change its size you will see how it works right and now you will also see the problem that we we get into is even if we go smaller screen it still just keeps running so we have to fix that and in all it puts it all in the same row now how do we deal with that problem where it just keeps putting everything in one goddamn row instead of doing that we wanted to move over to the new line if the space runs out to automatically wrap to any screen size pretty much yep so well it makes it really easy we can do flex wrap wrap and that's about it okay now things just wrap so if I start going closer it'll just wrap so now it's pretty much mobilefriendly pretty close to it automatically this is what we love about the Flex box if you're dealing with images and things of that nature you definitely want to have flexwrap on other things that are cool about flexbox yeah we have a thing called order we can order them kind of however we want now if we go and go here and I go order one you can see which one got ordered what now if I add in order to you can see what happens here and if I do order three we have the default order that we had originally yes you can kind of manually order each item independently which is what this allows you to do it's just like numbering them in a certain order like the elements of a list or something yep exactly of a sorted list so yeah so you have like the default which is just all the way through or you're gonna reverse or you can manually order them any way you want so you have full freedom yes you make it look maybe you want to do two one three or something so you can change that in the order that you want all right so this is why order this is where order can come handy now let's take a look at few other properties that you might need like to be honest these are them these are the most common and simple ones you need to just get started alright these are the most common simple ones you need to just get started and again just in case you're seeing how this is working we have one container and then we have bunch of divs inside of it okay and each div has a class item one item two item three which is why we have class item one item two item three all right browsers support another important thing you want to take a look at flexbox has browser support pretty much with all browsers now you probably don't want to be using Internet Explorer but if you're using the 11 Plus you have accessibility to flex box with Chrome Safari and Mozilla Firefox you obviously have the flexibility to use it now where it says new or new that's where you can add the regular syntax of just saying flex on the older ones you might have to say flex box or if we are if you get really old you have to say box for example we have a file here which is a very simple file with one context container and everything else is just a flex item we can resize this image and you'll see what it does we can go to its CSS and in the CSS to add compatibility for multiple browsers you can see how they have done it WebKit which and Mozilla they did box and for other stuff they did either flex box or flex these you honestly just want to look them up online and see what's the best way to add compatibility across multiple different browsers but if you just write it very simply and you just do display Flex most of the browsers if people have the newer versions your code will run but you definitely want to make sure that you have compatibility in all of them hopefully this gives you some idea of how flex boxes are used what we can do is we can add in multiple items here so you can get more of an idea of what's happening there we covered the basics of Flex box that you need to immediately get up and running mmhmm we will have the source code in the description below for you to go and use now we're gonna be jumping into the next portion of the video where we're gonna be building a few mini projects that require flex box so you can get the idea behind them one of them is going to be your aging days and then the second one is going to be what is it going to be it's the cat generator random cat meme give which is gonna be a lot of fun there's random ass cats in there and good luck trying to focus on the code but I think you'll learn a lot and you'll enjoy it and what we would love for you to do is build it and then drop it in the comments below and we'd love to even check out your code cool so now let's jump into the project portion of the video what's up guys how's it going let's get started or as this in my country let's get swifty so we're gonna be starting from complete scratch okay so if you look at over onto the screen cue that screen up right now it's empty okay but this is what we want it to look like ultimately so challenge one challenge two three four five blackjack blah blah we're gonna start off a challenge one in this video Ken we're just gonna work and figure out how to actually do that so let's get started on this challenge okay the first thing we're gonna need to do is sew so by the way the reason why I have the borders around it and so you can kind of see like visually you know once we're actually working on this challenge you'll you'll see how you know each border is supposed to represent like a div or a container and if you don't know what the heck that is don't worry you'll learn and I'll guide you through the process okay so the first thing we're gonna do is just add add the HTML content okay so where's this challenge one your age and days and maybe the click Me button in the reset button and we'll go from there okay so let's get started on the lefthand side I want to show you in vs code here I have index.html file and right next to it I have a static folder and static I have my CSS I have my images I have my GS and sounds okay so don't worry about that for now you what you aren't gonna worry about is CSS and JavaScript okay and I don't want to just show you JavaScript by itself I can and I will a little bit here and there but my main goal is to show you JavaScript and how it works together we everything else okay so you know I'll show you a few things in JavaScript right now so I'll go over to my JavaScript and I'll write something like alert hello okay and I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna go back to my index.html file and I'll write my doc tab it'll autocomplete a bunch of useful common normal stuff and so I'll just keep that there and for document I will say let's see Java Script on steroids and when I come over here and I hit refresh the tab you'll see it says JavaScript on steroids now I need to link my JavaScript sheet to my HTML otherwise it's not gonna run the JavaScript code okay it's kind of like the CSS and how that work now on the left hand side you can see how they're related to each other okay index is over here and then you got to go in the static folder then you got to go into J's folder and then you got up click on it then you got to select J script yes so we're gonna do just that okay so right before the body tag is about to end I'm gonna add a script tag and I will say something along the lines of source and I'll make the source static /j s slash script dot J s okay I'll hit save and I'll let refresh and you can see that the JavaScript code just ran and now it says hello okay this alert popped up I can change this this to hi and I can come here refresh and now you can see the dialog box popped up and it says hi I can comment this out I can say console dot log hello and hit save I can hit right click inspect I'll go into console I'll refresh and when I hit refresh what you see here let's make that bigger what you see here it says hello okay and this is the console so anything I write and I said call so the log it'll just show up in the console right here console is very very useful and if you have chrome you can pop into this and check it out developer tools and I'm sure Mozilla Firefox has those developer tools as well okay but I but I encourage you to use Chrome because that's what we're gonna be using for this course so now let's get started and see how can we add this challenge one your aging days right we're gonna just add the HTML content I'm just gonna comment on someone's JavaScript and we'll work on the JavaScript part together I'm also gonna hide the tab by doing command B okay I'm gonna hide that little tab right there and we're gonna go into our body and we're gonna get started so first I'm gonna write an h2 tag because I think that's an h2 I'm gonna right click inspect and I'm yeah that's h2 okay so I'm gonna go back and my h2 tag I'm gonna write this so boom refresh challenge one your age in days so cool we're done with that part of the code now I want to add a few buttons and you know make them look kind of nice how these look so let's let's let's first just add a button and then the button will say click me and then we'll have another button and now say reset okay I'll come over here refresh and now we have two buttons okay cool so we got the buns but now what now we want to make it look a little bit nicer so what I'm gonna do is instead of designing my own epic buttons I'm just gonna use bootstrap and bootstrap makes it really easy to to just style my stuff and make it look a lot nicer okay without me having to write a lot of code to style my but I'm gonna go get bootstrap and just do it so here bootstrap CDN and quick bootstrap CDN stack path I'll grab this complete CSS path okay CSS I have copied it and I'm gonna go over here and I will say link and then paste that bootstrap okay now that that bootstrap has been pasted all this is by the way guys it all this is by the way is just a CSS file that's hosted online okay so you could take the CSS file and you could actually paste it into your own CSS file like like that and notice it's like many many many many lines of code it just is all horizontal and on one line but I I wouldn't do that I'll just use the one that's on line okay so I'm just gonna link to that path that's kind of all we're doing here by linking to that path instead of linking to a local path we're linking to an online path and after linking to it for these buttons I'm just gonna add the class button button primary for this one and now what you're gonna notice if I come here and hit refresh this looks like a beautiful juicy bootstrap button okay and then I'm for this button I'm gonna add class is equal to button button danger like that okay hit refresh and you can see now it looks like a nice juicy bootstrap danger button okay so you have the blue button we have the red button now what's what else is going on on this page right so on this page we have all this content nice and centered and whereas on arms we actually don't have a nice and centered right if I look at ours it's kind of like all the way to the top left a lot of it's like squeezed up there so we wanna if you notice you know we kind of want to bring it in the middle and give it a little spacing from the top so we're gonna do that so we're just gonna play around with it and see how we can do it okay I'm gonna put a container here in a second because what I want to do I want to show you guys something called flexbox okay and flexbox makes your life really really easy it's gonna allow you to put things in a nice little grid and organize them instead of how we had to do it with we had flex boxes you have to use like coordinates and percentages and do a lot of math to create things into their own grids and columns well it's flex box it makes it really easy to put things either in a row or in a column and it just calculates everything for you looks super nice and organized okay so that's what we're gonna do first I will create a container class okay I'm gonna say I'm gonna call this container one okay I have this move this over and now I'm gonna create a flexbox class okay I'm gonna give this class flexbox container one like that and I'm gonna save this guy a div and I'll add I'll add in this button okay and I'll just put each of these buttons in their own divs okay so cool so I have basically what I'm doing is I'm putting a flex box at the top and inside of it I'm putting in two buttons and each of those buttons is it's you know a in its own div okay I'm gonna hit refresh here and you just see that each button is it in its own div now what I want to do is put them all kind of in one space so before I go and do all of that let's just do a flexbox container one and I'm gonna go in here and I'll just add a border okay I'll add one pixel let's do solid and black come here refresh flexbox container one let's go back here why isn't it showing up Oh obviously because I didn't link to the sheet so I'm just gonna do link and I'm gonna do static slash CSS slash style of CSS refresh here and now you can see that it's actually showing up somewhat okay so we got those two divs there and then what I actually want to do is I want to say display flex okay so I'm doing display flex now and I'm gonna do flex let's add a little bit of padding to this okay adding a little bit of padding here oh and this div here let's move this down so sorry my container div wasn't closing although at the bottom and that's kind of where some of the stupid errors we're coming from I don't know what the heck I'm doing here and this Dave is supposed to be closing all the way at the bottom here cool so now what's happening is this Dave is being closed here this disclosed here this is closed here and this one's closed there cool now let's refresh okay cool so now we have the two buttons inside of inside of one container okay this is the container this is what I added the border around okay so if you notice here right I'm gonna hover over the elements here real quick I'll move this here and I'm hovering over the container element and you can see that the this element that says flexbox container 1 that's where actually that border is and that's the one you actually see highlighted right now right okay now what I want to do is add some padding in between the buttons too so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put each of the buttons in their own little box cuz right now they're part of one flex box so they're kind of like pushing together with each other so what I want to actually do is give them a little breathing room okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say inside of the flexbox container class container class if there's any div just give it a padding of 10 10 pixels and so now you see eat you because click me is a div and reset is a div it's giving its giving it its own space I can also say hey border add 1 pixel solid black here and so now you can see that the reset and click me are actually their own little thing and even though their own little thing to have a little padding inside right so if I actually take away the padding right I I click this you can see what happens or if I go in here and take away the padding so let's see on the right side if it lets me take that away click right here yep right there so if I take that padding away you see how those buttons are squeezed together like that but then I'm gonna add padding to get a little bit of breathing room so now what this is doing is that inside of this class every single div its selecting that and I'm just styling each of those divs that are that's only within this particular container class okay hopefully you're following me so far okay so right now we're just kind of doing the styling part we're gonna add the JavaScript part in just a little bit so now what do we want to do okay we have all of this together one thing we want to do is that we want to justify our content okay we want to justify our content and we want to justify it as space around and when we refresh it's adding space around it so flexbox has like smart things okay there are some other options too for example see if vs codes will make those suggestions for you so do you justify content and then see it does write flex start flex and so I can do flex start for example okay hit this refresh and now set flex start I could also do flex and and now they're all the way to the right of the Flex box right where the Flex box is ending so have you ever seen those testimonials on a page where at the bottom like some of them are starting from the left to right and then right below it it starts from right to left and then right the lowest start from left to right well we're using flexbox you could actually make it really easy for you to do and it's kind of cool and it will do flex here as well so there we go justified content will add a flex wrap flex wrap will come in handy later on when we have things that need to wrap around or go to start going to new lines so it won't really take too much effect right now but I'll show you what it does afterward and instead of flex and we're gonna a new space around you can also do space between space evenly cool so our dev one is looking somewhat decent we're gonna do a line items Center okay now what we want to do is make sure that the entire challenge is inside of a container so what I'm gonna do is I already have it inside of a container what I want to do is just make it visual so you can actually see it okay so I'm just gonna do dot container one and then I'll just do border one pixel solid black okay and there we go so now you can see that the entire thing is actually inside of one container and the this one over here is the Flex box inside now flex box has two flex items and one is click me and one is reset okay I can do you know different kinds of things with this like I can choose my Flex Direction so I can do a row which is usually by default and I can also do column and now notice that each of those are in its own column which again is pretty cool how it makes it so easy for you I just didn't call them I can also do column reverse if I wanted to switch their orders right and I can also do row reverse so here now reset and click me get switched up so pretty nice but right now we're just going to keep it at row now what we want to do is when somebody clicks click me it should essentially add how many days old you are okay and then let you reset it so we're gonna now work on that okay so what we're gonna do for this is we're gonna go inside of our index HTML we're gonna go right below our div flexbox container 1 we're gonna create another div here we're gonna give it the same class a flex box container 1 because we want to inherit its styling and then inside of here I'm gonna create a div and I'll give it an idea flex box result okay just like that so now this is gonna be empty you're not this is gonna be empty there's nothing in there yet what we're gonna do is we're gonna create an h2 element and we're gonna add it in there so that's kind of where that is gonna take place but you're not gonna see that right away so let's go ahead and do that now we're gonna go to our script I will remove all of this and this is gonna be our challenge 1 your age in days now this is the fun JavaScript part okay okay how do we do age in days well think about it first what we need is well here's what we need to get okay we need to see how what year somebody was born in okay so let's say that you were born in 1994 well how would I figure out how many days old you are in a simple way okay I will take your age and just multiply it by 365 because there are 365 days in a year and that will give me your age in days so if you're 10 years old I'll do 10 multiply it by 365 that number 3650 those will be the number of days and you know and that's how old you are and that's essentially what we're gonna be doing here okay you know take the age and then just subtract so for example I can do something like variable birth year is equal to 1994 whoops let's do this let's do birth year that's it's for 1994 now I'm gonna do 2018 birth or sorry I can do this age in days right what's the formula for Asian days well that's just 2018 the current year your birth year okay and now if I print out aging days age in days it says 20 other sorry I gotta do this multiplied let's put a parentheses around this multiply it by 365 okay now if I do age in days it gives me eight thousand seven hundred sixty and that's how many days old I am so that's essentially it it's not too complicated it's a pretty straight up thing so we're gonna do birth year is equal to but how we're gonna now take this input is by using something called prompt okay so for example I can say variable let's see Apple okay I will say equals prompt how many apples do you eat every day question mark and now notice it just pulled up a prompt okay it says how many apples do you eat everyday I will say six and hit enter now that I've done that I'm gonna go in the console and hit Apple and look it says six it gives me a six as a string very cool okay so that's information that you're actually gonna be that's how you're gonna be taking an information from the user that's how you're gonna be using the prompt so I'm gonna go here and I'll say a prompt what year were you born good friend okay so let's save it let's come here let's refresh and boom there it is I was born in 1994 awesome now what we're gonna do is we're gonna connect that button to to triggering this okay so every time we click instead of it just like instead of just me refreshing the page and it popping up this prompt what I want to do is that it should pop up once I click the click Me button so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna wrap this inside of a function I'll call this function age in days all right and I'll go in my index.html and what I'll say is that in this button I'm gonna give it another attribute and I'll say on click run that function age in days okay I said run that function so I'll hit refresh and now look the prompt didn't pop up but when I click click me the prompt prompts up okay pops up cool so that's pretty exciting so far let's keep going we got our birth here what can we do now well let's just pop up hopefully as post mates and we got some delicious food we'll see how it is it's probably really good and let's just keep rolling with it okay so I'm gonna do var all right so age in days okay we just did birth year and now we're gonna take your age in days okay how are we gonna do that I'm gonna call this age in days a bad variable name because the function is called this so I will just do age in days okay terrible normally shouldn't do that but I just will okay and I'm gonna move on with this so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say 2018 birth year that's kind of what we did earlier x 365 that's gonna give me the age in days okay of this person and let's actually just print it out to the console so I'm gonna do consult log age in days which is a variable here I'll go here I'll hit refresh now click click me and I'll do 1994 and in the console is giving me the right result ok 8760 the only problem is that is giving me in the console but it needs to give it to me actually in our file right our in our index.html so what we need to do is add it to that ok this is something called Dom do M document object model and we just need to create a new h2 element and just put it in our Dom okay so I'll show you exactly how we're gonna do that you see this little empty box here we're gonna just attach it kind of to that so let's get started with that I'm gonna say create an h1 variable I'm gonna say document dot creates elements and I'll create a h1 element ok now once I create that h1 element I'm gonna say text answer document dot create text node ok so I'm now creating text and I'm gonna add that ultimately to the h1 content ok so I'm gonna say you are you are here plus age in days so this is what we're doing right now a string concatenation so we're taking a string and then we're adding a variable to it ok that's it's just a fancy way of saying like we're attaching two strings together got it okay good all right let's keep going so I'm gonna take this I will add days old to that okay so this is gonna create that text node this um pop get grabbing this age in days over here and that's gonna be my text answer once I create this text answer I want to add it to my h1 okay so how do I do that I'm gonna say set h1 dot set attribute and I'm gonna say set its ID to age in days and then I want to do H 1 dot appendchild text answer and then lastly what I want to do is document dot get element by ID flex box result okay and a pen child H one a lot going on here and I'm gonna explain it in just a second so I'm gonna delete all of this or that one line I'm gonna hit refresh I'll hit click me I'll hit 1994 and boom you can see that it says you are eight thousand seven or sixty days old in my code okay doesn't say it anywhere else and not in the console not in an alert it actually says it right in my page so how is this working okay I can always right click and hit inspect whenever you're in doubt just inspect okay think of it like you're a detective and you're trying to figure out like what's actually taking place so while I'm looking at this if I hover over I can see my agent days and another thing I want you to notice is you see here on line eight or we're setting this attribute and we're saying set this h1 tags ID to age in days well check it out this h1 now has an ID which is age in days and then what I'm doing is I'm I'm adding that little h1 that I created right to that I'm appending the text answer I created earlier so it's adding this guy right here to the h1 and then once it does that I go grab the flexbox result okay which is right over here flexbox result and to that i append a child which is the h1 tag I ended up creating ok so if I hit refresh it goes away when I click me 1994 it calculates it for me and gives me how old I am now we just need to do two things one it's to make sure that when we hit reset this actually goes away okay and that one is not as hard so I'm going to do function reset and I'll say take that document get that particular element by its ID okay and ID we gave it flex box result that's the idea of it right so I'm gonna do flex box result or actually I'm gonna do age in days because that's the that's ID that this guy has so we want to grab that guy and remove him okay so I'm gonna do a get element age and days and I'm just gonna call remove on it and now I just want to make sure that this function reset runs when I click the reset button see if you can figure this part out because we did the click me together where I gave click me the ability to run this function age in days see if you can get the reset one to figure it I'm gonna give you five seconds five four three two one okay now I'm gonna show you how to do it so if you didn't get it don't worry beat yourself up just a little bit because you should have gotten it but if but if not you know what it's okay this happens and we're here to learn and we'll just figure it out together okay you and me okay we're in this battle together so let's figure it out I'm gonna go to my I'm gonna go to my button okay reset and I'm just gonna go here and I'll say on click and I will say run the function reset that's it so now I'll refresh I'll hit click meet 1994 you are eight thousand seven or sixty days old I'll hit reset and boom it just grabs that div and just deletes it so now it's gone okay if I actually remove all the borders you wouldn't even see anything here just look empty to you and the last thing we want to do in this challenge is just make sure everything is kind of like centralized so what I want to do is I will go to my style at CSS I'll go to my container and I'm gonna do margin0 auto and I'll hit refresh here and I'm gonna go to my width and I'll make my width like about seven five percent and I'll hit refresh and now you can see that it's a little bit more centralized right but the text is still not centralized so last thing I wanna do is a line text or I think it's text align text align and center I'm not a frontend expert guys I barely spent any time on frontend so take this with a grain of salt so take this with a grain of salt but this is good I'm gonna save it I'm gonna come here refresh look at that nice and centralized looking sexy we're ready to get into our challenge too I hope that you got it so far you understand it whether you understand it or you don't what I want you to do is try to do this all from scratch okay don't get discouraged because you're gonna fail this the first few times it's gonna feel a little bit like is gonna hurt your brain but it's gonna start to make sense so do this for your first few times get the hang of how that HTML the CSS and the JavaScript all connect and speak together of each other one thing is styling it one thing is creating it and the other thing JavaScript is helping speak to your code your buttons and make everything essentially work okay so that's it I hope you're excited for the second challenge I know I am and as always that's it for this video and I'll see you you in the next video what's up you how is it going I hope you are excited and I know I am and we're gonna work on the second challenge in this video okay this is the cat generator challenge and just gonna be super exciting a lot of fun to work on it this is where you hit that green button and it generates cats for you okay kind of like that and we're gonna work on this together we're gonna build it up now the things that are gonna be that that are gonna be like the most complex in this project right is not really the JavaScript horse it's gonna be the HTML and CSS portion so we're gonna focus more on HTML and CSS part of for this project and then the JavaScript part is gonna be a little bit easier and we're gonna do that at the end in the store we're gonna do HTML CSS and now you might be wondering hey Kazi this is the JavaScript module so why are we focusing more on the HTML and CSS the reason is because I want you to learn in a projectbased way now I can just teach you the JavaScript parent we can just do console.log all day and not actually build any cool projects but that would be boring you're gonna want to shoot yourself and you're not gonna actually make any forward progress so I want to avoid that and you might actually make progress but it won't be as enjoyable and you won't feel that deep sense of achievement okay but I promise you will learn JavaScript in a more deeper way because you get to learn how it connects to these projects okay so it'll be a lot of fun hang in there with me and let's get started so for this let's talk about the HTML and CSS part okay so you saw me just generate five cats right now okay notice what happened like the cats didn't run across this border right they didn't run across to the right or to the left they nicely move on to the to a new line in this case okay so how are these how are these images intelligent like that how does that happen how does it know to automatically go to a new line when it can't fit on the top one anymore and I'm gonna show you some really cool ways to be able to make something and in a really super simple way the simplest way okay to do that okay normally it used to require math and for you to know percentages there's there's something so much easier so it's a little bit of how we did the last one the age in days except I'm gonna break this one down a little bit more okay so first I'm gonna just gonna take a picture of this challenge right here I'm just gonna let's just talk about this particular challenge and nothing else okay so let's go like this and talk about this challenge now everything that's in the gray area in this picture I want you to think of that as the body okay that's the body of the entire EML documents so for example you know here this white area right that's the body the thing in the borders like these over here those are the containers right so we made the containers and then we shrunk them right and we made it we made it like so it's more centered all the content is centered on the page but the outside of it and like every the whole document is actually like the body okay so I just want you to be aware of that distinction now first I want to talk about this okay so this is a container that contains everything about our challenge okay so it's literally just a div okay and that div has a class of container that's all this is so this red thing I'm just gonna call this a container all right now what's going on with the rest of the stuff right this this challenge thing is just in the container and the button we can just call we can just say that it's in a container right now I have it in its own div which is like a flexbox div but that's really not necessary and in this challenge we're not gonna even do that but you can if you want to so we're gonna ignore the the button but the button is essentially you think of it like it's in the same place as where the challenge is okay it's just in the container that's it and now where are these cats right these cats are actually inside of a something we call in CSS a flexbox so they're actually inside of another div okay so I'm gonna highlight this blue and I'm gonna make a little bit tricky but I'm gonna do this like this and then I'm gonna move this oops when it moves this blue bar right on top of this okay I should be good enough okay so that blue box is another day of inside of the container div okay so the container is the parent and this blue one is not the parent okay it's the child and this is the Flex box div okay within this flexbox day if we have a few items now flexbox is something that's pretty intelligent and it has pretty smart builtin ways of telling it to hey space things evenly or when something runs across make sure it does make sure it doesn't run across instead it actually runs down below and starts a new line okay so what we're gonna talk about that too and all these the images they're just image elements okay so if I have to highlight them I'll highlight them for you as well so these each of these are just image elements that's it okay so if I have to write that down I would just write IMG here and that's it it's just the image class or the image element that's all those are now where this padding thing is coming from right like how is there this spacing that takes place in between so if I have to draw this out how is this happening so here I'm gonna type this out because my handwriting is not the best okay this 10 pixel margin where is that taking place that's actually taking place in the Flex box so in the flex box styling we can actually define it to to just space all of the that divs items by 10 pixels so that's essentially what's causing that spacing okay now what is causing it to wrap instead of going across the body and running into the body right and getting outside of the flex box div or the original container the reason why when you pop open a new image it goes down below is because of something called wrapping and flex box and there's an intelligent way how wrapping works so here I'm gonna just highlight it and essentially the code we have for that flex wrap rap okay so that's the specific code that's actually making the wrapping work and another thing I want you to be aware of is how there is uh how everything is spaced kind of evenly and then there's space around it okay so notice notice here right this is not just that ten padding this is something else okay and then notice this here and notice this here right how is that so this is actually something we call space around okay and space around is what's causing this to happen and more specifically the code the line of code would be this so let me sorry I'm sorry let me delete this and then right in here if it would let me just TIFF by content space around okay like that so that's actually what's allowing me to have that equal spacing take place okay so at the end of the day we have two divs one is the container div and then the one is a flexbox div flexbox div it's intelligent we just tell it hey make it all the items of that div flex so all the link that basically somebody put together this website where it's called a cat API comm and every time you run their URL it gets you a new image every single time and some random new image so I thought that'd be that'd be cool and it makes our life a lot easier okay so if I you know paste that every time and run it you can see I keep getting a new newer and newer image and also because I want a small image in the arguments of the URL parameter Isis size is equal to small okay and type is jiff now you could probably change the type you could probably change the source and you could probably change the size but I like small and I like jiff because gifs are awesome so let's go back to our JavaScript steroids thing and I'm just gonna paste that I'm just gonna paste it that's it okay I'm just gonna paste it as a source and we're gonna hit refresh and you can see one of the images popping up in the Flex box right it's popping up in the Flex box let's try putting another image in another image and then refreshing and seeing what happens so now what I want you to notice is that these images are really close to each other and there's no padding right so if I put this to the lefthand side whoops if I put this is a lefthand side you see that this has padding except our images on the right have absolutely no padding and then another thing I want you to see is that it actually runs across instead of running on a new line right so if I added another image here it'll kind of look really ugly now I press refresh like notice that the images are now just literally running across right running across the page already fresh again same thing those are running across so now what should I do well first let's just highlight each image green so you can actually see that each of the elements inside of that flexbox okay or inside of that container so I'm gonna say flexbox container two and I'll go here and I'll say get select the image okay so I can go one level down that container and just select the image and I'm gonna give border and I'll say one pixel solid and also in green okay and we'll refresh and now you can see that each image has a green border around so you can kind of see you can kind of see what that like which part of that is in the image okay so yeah it's a little confusing cuz there's overlap between the Flex box and the image but I think I think you get the idea right okay so now how can we make it so the images actually run across or sorry run down okay so first let's do that so make sure the image is actually running down so my container the type is flex and then what I want to do is I want to say flex wrap and enable the wrap and when I hit refresh you'll notice that now when it's about to run across the div or the Flex box it'll automatically go to the new line so now that's a pretty good sign that's a pretty good thing that we have done but if we look at the padding the padding is still kind of annoying and also spaces it kind of weirdly right it's it's all left justified and it's not centralized and it doesn't feel like equal amount of spacing and it kind of feels a little a little messy right so if I fullscreen the page it looks like this and maybe if I put a few more cats here and now if I fullscreen the page yeah you know I'm not a really big fan of it so one thing we want to do definitely is add some padding let's try adding some padding here okay so now this is a little bit better that's maybe what we want most of because we definitely want some padding to be taking place right and what we're essentially doing is between each image we're adding some padding so that's what we're doing before we had the padding in the div but well we s actually won the padding in is between each image element so now between each image element it has a padding of 10 so this has a padding of 10 and this has a padding of 10 that's why they're kind of equally spaced they're spaced out from one another now notice how these images like the images below are lining up to the images at the top but notice how what we had on this page these images at the bottom are not actually lining up to the images at the top right they're not left justified they're more like centralized in a really intelligent way so to do that what we essentially need to do is said justify content and we want to say space around okay and once I hit refresh you can see that because of space around the lot the images at the bottom don't actually run all the way to the left they're more they're more centralized okay cool so flex boxes are pretty awesome and they make our life you know a lot a lot easier so we've added the padding we have the images we pretty much have everything we need at this point right this is the challenge is essentially complete at this point the only thing that we need to do is make it so that when we hit the generate cat button it automatically creates the image element right instead of us having right now we're manually writing it so what we want to do is we hit the generate cat button it automatically adds those cats so I want to do generate cat add the cats for me so I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna delete all the cats for now okay once I delete all the cats you can see that the cats are gone if I make the page full and I hit generate cat because I don't have any JavaScript attached yet to my page well nothing is gonna actually take place right nothing is gonna happen nothing is gonna get added so now we need to do a little bit of JavaScript magic okay but that part is actually very very very simple so what we want to do is I'm gonna go here and I'll say I'll give this an ID okay so I'll just call it cat Jen button okay you can really call it whatever you want again let me just see what I have here so the the naming convention is the same we'll actually call this cat generator right here okay we'll call it cat generator so that's the ID of this green button here and then I'm gonna go over here and I'll add something called on click and I'll say on click run a function called generate cat now I'm gonna go over to my JavaScript and in my JavaScript I'm gonna create a function call generate cat and what this is essentially gonna do is it's gonna first get that is gonna create an image element then I want to create a div element so I'm gonna say or actually we don't need to create a div element but what I do need to do is get access to the flexbox TIFF okay so I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna say get element by ID so what I need access to is actually this guy right over here and the idea is that once I can get access to this container I want to just keep appending image elements to this every time somebody clicks a button so to get access to this let's just give it an ID so that way it'll make it'll make getting access to this a little bit easier okay so I'm gonna say ID is equal to flex box or flex cat Gen that's the ID I'm gonna give it let's go over to our JavaScript I will say Flex box or Flex cat Gen and that should get us that div and now what I want to do is set the images source okay so the image element that I created earlier I want to set its source to a link and that link in this case will be the cat whatever link and then what I want to do at the end is to that div append a child and that child is going to be the image and save I'll hit refresh and I'll hit generate cats and boom it works and generate cat and it works and generate cat and generate cat and if i refresh you can see how it's working cool there's only one thing that we actually need to add and we're gonna do that in just a second okay so the box shadows are not there notice with my cat it looks a little it looks pretty clean right you see that how the image looks like it's like popping out a little bit that's what I want to give you because otherwise you're gonna have a image that looks really flat and your website looks pretty stupid and amateurish right you want to give it a little pizzazz to it so I'm gonna just pretty much have you copy my code here for that and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna copy my box shadow code and you can play around with it so you can really see how it works but there are websites like CSS Matic or something I think and you can go to them and actually create boxes and shadows and things like that like visually and it gives you the CSS code for it alright so I'm gonna go in image here I'll paste it here and where it will refresh and generate cat generate cat and generate cat and you know it looks like the Box shadow is popping up over here and it looks like that part of it is looking pretty good now another thing I want to do when I hit refresh take that away okay so I don't actually even need padding because that padding was adding the white border around and actually didn't make it look that good but with the space even or the space or round that we did with the Flex box it automatically gives it a inherent padding and that kind of looks really nice right now and that's essentially what we want so it's looking pretty good honestly at this point a few things we need we can actually improve here is first of all we can take away the borders because they look a little ugly the only reason I had them is so you can kind of compare them with the little picture that I made but I would pretty much take away like let's say at least that border and then the red borders I have right maybe just make them black for now ultimately you don't want to have any borders the reason why I have the borders there right now is so you can see very easily like what is what okay so I'll refresh and I just made the borders black so this way just looks a little bit cleaner now you might notice that there is there's a lot of like repetition of code okay so what I mean by that we have display flex and 4 flex box container one I have display flex I have flex wrap wrap I have for this flexbox container one flex wrap wrap flex direction row by default flex direction is row I only just chose to write it here so you can see you know what it actually is and then we also have justified content space or round and then I have border one pixel black and I have a border one pixel black so there since there's so much overlap of the code there's really no reason to write its own like write these lines again what I can actually just do is say flex box container to okay like that and just hit save and delete this and when I come over here refresh and hit generate cat you see it it generates my cats and my cats look pretty good okay so that's the situation with that guy container to border one pixel solid with 75% can and you can see like the code is the exact same as container one so what can you do right you just the same thing it'll do container dot container to okay so essentially the same code is there okay and you can see that that's also working just fine all right so now when I do generate cat right it almost it's still good but here's the thing one thing that makes it look a little ugly is like look there's no there's no padding or margin between those images it's if there's no breathing room for them images whereas if you look my look at my final version right look at the images and look how there's this nice little margin between the images so we're gonna basically add that and here you're also gonna get to play around with the difference of padding and margin okay a lot of the times you want to just be using margin but sometimes you should use padding generally I like to actually use margin so here like you'll notice what happens I'll do 10 pm pixels here right I'll to that image I'm gonna add a padding here and I'll refresh and you'll notice how it's adding the little white thing because essentially what it's doing is extending it out but what we want to do is we want to give a gap between each image element so now instead of adding padding I'll say margin and I'll go refresh and I'll do generate cat a few times and boom look at that instead of like extending each image box what it did is it just added spacing between each image box okay so now this looks super clean I love it I hope you love it and you can see the power of flex boxes right the more I hit generate cats the the container grows to fit it the flex box grows to fix it to fit it and then the Flex box is also very intelligent in terms of how to wraps how it spaces around evenly how it centralizes it so I am a big fan I love it and there you have it this is what your CSS actually should look like okay these were the new things that we added literally like and I believe this line here okay that was all that was added in the CSS for this one or actually in container 2 this is all we added in the JavaScript part for this video and this is the only part that we added for the HTML part in this video ok that's it I hope that you enjoyed
