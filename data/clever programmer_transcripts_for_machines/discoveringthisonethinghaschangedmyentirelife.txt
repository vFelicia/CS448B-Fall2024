so I am walking back and forth my heart is literally pumping out of my chest at this point and I know I have to make this phone call but I don't want to do it I've just gotten this job today I found out and I've gotten it at $50 an hour and my mentor against everybody else's advice has told me charge them $100 an hour don't charge them 50 and I remember my family going what are you doing you're looking a gift horse in the mouth your 20 year old Oakton Community College student with a terrible GPA you are lucky and you should accept this as is and my mentor is telling me look you're good and this is what you should be charging as a software Python developer freelancer and even though this is your very first job this is possible so again you can imagine I've already gotten it $50 an hour fulltime and now I have to make this call and tell them look I want $100 an hour and literally palms are sweating I pick up the phone call and I'm like listen I know that we agreed to 50 but because of the workload that's involved I'm gonna have to go with $100 an hour because this requires a lot of work I'm gonna be doing some Python consulting I'm your trusted advisor and for everything that needs to be done that's gonna be the rape and at the other line he just hung up or he not even hang up immediately but he goes okay we're gonna have to look at our budget and I'll give you a call back we hung up I spent 24 hours and just agony thinking about what is gonna happen am I gonna get this job am I not gonna get this job did I just throw everything away this amazing opportunity and the next day I come home from college I haven't even told this to my parents yet that I have done this I haven't told this to my friends I've been told this to anybody and the next day I seed my phone and I see this text message and it says it's a long message but it ultimately says congratulations you've got it and we're starting this Wednesday that was the moment where for me everything changed literally my whole life changed because here I was willing to work for free to do coding because I loved being able to take something that's in my head and bringing it out to the real world bringing it out and making it a reality and then everybody else around me can use it okay so I would do it for free I wouldn't only do it for free I love it so much that I would pay right I would actually pay somebody to let me work on a project like this and not only was I not having to pay out of my own pocket not only was it not just a free job but I was gonna be getting paid to do this so unbelievable moment the lesson that I learned out of this is that if I didn't have a mentor right this would not be possible for me he was somebody who helped me accelerate my progress by years literally helped me cut my lifetime and have something that would have taken me 10 20 years to achieve maybe five years he helped me get it way faster of charge what I'm worth and again money is not only important because you just want to have a pile of it and sit on it because you don't only want to be able to take care of yourself but those around you okay and my having that mentor was key for me so in your life if you want to achieve something and you want to get there look for that mentor who can guide you in the right direction
