just wanted to chat with you real quick I know over the last couple of weeks I've had a pretty harsh stance around coding and I get that and there's a time and place for that I want to go into something deeper that I was feeling today around coding and like I get so many messages around it and it just people are so torn I can't get myself to do it or it's very hard I just keep getting frustrated people who have jobs and then they're trying to come back and then code an hour a day or whatever and today's message I just want to keep it very very simple my purpose here is just to make sure that you are getting value you're doing something with coding in your journey as a software developer where you're progressing forward and further so let's try something very simple today very easy very easy okay instead of trying to trying so hard on yourself and trying to be motivated to go all in to obsess and to go crazy which is a lot of times my mess and I do believe in it okay there's a time and place for that but if you're not a momentum and you're feeling out of momentum let's start with something really simple I'll prescribe you something specific that if you do that starting today or just even do it today or tomorrow it'll help you tremendously in coding okay even with myself when I'm not motivated or I'm not excited about something and my body is not feeling it really all that's happening is my body isn't giving me dopamine for for that thing that I want to be doing it's just like hey I'm not going to give you a lot of dopamine for this today and you're like like I gotta go and get my dopamine now from swiping on Instagram and swiping through Twitter and swiping through Tick Tock and Instagram reels but when you have that happen here's what you need to do you just need to give yourself a little one small thing to do and then just do that and once you do that your body and your mind will automatically start getting into momentum so let's try something specific today and very easy one and here's what it is I want you to set a schedule okay I want you to just put in your calendar for tomorrow a two hour block of when you're going to code that's it I don't need you to do some heroic Herculean effort where you spend 10 to 15 hours a day coding I don't need you to quit your other job so you get really obsessed over coding let's just start off with something very very simple can we do that let's just start off with schedule it on your calendar for two hours that's it for tomorrow okay could you do that okay that's a very easy step and I and I and I hope and I think that you could take that step and do it just find a time okay so let's just work through it together maybe you might be able to do in the morning so cool let's block uh 7 A.M to 9 A.M in the morning but if you can do it in the morning maybe you could do it after work so fine let's do a 6 p.m to 8 P.M block then I don't need you to be coding hard I don't need you to be obsessing over a lot of things I just need you to be doing something very simple which is all you're going to do at that time is just gonna show up you're gonna sit there and do something related to coding for two hours okay you can be coding and then doing research you could be doing coding and just kind of listening to music and it doesn't need to be an aggressive session it can be pretty simple okay and here's a second step that I'm going to give you so the first step is um scheduled on your calendar and actually follow through and do it because that's the first step that's the most important the second step is optional but do it and I'll hold you accountable okay so here's what I want you to do preferably take a photo of you coding okay so like literally flip your phone take a photo where it has you in the camera okay and then it has your laptop or a computer monitor whatever you're using right in the in the frame of you showing you coding as accountability okay and tag me at cleverkozzy cleverqazi so just tag me at clever Causey on Instagram that's it and I'll repost all of your things but more importantly than anything okay I want to use this as accountability for you and it also gets me to see who this message is really helping and I want to focus less so much on the algorithm the algorithm helps because it gets the message out to most people but I also just want to focus more deeply working with you oneonone okay so just do that send me a screenshot tag me and do your two hour coding block if you're committing to that just drop in the comments below I'm committed to coding tomorrow okay so for any one of you who's going to be doing that tomorrow drop it below I'm committed to coding tomorrow and then I'll check in with you tomorrow and we'll see how you guys did all right I'm excited I love your face drop the comment below and I'll see you
