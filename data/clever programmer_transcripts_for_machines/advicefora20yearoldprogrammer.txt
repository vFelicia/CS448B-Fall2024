I'm 20 years old I don't have any money and I want to become programmer you don't need any money to become a programmer you could do it completely on your own as long as you have massive accountability you stick to a schedule on every single day regardless of how you feel you should be coding x amount of hours every day whole resources information from the best sources and then once you master all of the skills start going to companies and go hey I'll start working for you for free I'll do it as an internship and then you can put me up as a junior developer
