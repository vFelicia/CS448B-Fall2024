what's up everybody my name is nas and i'm here with jesse emmy and we are here to build a pinterest code that looks just like this look at this amazing amazing creation right this is an actual picture that you'll be making today where look at this you will you have this amazing grid of layout okay you have these amazing buttons following homepage right look at that oh let's go the homepage right the notifications the chat all this these are actual buttons and all this for example check this out you can actually search let's say research for a car let's say i type in car look at that now you have cars that pop up look at this right here right here right they pop up in like random order because that's how pinterest works it's such a such it's such a fun little project from not little an amazing project going to make look at this look at this it's so cool jesse how pumped are you for this jesse let's go i'm super po for this guys i mean pinterest is one of my favorite apps i think it's definitely the second top in my top three of apps that i use on a daily basis okay so what you can do with pinterest it is basically one big digital mood board okay you can collect all your pins of interest yes pun intended yes yes and also you can collect your ideas so not only do i use it for you know to look at cute dog pictures but also to find resources on code personal development blockchain whatever i feel like you know getting to know more about yes of course and of course i say you guys coming in welcome welcome welcome so awesome to have you here we are here to be able to build a picturesque that looks just like this this is going to be a fun one right we are going to make a bunny from scratch using react gs and using of course using right using style components as well so check this out right in here we'll be building a react gs application through here and we'll be using style components of course and other other multiple multiple uh multiple uh technologies now granted one little thing one little thing this will be split up into multiple parts okay one two three parts for the first part we're going to be building is just a basic layout just how you see here that's going to be the part for this one then we're going to add crazy more functionality and crazy more different things so you can put it on your portfolio and actually potentially get a job from it how sick is that huh that's pretty sick that's pretty sick all right guys we're gonna get started pretty much right away at this point so here's what we have okay jesse what are the things i need to do to start up with a application like this tell me well the first stop you always stop the first step you always do is you're going to use the command mpa mpx create react app yes okay so that's always the first step to start your react app up in your um on your computer okay granted that you have what installed nas npm and node right correct correct okay so you want to go ahead sorry just go ahead yeah so this is the first step you do guys right there so mp square reactor is the first thing you're going to do on your machine on your local machine right to start up a project list of course you need npm for this so make sure you have that portion installed if you don't go to npm.js i think diet.org or just on type in npm.google.com so that's going to be really really good and that's pretty much it once you've done that you will have a project looks just just like this right here just like that guys and we are currently we have we are at 300 likes let's go people thank you so much let's like this video together so it's likely to get it to more people because you know you know you do have to can be sometimes funky just let's get up to more people so that we can go ahead and show them guys we love making these videos for you so please let us know if you like them too okay so smash that like button as always as always okay and one really important bit guys we are we have a react js challenge right for you starting february 22nd february 22nd that is correct completely free free like literally free no charge at all you will be building what are they going to be buildings jesse um slack clone clone yeah but it's really jacked it's so easy like you don't want to miss out guys five day react yes challenge starting next monday okay so the whole week you're gonna be learning amazing stuff from the one and only nazdamanski and daniel i believe and daniel correct correct so go ahead and join click the link below down below in the description it's going to be a regular challenge completely free no questions asked right you'll be part of an amazing community you will building react gs uh this lack loan with react gs uh with components with style components with redux and so much more that's gonna be crazy three five days five days let's don't want to miss out anyways all right you know what let's just get started but so all right jesse let's go ahead and get started right what is the first thing what is the first thing we need to do so we have our goal is to currently get to this application like this right here okay that's our goal right so this is so maybe you can explain a little bit nas what feature we're going to be building today correct so the feature we're going to be building is what actually you tell me oh okay well as you can see on the left side um we are first going to be building a header correct okay guys it's going to be a header with styled components super exciting so stay tuned okay then the second component we're going to be building is the main board with the pins right here this may be correct yes exactly and just like the original pinterest what we're going to do is we're going to make the search bar we're going to add a functionality to it that well when you look for cars you also get the pictures of cars in the main board correct so basically you're going to get get pictures based get pictures based on based on search right here yeah and we're going to get those pictures from unsplash so who's excited that's going to be a fun one answer if you don't know it's a completely free just a way to find images and they have an api and we'll teach you exactly how to use the api because that's how we get images like if i go ahead and search for something let's say what can i search for um what can i search for bali guys where's bali oh look at that there it is it just showed up right oh whoop there it is oh man i'm longing so much for the beach right now to be honest but unfortunately we can right now so cool but you can look up everything guys so on splash is amazing let's get into it so guys that's what we're going to be building today so after you you went ahead and you did your what you did your uh what's it called um nps correct app let's go ahead and do npm install and uh not actually npm start actually to go ahead and start our application npm start let's go ahead and do that this can be a fun one i'm going to say yes because i have another application called the minus don't worry about that most likely you will not have that kind of question on the right hand side don't worry about that guys you'll be all good okay oh oh what is this adam is this is this a new ampex redirect app holy moly uh yeah well this is with a redux layer oh my oh yeah cause we're going to create redux guys oh yes yes yes yes okay but that's gonna be in the second part guys so don't worry about that yet cool so we got that portion okay now of course to get started the first thing to do is we're going to clean do a little bit of a clean up let's go ahead and remove this kind of stuff right here let's remove all this counter stuff we don't really need that correct awesome down this span right here let's go ahead and remove this also let's go ahead and remove some of the things that we have so let's go back to here this set up that test stuff don't really need this as well and i think we don't need a service worker do we not ah actually know what we can leave there for now that's fine no problem yeah everything with the word testing it that's what you're gonna be cleaning up guys plus the logo.svg we don't need that anymore um nas already removed that in the app.js okay and that's pretty much it we also wanna no we also wanna add something to app.css okay what is it so we want everything to be at the margin zero nice so to have our app really you know tight and clean and having not to deal with any default margins okay and again and the reason why we do this this right here so this star means everything by the way just so you guys know this star means everything so target everything inside inside our html right right so if we go ahead and do that we'll say margin zero and the reason why we say margin zero is actually for this simple solution it's because right i'm not margin top margin zero is because of the fact that right all these h1s h2s and you know and h3s they have margin padding come that come prebuilt with them well for us we don't need that right so we kind of just want to start from a clean slate that's how we do that okay cool all right so we got that app.js that's fine and the css is clean all right what's up next what's up next well you can go to app okay here and then maybe change the first class into app okay so let's go ahead and do that yeah it's the first and i would just to show you guys you know what happens when you edit this one you can just put there you can say header okay wait it's not closing oh it is closing yes it is and then we're gonna add a main board yes correct so you can see here the header right here it's right there the header the main board is gonna be it's going to be right there so we're going to create biscuit guys two components two components we need to create in this one okay beautiful all right keep going yeah so do you want um so i like to work first when i've installed all of the packages but or do you just want to do it on the go no just keep going no we'll do on the go on the go yes we'll do that okay so let's start making the header okay so show them what the header of the original one looks like and what by the way thank you so much for the five indian i'm not sure what's it rupees rupees donation a fossa i appreciate you so much as always says hey guys why are you using style components instead of regular css or sas only main reason is because of the fact that style components have become very popular in um and kind of the real world and the workplace i myself have used style components whenever i've been working with react gs and i've been you know so i had the job inside components and so it's really important for you guys to learn as well cool but thank you all right keep going jesse sorry so no problem so we have the header here so we're going to be first building the header okay so now that we see it on the left side let's just make the header into a component so let's go to the source folder folder folder make a new folder component folder let's go ahead go ahead and click so we'll make it right here right there and then we have we're going to make of course the header component okay that's our first component okay so if you guys have installed the extension es6 i believe written by one person called dsna snyder or something it's going to be super easy to um make a functional component you just do rfce tab and boom exactly there it is an extension extension is pretty simple right the extension is if you go kind of go to the extension section here it's this one right here es7 react right here i think it's called react uh what it's called ef7 right there right there es7 react redux react code snippet so just go ahead and install those and you pretty much will be will be all good okay all right cool awesome thank you jesse now that you see it i changed the text a little bit but now it's not changed yet no because why we still need to import it into our parent component in our app.js okay so let's import it here let's make this into a component capital letters components are always capital letters guys always always and here import but it's not in the same folder as app.js can you tell so well where is module coming from so it's going to be import a header from and i think components components that's it right header component slash header yeah component there we go that's pretty much it that's it right because we're going to go again we're going to go into components folder and i'm going to down go down to the header.js folder okay cool awesome let's keep going so now you can see it on the left it changed from header to hello pinterest headers okay so one thing cool thing we're going to be doing today guys is we're going to be using styled components as we said and what are the benefits of stealth components nas well there's many benefits well for one the benefit of style component is the fact that you can go ahead and actually basically include variables so you can include variables into style components so for example let's say i had a variable here let's say loading right you can actually for example i can actually do something like this for example let me see let's just think about this okay let's say that this right here the header is a style component let's just say that okay i can say for example loading is equal to true and then my css can actually change depending if loading is true or not right so that's a really cool part and so that's why that's why stock components are so cool because obviously in sas like in stats or css i cannot pass in variables but with style components because it works with right javascript because with javascript guys we can do that so and you'll see exactly how that works later on as we go on and what i find so cool is that we don't need the css files anymore yes of course yes we don't need any separate css files anymore so it's like you're writing css specifically for that component within your file correct okay so that's going to be so if we go ahead go to the gs let's go ahead and go into that okay so what are we going to do into that jesse well let's start with making a wrapper okay okay so let's make a wrapper and you'll see on the and the wrapper is re it's really like a wrapper right so it's really oops it should not it's really like so that's why you see twice this right here this whole thing right here okay just you guys know okay cool continue on jesse yep and why don't you show us yeah now it's not the fine because i saved it by accident but if you go to our original nas can you show us the sections of the header the sections of the header so the header sections are pretty simple okay well the sessions the header we have what we have number one logo we have the logo okay and then we have the logo we have also the home page button right here okay then we also have the following button right here okay then we also have the kind of the in this input okay this is we call it a search wrapper and then we have all these different different buttons you know like the like this icon this icon this icon this second and then and pretty much that's it right that's it it's super easy guys once you see it your mind will be blown i will tell you that so let's first start with the logo wrapper okay i'm going to start typing okay right there good awesome as you can see right here she's adding the logo wrapper in here and again right it says the represent defined because we have not created that style component just yet so you have to give it one second right so you can see we have the wrapper that's going to wrap everything that's in here right everything that's in here that's gonna be the wrapper correct just like this amazing awesome and then that's pretty much it and then now we're working on this logo wrapper you can see and now next we're going to work on this homepage button right there okay and now we're also working on this following button right here which is going to be here right here okay makes sense cool awesome but wait guys we are 372 likes let's get this 400 to 400 likes you guys rock as always thank you so so much let's go amazing okay all right continue on so the search bar wrapper that's awesome you can see just typing which is basically just creating all these different aspects of like uh these components right these style components just just for now just kind of as placeholders for now okay just fine yeah just to give you guys a good overview of what we are exactly doing here you know so go from having a top to bottom approach let's say so like just like now i said before right we're first doing if you look here at the code we have the logo then we have the home page button the following button search wrapper search bar correct and the icons were correct okay so as you can see oh awesome drawing as you can see most there are one two three four five six icons that we use from whatnots the six icons that we use actually from something called material ui guys it's materialized so material is going to contain all the icons so what you do is wait to actually install material i so let's go ahead and do that right now so we can do material ui right there and if you go to material right right here you can see that to install it's pretty simple just simply as npm install material ui core so let's go ahead and copy that okay and we'll paste that into into let's go ahead and click click create a new uh terminal we'll do command v or paste for yours for your windows npm install material core that's pretty much it so let's go ahead and wait for that for one second once the install material ui core there's one more thing to install and that is the actual material ui icons and that's as simple as just simply saying i think npm install util ui so let's go ahead and do that and just simply set up core we simply say icons icons that's pretty much it that's all you got to do guys that's all you have to do right so icons are being installed cool cool cool awesome and so now if i go ahead and go let me let's go check it out if i go material with you high icons i just ate bless you thank you material icons right there so let's say we want to what is the first icon we want for example jesse so of course the famous pinterest icon you actually have that yeah so there you look up pinterest no way hold on there it is there it is it is so amazing yeah okay never mind and as you can see on what nas is selecting right now is that is how you import this icon at the top of your code that's how easy it is guys so you already have installed the icons library yes you know and then when you put this at the top of your code you can just use the pinterest icon like this on line nine like it's just a component correct and so once we import that now we go ahead and use it just like this right here so let's go ahead and actually see how this looks like can we without creating all these other style components could we create our first style component and actually see how it looks like jesse yeah so you want me just to start um yes yes yes want me to start okay so let's first let's first style the wrapper okay so install components this is what you do guys you make a variable here wrapper and that is what's here on line six okay then you go and give it you're gonna do whoops help not not on line six but excuse me what happened no no i got it i got it i calmed it out i'll comment i'll just see i counted up oh i don't want you to be to have to have to create all these just all these style buttons and all in one go okay oh my god yes yes yes that's good thinking okay so style div back ticks okay guys back decks and we're gonna give it a display flex so everything is nicely horizontally aligned yes whoop wait let me type correctly and again the style there means you're creating a div guys that's how you that's how you create divs in style components okay we give a display flex that way so we can go ahead and align these up very nicely together okay and we give the item center to make sure that everything is in the center right here okay beautiful and we give it a 56 pixels so this whole wrapper the height is going to be 56 pixels so this whole wrap right here boom right there okay we're also going to give it a small padding right here 12 pixels four pixels and again as you guys know this means top right bottom left right trouble so keep this in mind whenever you're doing this kind of stuff it's really cool right you know this kind of stuff just keep in mind the key word trouble right there trouble troubler trouble joe see trouble see top right bottom left it's a really really cool way to keep track of this kind of stuff okay really cool way i awesome girl awesome so we have a background color white and the color black so what that's with that being here let's go ahead and now create the logo wrapper to make sure that we can actually see it so because right now currently right now if we go ahead and save this we have the local wrapper is not defined icon button defined and style is not defined as well now yeah let me import these at the top go ahead icon button nice so do you remember what the icon button is actually don't know is it because the button to be able to click on is that what it is like this no yeah it's that bubble effect exactly yeah it's that bubble effect when you hover over it that's what it is so yeah wait we've just reached 420 412 likes let's go guys thank you so much appreciate you as as as always guys go ahead go ahead and smash the like button for us help us out to get this out to more people so the deal can be coming together let's make this the best [ __ ] coding academy coding universe out there we want to be up there so when you think of coding we are there to provide you that knowledge all right that's what we're here to do all right let's keep going let's go okay so logo wrapper okay yes logo wrapper and the logo wrapper well it says what it is right it is wrapping the logo correct local wrapper but in this case we're using that actually to style pinterest icon okay go ahead because it has a really specific color right yes like this fiery red so guys when you want to style something of material ui you have to go into the documentation right and pinterest icon is actually a socalled svg icon so in order to target this svg icon you need to reference to a certain class you know which is called like this mui svg icon dash root okay and we'll show you why i'll show you why why that's the case in a second as we go into the inspect element so let's go keep going so i'm just gonna pop this one in here so color is this fiery red it has a font size of 32 pixels so it's a little bit bigger than what's showing up right now and when you hover over it it gets you that little hand okay the cursor pointer that's the hand let's keep going jesse so that's the logo wrapper um and i think that's pretty much when we saved this we're able to see how it looks like i think let's see let's see we have style okay so one thing is style is not defined so why is that because we still need to import styles styled from it's called style wait is it style dash components yep styled way styled dash component right exactly yes just making sure i'm right just okay module cannot result can i result it's not called what is it called i forgot but did you already install it oh it didn't install style components hold on no no no npmi so look at this guys so styling components let's go and install that first style component right there yeah style components good it's not components go ahead do uh not here let's go ahead and do that inside the npm right there see yeah npm install right there stay styled components so let's go ahead and do the right here the bottom cool and install save style component that's gonna be what we want to do it's installed okay now it's so good let's go ahead and save this up save this let's see boom right there hey let's go that's what i'm talking about nice beautiful okay amazing amazing awesome guys wait guys one more thing i want to say to you guys if you are interested in learning reg gs and becoming a javascript developer yeah developer we have launched the best of you as you know we have the mo the best course out there on the planet period it is one of the best courses out there on the planet called profit with javascript link is in below go ahead and check it out you get to build crazy crazy applications like slack like facebook get to create applications like a gmail clone twitter clone and so much more you get to be part of amazing community and you get to have coaching calls with me with jesse and so many other teachers on a weekly basis for a lifetime for a lifetime so if you're interested link below okay let's keep going jesse whoo okay so what should we do next well make the home page buttons okay buttons i think yeah let's do it let's do it so like button yeah so actually the buttons are links references to other pages right but we'll make those pages later but it's just an adren href okay so we're gonna do this and we're gonna oop everything is red close this one off here nice and then we're going to do the same thing with the following okay following button yeah you see these are just just buttons and there's all they're simply doing is they're simply redirecting you right now currently to the homepage for now for now just the whole page so if i go ahead and save this let me go ahead and save this save this let's go ahead and take okay oh homepage button undefined boom let's go gotta keep up gotta keep up okay so let's start defining those things guys so here home pitch button and i feel like i did this a little bit in a redundant way but maybe you can improve it later so let's see let's first start out with this you know when it comes to coding you always just want to start out with something that works and from there on you can always refactor later okay guys so don't worry too much about it so a height display flex of course height of 48 pixel min width of 103 pixel line items center that's the center right there just flat content horizontally as well and the water release is going to give us that really nice effect right here this really nice kind of concave shape right here that's going to be what the border radius is for guys okay that's going to be the really cool part okay awesome we have the cursor pointing amazing sweet sweet sweet okay and then it's going to have a background color like the home page button is going to have like it's black but it's not totally black you know what i mean what is it no it's not black rgb okay okay let's see jesse let's see what you got jesse let's see what you got okay okay so that's just the button okay but within styled components there's something we can do we can target just like within css we can target certain elements within no i would just do it like this but no way oh yeah sure squeezy okay all right so upon the link you know upon a link you know an href always has that ugly word that's true very ugly decoration so i don't want to i don't want to ever ever want to see that you know so and let's give it a font weight of 700 okay 700 700 700 yo 700 yo so let's check out the under the following yeah that's fine i will go and count this part out don't worry about it but the phone okay wait jesse don't delete this wait just i didn't i didn't delete it okay let's go ahead and do that oh it's gonna save this oh oh [ __ ] look at that that's fine the whole page button we have what it says follow following button following button is not defined even though we have the following button here let's try our time no look at this guys one cool thing that you guys need to understand here is that you see how you see how these display flex these are starting to align very nice horizontally you see this right here look at that because why because of display flex right without display flex if i right click on this look at this and if i went ahead and if i remove this playface on this specific portion look at this if i did display fact now remove this oh my god boom boom right there see it becomes weird from top to bottom it's [ __ ] up it's just it just becomes [ __ ] up okay um hopefully youtube does not ban us for that messy it's it is this that will make it look very messy look we had the home page button now let's we'll go ahead and work on the following button right here oh i just let's go ahead and see how that works out yeah so the following button is actually has the same shape um but it has a different background color and on the hover it also works differently so constant following button tactics i always find it so funny this one has backticks i know it's weird right i know it's a yeah it's so weird so weird but also so fun at the same time so guys top thing is the same as the homepage button so i'm just gonna pop that into here but background color is different of course so we're gonna make this one white okay beautiful beautiful beautiful now here's here's a really cool part so let's go ahead and save this jesse awesome let's go ahead and save that yeah okay so save that save this let's see if this works out let's see let's see let's see oh this tax declaration is just no bueno no one so what do you do well i'm saying the tax declaration i'm saying you see how you see we haven't targeted that href yeah this is what we're talking about guys in order to remove that hideous hideous text decoration we need to go ahead and target it in here so let's go ahead and do that and this is where it's actually style components are very very very similar to something like sas right because you can have you can nest css classes inside css classes that's the big part about style components that you know we can do so you can see it check this out as jess is saying she went ahead and she nested the a tag meaning the a tag within the following button is going to be the one that's targeted let me give this test equation a color block and a font weight of 700. it's as simple as that that's the really cool part about this okay yeah and you want me to show the hover one second so let's go ahead and save this okay oh so that's there okay let's go ahead and see the power state because when i hover over this you see this right here and i hover this i should be able to hover over this and have this type of functionality right here so let's go ahead and see this yeah so but usually guys when you want to hover on something in css you target first the element right and then using colon hover but in this case in the style component you just do this hover yeah okay good good good good good good good good then we have a special color like a light grayish i'm going to save it now let's go so save that let's see oh let's go jesse okay so one really cool thing when i add to this is actually really awesome so look at this you see the really cool part about style components guys is that again we're nesting here however we're nesting the etec and so forth but another thing you can ask is actually the buttons themselves you can see how this one has the 48 pixels and so does this one this one has 123 faces and so does this one and this one is this one and so this is this one as well as this one so they are both very similar there's some the only thing the only thing they have difference is this background color so what can we do to remove this repeatedness we'll check this out here's what we can do i can actually create a style component like this i can say const right there look at this home button for example buttons equals style.div okay so watch watch it with me okay style it didn't do with me of course okay and i'm going to create a style that div like so okay and this is going to have everything that's in common so i will i will say for example although this right it's the same correct all this is the same so display flex 48 pixel 123 pixels center center center yeah so yeah i will go ahead and copy this and i'll give it to here look at this boom right there all right yeah enter this out i will save that okay now of course nothing's going to change and why but pretty simple right but now i can go ahead and do this i can remove this look at this actually let's go ahead can we should we put cursor point down here too yeah we should yeah cursor pointer awesome so it's going to remove this crystal pointer okay and it's going to remove this portion right here as well and look at this right now it's about to go really bad so right now yeah i know it's hold on hold on hold on hold on i got you oh lord so here's what you want to do i'm going to do instead of staying saying style.dip i will say style and i will pass in the home buttons like this look at this so i'm going to save that now oh look at that so what just happened is inherited this home button style and applied it to here and then here is where the changes come in right this makes its own changes for this specific homepage button but inherits this right here homepage button that is the sick part okay same thing goes for this look at this i can say styled home page home page buttons boom right there save that okay uh wait button or home buttons how about this my bad guys hold your horses it's all good not in the world don't worry okay so look home buttons i saved that and look at this now we have everything we wanted boom boom right there look i can hover this it's the same buttons and there we go oh that's so clean so clean right i'm wondering though so you don't need to in that case the home buttons you don't need to um show that at the top this right here yeah what do you mean you have to show this at the top you still have to show that to the top yes correct you still have to be this has to be there yes at the top um where oh header oh you mean this code no no no it does not no no it does not so see guys how clean that is you don't need to do that so you can just in your css you can just remove redundant code like this yeah it's just basically removing redundant css right you can't you can't can't do that in css unfortunately but in some components yes you can and that's why we're teaching you so if you're saying why stock opponents now you know now you know now you know all right awesome all right keep going whoa nice so the next thing what should we do icons or search bar okay let's go ahead and do the search bar yeah search bar okay search bar so can you show the shares bar in the original one there's a search bar right here it looks kind of like this right here it looks pretty epic right there there's a search bar right there yeah it's really click it has this icon in it of course and when you stretch out when you stretch your screen out the search bar will come with it yes correct correct correct oh really oh really okay hold on everybody hold your horses oh let's go that's a nice job yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nice job okay good so search wrapper search rapper the search up that she's going to be making is biscuit at this point is this one so i contract her i will go ahead and actually count it out for her so that she doesn't have to worry about that okay right thank you and the social press this one right here this is what she's making right there okay let's keep going so again guys we want to have that nice material ui icon within the icon button by the way um so i want to create an icon button right here we're going to create a search search a search icon so the search tag is going to be this one right here that's gonna be the search icon okay yeah okay so you do have to be careful that you really need to distinguish between the components or the icons that you're getting from material i or you're making them for style components okay always always always always always just a wrapper that gives you like this whole thing of like when i click on it see how it has that really nice effect that's like a button guys okay yes yes so this we're going to be making the form okay and within the form we're going to be making an output okay so the output for now it's just gonna be text nice nice nice text okay text and let's keep it for this like this right now okay so that's just the text right now okay cool makes sense makes sense and then we're also going to be using a button but as you can see in the original there is no button what no buttons well the thing is though do you have you ever been on a website where you put in something and i think a lot of people don't even think about this anymore right but they fill in something and then they just press enter and it just works their input is being submitted even though there's no button yeah right so we're gonna be imitating that functionality exactly okay guys so we're gonna show you how it's done okay so what was i doing searching search wrapper okay so we're gonna make the search wrapper search wrapper um and the search wrapper we're going to give it not so much we're just going to give it um a flex one oh style.div okay okay flex so what does that mean what does flip flex will mean jesse well it will take up all the space it gets beautiful take up all the space okay because because again we wanted this whole thing we want this whole thing of course right to stretch right so if we give the effects of one that means the the weight of this specific deal is one the highest of everything so it's going to stretch as much as it possibly can you know amongst everything else that's what that's one thing to consider definitely definitely so we're gonna be making the search bar wrapper okay so as you can see guys this search bar wrapper is actually that gray area which is curved so it's all this area right here all this crate area yeah oh okay yeah yeah we're gonna make that ourselves so how keep going so it's gonna be a background color of efcf ef beautiful that's gonna be different color let's play display flex and let's make sure it's gonna go ahead and align these like items like this that's the whole goal of this okay yep and in order for it to stretch out and i think i learned this from you we're going to give it a height of 100 percent nice nice nice nice border radius is going to be heavy it's going to be 50 pixels so it looks really curved carbon curve to give it this curvature right here right there yeah and we're going to give it a border of none because we don't want we want it to look really slick and clean right beautiful yes so and then we're going to give it a padding on the left because that icon we don't want it to be touching on the left side okay so that's it but we still need to target certain elements because if you look at the top here guys we have so we gave the search wrapper we gave it to flex one right search bar wrapper we gave it the background and everything and within that we have the search icon but we also have a form here and a form within the input and the button so let's target those things right now okay so here form and i'm gonna give the form also a display flex so it stays within that search bar wrapper okay beautiful flex one and see what this is changing it's changing you see how she's changing the form it's starting to take shape right here guys you see that right there beautiful so within the form we want to target the input okay so i think maybe we don't even need to do it like this but it's just to be really specific that the input is within the form okay i like that way yeah yeah so we're going to make that transparent because we don't want that to actually show you see the important thing from like white right you want to like basically transparent as you can see here right there as you look into it okay and we're going to give it a font size of 16 pixels as well because well we still want to be able to read stuff as i type right here you see now it's 16 pixels and it has a margin level 5 pixels and so forth beautiful beautiful and now you still see that if you maybe go to the right now you will still see that button we don't want that button to show up but we do want to use the functionality of that button so what do you think about that i feel like i saw michael right now i love it excuse me i feel like i'm so awkward right now i love it so what do you feel about how do you feel about the blue border yeah i hate it i [ __ ] hit it so here so right border to me this border i know who who made this who created this i don't know why they made this what were you thinking when you made this okay i'm not saying to you jesse i'm saying to the person who made it right right right right when i go ahead and inspect them on this for example you guys can see that we have a form right here this input right here and if i focus on this form if i do four stay focus uh if i do four state maybe in that case let's see visit it or focus within focus or stop active no i don't know why the force doesn't work in here but you can see we have an outline offset right here right right here let me do it one more time right there you see this outline offset right there this means right there see i don't disappear real quickly but that means there's an outline so if i go ahead and do input focus online none maybe we do not need actually active or jesse this stuff now we don't need that i really don't want it to show up can you tell really hate it and you can see now if i go ahead and just type right here see no more does not show up anymore guys that's really cool part about this okay let's go ahead and keep going jesse yeah so actually we only have the icons wrapper which is and within that we have a few icons from material ui and again we need to do we need to do icon button let's do that one first the icon button this one this one this one this this one right here this one what what do we need to do i need to add it don't we oh sorry yeah you're you're right we need to add it we need to import it exactly search icon then make note of 500 likes let's go let's get to 600 likes guys help us out that is what i'm talking about you guys are amazing oh oh oh oh oh 600 likes you guys are the best and just as you guys know right we have a reaction challenge coming up five day break just challenge completely free link is in the value you will be building the most epic slack clone with live functionality with style components with redux with so many different things you cannot explain how with login and so much more guys go ahead join the by director charles it is completely free it is great for beginners so if you have zero id on what javascript is or zero data i would react gss it is okay this is what we built it for so go ahead click the link below and check it out all right keep going jesse hope to see you there guys be there be there or be square so icons rapper okay let's go by the way search icon has been imported so it should not be complaining anymore if correct oh let's go so beautiful guys how cool is that drop it in the comments if that looks amazing at this point we're just getting started here guys started let's get the party started let's get this party started okay so the last thing i have is this icons wrapper that's the last time you have for this header okay once we've done that then we went to the pins okay let's go ahead and save that beautiful definitely definitely so for this let me start this time with the imports because then it's also easier to see what you need from the material ui there's four icons right it is a notification icon a face icon the little face text sms icon and the keyboard arrow down icon okay so all of these again need to be wrapped in what they all need to be wrapped in icons wrapper and an icon i get this right a button yes hover hover over so here boom let's go that's a lot of text that's good it's a lot of text but it's not difficult to read okay so each icon is wrapped in side of the um icon button okay i like how so that's why and then i'm typing at the same time that just like dude teamwork teamwork makes the dream work guys always he always makes the change is what makes everything work okay right you got no team then i don't know let's see you can get far solo but together you get further a lot further right cool awesome so let's see what do i call so look at that look at what jess is doing here okay we have an icon button right here notifications icon right there right so that's that's the whole call now of course she's wrapping inside the icon button to give it that little kind of ripple effect so when i go ahead and click on this it gives it the ripple effect you can see right here right there right there good creates a ripple effect and again just copy and paste this text sms icon face icon keyboard arrow icon and all those are actually imported inside here right there she just went ahead and imported from material ui okay and again the way you search for this is pretty simple guys all you have to do is go to material ui okay search for example whatever you want let's go and say let's say you want to do search right click on search and then you see the search icon click on the search icon boom and this right away tells you what you need to import like like it doesn't get [ __ ] easier it just doesn't easier but what you need to pay attention to guys is as you can see it says from material ui slash icons so sometimes it's icons and sometimes it's core so pay attention to that okay yes yes yes otherwise let's go ahead and save this let's see how this works out is this gonna work no we have to create the icons wrapper style div first style component first key const icons wrapper and we don't need to do anything with this no nothing oh no no no no not a kaput okay oh wait [ __ ] hold on hold on search rapper wait icon's wrapper is not defined this type of this happens i just need to refresh this paste sometimes refresh yeah beautiful so we went ahead and we finished this portion right here guys we have ourselves the header the home page the following button we have ourselves the search wrapper and all these other icons which just look amazing which i just love personally right the no the next thing we're going to work on so let's go ahead and work on part two part two is gonna be what is part two of this create one we're gonna be making the main board guys we're gonna be making the main board right here okay create more and this is going to be you're going to contain to contain contain the chat the pins that's it and we're going to use the later on we're going to use unsplash this as well so create the main board to contain the pins all right all right let's start it up part two let's go let's go let's go so just as the header guys i'm gonna make another file here within okay and again i'm gonna use rfce tab and i'm gonna make a mainboard component here okay so of course just like previously i need to import it here and i'm going to say main board wait wait you are in the attitude yes oh right there i see you so yeah and i'm gonna import it here okay import right there so we have the import main board from components slash main board just like the header guys i hope that did not go too fast but just like the header you're just gonna make a main board file here within your components and just make a functional component here right easy easy right here guys man with the gs once you create the main rds let's go ahead and do rfce to go ahead and create a react app like this and then once you have that you're pretty much set for life that's it see right there boom voila yeah and if you type anything in hasad here this is called the main board right let's save this we have mainboard right so right there that's pretty much what you have okay and then next up let's go ahead and go on to the next one yeah let's go on to the next one so let's style this main board first let's see it okay oh no wait wait wait wait let's make what we're going to do this in style components right yeah of course so what do you want to call the first rapper here just rapper yes that's called rapper of course always rap always always style component always wrappers no i just just i just like it i just like it makes me a bit hungry sort of wrapper sandwich sandwich burritos and then what should we call this mainboard or just container since this name is also really generic let's go let's call the container correct go ahead container okay container okay container and now what we need to do is we now we need to create different style components for those okay and again these contains we right whoops right there so what do we what is this right here the wrapper is going to be the wrapper for the main so here's the thing just just so you see exactly what we're trying to do here okay look the wrapper is this wrapper right here right this is the full width 100 the container is the container that contains the icons themselves right so that's where where that comes from right that's the really cool part about that so that's where again the reason why we're doing that is because we need to be able to center this horizontally like this because we want spacing in here right that's how we create another container within this wrapper okay makes sense comprende i hope it's comprende all right comprenda all right guys let's keep going this is awesome oh i'm having fun i just want a shoe i'm having fun yeah me too lots of fun all right let's go ahead and do it so i just want to show the container within the wrapper nice so it's going to do so let's see this background color pink okay wrapper that style the devil's going to save this oh we also need to import style components here as always always whoop like this i believe beautiful yeah stack components okay let's go ahead and save that okay now of course right now nothing's really happening the reason why is that the reason why is because this wrapper this wrapper right here does not have a height so we need to give it an actual height right so for this wrapper to give it a height so if i go ahead for example if i inspect them on this one right let's go ahead and inspect that one on this uh dvd root the class app right there this is right here this is our header this is our main board right you can see our main board oh [ __ ] something's really loud hello hello yeah yeah we got you we got you if you see if you say this member let's give it a height for example a height of let's say 300 pixels okay right there okay now this is 300 pixels for this one let's give it a height of also 300 pixels right there you see so that right there is going to be what this is the wrapper is the pink and the container is is green now right now we don't see any pink and why is that pretty simple because we need to go ahead and give the container a width let's say of 80 percent so for example how jesse is doing right here i'll go ahead and save this you see right there boom voila now we have the wrapper which is pink right here that's this right the background color green that's the container is going to contain the pins guys right it would give it a width of 80 percent okay that's why we have those make sense compressing all right let's move on yeah so just to add some stuff i just wanted to make this really visual for you guys you know because that's very important when you start working with this and styled component of course so but just let's make this um white because yeah that's a regular color okay white and um you want to keep the height i want to give it the width of 100 for the wrapper good nice and a height of 100 100 but i also don't want the pins to be attached to the header you know so what i'm going to give it is a margin top of 50 pixels because when the plants come in right they're going to come in half they're going to come in like this like the green area we just had yeah so we don't want the paints to be here right all the way here we want it to be margin task we want to push it down just a little bit as well go ahead exactly all right that's next up so for now this is good for css from the main board but what we want to show up in the main board for now is actually one pin okay guys before we're just gonna make it really simple because when it comes to coating okay you always need to break up your big problem into small chunks so we're gonna not gonna be making all of the pins now we're just gonna make one pin now okay and this pin is well a regular pin just like main board so let's make pin here okay pin then we have of course before actually we have to make a full file here yeah so let's go ahead and make a pin inside the components folder right here this components folder right you can see jessa just went ahead and she made a pin.js file and if i go and click on this she's going to do irfce right and that's going to create our our component in here so rfc go ahead jesse does it work no it is got it there we go beautiful whoa there it is by the way guys thank you so much 551 likes let's get to 600 likes you guys are amazing as always let's get this to us to 600 guys 600 come on could we get to 600 click that like button right now let's go right smash the like button subscribe for more videos like this guys this tells us that you appreciate what we're doing because of course we're putting a lot of time a lot of hard work into this i really appreciate you guys if you guys show it okay that's all we ask that's pretty much it yeah that's all we ask for something hard just click that drag button and click like so yes 5 67 likes let's go let's go how far can we go how far can we go 58 likes oh let's go let's go beautiful appreciate it guys let's keep going jesse so one pin we're gonna be making one pin but for now i'm just gonna say hello pin okay to make sure that our pin component is really um being imported into the main board so let's say here import pin well we don't need to do anything now because pin is in the same folder as main board so i don't need to say component slash so if i go to main board right because the pin is in the same folder right it's inside here i can just say pin from pin makes sense okay gotcha gotcha gotcha okay yeah oh oh hello pin let's go come in okay cool cool cool all right let's see them pins i want to see them yeah you want to see them pins well i think also you should pick a picture later from one splash let's go one inch i feel like i'm a kid right now so on splash on splash yeah yeah i'm sorry oh okay what what picture you guys want what do you guys want like tell me i always pick dogs but you know or bali or ocean or surfing you like bali don't you yeah i do i mean you know i like architecture a lot like a beautiful occasion like this like can we pick this one yeah could you pick this one definitely oh you can also pick something like berlin they have great architecture this is cool look at this guys this is amazing i love this okay i got it let's go ahead and play this pick this architecture right here i love this one okay copy image address copy image address okay okay let's then what do we do after that then we go ahead and and we're going to okay so i'll copy the image address for now okay and now we need to add it to a pin so let's go to pin.js and let's create that pin jesse that's created so first again style components right so can i try that i'll try it can i try it can i try it can i try of course you can try of course of course so we're going to create a wrapper that's really i don't want such a kid right now rapper can you get what excited i'm such a kid right now i know why i'm with the critic container for that so container okay and the reason why we're going to create the container right is because again what right we're going to create a pin and that's going to a pin is going to contain that image okay that's why we're going to create a container right so let's go ahead and do that then inside the style components go ahead and import style components so we'll say import import right styled from what styled from dash components style dash components exactly components okay so let's go ahead and save that amazing two two two two two let's go so one pin guys is one image yes okay let me say for example const wrapper is equal to style dot div right there style the div right and so forth now nothing so far let's go ahead and do it now container same thing const container is equal to styled dot div boom right there okay awesome so let's go ahead and save those save that okay you can see nothing is breaking that's the most important that's the most important thing let's not create an image so we'll say image image source is equal to and let's now give it that specific uh what's it called the url the image address boom right there that's going to be the image address right here okay boom right there then inside here let's go ahead and now do close this image out save this oh let's go oh oh oh okay awesome all right jesse let's go ahead and keep going this is amazing so we got ourselves an image that's awesome next up we're going to do guys is we need to go ahead and what we need to once we have the image now we need to modify these images to actually look nice so how do we do that jesse so when we first gotta you know we're gonna i would say first maybe adjust the style the wrapper wrapper the wrapper okay so this wrapper you don't see it right now but it has to be this or should we let's do this later it's fine it's fine yeah we can do implied flex that's fine that's fine yeah and we're gonna give it a padding okay the container is gonna have display flex one container good i don't think it needs i thought it first needed a flex direction column but i don't think it needs that so but to have everything really vertically aligned we can give it a line item center beautiful i'm going to give it this one and i'm going to give it like the little hand my the rocket program always starts up when i do column pointer and we're going to give it a width of 236 pixel guys and the thing is oh 36 and this way all of the images all of our pins will have this width so see if i go ahead and do this let's go ahead and save this if i go ahead and do this now look at this we see nothing has really changed on here on this side right it's still not 236 pixels so if i go and right click this inspect element why is that because why this is 200 but the image is not so going to do is need to give an image a width of a hundred percent of 100 is it 100 is a height of 100 no width 100 right now and now you can see now boom right there width of 100 you can see right there right and now that image fits directly in that width box okay beautiful now we can also give it also a border radius what we should give it give it give it uh border radius uh 16 pixels or the radius right there 16 pixels boom right there look at that oh that looks so good it looks so good jesse it's so good yeah i know right yeah so good i love it i got you do do okay anyways ah awesome water is good so what jesse is now doing is we have for example a width of 100 okay just how we said it okay for the specific image we have a cursor what does this course zoom in i'm curious what is that what does that do that is i think for the picture for the image like when you hover over it it will just make it look better basically really oh oh that's the zoom in but you see why if i click this yeah this has a zoom button right there okay i got you okay cool cool cool border radius and of course object fit cover so you're how to say this your picture is then being skilled the right way yes when it comes into the container okay awesome and that looks awesome so that looks amazing jesse okay and that our friend my friends is our first pin now look we've got our first pin now the question is how do we get more pins at this are we done with this he says in here jesse yeah i think so well i i also had something on opacity but i don't think it's necessary for now so let's just keep moving awesome so let's go ahead this we got ourselves guys we got ourselves the pin how sick is that drop that in the comments below that is pretty pretty something says you are the best guys who let's go thank you we are currently in 587 likes let's get to 600 can we do it let's go 600 likes help us out let's defeat that youtube algorithm together let's knock it out of the podcast yo youtube i know you guys can do it 588 how far can we go 58 593 let's go finally three come on come on come on you guys got this i know it i know it just hit that like button and that's all you gotta do guys 5.99 okay hold on hold on 604 appreciate you guys so much we love making these bills for you so if you like it all right cool keep pressing that like button okay that's fine that's fun i always love so much there's so much energy on here all right so we got we got a pin jesse okay that's the first part on pain next up we need to go ahead and let's how do we create now more pins this is where the fun part comes in whoa well i think we should be talking about data right now okay so let's think about this well check this out on splash actually has an api so on splash api on splash api right here unsplash api right i splash sorry to interrupt you but i think i want to take it even one step back okay okay easy okay okay when it comes to you know when what the user does okay let's okay good i like it i like it so what's gonna happen just explain it to us so like you know right now our app is the parent component yes and then we have header and we have main board as child component right correct this main board right here correct yes yeah and then within main board we even have another component called pin which is again a child component right correct yes so in which component are we starting right the header component because when we want to search for something we're going to put in something like tokyo or dogs or in your case cars right yeah and once we submit the cars what's what do we want to happen well once we submit once we submit the cars then we want to go ahead and look for example okay let's think about this if we for example let's think about this i'm going to put this down here so um search right search when we after we did search we want to go ahead we want to go ahead and get data from unsplash right get data yep from unsplash unsplash using search search right and then what is the next thing we need to do guys then once we get that we need to go ahead and add that add the data add the images that we get from unsplash back back to pins slash slash main board yes right there slash the main board and that's how that's going to work yeah guys got that that is the loop so it's a pretty easy like i said it's a pretty pretty easy simple oh go ahead let's do this pretty simple process guys okay go from search get that from on spot using using search and then add the images back to pins slash main board so right now we have the search now we need to go ahead and get data from unsplash using search is that right jesse that's right so let's go to unsplash like you previously wanted okay and show them what you need to do let's do it jesse let's go let's go beautiful beautiful so let's go ahead and check this out so if we go to unsplash okay we have an splash api right there right is it this one or is it is it this one or which one is it no no i think the first one was correct this one okay so it says on splash images now you would have to register as a developer right here right there register available it's free for anybody to join completely free no no questions asked you can join the no problem okay once you join you should be able to actually get your api key do we have an api key just that we can use yeah we have an api key it's in the oh it's in the other one right yeah it's in the api folder we have our own api key and if we go to documentation let's look at the invitation right now right you go to search you go to where's the search on your left side on your left side so so guys you go to the end splash you regulate yourself as developer and you go to the api documentation okay and then on your left side when you scroll down you have is search photos right there then if you scroll a little bit more down you can see the query or the end points exactly gonna be using so we are later gonna be defining our base url and then of course we're going to add the term on which we want to have photos for yes right so you can see here for example what they're doing in here let me let me take a look at this pretty simple right what they're doing in the search they are they are doing what hold on search photos right here they are simply go ahead and provide you a query you see this right here a query uh wait query right here it could be anything pretty much it can be a search box could be a car whatever it is whatever anything that you want that's the search term that you want to use okay that's going to the query then other than that pretty much we're going to then use the per page we're going to have 10 per page is that right yeah pen per page and that's pretty much it i think right that's pretty much it that's pretty much it but maybe we're going to be using something to make the request to yes unsplash so that's the question is how do we now make the request to actually get the data that's the thing well the really cool thing about react.js is we have something called axios right axis is a way for us to get data so if i go and take a look at this let's go say axios um right there see axios uh gs right there right there react react axios right there that's the one oh no not this one hold on uh is it this one mgm i xios just the regular yeah that one no not that one no no no no no no this one no no which one is it actually mpmi axios i know i'm trying to find where it is wait no maybe here oh npm install npnc npm install install axios there we go that's the one yeah okay yeah yeah look at that because i'm looking for this weekly downloads look at this 17 million weekly downloads guys that is pretty damn insane i will say yeah that's always something you want to check out for guys when installing new npm packages let's go ahead and do this let's go and open up our integrated terminal our beautiful integrated terminal in here right here let's go ahead and do command v for amp install axios hit enter that's pretty much it at this point okay good good good good good good good good that's amazing so we got that portion okay next up we're going to do next that we're going to do is the following is so we got axios which is which is all good now we need to go ahead and what and we need to import access is that right jesse definitely so i'm going to create a new folder inside where okay let's okay check it let's do it i'm watching you jesse let's go api okay here and then we're gonna make a file and we're gonna call it what is it unsplash small letters guys it's not a component js okay okay so let's open that one up where is it oh i'm here in it now you got it and so i don't know once we have it i don't know jesse i don't see the new file it is here though api axios it should be an api okay let me move that to the api i got it oh it's here okay there we go awesome okay now we got now we have it right here awesome thank you so once you have installed axios you're going to do that this guy's import axios from axios okay ooh nice okay right there and what we can do is really cool we can create sort of our own axio server through which we can send the requests to and then we can export this one throughout our whole app okay so we need to do this export actually yeah well yeah it's okay i already started repeating that but axios and then create so this is a function of axios itself and then your can give it all kinds of parameters okay so in this case we're going to give it first our base url of unsplash so this is the parts url you absolutely sure you're always using in every request that you make got it got it got it okay cool cool okay and with it um you're gonna give me the param headers nice and that one's going to have a key of authorization okay guys so authorization you can see me writing it with a capital letter very important um you will not get any requests okay so i speak out of experience i'm going to share this one with you guys in a silver platter okay so very important guys when you do stuff like this be accurate and consistent okay authorization capital a okay now you're never going to forget that and here we're gonna say client id again watch the capital letters okay then we're gonna have the access key here that you're gonna obtain from unsplash so when once you have registered as a developer you scroll down and then there's an access key okay at the top you can hardly miss it um exactly there right you can see and you can see the way she got this because inside documentation if you look at public authentication and in the documentation guys it's talking about right to authenticate requests in this way pass your application's access key which you get basically by logging in to sign up for unsplash api right then what happens you're going to get your access key and then at that point you will go ahead and you can add the access key to your as your client id inside here that's pretty much it that's it that's it yeah that's it easy peasy so i have my key already ready okay yes yes yes please don't copy it guys and they're correct so i mean it's quick they do it's fine it doesn't matter it's not like it doesn't matter we don't get charged for this anyway so it doesn't matter no it is free anyway so but um this is this is how i created the um axio server basically okay so i can use this one everywhere in my app because i'm exporting it here plus i just need to import it in my other component wait so how do you know what and how do we name it is that what to name this as well like name this axio server or no well we created a file called unsplash so within our like for example i know for sure that we're going to be using it in the app.js so let me show you here so let's go like this import unsplash yeah yeah be amazed and then we're gonna do this oh interesting yeah okay look at that guys that is pretty sick i will say that is pretty damn sick so we created our own server i mean it's not it's not our own service just a way for us to be able to define a api call basically using a using axial so it's very simple for us then to use it and we don't have to define it out you know in a different place pretty cool damn gesture that is awesome all right this cells keep going yeah yeah yeah we haven't defined it in a different place what do you mean so it says you attempted to import api and splash which falls outside of the project source directory so it's decided so the reason why let me see let me look at this because where where um let me see oh i know why i know why i know why i know why because you should not okay there we go now it's so good so you don't have to dot dot there we go okay no dot dot yes so we got that now what did you just say um well we first talked about let's first go back to the header okay okay you know because the header is actually the place where we start i always like when i make an app or develop the app i always like to think in the story right the user story right and then once we put in something in the input we want to catch that so what could we use for that how do we catch something in an input well you use something called unsubmit or unclick or unsubmit i think unsubmit for the input is unchanged but the button is definitely going to be the one that's going to be submitting something okay so okay so we're going to keep track let's go check out the input okay make sense okay go ahead so let's do this first so an unchanged event is actually unchanged actually an event so technically your input is an html element that is waiting for this unchanged event to happen correct unchanged just means like um help there's something happening in my input correct and then he catches that you know so for now i'm going to console log this so you can test it out and the event is actually i think an object so therefore within that object we have target and value as keys so we can grab that value from that input so maybe you can show this so if i go and save this guys let's say let's go back to and save the app.gs save the header here's going to happen if i go ahead and right click on this inspect element on here if i go to console okay so let's go ahead and clear this console out for a second if i start typing you see right there boom that's the target of value that that jess is printing out right here and the reason why we're doing this is pretty simple is because we want to keep when we want to save this right we want to be able to save this value right in something called a state right in state so we can go ahead and actually use it and then apply it when you submit it right so for example jesse right now she's going to create a input state right the input and set input using something called the use state which is if you use state is basically think of it as like think of it as like a database for for your own component right every single component in react.js has its own little database called state right called state and so whenever you make change that state right at that database it refreshes right it keeps track of that and so that is what jesse is doing you can see here she created a use state of where the default this is basically not an empty string okay yeah this is the input this is the actual value the set input is the change function the on change function right so if you want to change this specific value you just simply call this function and that's pretty much it so that means if i go ahead and say the unchanging here right all i have to do is instead instead of doing either target instead of doing that we simply do is set input e dot target that value so we're going to get the value from our input and we're going to change it inside inside out oh what happened oh there we go inside our what inside our specific input that's it and now every single time when you change this is going to change as well it's very very very very simple simple as that yeah and i can show you the next feature we're going to uh adding as well because now you see that everything changes when nas was typing something in in the input but we don't want all of those letters right we don't want that pyramid of letters we just want the last well the last word basically yes so what we do which moment is that when where oh clicking the button when you click pressing the enter correct you click the button or when you press the enter of course yeah press the enter same it's the same so upon a function okay once we click on the we press enter not the button because we made that one disappear yes to be clear again the reason why the reason why this let me just happen is they unclick the submit because the button submit by default has functionality for you to be able to hit enter and it will call the button it will call the submit button that's actually what's going to happen basically right by default so then we're going to create a function called right there answer submit as justice creating right here okay right there beautiful beautiful and we're doing this april before because there's some other like whenever whenever you click a button right like when you hit enter it by default it wants you to it's gonna it wants you to take to it you want to take it to another page but we want to prevent that by saying either parent default to do that okay make sense good good good good good awesome then what's going to happen is let's consolidate the input and that's we'll see is when you hit enter you will get the input right here let's go ahead and save this beautiful okay that's used as undefined now again yes you send the file because we're team pointed so let's go ahead and import it here i'm gonna say comma hold on sorry right there all good i will say use stage state okay there we go and beautiful now we have our use date simple and again here whenever you hit enter right it's going to click the it's going to hit the answer submit function which is in here right and our input is always updated because our if the input gets updated through what through our on change function right here that's pretty much it guys that's all you have to think about okay so let's go ahead and save that so we'll go ahead and save that beautiful okay so save that and then let's go ahead and refresh this beautiful all right now let's go ahead and see if i go ahead and now command k to clear this out if i'm typing for the po right and i say enter this is the input asdf whatever my b right if i say for example cars let's say hit enter there's the input cars right how sick is that guys by the way guys we are currently at 666 likes let's get us to 700 likes can we get to 700 should we get us 100 jesse can we get 700 guys i'm sure we can 700. let's get to 700 and let's finish this pinterest clone today right now we are guys are so close at this point it's insane guys so close so that's going to finish this up right now and we'll get started let's go jesse let's go let's go let's go let's go so nas the next thing we need to do actually is i think it's time somebody said somebody give you a super chat and give us 40 pesos says jesse i love you [Laughter] thank you calamity calamity is the name calamity that's awesome okay so um well you know we actually want what do we want to do with this input guys we want this input we want to make an api call with that to the on splash right and then we want those pins to be next step to be distributed or passed in as props correct yes to the main board yes so what we need to do actually because header is a child component a header you know you don't see the main board component here right so what we need to do is we need to send info from the header component to the app component the parent component and app component will pass it to the main board well let's think about this but but before we do that jesse let's think about this okay if we have if we want to make for example a search to the unsplash api okay what do you think that that needs to happen like if you want if you want to call an api right the on splash api what do you think that needs to happen well it needs to be distributed to different components right so i would say it's parent component app.js yes because we're going to use that functionality inside here and also inside here right so we have to think about that okay so we're going to go on on uh we will go to app.js and inside the app.js what we can create guys is we can create a actual kind of like uh think of it as like on search submit function okay so we can say create an answer segment function so let's go and do const on search submit right there oh damn how does it give me the the answer to that i don't know why yeah it's very smart sometimes visual studio way too smart right right this function we're going to pass in our input so we'll say for example equals we'll give it a function this is called the arrow function just so you know guys in esx we'll give it a term right there this term now what's going to happen when we go ahead and actually call this function well pretty simple this is where we will get images right we're going to call thank you we're going to call uh basically the images for what the images for on splash so that means like again separation of concerns we now want to get images from one splash let's go ahead and create a function called get images so i will say const const get images images right and that's also going to be a function right and this is also going to accept what a term correct yes right and now just how we had it before right the way because because jesse went ahead and created our what our onsplash um axios right here where is it inside the api right here see we can simply call this right away check this out i go to app.js and i simply say here look at this here's how cool this is i can simply say on splash return here we'll do unsplash on splash right here unsplash.git and we'll give it that url and we'll give it the what what url we're going to give it well the one that we found in the search query um area right yes yes uh within the documentation of em on splash correct so the one that we're going to look for is actually the search photos let's go ahead and do search photos right here that's going to be which one it's going to be pretty much this one so https api search photos right here boom oh you got it thank you jesse yeah yeah of course no i know you were looking there so exactly that we're not looking at exactly the source of it and also you need to give it some params right yes it also says it at the top params correct and then within these params is an object it has a key and it expects they're actually what you want to search for yeah it's out there right there and again the params are based on this as you can see guys right we have a query parameter page param a per page prime and so forth and by default the per page param is just simply 10 right that's how we know right that's how we know that you know that's how many photos we're going to get back every time we click search and that's what the parameter we're going to pass into our query so let's go ahead and do that save that and now let's just call i'm just going let's go and call this unsplash let's do let's do git images let's actually call it we're using the term right no definitely of course right now okay but now that's gonna happen because we need to nothing's been nothing's called the answer submit so let's for now let's do answer submit just as a as a as a test let's go ahead and call it with what should we do car i don't know i don't know why volley how about that bali how about that let's go bali so here we'll do bali okay we'll do bali right here and so now if i go back to my my right there oh okay check this out let's go ahead and do network okay you will you will still see here right there where is there is arizona where is it photos bali look at this hey and here's a result let's check this out we get our results let's go hey you gotta have fun sometimes you know special friday night it's friday night here it's friday night let's go this is the result we got back from unsplash okay isn't that awesome yes like an array with 10 objects and each of those objects what do they contain us they contain look at this i'm not sure well do they contain jesse actually you tell me a lot though but what you should be looking for is the urls where's the url no bottom bottom oh url so right there yeah yours we have a full url a raw a regular yeah a small thumbnail and so our goal is we're going to go ahead and go and get which one well um usually the regular one is good yeah you can see we made it out not you can test it out you can copy one url and paste it in your browser we copy it yeah that's cool i mean it's just like it works in source right for an image so let's go and copy this guys cup case copies pasta pasta pasta in here oh that looks oh jesse why am i not there justin how is the question something way to see anyways isn't this amazing guys always always be positive guys always always okay so here that's how you connect thank you love youtube that's how you can test that your api called two on splash went perfect though yes okay exactly let's go let's go now so we got the answer submit okay jesse let's go ahead and drive us what's next what's next so um i think we want to call this unsearch submit when we're doing what when we're pressing enter enter enter so how do we do that jesse so when we go back to header.js okay right there apparently we have the unsearched submit correct right here sounds familiar yes so here we're gonna be calling that function with an app component but wait how can i call a function in the parent component from a child that's a good point that's a good point well the way you do is you can actually pass in guys you can pass in a function as an actual prop or think of it as a parameter not a prop a prop to a component is think as like a parameter to your function right so don't confuse that it's a pretty simple term to understand okay prop is a comparable to a function so within the header no let me start at the beginning but the header will receive props which is the function so when we go back to app.js let's pass that function in and let's call it um unsubmit you know like do it let's call it unsubmit yeah you can do it no you do you you do it you do it you do it okay okay on submit and we're gonna pass in that function that we made okay so it's the on search submit so just to be really clear about this guys these are different things but here look unsubmit is the key on props okay because prop's always an object and on that key we will have the unsearched submit function so when header receives props and basically it looks like this now uh under the hood okay okay not with the not with quote guys but just like this and it will have and then here it will have that function yeah so on this this this guys is happening underneath the hood just you know this is underneath the hood basically this is how props can be passed in right into the header component okay so it's just so you know right it's not magic it's not magic right underneath the hood when you pass in a prop into here right it's like you're passing a parameter into your function and you're given the parameter a function uncalled answer submit and then we accept it by saying like this and now we can say what we can do props what props dot what on submit submit submit and look at this and then we can call using the term what is it the input which we get what the input right here and that's it and so now it's going to happen is look look this right here is going to call the on submit function that's going to remove this unsubmit function which is actually inside the app.js which is right here right there see so now if i go ahead and do this if i say console.log sorry god bless you no no sorry answer submit right there right right there and i i give it a term let's say term okay so let's go ahead and save this beautiful if i do that guys check this out if i do that look at this what's going to happen is pretty simple i will go ahead and do this right now and let's go ahead and inspect element console let's do this bali look at that answer submit bali and that's the one guys how cool is that huh i'll say that's pretty sick so you can see if he called this function this function was called right within you see you had this function which was one function here right let me play this right this was our function called the app.js this was our app.js that gs and we had our oops let's go ahead and do this and we had our what's it called our header header right there so let's go ahead and do this say header header.js right there and what happened is that from the app.gs we went ahead and we have a function called um what is it called on subscribe submit on search submit right there right let's go make this a little bit smaller right there right there oh boom wait see answer submit then what's going to happen is that this answer submit is going to pass itself in right then we'll go to the other brush pass itself into here and then we're going to get the on submit function here right and so what's going to happen is when we call now this and go and okay boom we now call this this is going to be this is actually going to call this so this right there and that's pretty much it right it's going to call this and it's going to pass in the term any term any parameter that we want so parameter let me see param into it as well how cool is that right so just keep that in mind guys okay let's just keep that in mind with you right really important tool for you guys to know exactly what you're doing all right cool all right let's go ahead and keep going so we got that specific portion what's next jesse what's next let me think let me think okay so let's look at app.js so we're gonna make api close to one splash right now yes and once we have that once we get results back what do we want to do with those i think we want us i think we want to make new pins out of those right so once we've done here line 23 guys once we have um we get the pictures back from unsplash okay we want to do something with that result right correct so we're going to say then by the way um axio is always returning promises yeah okay guys we're going to wait 64 likes let's get to 700 guys just six more likes 700 likes omg that's a lot that's a lot so get images term we're gonna wait for that function to come back with the pictures and then we have the result of that okay so let's do something with that so let's catch that in a variable and say rest.results this one on the right side this actually what we're getting back from unsplash remember we had that result an array and then we flipped out right here that's exactly that right there see this results right here guys we see this result this is the result we're calling right here so this directly maps to that right there directly mapped to that just so you know okay so we want to store that within a new array and we call that new pins okay what we want to do there is actually we want to have all of the results in there all of it so we're going to use something spread operator and we're also going to do that for previous pins that we have because at the top of this app we also want to do something else we always want to know a certain state yes okay a certain state regarding the pins because that's what we want right so here again pins sets new pins so these are going to collapse are going to reference whatever pins you have here so these pins are going to contain the data okay to show all of these other pins right here right that's how this is going to work it's pretty simple right so let's go ahead and keep going jesse so people yeah okay go ahead so we have a state here of pins and then with the react hook of use state which has a default of an empty array so if we don't have any pins it will just have an empty array okay but with set new pins this function which is the setter we can set the value of pins okay so once we have new pins here what we're going to do is well first we're going to sort it a little bit because we don't want pins like 10 dogs 10 cats 10 cars we don't want that we don't we want to shuffle that a little bit okay so we're going to use a sort function here to do that we're going to randomize it okay but actually what's the most important part of this function is we're going to set the new pins with the new pins yes yes yes yes so line 34 guys line 34 that's what it's all about we're going to give new pins as an argument to the setter function which means new pins here will be set on pins and will be displayed we get the results here right we get we use the results and we concatenate together with our current pins which are currently inside our state right here right there you see inside this state right you concatenate this is called a spread operator so we can actually spread out whatever's in here and what i was in here i kind of put them and put them together right so imagine taking for example imagine taking like uh taking like for example here you see this right here see this actually let me put this imagine doing this for example you have this and you have this right and then what you do is you bring it together by doing just doing you're doing like this now you have one that's pretty much it now you have one that's all you're doing when you when you're doing the spread operator together right that's all pretty much you're doing what we're doing here okay so you got that then we're going to have here and we're going to just randomize them just for recommendations think and then we're going to actually save them usually called something set new pins which we get from here directly and that's pretty much it now we have the set new pins and so every single time we now search we're going to show these pins in here we're going to set them save them in here and that's it and now because we have that because we have that what we can do now what we can do now is pretty much just go ahead and what pass it to the main board exactly let's do it jesse you got this come on okay so guys so we're gonna be we're gonna be passing the pins as a prop to mainboard right so here with a mainboard chorus pass props are gonna be here okay so always make sure when you're making react components that you know you think about the data flow right not props but props yep so let's destructure that because just like i showed before props and objects so the key on it is pins so let's just do this yeah we're currently wearing that we're currently where in the we are main words the js let's go ahead and do that right now okay click beautiful nice nice awesome so now we only have one pin here but i still want to show it first of all let me fix that error for you here import you state where is it where is it where are you doing that where are you doing that jesse yes yes let's go back to app.js hold on app.js okay keep going yeah so make sure you let me know where you're doing this okay yeah yeah sorry after gs i fixed it on the top at the top good so we have the use state right here that's beautiful to make sure that that's all working okay nice good oh there we go now it's working probably okay keep going keep going yeah yeah so i'm gonna go back to mainboard.js okay let's go so now that we have all of the pins what do you think we want to do nice well we underwent now we want to go ahead and loop through them fully and actually show every single pin that we get how cool would that be oh let's go well let's just map through it or you want to for each through it well we can do we can do map we can do for each let's do map that's fine okay that's fine we can do it that's fine visual studio code um pinstop map and i'm mapping through each pin and each pin has a url to to just make it a little bit more readable cool so what's happening here guys is pretty simple we're going to get these pins that are going to come from the the home page okay from the app.js right here from this these pins right here then we're going to loop through every single pin right we're going to get left every single pin right and then what's going to happen here now jesse well we're going to get the url we're going to get the urls yeah of the pen right and then again we can actually show show what show the actual component of the pen yes so we're going to pass it in to the pin because remember when if we're looking at pin.js i'm now in pin.js we have that image source right the hardcoded copy link or the link you copied in if you go to pin.js i'm doing it right now and then yes right there okay let's see okay oh so it's currently hard copy so we need to actually replace this right we need to go and replace this with a prop so if we go ahead and pass some props here okay props here okay we're gonna place that prop with an actual url from props so let's do that right now so we can pass in a prop what prop should we pass in here equal url right there right there and we can say urls that what the regular right because why you can see that inside here it's right inside here we have urls right there right urls and then we have a regular a raw a full a small and so forth and we're going to get a regular for this one so we'll say urls.regular right to get just the regular ones okay beautiful i'm going to close this out okay yep sorry and what i do sometimes just to make sure i'm gonna put a question mark here so in case it's not there it won't freak out yes correct correct correct so what's going to happen is once we go ahead and we have the urls.regular okay so cool you have that guys now of course you can see nothing's happening you can see this kind of it kind of broke right but that's exactly what we want to do you want it to break right we want it to break right now because we're not passing in urls just yet now to do that we go to main board okay we go to the main board so wherever we passing url so you can see now we're passing urls and look at this let's go and pass it in and you can see nothing right now is happening just yet no no no because we need to do this this one oh let's go hold on so we need to save this hola save this it's still not showing up which is completely fine that's fine look right so we want to go ahead for this specific one right for every single pin in the in the main board if we go ahead and let's take a look at this if i go ahead and see this let's go to console let's see if we have any issues there's no issues right now that are showing which is no problem let me see so we go ahead and map through this we have pins okay let's go ahead and do console log pins to see if we actually get in the pin so console.log now actually hold on this makes sense look at this this makes sense why this is now does not work why guys because this should be working when we click submit when we hit submit that's why right when we hit submit so if i say click this if i say car ready ready for this jesse are you ready oh let's go that's what i'm talking about hold on look at this oh that is so cool thank you so much guys we are clearly at 715 likes let's get to 800 likes you guys are amazing thank you so much let's go ahead and keep going we're almost there let's go ahead and make it so good so good almost pictures man that's really like that gets me pumped about pinterest every time you see it you know now one thing i will say to you guys is you see how we have this issue right here say call unique key prop no problem what we can do is here for here is we can actually give it a unique key so look at this this is something you you need for every whenever you map through it we can you need to give it a unique key that's the one thing you need to do which is no problem so we can do is a set of pin we can now do key key right here key is equal to index and every single component when you loop through it needs to have some kind of a key and the reason why is because this is how right here just so you guys know just so you know this right here this key is how react.js tracks changes so whenever something changes for xjs this is how it tracks changes this is how it knows how to update your view that you have okay cool so kind of keep going with this that's also what makes it really fast right yes yes yes yes okay so we saved that keep going jesse so keep going keep going you know what nas let's go back to app.js because now we only get pictures upon the submit okay okay actually when i open up the app i want to see pictures as well right i want to see pins as well okay and maybe based on a few search terms that i've you know used in the past couple of days so what do you think so maybe let's create a function that will maybe that will right away show us show us a few pins right away how about that jesse yeah well i think it's good if we use use effect for that because use effect is one of the react hooks i believe that you know renders one time it fires off one time when you open up an app exactly okay so let's use that one and let's let let blow up let the use effect fire off another function yes okay so let me make that one here i don't know where you are i'm in the app.js as well okay great i'm gonna give it an empty array here good good good good good okay and then what should we call it i think like get new pins for example yes yes yes yes yes and guys the reason why we're doing this is because again user effect is a really popular thing where every time the page loads right whenever the page loads we're going to call this function on page load right and so then we're going to create a get new pins function right here which is going to be called on again page load and then we're going to get just a few you know few simple uh kind of like a few simple pins for us to show right away from the getgo so let's go and see this so we're going to do is we're going to create multiple promises here the reason why we're creating this process is because again we're going to have multiple uh what's it called um multiple uh calls to the api multicast api because if i do this check this out if we do this if we think about this let me go ahead and click a brush and let me go ahead and freeze this right we have all let's we'll create a few different search terms so we'll have for example car maybe we'll have for example bali right maybe we would want to show for example uh something else let's say it's car or dog just kind of how jesse is typing right there right this is let's say it's an array okay let's say this is an array okay that's awesome then what's going to happen is pretty simple guys right we're going to for every single one we're going to call the unsplash api flash api right on splash api right and we'll do like this we'll go to car we'll call that splash api and we'll get data and we'll save it to pins so here our pins are going to be here this is the pins data okay then same thing is going to happen for bali right we're going to go bali collapse api save it back to pins then dog answers api save it back to pins really simple really simple guys this is why we have multiple promises in here because of for that reason because we want to be able to show we want to wait for all this to happen at once and then we want to go ahead and show all the images so you can see you see jesse right here where she's going yeah where she's got the promises she's got the list of pins just how i just showed it to you we're looping every single pin right here a little bit exactly okay okay lupita and then what's going to happen is for every single pin pricing pin turn which is going to be this this and so forth we're going to create a promise or push a promise right a promise using the get images function right here it's as simple as that okay so you digest it right here here just doing she's doing the get images function just like how i did it beforehand in here to get images function to get the term but in our case we're doing good images for every single pen term inside here okay then we get results that are just how did before and now we have the pin data so go ahead just to keep going so we're going to concat that previous correct things we're going to concat the current pin data which is a current pandita which is kind of basically empty right empty array for now with a new result so basically we're going to create a bunch of pins right here for for ocean for tokyo for dogs whatever we get for ocean is going to go here there we go for tokyo is going to go to here whatever we get for dogs is going to go here that's it and now what she's doing is she's going to go ahead and sort this right just to kind of uh let's go ahead just to sort this just to go ahead and kind of like insert it just to so so it's not blend you know so it's not blend and that's pretty much it so here when we're sorting we're just randomizing it that's it and that's it that's pretty much it jesse right but at the end we're gonna collect all of those promises all of those from those requests that we send out yes yes so this is gonna be at the end and then we're gonna do the most important things what do you think we should be doing setting the new pins of course yes with all of the pin data exactly exactly so what's going to happen now is that promise is not all what it does is pretty simple guys it goes ahead and it waits for all the promises to finish right that's what all the problems to finish meaning it waits for all these api calls to finish like the images for the ocean for tokyo and so forth and then we're going to and then all it wants is going to set new pins with the pinned data that we have here it's a pretty simple solution right we're going to set your pins with a new pin that we have here and that's pretty much it makes sense that's pretty much it makes sense all right let me see i'm missing a bracket somewhere missing a bracket let me see we have the bracket here we have a bracket here we call this here bracket here racket here bracket here let me see let me see let me see i think you got it pretty much i think it's actually because of let me see here that's actually interesting where'd that come about i don't know let me see we have a bracket here the bracket is here okay that's fine now it's still not gone and then here what is it here maybe somewhere at the top i got it command x let's cut this for now for a second i think it might be fluke with use code for a second here that's all and then command p no let me see there's that use of fact is in here and make sure this is all good you got that that's awesome oh we haven't imported use effect um that's why hmm well it's funny how it doesn't fully give us the what's it called doesn't give us the proper uh error if we wanted to mmhmm yeah so we have used this word okay that's fine yeah let's try this say this it says okay there we go and now we have ourselves pins look at this oh let's go so you can see now now of course it looks weird right it looks weird as [ __ ] look at this actually that's pretty cool holy [ __ ] can we just leave it at this damn yeah yeah yeah yeah we create our own pinterest can we just leave that down pinterest what color for you because this is much better i'm sorry i love this i really love the amazing layout though where you have like the small blocks and the big blocks and then it looks really please okay guys how cool is that guys let's go ahead guys we're currently at 706 likes let's get to 800 guys for this epic view for this epic picture score that we've got right now look at how beautiful it is good look at that i love it that's amazing amazing guys let's go ahead and get it to 800 we are currently at 727 can we get to 100 i'm sure we can i know we can you guys current you guys can let's go all right keep going jesse let's go ahead so we got the pins right we're getting the pins right here no problem okay what's the next thing we should do we should probably focus a little bit on the styling portion right what do you think yeah so guys this is the last part okay we're gonna give this app that famous pinterest look let's do it let's do it a masonry layout are you ready let's go let's go i'm ready are you ready jesse are you ready ready are you ready i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready for a long time so let's go back to the main board now let's go back there okay so mainboard.js okay awesome let's see it okay so we're good yeah the gs we're going to go back to mail and we're going to actually be focusing on the container so remember we had to put on a width of 80 percent and when i showed that green block it was really persistent on showing that right yes but actually when you're making this layout we're going to use columns and yeah we're going to use columns and gaps and some counts because we're going to be saying if your screen is a certain size you need this many columns which basically means you're going to show this amount of columns of pictures okay so what is natural so for what is initially what columns should we show initially for now what columns how many columns um maybe for this height maybe five columns or something just to show it you mean okay let's do it just a show let's see um comic con five okay sophie oh okay hold on hold on we're getting somewhere hold on getting somewhere column column gap go do it do it do we do it do it jesse okay column gap sporty nice cool nice beautiful beautiful oh it's gonna well this was a little bit smaller i think i think this was like five pixels no okay that looks better okay and we want to set a margin of auto zero auto so give it auto good on the container on the full container good yeah yeah and well we did have the height already yes correct no 100 percent no it's not necessary i think but maybe just to be sure yes so what you also need to be doing is something very important there's something you need to do with the pin itself i believe okay what is it what should we do jesse we should put the pin on a display inline block otherwise it will not do anything okay display inline block where would that be that would be in the pin pin.js here and it would be on i think the pin container if i remember correctly might be the wrapper i think actually oh yeah yeah oh we already put a display inline flex on it correct correct correct and so you can see now right these are not showing up in the three color three columns that we want to show up right let's go ahead and inspect that one on this one just to make sure just to check it out okay so here is all paint all pins right boom right there okay we have this specific portion right here okay this specific portion is display flex right and so forth this specific portion has a display flex with a column count of five and margin zero auto but of course it's not putting what do you think that's not putting you just see the column cut i'm curious um that squish question um so here's what we can do let me see so if i go ahead if we have this specific thing let me see let's let's check this out because i think i think is because of the fact of this so you see column gap column count merges your auto let's see about height don't need this so we have the container which is fine okay display flex okay let's go ahead and do a line i can i do it like item center that's fine cancel that's fine let's go ahead and now do the following so we got that let me see column column uh what is it what is it called column what column count column or what do you mean column count css right there so for column count to work properly let's see for column count to work properly we need to do what uh no just like that that's fine column count so column count of three column count of four depending i think it's actually because of the fact that it's going out so for example i think what we need to do jesse in here is inside this container mmhmm you see how we have this container goes side goes outside the width of this we need to prevent it from go outside the width of this ah you see this is the way this width has a width of this so we actually almost need to think remove this width right there that's fine because this is for example 435 this is for example let's see wrapper this is container look at that the width this is a thousand pixels you see this is however container okay i see okay um this one this one here is 944 pixels let's see okay let me see okay that's fine okay i think we need to look at our first our big one here big one here okay let's see max with with a hundred percent for this one okay let's take this okay okay 959 which is gonna be this one that's fine okay now it's going to happen let me see so if we go ahead and check this out this is 9.59 how do i make sure let's give it this a width for example let's give this a um let's give this a width of of let's say 400 pixels okay so we're getting somewhere hold on hold on oh yeah sorry you're right we need to give it a max with to be honest thank you jesse appreciate it yeah there we go because you have max with right here yeah yeah yeah no i'm sorry i forgot about it but you need to give it a max width and within the max width then you can set a certain amount of columns yeah so if i remove this width actually i guess we don't need this okay right for this as well that's fine but for this specifically let's do a max width so let's try like 1008 pixels for max with 1000 pixels yeah something like that and then maybe like yeah four column count four for example column count four do you think that's gonna work hope so no it's not gonna work let's see one more time so if i have this let's save this all right so we have column where's our column count right here for the container right so we need to set on the container of this let's give it a on the container max width right here let's say it's given knight a width of 756 pixels what do you think what do you guys think you should do huh what do you think what do you guys think that we should have okay so it's getting somewhere it's a little bit okay all right that's fine okay that's fine um i think we need to do because is this the inviting flex or just flex inline flex uh no this should be a flex i think um oh sorry that's the whole point you need to remove the flex sorry you need to remove the flex yeah there we go oh sorry hold on you need to remove the flex remove the flex nice okay beautiful yeah yeah now it still looks weird as hell yeah yeah but i can change that for this one like for example if you put this one on 1260 pixels and then you're gonna give it a compound of five can you save it one two three four yeah oh that looks so much better thank you okay so it was all display of flex that was the issue because this place like keeps it in one row to use that but with the amazing rate layout we don't need to use that so learn from this guys okay so now you guys know i think that's not allowed honestly cool so guys so we got that specific portion and somebody said flex wrap thank you actually we could have done it can we do what's on display flags can we do this display flex let's see display flex and could we have done it with a flax wrap somebody said gonna have spaces i believe flex rap i'm just curious here rap prep i mean i mean that kind of works yeah it works but um only because you're using the column count i think i mean it kind of works not badly no that's true that's true okay okay cool cool cool cool cool i like that i like that okay so now we don't necessarily need to use that right there we don't necessarily need to use that so it's still going to be flex wrap of this specific actually no actually off i think actually i want to make it responsive nas hold on hold on just hold on hold on hold on this is fun align items flex uh start start oh okay oh yeah you're gonna have it's not gonna have oh i see what you mean so you see yeah it's gonna ah so it won't be the same can i talk yeah i'll be the same gotta check that yeah yeah yeah nice but it's cool it's really good it's really good if people try this out you get a feeling for it you know i was really hoping the flex will fix this but i guess i was wrong it's all right sometimes you win sometimes you lose you know that's that's part of life but this looks amazing though i'm happy look at that guys 743 likes let's get to 800 guys for this sick demonstration right here guys all right let's go let's do this let's do this omg yes yes yes yes yes all right so let's keep going let's keep going i want to make this responsive so that means what when you stretch it out yes i want the column count yeah you know i want it to be you know smooth like like the car spins popping up there so what did i do for that you know um something called media queries yes with a media query you can basically set and say like hey if your screen is this size between this line of pixels and this amount of pixels you should change certain classes or certain css properties of your class in this case your styled components okay so i'm gonna should i well it's a really long list i mean let's see here we can actually copy that list and probably let's create a css file let's copy and paste that list so people can see it and we'll be able to provide to you guys no problem later on don't worry about this so let's do it so let's go ahead and go ahead and create a main.css file here in components yes yes yes yes yes yes yes mainboard.css file okay so she's going to create a name with a css file right here right there and that's just going to go ahead and actually use media queries to add media queries to that so let's do import just go to import now import right right there main board main board dot css right here and then on this specific section inside my mobile site css oh sure they got ahold of media queries so look at this guys this is the media queries that we can use i guess we'll provide this to you in the github page holy [ __ ] that's a lot jesse yeah a lot but look here looks look here like line 23 remember when i said max with 1260 yes oh sorry this is mini width here but max weight is here match with 1260 and then i'm gonna give it a column count of five so when you stretch out your um browser until that amount of pixels is going to have a column count of five correct if you're gonna stretch it out more it's gonna have six so kind of like this right let's say this this right here so the min width for example is guys this right here is the min width so min width is kind of like main width i mean width it's pretty simple to understand it's basically the main width of this container of the whole box right of the whole of the whole um uh browser right that's the main weight max width right here is till how far will it go maybe it will go till this width right now basically from here to here right we'll get a we'll add the container width of 100 1500 pixels and a column count of six right that's that's pretty much all it said so the column count will increase here for example for a max width of 1260 and then a minimum 1260 and a max of 5 15 11 right we'll do a column count or five pretty simple as that right so we go ahead and check this out let's go and save this jesse you ready for this yes but we now we still have a default because we have put the max mainboard with now on a certain max weight remember what do you mean oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so let's go do this let's go ahead and do this so we'll do here let's do remove the max with wait where is it right there so let's remove this one okay yeah and let's remove the column count as well please and we don't want to remove the gap that's not going to work you know why i know why e we need to import or what we need to go ahead and actually add a class to this one oh that's what you wanted to do okay container see so yeah yeah this one we'll say class name boom mainboard container see let's go oh my god it looks so good let's go let's go oh look at this guys holy moly that looks sick how cool does that look guys let's get this video up to 800 likes for a 757. can you guys do 800 likes let's go smash that like button below guys we finished our application guys we will provide you with the github to this app again this is part one of part three parts okay but this is part one of three parts that we're going to be working on okay this is only just a functionality guy but jesse what other functionality are we going to be adding in the next few parts of this pinterest clone well like in a normal pinterest you know you can add pins to a board okay you can add pins to a board to newly created boards and we're going to be i'm i mean you want to see those boards right so we're going to be making a user profile super sick super super jagged a lot of data flow a lot of css html styles components okay like get ready guys this one is going to be one hell of a series okay so i'm so so proud of this one though that's gonna be so much fun so guys how sick is that drop in the comments below we are calling at six 767 likes can we get to to 800 let's go come on can we get to okay 100 likes guys i'm sure we can i know we can guys one less thing i will tell you okay really important guys so yeah like i said we finished starting first pitch is cloned it looks really cool if i for example now type in car look at this i can type in car and look at that it adds car right there boom boom right and randomizes it that's the whole point of pinterest right about the position and making it making it look like a really nice board right that's the whole point of this so that that's that's awesome now really quickly here before we we go we'll go ahead and finish with you guys again we have a react.js workshop and now reg.js challenge for you down below link in the description guys you want to check this out completely free you will learn how you will kickstart you will not only kickstart your your career as a rack just developer but you will also go ahead and build a slack loan free portfolio you will get your own portfolio by using react.js you will upload that portfolio online you will upload slackline online you will learn how to kickstart your career in the in terms of have become you will learn how to kickstart your career as a react.js developer you will learn how to make money as a reactor developer and you will learn how to become a six figure developer in general guys trust me it's so much fun we have thousands of people now at this point in this challenge join now it is going to be so so much fun the next few days again it's going to start february 22nd so join up because you will miss out and you don't want to miss out i'm sure you don't if you join hold on if you've joined the react just challenge let us know in the comments below and we'll shout you out so if you've joined to the redress challenge let us know in the comments below i will make sure to shout you out okay guys so jesse how was this built how would you enjoy this you enjoyed this oh man i enjoyed it so much i mean look at this and when you stretch it out it will get all of the other pins as well it's responsive it looks slick it has functionality to it the icons look good it's styled components like i mean what's there not to like yes it does i love love love it's so good i love this i hope you guys love this too give us some more likes smash that like button okay and join that five day react yes challenge guys you don't want to miss out next monday it's starting okay so be
