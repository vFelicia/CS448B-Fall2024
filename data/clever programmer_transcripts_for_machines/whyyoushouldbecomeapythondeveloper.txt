hey what's up you how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk about why anybody why you why that dude on the street should become a Python developer so without any further ado let's jump right into it alright so there are a lot of reasons why somebody should become a Python developer before we get to that let's also kind of drill down on what it is that you want right for example do you want a job where you're working full time do you want a job where you're working parttime as a freelancer independent contractor or consultant what is it that you want what is a lifestyle that you want right that's one of the important things to decide and what types of things do you like to do so for me I like to take ideas from my brain write whatever ideas whatever crazy stuff is going on in here I like to take it and turn it into reality something physical that people can use so what do I mean if I was good at art which I'm not then I get to build art and it's pretty cool but I don't it's hard for me to get thousands or millions of people to use that piece of art right but programming allows me to do that becoming a developer allows me to do that a programming language like Python allows me to do that it lets me take my creativity from my head turn into something real like an app and then people can actually use that app so you can use that so people can solve their problems whether it's a mobile app or a web app a website whatever right it's instantly scalable that's one of the main reasons I love to do what I do be a developer the reason why I'm specific with Python is because you guys know I love Python it's easy one of the most paid and one of the most growing it just overtook Java last year its 2017 if you're watching this in 2018 it might have changed stats but I know that Python is growing okay so if these are the things that you like to do right be creative come up with your own ideas build things and then have the world use them then dad is one very good reason to become a Python developer now the lifestyle you want right don't even think so much about payment yet money comes but what's more important is your time so you're gonna grow old I don't know if you're young or if you're old watching this but you're gonna retire at some point you want to do something in the meantime that's worth while and also pays you well with programming and Python it pays you well so that's one thing that's already taken care of right if you're a Python web developer somebody who's developing web apps web sites you get paid 80 to 90 thousand dollars on average and more you you can get paid up to 120 hundred thirty thousand dollars a year it's not unheard of it's common now why Python like what's so special about it the cool thing is that I mentioned this a lot so I feel like I'm saying this all the time but this might might be your first time hearing this so I'm gonna mention it places like Google was built off of Python okay YouTube was built off of Python Spotify is built off of Python Instagram is built off of Python Dropbox is built off of Python reddit is built off of Python so Python is not a joke it's a very powerful language that is one very important reason where if you're thinking about where to invest your time Python is a pretty good choice now there are other languages like JavaScript which are really good but one thing I like about about Python is that it can speak with JavaScript HTML CSS naturally if you're not a web developer right I want to make sure that I'm speaking in terms which makes sense and Python doesn't have to fight those other languages you can actually use JavaScript with Python with HTML with CSS all those other languages ok so easy something you can use with everything else something can get started off with fairly easily and something that you can build platforms that can handle hundreds of millions of people per month like Instagram or whatever right Dropbox read it so incredibly powerful now for the lifestyle that I mentioned earlier if you want to be a fulltime developer you have plenty of choices you can go with you know any company now you're not limited to web development with Python by the way so I want to stay true to what this video is about which is why you should become a Python developer if you're more interested in things like data science you can do that with Python right people who work at NASA those types of things where you know you have data and what to make of it for example if you're working at Amazon and you want to build a recommendation system which suggests you know these are the products you should get you know just like how Amazon knows you more than you know your wife might know you it's like hey are you done with this would you like the next one or would you like this similar product you know like hell yeah how did you know him as the hunt and you go and like buy those things it's because there's you know there's data scientists who are building that stuff for you it's like machine learning you know it's like algorithms that they have there they can recommend to you things that you wouldn't even recommend yourself and you basically make these computers artificially intelligent computers that do these things for you that think essentially and python allows you to do that machine learning you know which is something that I've also mentioned which is you know have you ever seen those videos where the there are these cars that are not controlled by anything and then they'll like a run into a tree and then they'll like run into a tree a lot and then they'll learn to not run into that tree then they're automated and they can go as fast as you can think like 30 40 50 miles an hour let's small little cars and they don't crash into anything or the Google cars that just came out right where there there's no driver and they're being driven Tesla cars that are being driven and there's no driver this is machine learning this is something you can actually do it Python image detection digit character detection you know the same one when you for example go to deposit a cheque before you have to always go to the bank but imagine well not imagine now we can actually do this you can take a picture of a check and then it detects the edges of the cheque right it detects that you know your carpet or your table is not part of the cheque so first of all that's imaged and it's called edge detection in another machine learning thing that's happening there is that if you wrote 500 dollars in the check or $10,000 in the check it also detects that you wrote ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars that's digit recognition or character recognition that's also part of the whole machine learning and data science thing so that is a whole another route you can go which is amazing and you can combine that with web development I'm a fan of web development because you get instant results you can instantly put together something for your friends or family or start freelancing for clients and then you know kind of nudge your way into the data science field from there because data science field is a little bit more traditional takes you a little bit longer to get a job it you know a lot of the times also has prerequisites like your degree or your level of experience whereas web development doesn't really have a requirement for degrees like not at all it doesn't matter if you have a degree or not it just matters if you have a little bit of experience mostly it matters about your skills and it's easy enough to build a portfolio it's so easy you can even like look online find some apps put those together one or two simple ones and you can actually start getting clients from online platforms or find clients locally okay it just comes down to reaching out so the reason why I mentioned web development is because it's easier thing to get into but there is a ton you could do with Python right anywhere from starting to working at a NASA or Amazon or Netflix level right Netflix also has a recommendation system built into it which recommends movies intelligently to you so with knowing what how many things there are with Python what kind of feels you can go into what kind of companies were using and how much money you can make it comes down to between also you know freelancing or fulltime I like the idea of freelancing because it's easier to get into it and you get to choose your own hours and you're not stuck to this ninetofive time that's one of my biggest things I love about being able to freelance another thing I love about it is you start of yourself as a business rather than employee because you have all these clients so now the clients are working with you they respect you as much as you respect them whereas in business it's a higher art yeah when your employees a hierarchy right and your bottom of the food chain or there's always somebody above you freelancing your clients you're their boss and they're your boss it's like equal relationship so the respect is great you can fire your own clients if you don't like them so you don't have to work with people who make you miserable and want to kill yourself every single day you don't have to do the work that kills you there's no like contracts there also you can do the stuff that you really like the stuff that you really love and get paid working with the people that you really enjoy and on your own time your own schedule so if you want to travel the world you want to travel see your family not be restricted to a specific time I know I've missed you know lots of special occasions because I was actually like I had a job where I didn't have time so freelancing kind of makes that a little bit easier but there are multiple routes you could go with Python if this is something that interests you going the freelancing route or going the web development route I'm gonna put a link here also I have a course that comes up around well if you're watching this in 2017 then I have a course coming up in November but if you're watching this some time later same course will be launching some other time I only open it for a short period of time but this course is mostly about Python web development and freelancing if you're if you're interested in this and you want to know click this link go to this page it's gonna be a page that's gonna tell you about this upcoming course and if you sign up which is free to sign up you'll be the first one who gets notified and then also give you you know the resources that help me become a software developer in less than three months and all the resources I give you in this or free as well so you're gonna get bonus and you're gonna be the first one to get notified when this course opens up if you're not interested in web development that's totally fine some things I mentioned to you if you want to go the route of data science or you want to go your own route you know there are plenty of resources out there for you like on Udacity Coursera udemy those resources have stuff about data science you know some basics about web development the only thing I did with my thing is put together not only learning with Python but also how you can start getting paid as fast as possible because I get it right most of you are busy and you have only a few hours a day whereas a lot of people and a lot of people online people's courses assume you have all the time in the world and in you can just spend all this time to like learn just learn about Python right and I like to say that learning and understanding plus $2 can almost get you a Starbucks which is actually something Tony Robbins says so I want to make sure that I don't only get you to learn but to earn at the same time or earn faster in a shorter period of time or you're only having to spend one to two hours building practical things learning practical things interested in that click this link go to this thing otherwise I gave you as much information as I could about you know give you a big picture perspective about Python hope you like this video if you like this video give it a little thumbs up if you hate it dislike it comment below tell me I'm ugly if you loved it comment below tell me you love me subscribe to the channel hit the bell button as always I love your faces off thank you so much for watching this and I'll see you in the next video
