again but with redux and today i'm going to be teaching you guys redux so redux is one of the most wanted most popular things that you could pretty much learn when you're learning react so it's the most valuable thing in terms of what a job essentially wants so today's going to be a big build for you guys okay um redux is pretty much in previous builds i've done everything with the react context

this comment out of the way so yeah we'll pretty much build this out with firebase you can see we're using cloud firestore we use google authentication and in this build we actually go ahead and use a persistent so i remember some of you guys are like hey something we're using google authentication but it keeps logging me out so i went ahead and fixed that for you guys so we don't have we don't have that issue anymore so if i go ahead and refresh it will log me back in there we go oh let me show my screen if we go ahead and refresh and we go back there you go it logs me back in and

pretty much it's completely free so go ahead and do it like it's gonna help you guys out on your coding journey but with that said guys quick demo of the app one more time for anyone who joined in new this is the discord clone we can pretty much go ahead and log out log in with full google functionality so google login and boom somebody goes sunny just saw your rubik's cube story back in the days man back in the day um and yeah and pretty much when we type in here so we can go yo and you see we can pretty much it comes up and let me go ahead and see if i get my annotation there we go and you can see it pops up here so keep an eye over here and if i go ahead and say who's ready to start so who is ready to start the build go ahead and let me know guys if you're ready to go ahead and get

ahead and register dude and we run that training quite a lot so pretty much register and then we'll ping you uh a link and you'll be able to watch it after the build okay and i'll be able to help you out with that said guys let's get started okay so first thing you want to go ahead and do is open up visual studio code so let me go ahead and pull up a new one um actually i'm going to show you guys a little trick so today we're using redux okay so we're using redux today so with the redox in mind if you did you go on google and type in redux i'll show you hey we just got another supernova superchat donation thank you so much ayush gupta oh yeah nice to see you again hey sunny when will you be dropping react native soon soon okay um and also i see yeah so if you get if you spam guys we do block so please don't spam okay so now what we're going to do is click on getting started and i'll keep it nice and sweet and short for you guys so redux toolkit so you could do it this way but there's a very easy way to now to get started with a react app um no wait oh man i have to check this out serene cowden is back he goes great to see you back to sean hey so funny man uh jason was actually one of one of my favorite singers so good stuff all right let's go ahead and jump in back um oh man this is insane like i love seeing this stuff like the actual effect that we have so i made 500 in a week just with the netflix phone i just configured a little bit to use an anime api instead you guys are overpowered keep up the good work hey thank you dude appreciate you um let's go ahead and get started then so here is the command that we're going to do so it's pretty much very very similar to what we normally do okay so mpx create react app with the name of the app but here now we do dash dash template redux okay so don't freak out if you've never used redux before don't freak out it's going to be okay okay i know it can get pretty scary but you know it's going to be okay thank you so much today t dane blake so 199 super dollar super chat sorry thank you so much dude appreciate that um awesome so let's go ahead and get started um with the terminal go ahead go into the directory that you want so i'm going to go into this and i'm going to go ahead and say i've actually already run this command so it's mpx create react app and then redux so i've got it over here and i'm going to call it disk or clone youtube because i've already got another one called discord clown hit enter and that will go ahead let me make that a bit bigger and that will go ahead and spin up everything that we need so while that gets started guys i would recommend that you go over to firebase because firebase is pretty much how we're going to power the back end of this build so firebase.google.com and then over here you want to go to your console and you want to click on add project okay now here you can just go ahead and do discord clone i'm going to do disk click on youtube and keep it consistent because you know how we did and we're going to go back and go here and you don't need to enable google analytics i'm going to enable it for now because you know when we deploy this thing i like to see you guys looking create project and there we go okay so this thing goes ahead and gets created and let's go ahead and see so somebody says while we wait garvett says hey sonny my father is a bit conscious of spending a thousand dollars in the pwg what should i do should i show them all the videos about pwg honestly dude just literally go ahead and use the free videos okay go go ahead and use the free videos on youtube in the meantime and pretty much go ahead and build a bunch of stuff and show you that and say like hey like this is what i've done and i want to take it a step further i think that will be enough dude um and and all the best with that okay so with that said in class course somebody says would you do an in class course well after kovitz out we're actually going to do inperson events so stay tuned for that okay now you want to click and h click continue now that will load up and then what you want to do is hit this little or you can hit this web icon over here click that go here and i'm going to say discord clone youtube boom and then we're going to go ahead and do how to get rid of frustration when you keep for failing and code about feature in app based okay thank you so much gaming map gaming mat says love your builds uh two little two pound donation hey london huh london house love your bills and videos man keep it up appreciate you dude appreciate that um and make sure you go ahead and follow my instagram it's down here and you can pretty much keep in touch and and and let me know what you built because i'd love to see you guys interacting and going ahead and building out the stuff so um does anyone reckon there is still money to made in mobile development 100 dude 100 richard says our live calls recorded in pwj yes everything that we do in pwj is recorded so it's completely there so we're going to click on continue oh wait a minute why are we on crashlytics let's go to this little cog icon go project settings and we're going to scroll down and you see this right here guys config this is what we're interested in okay so you want to go ahead and copy this you just want to copy this and then oh nice dude that's a donation appreciate you guys holy crap so super champ says hey sonny what projects do you recommend for putting up on your portfolios for a front end developer also is it necessary to jump in the back end if you actually want to create a fully functional web app so very good question and to answer that question quickly before we get started uh as for what you want to put on your portfolio i would say go ahead and literally do all the clones all the clones are going to be like it's going to be huge for you guys um and that will make you have a very attractive portfolio now something i would recommend is that people have have had a lot of success of things like the netflix clown the spotify clone and frank grandma's actually got a six figure contract so that's good money right there okay so you guys can go ahead and get started with that and that will be really really good and you guys will be able to build out a portfolio but in the meantime literally just go ahead and do what you find fun so honestly anything there anywhere anything where you can provide a bit of value uh that's going to be the best place to start uh okay so with that said i'm gonna copy this and then you see we go back to our terminal everything is good so we're gonna go cd discord okay so now we're inside also i'm using all my zsh for this guys so if you haven't used that out uh go ahead and check that out it's a really handy terminal thing that you can do with all my um with it makes your terminal a lot easier now what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and open up a vs code inside open up vs code with our stuff inside okay so with that said let me quickly damn it i messed up all my windows okay with that said now somebody said why using firebase dude just watch and wait and see wait and see it's all i'm gonna say to you um let's go ahead and what is this oh we've got my coders playlist boom okay boom boom also if you guys don't listen to that i would check that out it's called lofi uh coders on spotify really really good playlist um so and also somebody says when will this end uh everything we do on the channel is always up on the channel afterwards okay so pretty much you guys can watch this at your own time afterwards as well and if you're excited guys please smash the thumbs up button because we've almost hit 500 likes which is dope okay now let's go ahead and move my screen a bit up there we go so here guys we're going to go into source and the first thing we're going to do is hit command j and you're going to see your terminal pop up now here what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say npm start to spin up the app now i think i have another app running so i'm going to go ahead and do y and that should go ahead and start up on a localhost so boom boom boom one second now oh nice gaming map says hey i listen to that it's good right lofi coders on spotify it's nice dude um and now the app is up and running so let's go back to our stuff go here and let's go to our localhost 3002 for me for you guys it'll be 3000 if you're not running anything and here we go so this is like a little bit different from the correct react app that we're used to right and you can see that this is actually using redux to power the state management here so everything that we pretty much have inside of here hey what's up keenan good to see you again dude um yeah nice to see nice to see some locals in the house nice um okay so also please stop smiling in the chat guys okay so you can see pretty much here i if i add stuff and remove it it's pretty much getting updated but not by the typical state it's actually being managed by redux so redux is essentially like a data layer around the app but it's like the production level data layer okay so it's the thing which is gonna it's used in a lot of professional environments and we're gonna show you guys how to do all of that today uh and you can also add different amounts let's go ahead and say if we add in 20 so you can add amount at asynchronous so you see there's a little delay before it gets added which is kind of cool we just hit over 500 people as well watching so what's up guys uh if you guys just joined in we're going to be building the discord clone so get excited for that it's real time everything is supported it supports google authentication we're going to be doing all of that in today's build so and we're building redux so awesome stuff so all you need to do was get that up and running um somebody said so why are you using redux because redux if you're learning react then i would say you need redux okay like redux is going to be one of those skills where you pretty much go ahead and and take yourself from becoming a like someone who might get the job to to pretty much you you need redux to get those you know to get those good paying jobs okay okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and clean this up a bit so we're going to go ahead remove app.test.js logo and set up test.js so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of those boom they're gone and then we go to features and i'm going to keep some of this stuff i'm going to rename this to counter dot css and this these are just dummy files okay so these are dummy files we can go into counter.js change this so it reports from counter.css now the only reason you need to do this guys is so that you don't get those errors but we're going to come back to this for like for like help in a bit so let's go over here and let's delete everything inside of app.js so everything inside is the header tags and then we're going to say h2 let's just say h1 let's make this thing big say h1 and then here we're going to say let's build oops let's build a discord clone boom i'll make that a little bit bigger for you guys there we go let's build a discord clone also if you guys can see that let me know okay so i'm going to save that and you can see it's still freaking out because there's logo up here so we're going to get rid of that now also just before you pretty much go ahead and okay so this actually i want to quickly address this question right so somebody says sanga i'm passing for a depression where i try to work hard in coding but every time i try to write my own app i get so frustrated that i leave it and complete it how do i get rid of it i just like dude debugging it coding is never a straight line okay it's never a straight line you're always going to become into places or like situations where you get stuck and i mean like not stuck for like five minutes or ten minutes you get stuck for hours sometimes i've been stuck for a week before working on projects right on like one feature inside of an app so it is a normal thing and in those experiences is where you will learn now if you guys agree with me let us know you let me know your stories in the comments right now so if you've had a debugging nightmare or experience go ahead and check that out okay um anka thank you so much for the donation he says um so is it necessary to jump into back in sunny it's not necessary but i i mean depends what you want to go into but in this case firebase is going to handle our back end for us so with that said let's go back to our code so here now what we're going to do is get rid of counter and then if we go back to our app it says let's build a discord clone okay so what i'm going to do is i know you guys actually like it when i do it like this boom boom there we go and you guys can see both at the same time so let's build a discord clone then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change this to a lowercase a because this is actually the bem naming convention yep so bem naming convention so it's the way we name classes to be scalable maintainable quite easy to understand um okay and oh priyanchu what's up dude nice he is a 13 year old badass inside of our course uh make sure you make sure you guys go ahead and follow him so then we're gonna go to app.css and delete everything inside of app.css so we're going to go ahead and get rid of that let me make this a bit smaller for you guys and then let's go ahead and oh i love this comment thank you dude you're my inspiration to become a web developer thank you so much dude really really really appreciate that um right so let's go ahead and go back into index.css and then here guys you see this little annoying bit of space over here um so this space over here right so you see that little top gap it's got like a imaginary sort of like margin that's being added there right to get rid of that we're going to go ahead and say my um all so asterix and we're going to say margin zero save it and the kill says damn the badass is here what's up um then let's go ahead and now you can see it this is where we want to start from okay and um yes graph icon uh you guys can go ahead and read this comment yourself but it pretty much is saying like if i don't if i copy some snippets is it okay yes it's okay trust me like keep doing it just keep working hard you get pattern recognition you'll get sort of up to date with things and just just don't quit dude just keep on going keep the energy high and and and things are going to be really tricky amberly so kazi's girlfriend she dropped a really really good point today on her on her instagram and her youtube actually she's got really awesome youtube make sure you go check it out it's sugar shaw and what she said is um discipline is actually what pushes you past the point where your body doesn't want to do any do that thing anymore motivation is kind of high for everyone in the beginning right we're all it finds it very easy to jump into coding but your discipline is what's going to be the thing that counts and when you get into those debugging situations where things get really really like hard and and get tiring and sort of like you're sitting there for the hours and the sort of like pain to quit comes in that's where you you have to have some discipline and that's what's going to get you to build awesome apps like today and let's jump back in so with that said we're going to go ahead and now we have our starting point okay so with that done we don't actually need to do anything more at this point what i'm gonna do now is inside of app.js we're gonna build two portions of the app first okay so let's go back to our final build over here and now you can see in this build right we have two main sections okay we have the i'm going to go ahead and move my drawing tools um oh this is a good point actually jennifer says i'm in a code camp and everyone was super impressed by twitter knowing i did from your quick look oh god twitter clone video okay uh and that's what i hear all the time like people spend thousands on coding bootcamps okay and it's crazy because like i mean like uh i don't know man like i like we you can do this stuff and we pretty much that's why that's why i build these clones you guys can go ahead and get the value for free and if you want to go ahead and take you to our next level and learn how to make a serious like income with this that's where we offer our course profit with javascript so all that stuff all that good stuff is in the description okay so make sure also make sure before we get started go ahead and sign up to our free training so completely free okay what are you doing sign up to that let's go back okay so here the first thing we have is i'm going to go ahead and freeze the app okay and graph icon it is okay to listen to music dude i listen to music when i code but anything without lyrics so you see we have two sections over here okay we have one section over here and we have one section over here okay that's a bit better so we have the first section so i'm gonna go ahead and just draw on this so this first section we're going to call it the sidebar component okay oops let me make this a bit smaller this section is going to be called the sidebar component and this section is going to be called the chat component right so we have two components here and then we're going to break everything down into smaller sub components so obviously you've got things like the oops you've got things like the the uh channel component we're gonna have the chat component uh we're gonna have the input component things like that right all of this is going to be separate components because in react we like to use components everything is component based okay so with that said we have the sidebar and the chat okay so what i like to do as if you haven't seen my builds before is i like to use comments to sort of mask it out okay so the first thing i'm going to do is say sidebar here and the second one i'm going to go ahead and say chat and this is just comments so this is nonfunctional code but it's pretty much where i want the component to be so the first thing we're going to do is build out this sidebar so here i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar and of course my code is going to freak out because there is no sidebar at the moment that's defined okay so it's helping us out here by telling us this so what we're going to do is go ahead and do command b to open up our side and then here i actually want you guys to do another clean up step okay so you see right now it says features counter because in the demo app what they did is they actually went ahead and and put everything into our into a folder called features but what i want you to do is actually go ahead and move this outside okay so move this outside go ahead and delete the counter folder and then i want you to grab the counter to the counter slice and pretty much put that into the features folder so i just want one folder called features with those three things inside of it and we'll come back to that afterwards but that will make life a lot easier okay um so yeah i love react but i don't like css or designing part what should i do maybe consider a backend development if you don't like the styling i used to hate css dude and it was only until i did things like flexbox froggy and i just gave it a little bit of effort and you know some more drive behind it that i actually start to get good at and when you get good at it things actually start to look really nice and it becomes fun so don't quit dude that's my advice um okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go in so here and i'm going to create a sidebar dot js component okay now i'm going to be using snippets here so if you haven't got the snippets i'm going to use go to the extensions in vs code and go ahead and type in es7 and it will be the first one so this one right here so this is es7 react redux all those things snippets and this allows you to write code really fast by using shortcuts so now i'm going to say rfce boom and we've created a functional component okay now here i'm going to go ahead and say import import sidebar sidebar.css like this okay and then i'm going to go to the div i'm going to say class name equals sidebar like this and then this i'm going to do h2 saying i am the sidebar okay now obviously we need to create the css file so i'm going to go ahead and create that right now so i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar dot css just like that we have our css file go back here and we can pretty much go ahead and go back to our app now and import it so here a little trick for you guys you can go ahead and um i see loads of people actually saying um i got a job thanks to you guys if you can show me proof of that dude i would really appreciate it because we're on a mission to get 5 000 developers jobs by the end of the year so yeah it's big and we're getting there we're getting there loads of people have got jobs and i'm starting to get used to hearing about people getting jobs from our tutorials so that's dope and i love that but we're gonna go back now and yeah if you could just send me on my instagram that would be awesome and i can add you to the counter that we have running okay now to a little shortcut for you guys if you go to the end of the component and hit control spacebar it says auto import and boom it imports it at the top otherwise you just have to write that out by yourself and then yeah now it says there is no such file such as counter slice okay now this is because we we changed the photo directory so you see these things right here so what we need to do is go into the app folder go into store and here we got rid of the counter right so we need to just go ahead and get rid of that and that's it and then it'll work because we just got the photo directory messed up okay also thank you so much for the kind um kind words uh rohan gupta so if you if anyone has signed up to training go ahead and uh you can pretty much sign up as many times as you want afterwards even so you can go ahead and i'll say watch this live first maybe and then go ahead and watch that one so that would be really really handy for you guys and it's completely free link is in the description check it out okay um also guys i like to code with a bit of music i don't know about you guys so let me know if this is distracting for you okay and if you haven't already smash the thumbs up button because you know we're gonna hit a thousand likes today i know it i feel it the energy is good so let me know if this is distracting for you guys if it is i'll turn it off but i kind of like it okay um okay so let's go ahead and do this so let's build a discord clone on the sidebar so now you can see it comes through okay so at the top uh i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna get rid of this so now we just have the sidebar in okay so this is where we always get this sort of mixed opinions on the music in the background okay bonjour tech what's up dude uh yes this will be available later thank you marin um for asking uh can i dm on twitter i'm not on twitter at the moment actually i'm not active on twitter anyway so go ahead and check it out on uh go ahead and message me on instagram so my instagram is down here gonna go check out and follow me uh yeah if it's too distracting i'll tell you but yeah let's go ahead and get started so i'm the sidebar okay the next one i'm gonna do is the chat okay but for now what we can do is we can actually go ahead and just build out the sidebar first okay so here we go to sidebar dot js what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna first build out the top section okay so all i'm gonna do is actually gonna put this over here right so there we go so what i'm gonna do now is i'm going to build out this top section so let me go ahead and remove all that stuff boom ismail says play some six nine i think that will be distracting dude yeah um so there we go we've got this over here right on a beautiful girlfriend she goes it's not distracting it's nice i really like it see you guys be like my girlfriend there you go all right so we got uh we've got the sidebar here and then at the top what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a div so i'm going to say div and there's actually a trick i'll show you in a sec for emma okay oh i love this comment faisal says sonny you're helping thousands of learners i appreciate that dude i really really really like that uh hearing stuff like that so thank you so much dude um so now what we're going to do is i'm going to say div dot sidebar underscore underscore top and i'm going to hit enter and then you can see it creates a div now we can also do the same thing by without actually writing divs you can say sidebar on this one's called top and then boom it creates a div so that's a nice little trick if you don't actually know that trick so yeah check that one out but here we're gonna have a h3 and we're just gonna say the the discord room is clever programmer because that's a nice room to have and then here what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually need that little icon so i need this icon right here okay now if you haven't already used ataba yes dude he said sunny the first blog is published nice um okay so also let's go ahead and one second guys okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and install material ui because we have a bunch of icons throughout the app so we have icons here we have icons here here we have loads of different icons around the application and what we can do is go ahead and install material to get started with that so i'm going to say material ui.com and then calvin commander says music is okay i got into an argument with my girlfriend because she wanted me to stop playing music but i didn't want to oh man you cracked me up dude nice so here what you want to do is do npm install material ui core so let's just go ahead and grab it and i'm going to do command j and what i like to do is actually open up a second terminal so i'm going to click plus and then here we can go ahead and just paste it so npm install material ui core and make sure you're in the right folder okay so right now we are so let's go ahead and do that and that will install the core now the core is good but you need the core and the icons because we want to have the icons like i said right but you need the court in order to have the icons i hope that made sense um but yeah you're going to go to the search bar type in icons click this and then you want to go down and here it says npm install material ui icons so now what you want to do down here is go ahead paste like that and then install the icons as well that will make it a lot more um that will actually go ahead and install all of the icon set into our app so then what you want to do is go here to this lovely bit where it says you can search the full list of these icons click that wait you can't we can't see your screen you can see my screen right guys go ahead and let me know if you can see my screen i'm sure you can see my screen right now um okay but what you want to do now is you want to go down here and i was doing it in the terminal down here guys by the way if you didn't see that so that's why i copied out the terminal commands yeah so here now inside of here so let's say we want it a plus icon okay let's type in plus and you can see i get like an ad right and then you see it actually gives me the import code for that so that's going to be really really handy because then you can go ahead and just use it inside of your app okay so if you're wondering how i found all the icons that's how i find them okay so uh the greatest ever hey what's up dude good to see you here man i love you i love your instagram account it's always like full of positivity dude i like that right so the first thing we're going to do is now we're going to jump back in so let's go to our code i need this little carrot icon and the carrot icon is called the expand more icon okay so i'm going to go ahead and import that so here i'm going to go ahead and say import expand more icon go down here and do this like so and then now we should see that little icon pop in so you know you see now i get here okay now what you can see is um uh also dix or dix ruby um ac says emmet is is available only in html files so you do need to actually run an additional setting uh what i can do is i can show you that right now okay um oh nice dude i just read the greatest difference come on so you're gonna press command and comma no oh oh come on comma here's commander commands you only click on vs code do command comma and it'll bring up your settings okay then what you want to do is you want to type in emmet and then you want to click on include languages okay and what i do is i go ahead and add this one so you see you either an item called javascript and the value is javascript react that's how you get emit on this okay so do that going back to the code let's go ahead and check this out so sidebar now we've got the expand more icon okay dope next thing we're going to do is the uh we're going to style this in a second but the next one i'm going to do is actually add the channels okay so the channels is going to be actually just style this one as we do it so let's go ahead and do sidebar.css so down here what i'm going to now have so for the sidebar i'm going to say sidebar and then this i'm going to have to do display flex it's going to be display flex it's going to have a flex direction of column because everything's going to be stacked upon each other and then the entire sort of sidebar should take up 25 so the next thing i'll explain this after but you see how this one takes up pretty much 25 so this takes up 25 this right here and this takes up 75 okay so in order to do that we set the app to display flex and then we say that this is 0.25 uh oh god damn it no 0.25 and this is flex of 0.75 that's how you get that kind of nice spacing the responsive spacing between the two okay so we're gonna just get rid of that and then let's go here we're gonna say flex 0.25 and you need to actually go ahead and do display flex on the app.js but we'll do that in a sec okay we're going to go ahead type in height of 100 view height and i'm going to say the background color and i found a very nice gray which is the discord gray so i'm going to say background color is this little hex right so you guys can copy that hex if you want it now if we go back to our redux app you can see the whole background color change because right now that's the only component and it's taking up 100 view height okay so with that done hey sunny watching sonny from florida nice dude you built community developers around the world i appreciate that and love the positivity dude um nice and glad to see you okay so now what we're going to do is go to sidebar top so i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar underscore let's go top bam in for the win then we're going to go ahead and say display flex i'm going to copy a snippet here and explain it so i'm going to say display flex justify content space between align items and you see what happened is i'm zoomed in right now there we go if i zoom out um space between so if i get rid of that it's next to it you see the carrot is next to it and if i do that it spaces out and i'm going to say align the item centrally so if i get rid of that everything's kind of uncentered it's a very subtle change but you won't see it but it does make a difference and then you want to do padding of 20 pixels if i get rid of that you see it adds a nice bit of padding background color again we're changing that now but i like to have it just on top but you don't actually need to have it there color white so obviously the color of the text is white and then the border bottom to add that nice little border right now of course we don't need the h1 which saying i am as a i am a sidebar because we already know it's a sidebar so we can go ahead and get rid of that and then you go let me get this so it's starting to look a little bit nicer than where it was so let's go back to sidebar here and now what we're going to do is command j to hide the terminal we're going to go ahead and say div sidebar underscore underscore channels so this is where all the channels are going to be okay so we're going to have the next section now that we're working on so here what i'm going to do is i'm going to say div and i'm going to say sidebar channels header okay and inside the header i'm going to have a div which is the sidebar header so i'm going to say sidebar header and this one is going to be the bit here so we've got text channels and a little plus icon okay so first thing is we have a little carrot icon so save that with the carrot and then what we're going to do is we're going to create a h4 i'm going to say text channels like this okay now you can see it pops in here so you see it popped in there and then what we're going to oh god why is that so and that's not far out okay then what we're going to do is we're going to go and head and add an ad icon all right so it's called an ad i'm going to get rid of the on click we don't need that yeah so you can see it's a class name sidebar add channel right reason why it's adjust because this button is going to actually allow us to add channels so if we go back into our app you can actually go ahead and see we can actually add channels in this app i forgot to show you so if we click this it says enter a new channel name so i'll say yo as you know go ahead and say react devs make it a little bit more less dj boom react devs look at that guys let me say who's popped who's pumped boom you can see it works okay so everything works on that and it's really really clean okay so um yum now what's up good to see you in here um she goes i really love this live stream glad glad you like it okay so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and style this text channels because right now it looks ugly okay add icon i'm going to go ahead and import this so the add icon let's go ahead and first import that in so add icon boom we got the ad icon in let's go ahead and start this up so sidebar.css and the first thing i'm going to do is go ahead and say dot sidebar underscore underscore channels and then i'm going to say flex1 because i want the middle bit to take up the most room okay so that'll make sense afterwards as to what we're doing there but i want the actual channel sections i want this to take up the most room okay and that that's why these get pushed to the bottom in the end result so after we do that what i'm going to say is firstly i want to do sidebar add channel i want to make it a cursor point us that way when i hover over this it becomes a little finger icon you see that so it becomes a little finger icon um that's always nice to have and then we're gonna say when i hover over it i want it to become white as well so this gives it an element of uh so you see that now we get that nice little hover over white effect okay um oh we've got sami hey he actually landed a sixfigure job in new york but he goes hi sunny my new job is going well i just came here to say thank you as i received my first paycheck that's sick dude that is awesome i've been in constant contact with amanat as we share knowledge but amanda is insane dude i work with amnap every day he goes thanks and let's go dude that is awesome man that is so so cool and i think that's an awesome message for everyone here as well because it just goes to show that it's possible and it it's not it's not fake you know like so that's dope dude and everyone go ahead and smash thumbs up button and drop some love for some meat okay that's dope dude that is that is awesome to hear that okay now we're almost we're at 600 likes right now i think we can get to a thousand today guys let's go ahead and push this video out to as many people as we can the next thing we're going to do is style the header section so channels header so i'm going to go ahead and add this snippet and so we say sidebar channels header display flex justify content space between okay justify align item center padding 10 pixels background color black and then we've got the color gray okay that makes it pretty nice then what i'm going to do is um somebody said redux as it's using no no redux is just like the professional version of react context hey but just think of it that way for now okay but then what we're going to do is we're going to go to the sidebar header section that's why these two aren't inline because they're in a div and we're going to go ahead and say display flex and the line item center and you can see now we can see some similarities okay so obviously this is just because it's only using this much but you can see if we had it at that same size it's starting to look similar okay and remember we try and build our absolutely responsive you see that so it's quite a responsive design now with that said what we're going to do next is we're going to go actually go back to sidebar.js so over here and then we are going to go ahead and check out we're gonna go ahead and actually add in the channels list okay so channels list being all of this stuff here right so the channels list i'm gonna go ahead and create div so underneath the current div and i'm going to say sidebar underscore channels list okay now inside the channels list i'm going to create a component called sidebar channel okay so i want you want each of these to be a component itself and this one i'm going to say so i'm going to create a component called sidebar channel sidebar channel like this okay and also one day dude if we do in person events i would love to see you there to me that'd be dope man it'd be lovely to meet like everyone on the uh who's actually gone ahead and landed jobs from this stuff that would be awesome okay so here let's go ahead and do cyber challenge it's gonna freak out because we haven't got that component so let's go ahead and create it so here we say sidebar channel dot js boom and then we're gonna say rfce there we go and then i'm gonna say import sidebar channel.css this is the setup that we do every time i'm going to say class name of sidebar channel because this is just a bem naming convention we always want to be consistent now the sidebar channel is going to take three things okay eventually it'll take like an id as well but in the beginning right now it's going to go ahead and take um so right now we're just going to put this in right now so we're going to say id it's going to take a channel uh id in the channel okay but for now i'm just going to go ahead and make it very simple okay so i'm just going to say h3 and um let me go into the sidebar and have a look so we've got there we're going to have a div and we're going to have a h4 and the inside of this h4 i'm going to span a hashtag in so i'm going to say spam a hashtag and this is going to have a class name of sidebar channel hash so we can style that layer and then after that i'm going to say whatever the channel name is so in this case let's just call it youtube by default so it's going to be stuck on youtube okay and then let's go ahead and import this i'm going to click on sidebar channel do control spacebar boom auto import nice little trick now it says cannot resolve the sidebar css so if we go back um uh then we go back and we say sidebar channel dot css and then you see it gets rid of the error okay so works and then what we're going to do is we're going to just test this out now so let's go back to um our div and then let's just say imagine we just done this right like four times and you see it's actually at the bottom right now but now this is happening because we're making this use up as much possible space as it can now i'm gonna go back to sidebar and right now sidebar channels oh oops okay so make sure when you add this in you add it inside the sidebar channels div okay so you want it inside of the sidebar channels div otherwise you're going to get pushed to the bottom but you guys can see what flex one did in a column view okay so it pushed everything down to the bottom and that made it very very clean okay so oh this is pretty good question actually let's go ahead and check this one out so it says uh free code camp developer says sonny what's your take on redux i've read two books on it and used it in several projects but i really don't like it do you like it or think it's overly complicated i think it's heavy so i think it's quite a heavy uh state management tool but the new version of redux so that with hooks and everything like what we're going to use today is actually so damn clean so to answer this question in a nutshell go ahead and watch today's video see how we build everything with the new kind of modern redux and and you can go ahead and see but i think it would be uh i i understand the sort of heaviness of it but in the production environment it's going to be super handy and powerful so i wouldn't rule it out so sidebar channels list okay so then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and style the sidebar channel so inside of sidebar channel oops sidebar.css so i'm gonna go to sidebar channel and i'm going to go to sidebar channel.css i'm just going to pop this underneath so now we've got the sidebar channel css underneath and the code at the top that's a nice way of doing it sometimes guys um it'll make your code a lot easier to read sometimes okay so the first thing i want to do is i want to make it so when i hover over the text it changes color so i'm going to go ahead and do sidebar when i hover over the sidebar channel div so this one it's going to target the h4 element inside so the text and change the color to white and the background color should become light hey look at that this lovely kind of hovering functionality okay and then i'm going to go down and then i'm going to target the h4 so i'm going to say inside the sidebar channel the h4 element which is the text i'm going to say display flex because we've got a hashtag in there and i'm going to say padding left of 15 pixels align the item centrally background color make the text gray so you see that we get a nice little gray and the cursor should be a pointer so we get that little finger when we hover over it because it's always nice to get that okay um so melissa says i fill you with redux you follow the same path so yes that's exactly why i go ahead and teach you guys react context api first because it's the same pattern okay um what is awesome about these tutorials is that sunny uh always leaves some part of the projects you can make on your own i add extra functionality 100 and i really really think you should do that you should add extra functionality on top of it that will help you out and it will just make you different from everyone else okay um oh nice he's from watching it from birmingham nice dude based in london is awesome awesome okay um then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go down and i'm gonna style that little hashtag so boom and then i'm gonna say uh font size so i want the hashtag to be a little bit bigger so i'm going to say 30 pixels and i want to have some padding of 8 pixels here so as soon as we do that look at that immediate change let's immediately get a nicer user experience and now you can see it's looking a lot more like our actual app okay so this is very very clean we're actually moving very quick right now so this is good stuff the next thing we're going to do is i'm going to make it so that obviously in react you can have props okay so what we're going to do is we're actually going to pass in the goal here would be to pass in something but for now we're going to keep it as fixed channels and then we're going to when we build out the back end we're going to go ahead and change that up so this will be like the finished product where we can add our channels in here and i can basically say like a channel called abc and you can see like it will actually populate offer firebase i'm into our project okay um hey thank you so much brian he says something you're a legend can't believe that you are human making all these clowns super fast my brain can't take so many clones i'll keep on going mr robot hey i love that show thank you dude appreciate that all right so um and also guys if you're enjoying the build so far please smash the thumbs up button helps this video reach a lot more people and it helps you know bring more value to everyone in the world so that's good stuff now let's carry on guys we've got the sidebar channel going strong so we can now move back to the sidebar and carry on so the next part guys is the bottom part so down here you see where we have the voice connected and we have the actual user right here okay now i didn't actually realize it's stacked up like that that's pretty dope so now you see it kind of like it's very responsive but you see at the bottom we've got that nice little sort of user profile section and we've got the voice connected obviously this is not actually connected to anything but it's a ui okay um also daniel cartier said don't worry if if people like league stuff but the main thing is is that you don't get the community aspect that you would get in in proper javascript so you have to join the course to get the networking opportunity okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and we're going to move outside of this div so outside of this sidebar channels div and we're going to go ahead and create the sidebar voice which is going to be responsible for this part so i'm going to go ahead and say div with a sidebar i'm just going to score voice right now inside of here what i want to do is i'm going to actually import a uh this icon right here so this this icon right here is actually called a signal cellular alt icon okay and it has a class name and we're going to give it a class in the sidebar underscore underscore voice icon and i'm going to give a font size of large yeah um thank you so much dude as well uh for the donation awesome okay now what i'm gonna do is um also guys uh i'm actually gonna go ahead and don't go ahead and spam guys with with some bad stuff because yeah um so we actually want to go ahead and import that icon so what i'm gonna do is pull that in from the top so there we go signal cellular oh icon and then what we're going to do is then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and go down here and create um where is it where are we going yeah i'm going to create a div sorry so i'm going to say dev dot um voice info voice info there we go oh sorry it should be sidebar i'll just go underscore voice info and then what we're gonna do is hey jacob says this is freaking sick nice dude um we're gonna go ahead and do a h3 so the h3 inside is going to say voice connected so voice connected and then i'm going to go here and i'm going to say p i'm just going to stream oops my emmit didn't kick in in time so what happens when you code too fast guys god dammit okay then we're gonna go ahead and do that so now if we look at our app we should see it looks it's pretty ugly down here but you know we get there so i'm gonna go ahead and scroll the screen up a tiny bit there we go so you can see it says voice connected and stream at the bottom of the page now we're going to get that up to the top and i'll show you guys how we're going to do that so let me go ahead and center it there we go so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and say create another div chord sidebar sidebar underscore underscore voice icons like this okay and then here i'm going to have two icons one called info outlined icon and one called call icon these are going to resemble these two right here so these two icons right here so i'm going to go ahead and pop them in and i need to do the appropriate import for it so it's the core icon and info outlined so these two up here so these two okay then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and go down here to uh we're actually gonna start this right now because it looks crap right now okay so it doesn't look nice right now so i'm gonna go here and again what i like to do is drop the sidebar css underneath because that way you can see both pieces of code okay and then we're going to go here and i'm going to carry on styling it so cyborg.css uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to say dot side so sidebar voice i'm gonna say display flex position relative actually we don't need that yeah we say bottom no we don't need that either say justify content space between yep and then we're going to go ahead and say an iron item center and then we're going to go ahead and say color gray and i'm also going to give a background color padding and a border top so boom add that in and you can see it's all getting added at the bottom right so it's all down here right now um we will fix that though we will get that looking pretty clean so the next thing i'm going to do is target the voice info so this one right here okay then we're gonna go ahead and say boom voice info like so save it and you can see now it pulls everything to the left because it's saying voice info flex 1 which means that what it's actually doing guys it's actually saying that this should take up the majority of the space which is why it's positioned itself like that because flex 1 is saying like you know use as much space as you possibly can right okay and then we're going to say is the voice icon should be green because that's why it will look much cleaner that way so that looks a lot better doing it like that um and then we're going to go ahead and say voice info and target the h3 icon inside uh and i'm gonna make that green as well so you can see the little things the little things right uh priyanka says by the way those lights are killing me i know look they actually guys they respond when i talk like hey that's that's pretty cool yeah my girlfriend got him uh she's awesome so let's go ahead and carry on so i'm gonna target the p tag next i'm gonna make the p tag smaller so i'm gonna go ahead and say voice info target the p tag inside and say font size smaller so now we can actually go ahead and see down here um i'm going to say voice stream you see now that we just target the p tag so it's very small very neat okay and then we've got those two icons on the right yeah so we've got the two icons on the right so what i'm going to do now is material ui actually adds the class itself so now if i go ahead and say target the voice icons div so you can see at the top the voice icons this one voice icons and then i'm going to say material ui svg dash root that's basically the class that material ui gives us we're going to basically give that a padding of 10 pixels now i want you guys to pay attention to the bottom bit over here because that's where the magic is going to happen so you guys might be able to see this might not be able to but let me go ahead and pop it there as soon as i hit save boom just made it a little bit nicer okay and with that done we actually have the bottom bit done right so that bottom bits done very nicely now what we can do is we can go back to the um and guys if you're enjoying this and you haven't already go ahead and hit the thumbs up button because this speed right now is awesome and the energy today is is insane um uh oh sake i'm sorry dude uh because that link was of an offer let a screenshot no on insta so i shared you oh so sorry dude i thought that was uh because whenever people share g like google drive links uh we have a bot that sort of swipes it off so it's probably the bot that's taking it off but um yeah damn it dude sorry about that um just go ahead and drop a link again then people can see it um yeah now what we can go ahead and do is actually continue building out the final bit um which is at the bottom so we've got the sidebar profile right so the profile right now is the final piece here so this is where we have like sunny sangha and then we have like all your stuff being pulled through so let's go back down here let's go ahead and go out of this div and i'm going to go out of this div here this one let me go ahead and double check let's go ahead and close the css file and i like to click on this and it should show me that that's the div for sidebar voice so it's out of that div there we go we're gonna say div and then we can say sidebar underscore underscore profile boom and then uh yeah sorry about that second but um yeah just go ahead and share it again and that'll be awesome uh so then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and actually pull in uh a avatar component okay avatar and avatar component so i actually imported that at the top here and that's actually a course that's not an icon you can actually pass that thing like pictures and things like that okay so the avatar should pop in so you see at the bottom we have a little avatar that's there so we have the little avatar popping up right then what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and say there's going to have a div inside of it and this is going to have a sidebar profile info and inside that info we're gonna have a h3 tag which has a the user's name so in this case let's just do sunny sanger let's just do my instagram handle so sssango if you're not following me what are you doing go ahead and follow my instagram thank you nice you gotta plug yourself you know um and then we're gonna go ahead and do a p tag and this will be like the id okay so for now i'm gonna say um uh this is my id okay and then you can go ahead and see at the bottom and it's getting cut off a tiny bit right now but you see this is my id at the bottom over there okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and after that we're going to have a div so it's a sidebar underscore just called profile icons profile icons boom and then we're going to go ahead and add three icons right now so these are the icons that you guys are noticing over here so these three icons all right so these three sorry it's frozen so these three over here that's what we're gonna add over there um jacob says you guys i got so cool i'll pay you if i had money don't worry dude just all we ask is just smash the thumbs up button that's it get this video out to as many people as we can okay and and that will be that's all i can ask for okay also yeah guys we hit 800 000 subscribers it's just insane nice insane right so next we're gonna go ahead and import the three icons so let's go ahead and pop them in here mic icon head to icon settings icon uh so i'm gonna go up to the top and pull them in so my icon headset and sayings boom then um then what we're going to go ahead and do is we should see them so react readers now we've got the three things over here okay so we've got this and we're just going to start it now okay um i always find it funny when people say the lights are disturbing you guys if that's disturbing you like improve your focus come on man shouldn't be looking down here you should be looking over there over there you know it's hard to figure out which way yeah um let's go ahead and uh we're going to style it now okay so sidebar i'm going to pull up the sidebar css i'm going to drag it down here so we split the screen in half and off and then i'm going to go ahead and target a few things now so let's go ahead and do profile info so what i'm actually going to do is i want to reuse the styles that i did for the voice right so you see the voice stuff over here so let's go ahead and bring it back um somebody says funny story when i'm doing programs in react while i'm speaking to myself i speak in a british accent that's so jokes um i know right the greatest is people just look at the weirdest things to critique i know dude honestly focus on the screen all right so now what we're going to do is uh where we had the voice the voice div over here what i can do is i just can just write comma and i can target the sidebar profile as well because i just want to reuse those styles right so sidebar as soon as i do that you'll see look at that it reuses it for that so so that's actually really handy it's a very nice way of doing it right and then then what we're going to go ahead and do is go down here and i'm going to go ahead and say sidebar underscore unscore profile info profile info and then i'm going to go ahead and say flex 1 padding of 10 pixels and then you can see it pops it to the side again right i mean you could do the same thing that we did before with that and i'm going to pop in this snippet here so these are two more selectors that we're going to add in so cyber profile target the h3 make it white that made the name tag white and then they i love this comment i got to shout out david jonathan goes huh that's true they don't want to pick a fight with marvin over the lights it's great honestly guys you want to pick a fight with her go for it i'd rather not today this is this is already enough all right then we're gonna go ahead and um yeah that's actually that's actually that done so that's pretty pretty sick guys so let's go ahead and we haven't had this in a while yeah i don't know i'm not a fan of the the the blowhorn anymore you know i like the music instead um so what we're going to do now is do all right then we're going to do nice we actually have this pretty much done so look at that it's looking pretty good and what we can do is i can actually go ahead and load it up with an image so let's go ahead and i'm going to quickly find an image um there's nothing wrong with being alone by the way so i see people saying priyanka why are you saying are you going to be alone it's fine to be alone because he's having a good time he's on vacation right now it's time to i'm on vacation you know sorry it's so good so avatar here we're going to say source i'm going to basically pop in an image of me so this is on google images and then boom see my my image just popped in down here the smart developer right and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and build out the chat part now okay so we're done with the sidebar for now we'll come back to this in a bit let's go ahead and create the chat component so let's go into app.js and you see here we've got we can get rid of that comment and now we're going to build out the chat okay so here i'm going to say chat like this and first thing we're going to do is actually apply some stars to app.js okay so i'm going to go into app.css and in here what i'm going to do is i'm actually just what i need to do is say app display flex and this is because remember i applied that earlier rule where i said 0.25 right 0.25 is where uh it's taking up 25 on the screen and we want the chat to take up so now look at that ooh we're getting there okay we're getting there okay so the next one uh oh thank you dude saket says really want to talk asia about the job i'll let him know dude honestly he knows about all these jobs as well which is awesome i don't know thank you both literally smash thumbs up that's it that's all we ask dude and get this video out to more people so we can help more people get those jobs um so save it go back i'm going to create a chat.js so chat.js boom and i'm gonna say rfce and then we get the chat icon then here i'm gonna say chat component sorry class name equals i'll say chat and also guys if you're enjoying this right now shoot an instagram story tag me in it down here and go ahead and post it on instagram because i'd love to see you guys love to see who's watching and it's always nice to go ahead and engage with you a lot so yeah let's go back and i'm going to go ahead and say import import um thank you so much dude for a donation he goes i was working in deloitte and i got laid off i don't react but not getting confidence to give an interview selfconfidence is negative help me with advice dude continue building the clones it will build your confidence up join a community like profit with javascript so we have a link in the description or it's a cleverprogrammer.com.pwj if you want to check it out and we pretty much help you we hold your hand the entire way uh but there's a free training in the description as well so the clones free training in your description make sure you join all of that and that will help bring up your confidence um yeah uh so let's go ahead and somebody said maybe watch your first video on youtube yeah go ahead and subscribe to my youtube channel say sango um so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and finish off the import so here i'm gonna say got four slash chat dot css go ahead and create a chat css so chat dot css go back and then here now what we want to do is here i'm just going to say h2 saying i am the chat screen okay let's go ahead and do that and then we're going to app.js go back here we need to import so i'm going to do control spacebar auto import and it pops in up here and we have it so it says i am the chat screen now okay so moving at a good speed guys uh let me know if you're enjoying this in the comments right now um i'm gonna have a quick war break if you guys need to right now have a quick water break um just stand up you know stretch out okay you know like it always kind of helps to have maybe a coffee or something so like you just kind of like stand up stretch out if you need to make sure you have water everyone always says to drink so much water like dude i couldn't live without water so i mean so many people like they don't drink enough water okay now let's get rid of our comment so we have these two components okay um preentry we actually set up the template in redux so yes we will be building our redux in a sec so now what we're gonna do is go to chat.js and we're going to go ahead and build out some stuff here so the first thing i want to do is build up the chat header so the chat header is this part right here so this section over here so you'll notice once i'm inside of a channel for example here you see this like this kind of header is what we want to build right now and then oh i love this dude you will be just like me just carry on working dude and do not quit and anything's possible right so um then what we're gonna do is where it says i'm on the chat screen so now here i'm gonna go ahead and create a chat header component so let's go inside our chat and then in here i'm going to say chat header right so let's go ahead and create a chat header component so chat header.js boom and then here i'm going to say rfce like so come down here to div say class name equals chat header and then over here i'm going to say import chat header.css boom and then i'm going to create that file oops not like that let's say go ahead and do chat header dot css and then we have that up and running so that works and then here you can actually just go ahead and do yourself a sanity check say history i am the header go back to our chat dot js component and then here control spacebar auto import save and it's there i'm the header okay this is vs code anyone wondering so we can get rid of this one and we can say i'm the header so we know that's there now right so what we can do now is we can click into our chat header component and then here let's go ahead and build this out a little bit so we have two sections we have the chat header left and we have the chat header right so chat header left is this bit and the chat header right is all of this stuff okay so i'm gonna go ahead and uh create that now so i'm gonna say div uh chat header underscore left and i'm going to do another one so i'm going to say div uh chat header on the screen scroll right like so the chat header left is going to consist of a few things it's going to have h3 the h3 inside of it will be where we have the chat name so all of this stuff this is the h3 that we're talking about and here i'm going again what we did before i'm going to span i'm going to span with a class name of chat header hash so i can style it afterwards so what that did to make this very clear for you guys is you can see it like it spanned that okay so now we've got a hashtag and i can target this hashtag right now for the channel name so here again i'm going to do a test channel name so test channel name but what we'll do is we'll be using prop soon and that will actually go ahead and help you out um so let's go ahead and do that so you can see it says test channel name we'll start that in just a sec and then the right side what we're gonna have is firstly we're gonna have three icons so i'm gonna have pop them in here so i'm gonna have three icons notification icon the edit icon and so forth and i'm gonna go ahead and pop those in right now save and you should be able to see those three pop in okay so oops and then so then you can see these are the three icons here so we're gonna start that in a sec and then what i'm going to have is i'm going to have the search field so here i'm going to create a div for this i'm going to say chat header under squander source search like this and then here i'm going to have an input and this input it's all by the photo is type text so i'm going to say placeholder should just say search okay uh tommy gian yes this is good actually have you ever tried using dotmodule.css yes that's actually very good so that's a really good comment the only reason i didn't do it today is because people are used to using just the typical bam but that's really good dude um and i will be starting to use that i just didn't want to kind of overload everyone with redux and that because if you notice when you sort this up uh it actually by default does dot module so uh really good really good point okay now um we're gonna go ahead and do uh placeholder oops this is not right please hold a search like this and then we're going to go ahead and do a search rounded icon so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in here and obviously when we use that we're going to need to import it so search rounded icon just go ahead and import at the top save and you'll see there and then outside this div i'm going to go ahead and add two more icons so like such so these are going to be these two so now we have to import those as well oops so i'm going to go ahead and import those at the top over here like that and then we can see now we have everything we need now so i'm going to make this i'm going to make this sorry all of this nastiness look like this right so this is where the magic happens this is where all the sort of like it comes together it looks really really clean so what we're going to do first is i'm going to go ahead and do this because i think this helps you out a lot when i pop this underneath like this also we're nearly at 800 likes guys so come on let's keep pushing that number up if you're enjoying this and you haven't already smash the thumbs up button and it will help this video get out to as many people as it possibly can and that will help a lot more people get value from this video okay um so we're going to go here we're going to say chat header and i'm going to actually pop this up i love having this on the screen so i'm going to go ahead and delete the ima header you don't need to say that um so here i'm going to say chat header and then here i'm going to say display flex display flex and then i'm going to say justify content space between all right then i'm going to say align item center i'm going to say color is gray and i'm going to say padding of 10 pixels right so we can do that boom see it already starts to look a bit different then i'm going to target that hash remember so the hash that we talked about before um i'm going to go ahead and pop this in there so this is the hash uh this one over here so now the hashtag is a bit bigger now you can see that it changed it a bit so i need to target the h3 and i need to make it like fall into line with this so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go here and say chat header left so the left section which was this bit when i say display flex align the item centrally so the span tag as well save it and boom so the color is white but that's fine for now because i'm going to go ahead and make the background color of that actually changed to um something else so in a second i mean for now what i'll do is i'll comment this out so you can still see it okay but that will be why afterwards because here we want it to be white um and then in the chat header right so let's go ahead and target this we're going to say chat header right and then here i'm going to say display flex alignment center flex 0.5 justify content space between so this will actually go ahead and make it so that this takes up uh the rest of the remainder of the screen there okay so what i need to do now is actually go down to target the icons themselves so i'm going to go ahead and say chat header right target the material ui icons give them a padding of 5 pixels and make them a cursor pointer so you see when i hover over it now it's a pointer that's always nice as a user experience okay and then we're gonna go back and then we're gonna go ahead and make it so that when we hover over it it changes it to white okay so you'll give it a nice user experience right now you obviously you can't see it but if i was to make this red you guys can clearly see a visual indicator as to like when i do that okay so i'm going to make it white and then i'm going to change the background color after now for the search field to get it looking the way we need to first thing i'm going to do is go ahead and target the div i'm going to say display flex align the item centrally the color should be gray of the text background color should be a darker gray border radius three pixels so that way it's not like a set horrible border and then a padding of three pixels so do that and you see it becomes like this and then we're going to target the actual inner input right so we're going to go ahead and actually target the inner input background should be transparent the outline width should be zero uh outline which means that when i sort of you don't get that blue outline but if i get rid of this line and i go here get this horrible blue outline so that's what we don't want that's what that line of code does color white so the text is white border none so that way it just becomes this nice one big border okay then what we're going to do is we're going to go back to chat dot css and in here i'm going to go ahead and say chat display flex flex direction column and then i'm going to go ahead and say flex 0.75 because i want this to take up the remainder of the space and then i'm going to say background color should be of a darker gray so this is actually in chat.css if you guys are confused and then you can see it changes it to that so then i can go back to my chat header i can go to the left section uncomment out the white again so now you can see all the highlighting works as we wanted it to okay and then we go back to this chat dot css and then the final thing i'm going to do is make this actually a hundred view height so there we go that would be handy for later i'll explain where that comes into play in a bit um okay so dope we have the um thank you so much flick shot because uh it's 3am he'll be working this hot piece tomorrow morning you're like an angle in this angel in disguise thank uh for the beginner react developers appreciate that dude and as if anyone else is interested in watching afterwards remember it's going to be recorded okay see han says i don't know redux should i continue watching hell yes continue watching and it will make sense so don't worry um this is completely beginner friendly if you haven't used reacts before it's fine don't worry pattern recognition okay um somebody says why are you not using bootstrap trust me when you get into professional um environments bootstrap is not the way that you always want to go so learn how to do it and um yeah that will help you out uh goodnight apprenticeship um okay so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to the next section which is so it's actually starting to look very similar now okay we're gonna go ahead and create the chat so let's go into inside of our chat.js and we're gonna actually go ahead and first now right now we're going to go ahead here and we're going to say so we have the chat header done the next bit is we're going to have chat messages we're not going to build this out just yet we're going to build that after so chat messages and then we're going to go ahead and say chat input now the input is of course the bottom part so this input down here let's go ahead and build the input first and then we can go ahead and build the chat messages afterwards so for the input we're going to have the add circle icon we're gonna say it's a large size so i'm gonna go ahead and do that um oh awesome dude thank you so much for that donation uh can we have a medium clone of course we can have a medium clone okay um thank you so much to greg stevenson he still surprised me with how good he is explaining this stuff even to complete newbies appreciate that dude appreciate that a lot um okay no we're doing the back end as well so it's going to be all powered up um we're using firebase to do everything so and i'm using vs code kevin patel all right so now we're going to go ahead and inside of chat input i'm going to go add circle icon i'm going to remove this you guys can see it need to import add circle icon so let's go ahead and do that there we go and then down here i'm going to go ahead and say i'm going to create a form because i want to have it so i can submit the form get rid of the action because we don't want that and then in here i'm going to have an input field and this is going to be the one which says message youtube so here i'm just going to say placeholder as for now we're going to give it uh something basic and we're going to say message hashtag test channel ccr1 is over here message test channel okay and then we're going to go ahead and do button and the button type is submit so that way when we hit the enter key on the input field it will submit the button and here i'm actually going to say send message but we don't want to show this button so this button isn't actually visible so you see here we don't actually see the send message button but the functionality works when i hit enter right so there's a little trick we're going to do for that and i'll show you how to do that okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and say set a class name for this we're gonna go ahead and give this a class name so i'm gonna say um class name chat input button okay and then i'm gonna go and give underneath this form i'm going to go ahead and say uh chat underscore underscore input icons okay uh i love this one dexcode says hey papa react here saving live since appreciate that dude and any man any positive impact that's what that's what we're aiming for um so we're gonna have three icons here right these three icons are gonna be these three icons that you see in the bottom right um so let's go ahead and drop those in save it i need to import those because it's screaming at me right now let's go ahead and pop those in boom uh for getting one which is emoji this one save it and there you go so now obviously this doesn't look very nice i'm going to make this look like the finished product so let's open up our chat.css and let's drop it underneath like we like to do that and then what i'm going to do is we're going to target chat input so go here and then chat input has quite a few changes that we need to make so let's say chat underscore underscore input um like this input go down here and then what i'm going to say is i'm going to say color is light gray okay so the color is light gray display flex boom and everything goes into that then save align item center everything pulls into the center justify content space between and then you see everything should push apart and then we say padding of 15 pixels padding of 15 pixels hey check this out dude just got a nice donation from divash kumar thank you so much he says um lots and lots of cheers for the running project and thanks for making people grow their confidence on their learning appreciate that dude waiting for some challenging illustration sonny hey i will give you a quick illustration once we uh get to the trickier part okay but thank you so much for that donation awesome so with that done chat input is then panning 15 pixels now i'm going to go ahead and do border radius margin border top and a background color so i'm going to paste a snippet here boom save it and you see we get a nice little outline now i'm going to target the form so i'm going to go inside the form inside the input like so give it padding 15 pixels make the background transparent of the form uh border none outline width remember that little trick color white font size lodge save that you can see it starts to look a bit nicer we're not done just yet though we have to make the chat input form flex 1 so it takes up the majority of that container space if i do that you see it does this okay now the input we also want to make width 100 so we're gonna make it take up as much room as it can okay uh actually in this case let's not do that just yet uh for the send message so the actual input button i'm gonna do display none so we don't see the button because we don't want that button right here i'm going to say width let's just give it 100 pixels let's see if that works again yeah there we go width of 100 pixels and that works a little bit cleaner okay now um all right now what we're going to do is we're going to go to chat input form um we're going to go to flex 1 input icons material usi so now what i'm going to do is actually going to style the icons inside on the right give them a little bit more padding so let's go ahead and do that chat and chat input icons target the ones that you get given and then save it um i appreciate that does i know it's always something explained so elegant and easily appreciate that dude uh so now you can see look at that we've got a very nice comparison right so this is actually looking very nice right now okay um so this is very close to what we want now what we're going to do is i want the middle bit so the messages to take up the remainder of the space so whenever we have like a flex design so especially a column design what we actually have without realizing is so flex column so this is the top element this is the bottom element so right now we have two elements in this one so right now we have two but what i'm going to do is i'm going to add the third element the chat dot messages and i'm going to say this should have flex 1 and now what this does flex one is basically going to say all right you should take up as much room as you can right so this container should take up as much room and it pushes the thing at the top to the top pushes this one to the bottom and that's why we get this nice sort of ui so what i'm going to do now is where we have the chat messages if i simply go here and i say chat messages flex 1 we get that desired output outcome so we can say flex 1 and boom see that it went ahead and did that so literally i put back my drawing and it literally just did the exact same thing that's why we get that so now anything we put in this space right here is going to be the messages that come through okay and that's going to be pretty pretty awesome okay uh i definitely agree with ceon he says i think coding is kind of an art well done i definitely think it's kind of an art like as soon as especially when you get like a flow state and um uh nice because you made my friends jealous when i made whatsapp man cone today waiting for the man stack yeah so shout out david david drop the man stack okay now what we're gonna do we're gonna go ahead and build some of the messages okay so let's go ahead and check out chat.js chat.js and we're going to go inside of here all right so now inside of the messages div here we're going to have a message um we're gonna have a message component and we're gonna have it several times based on like if there's 10 messages 15 messages or something like that okay um somebody says imagine life before flexbox damn i don't even know what anyone i remember i remember what life was like before flexbox it was a headache man you had to do all sorts of breakpoint rubbish um i still use breakpoints they're good but you know i don't use them as much um now here i'm gonna say the message is gonna take three things it's gonna take a time stamp a message and a user but for now we're just going to make it a simple message so it says message is not defined so let's go ahead and do message.js so message.js boom rfce save it and then here i'm gonna say class name equals message equals message and then i'm gonna do import message dot css save it go ahead create that message dot css go back get rid of that and then here what we're going to say is very simply so inside a message we have a few things right we have an avatar an avatar and i actually imported that from material ui and that's going to have some kind of source and then we're going to have the message info so this will be like the the username the the message the timestamp and all that sort of stuff so the stuff that you see over here right so over here we have the message info so we're going to say message underscore and score info all right oops info and then here i'm going to say h4 entitled up and then it's going to say um this one's going to be let's just say like my username says this is anger if you're not following me again go follow me um and then we're going to span a timestamp in here so i'm going to give this a class name of message timestamp and then here i'm going to go ahead and say this is a timestamp and we'll replace that with the actual timestamp in a bit and over here i'm going to say a p tag which is the actual message this is a message okay uh also awesome stuff man calvin commander thank you so much for the five canadian dollar donation all i gotta say is god bless you guys for this value also is there a way to make these clones mobile responsive because i like to use them with friends yeah so uh we try and build it with a goodbye firstly thank you so much i'll keep that up on the screen for a little sec uh thank you so much dude uh and also yes so we try and make it as much as responsive as possible from the like the perspective of how long the builds last and how like you know how much we can fit in inside of a live stream but we can definitely focus more sessions on pure sort of responsive design i'm definitely down for that but again we have react native stuff coming we have readouts coming we're just you know we're trying to get out as much as we possibly can um but i appreciate that kevin always good to see you and um okay so let's go back and um let's go to our message let's see how it looks so let's go back to our chat.js go ahead and do our little control spacebar trick auto import save it and then you can see this is the message so if i go ahead and let's do three messages down here we want this to look like this okay so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go inside my message inside message.css pull this down underneath pull this down underneath then i'm going to go into mymessage.css and i'm going to say dot message and the first thing we'll do is display flex uh align item center boom and we should see that then we're going to say padding at 20 pixels because we don't want it that close to the end and i'm going to say color is white okay color of white and then we're going to say the message info should have a margin left of 20 pixels okay and you see it spaces away a little bit and then we're going to say message timestamp and this one is going to be color gray oops let me go ahead and say color gray and i'm going to say margin left of 20 pixels okay save it and then we're going to say font size of extra small so this one should be like an extra so right now the time stamp shouldn't be the same size just looks a bit strange it should be a bit smaller so i'm going to go back here and i'm going to say font size font size of 20 uh extra small sorry extra small so these are the predefined sort of browser ones there we go okay so that looks pretty good right now um what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to get a picture uh but you know you know for now we'll use this one and we'll sort of plug in our values afterwards so at this point this is kind of cool right we have things working pretty nice but we can do better all right firstly we're 850 likes smash that thumbs up button if you're still watching and you haven't already uh and yeah we're gonna we're gonna hit a thousand likes today guys just go ahead and keep pushing it to bring up the energy for the future builds um but with that said what we're gonna do now is go ahead and um i think at this point we can actually go ahead and maybe start introducing some firebase stuff so uh let's do that actually it'll be fun so what we're gonna do now is go over to our firebase then we're going to go to cloud firestore okay um hey i love this sanja because it's already 1 21 am here but i'm awake because you're super tutorial sunny and an extra next tour please do an admin panel yeah we'll work on the admin panel soon i will come home soon so cloud firestore you want to click create database and then we're going to say start in test mode click next any location is fine click enable you need to do this to get everything up and running okay um okay so uh almost at 900 likes guys almost at 900 likes appreciate each and every one of you watching we still have 300 people watching across facebook and youtube so that is insane thank you guys um and i'm sure we're gonna get that momentum back up and flying again um okay so there you go we have that up and running then we're gonna go into authentication and we're gonna go sign in method and here i'm gonna enable google sign in okay so you need to do this uh here i'm just gonna enable an email click save and you need to do this for the logging in step okay um somebody says love your programming what would love you to have you as a programming mentor i do do mentoring uh drop me a message on my instagram and i'll be happy to have a chat um so okay so um somebody says it's a good question actually he says someone says after 30 days it comes to cloud firestore database will be expiring soon to fix that problem go into your cloud firestore go to rules and then go here and then basically get rid of this line all right get rid of this and just do a semicolon allow read and write publish it and that's it you'll never get that annoying message again okay that'll save you a bit of headache okay so with that said now let's go back to our code and oh yeah so what we wanted to do actually is go to this little cog right remember we saved the config earlier but we're going to grab this config again we're gonna grab that config and then we're gonna go back to our code i'm gonna do command b and then we're gonna basically create a file called firebase.js and i'm gonna paste it inside of there okay so now we have this the next thing i want you guys to do is pull up a terminal say mpmi firebase we need to install the firebase dependencies so that we can go ahead and do everything inside of that we need to do with firebase the next step is we go to the top of the file and we say import firebase from firebase because it will be installed right and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and say uh const get a firebase app and initialize the app with the firebase config so this one right here that's the first thing that'll basically like set the app up and connect everything that we need the next bit we're going to go ahead and grab the database so we're going to make say go ahead and grab firestore and store it in this variable and then we're going to do the same for authentication and then the final thing this is where we have the special googie login functionality is we say const provider equals new firebase.auth.google auth provider okay so that's going to be very important for the next bit and then we're going to go ahead and export the authentication and provider as explicit imports okay and then we're gonna export a default export which is the database because we use the db more than we use these two so i'd like to make that the default and if you don't know the difference between explicit and uh implicit then i recommend go ahead and check it out but at this point it's not that important okay so with that said almost 900 likes crazy stuff okay so with that said we're gonna go ahead and um we're going to create a let's create the login maybe okay so right now we have this right here right but i want to have some login functionality and then i actually want to set up redux and get redux up and running so right now it created a some it created redux for us like the sort of back end of redux okay now today i'm going to be showing you how to use redux from the tutorial um you can actually add other so nagesh says can we add in other authentications like facebook or anything else yes there's facebook github loads of different uh ones that you can add so if you go to authentication you can see on the sign in method all of these ones you can go ahead and add they just have different implementations um but we're gonna use google today um so here now what i'm going to say is i'm going to rename this to become this one i'm going to say rename it to the user reducer because we're going to basically have one area of our data layer which is permanently for only the user stuff so we need to go to our counter slice rename this file to be user slice and i'll explain all this in a sec user slice and then what we're going to do is we're going to click update imports i'm going to click no so i'm going to show you guys where we actually need to update it but then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and change everything in here that says counter to user so it's user slice now so it's going to say const user slice equals create slice and we're going to the name user here we're going to have initial state of user this is going to be no and again this is the stuff where you can pretty much just go ahead and copy along and uh pattern recognition in this case i'll explain a bit of what redux is doing but you don't actually need to know fully as at this point as to where we just need to know how to use it okay so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of these i'm going to say create a function called set user for when we actually log in well let's just call it login let's call it login and then i'm going to say this will take a state and an action right and then we're going to create another one which is going to be called logout and then this will go ahead take the state as an argument and then it will when we log out we basically just want to go ahead and and set the user to know again okay um whereas when we log in we're going to get rid of this stuff when we log in what we will do is we'll set the user to whatever the action was plus let me go ahead and double check we're gonna say whatever the action.payload was whatever the payload was we're gonna wherever we pass through as an action uh this will make sense in a bit guys and we're gonna we don't need these three we're gonna go ahead and say log out log in sorry log out so we're gonna export these as actions so that way we can use it throughout the app now we don't need this stuff we can go ahead and delete that and then we don't need the comment here but a selector is basically how we can go ahead and grab this information once it's done okay so we can go ahead and do this so a slice is a store no so the store is like a so i'll show you in a sec i'll do a little drawing but over here we're going to say select user state.user.user because it's the user slice and it's the user piece of state okay and use that okay so we're going to do a quick drawing for you guys to visualize this okay so we have an app all right we have an app so freeze whiteboard okay so we have our application so let's just go ahead and say um discord clone all right so we have this app and discord clone right now when you have an app you have a few components inside of your app right so you have like your app.js at the top um so this one will be like app.js and then you have a few apps underneath things underneath you have like the chat right so you have the the chat dot js so i'm just gonna say chat you have like the header component underneath oops you have the header component right and then you basically have this tree that starts to grow right so you have this and this goes to this and then like for example the chat has like a message component and so forth okay now what we can do is so you have this kind of tree and then the header would also have its own components so like it's just gonna say dot dot dot so this would be like another component okay um now the point is is that say for example we had a login component okay so let's say we have a login component over here right and app.js connects to our login component now imagine we had a user here right so imagine we had a piece of state where the user is here and we set the user over here so imagine when i log in you basically go ahead and get the user's information now if i want to get the user like if i need the user when i whenever i do a message down here then what i need to then do is basically pass the user over here and then i need to pass it to chat component as a prop and i need to pass it down to message as a prop and it kind of gets really messy what if i need it down here as well i need to basically go ahead and pass it to the header and then pass it to this component and now already it's getting messy right we don't want this this is a headache right so what we do instead is we kind of say forget all this stuff and what we do is we introduce something like a data layer so imagine like an onion right it's like imagine like it's like an onion and this is what we call like our data layer right so i like to refer to it as a data layer or in this case it's going to be redux okay now the data layer in this case it has multiple slices inside of it so just like an onion but you have different slices in your engine so we're going to have something like called the user right so the user slice and this will have all the information about a user and then we're also going to have something like the uh the app slice this will have information which is like generic information about the app so which channel are you in so we could call it channel slice but in this case i'm just going to say app slice right now the benefit here is when we get the user at the login what we can do is we can actually just go ahead and push it into this data layer so in this case i would push it into the user slice right so let's go ahead and just move it over here so imagine i had the user slice because remember just like an onion has different layers we have the app layer the user layer so in this case we have the app the user slice so i push the user into the user slice and then wherever i need it i can go ahead and just pull it out because this the layer is surrounding the entire app so here i can actually just go ahead and get the user from the slice that we pushed into so we can push in at this point grab it at this point if i need it over here i can do the same thing i can just pull it from the daily so if i need the user at this point and you see it doesn't matter where we pull it from but i can go ahead and use it so this is going to be really really high i'm just checking the comments so um nice this week i've already took leave for three days from office just to learn react yes from sunny damn dude thank you so much uh that's awesome to hear that um i love this stuff okay yeah so this is essentially redux in a nutshell okay so we have like different layers of the onions so like and the reason for this is because you don't want all of your data in one place right we want to have sort of a place where it's all the generic information a place where it's the user's information only and it makes the app easier to maintain so with that said we're basically going ahead and create the user size first so the name of the slice is user and so forth so we go back to our store.js and here this is where we configure the store so the store is essentially this layer so essentially this onion pill thing right and this consists of like the user slice but we're also going to create an app slice so i'm going to create that right now and the reducer is just something which listens to action so an action is what we do here so imagine when we log in we push the user and then at this point through a login action and then if we log out we can push the user in as a logo action so it basically is the user state and then everything listening rerenders based on if it's listening or not so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go ahead and i can delete these two delete the counter and count this slice and we're going to go ahead and create app slice.js and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy everything from user slice i'm going to rename everything to app and we're just going to go through and make a few changes so app slice create slides the name of the slice is called app here we're going to basically we don't need this this is just going to be uh blank for now but we could we're going to have two pieces of information here we're going to have the channel id so this will be the id that you of the channel that you're in so in the beginning it starts off as no and we're also going to have the channel name and in the beginning that's no right now in here we're going to have something called set channel id um and then this will actually go ahead and set off some information we're gonna we don't need this one and this one will say set channel id oops set channel id and then here where we have select app it's not gonna be this it's going to be select i'm going to have two i'm going to have select channel id and select channel name because we have two selectors here to go ahead and get us the channel id and the channel names you see it goes inside that global onion layer and it goes inside the app layer of it so the store the state and it goes into the app layer and goes and gets the channel id goes into the app layer and gets the channel name and then we're exporting it so we save that go into store.js and then we go ahead and import it like so we basically go ahead and we just go ahead and change this the app slice there we go and it's literally that easy to connect it right now you see the app isn't freaking out everything's good now if i go ahead and inspect it so if you go ahead and grab the redux dev tools you can actually go ahead and check the state so let's go into the state now you can see look the user states set up so inside the user slice remember like i said we have these two app slice and user slice so we have the app slice and the user slice the app size has the channel id channel name the user size has the user right um so this is going to be really really handy um to go ahead and do it and this will actually handle the sort of persistence all that stuff and it'll do everything for us so with that said now what we're gonna do is we're gonna have it so that um so we now have our store essentially set up okay but what i need to do now is create a login okay so a login so what i want to do is i actually need to pull the user at this point so just like we said here i'm going to pull it in at app.js so i'm going to basically go ahead and say give me the user at this point okay so give me the user now how do we do that we go into app.js and we basically go ahead and we do the following we say const user equals use selector so this is a special hook and we can import that from react redux and then basically what we do is we go ahead and remember in the uh user slice we created the select user hook a select user sorry uh selector it's called and this basically goes into that piece of state and goes ahead and grabs it okay so we basically go ahead and we can go ahead and say import the select user selector from sorry features use a slice like that okay and then what we do is we just pop it in here so we pop it in there and that will actually give us the user believe it or not okay so and then what we're gonna say is if there's a user now okay so if there is a user so for example if you're logged in then only then do we render the actual app so we need to if we do this it freaks out right actually because it says passing elements must be in a uh wrapped in an enclosing tag so in order to get around that what you can do is you can go ahead and do a fragment or a div whatever you want to do but this will go ahead and do that and then we have a ternary here so we can go ahead or test returnery operator so the redux what would be the difference from the context uh so the slices is one thing also the dev tools is much more maintainable plus you can have things like uh mid middleware and things like that so it's a lot more production you can add a lot more to redux it's been around for a long time it's the reason why it's not around for a lot longer and if we don't have it you're gonna say you need to log in right you need to log in and save so see right now we don't have a user so we need to log in okay so right now if we check the state so let's go to our redux and then we go to our state and user is no so that's why it's rendering you need to log in okay i understand it could be difficult in the beginning but don't worry i remember when i first saw redux i was like but it makes sense trust me just keep practicing it like anything you get used to this stuff and it makes a lot of sense now what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a login component now so i'm going to go here i'm going to create a new component so tomorrow's build uh we we might use redox yeah let's let's go ahead and do redux in tomorrow as well as well i mean redux in tomorrow's video may not be as necessary but i think we'll do that yeah so login.js all right rfce import login dot css boom go here class name equals login go down here h2 i am the login page save it let's go back to our app and rather than rendering this i'm going to render the login page i'm going to go ahead and do control log login boom um somebody says melissa says just keep following the pattern with redux yes exactly so i would recommend you learn the react context api the pattern you then pick up on the sort of reducers and what the heck is a reducer in action and all that sort of stuff um but to give you a quick breakdown again um remember we have the apps and they follow sort of like a treeslike structure okay now this prevents a problem called prop drilling when we introduce something like a data layer or like redux you don't want to have prop drilling okay that's where you basically pass your props from one component to another you don't want this okay so you don't want that so what we can do then is we introduce something like redux and then you have different slices inside so you have the app size the user slice this will contain generic information about the app the user will slice will only contain information by the user if you had like a ecommerce app you would basically have stuff like the basket slice and things like that you know and what you can do is that any component you can push in via an action into that slice right and then in any component you can use a selector to go ahead and grab information from the slice right so that's what we're doing so here now inside logging.js it says cannot resolve login css so i'm going to go ahead and create login.css boom save it and here we go it says i'm logging page so good everything's good at that point so i'm going to go ahead and remove the comment for now and then what we want to do inside of our login component what i'm going to do it's going to be very simple logan come on we're going to have a div which says login logo and this div is basically just going to have an image tag inside of it right now i have the discord logo image here so i'm just going to go ahead and paste that in it's just a simple one i got from google and then i have a button right and the button is simple it's just going to be a button it's going to be a material ui button so that's why we use capital b and then it's going to have an on click oops and it's going to say sign in sorry and then here it's going to have an on click which is called sign in right so we need to create that function and then um we're gonna go ahead and say const sign in and this takes an event um but i mean at this point we don't really care about the event because it's just one button click so we don't even need that and then here we can actually go ahead and do the sort of do clever log google login cheers right this is where all the magic sort of happens okay uh oops i didn't get rid of that comment okay uh thank you so much ritik saying uh love you bro bro appreciate that dude um so now what we're gonna do is we go ahead and import the button so material ui just like that and put the button then we have the button here okay so i'm going to go ahead and style this to make this look a bit better before we go ahead any further so let's go ahead and go to our login.css right so login.css and then here what i'm going to do is go to login.css and i'm going to drop this underneath like we do before because it's always easier for you guys to see this and here i'm going to say login okay now for the login i'm going to say display grid um sorry not display yeah it's display grid it's a very neat trick by the way say place items center it's a very very nice trick save it and there you go okay then i'm going to say height of 100 view height and width of 100 100 and this will actually go ahead and center everything in the middle of the page so it does a neat little trick okay um and then what we're going to do is we're going to target the button and i'm going to say targeting the button say width of 300 pixels the background color is discord color the color is white the font weight is 80. but you see when i hover over it comes to default white which we don't really want that okay it's going to be super confusing i'm just gonna make myself smaller for you guys to see that a bit easier because i think i'm getting in the way there we go and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make sure when we hover over it inverts in some way so i'm gonna say when we hover over the button change the background color to back and then the button to that text you see and then it goes like this which is a bit more of a nicer user experience you change that to whatever color you want really to be honest okay then what i'm going to say is i'm going to go ahead and target the inner div which is the login logo display flex flex direction column and then i'm going to target the inner dev image uh we don't actually need that line yeah image i'm going to say object fit contain which basically keeps the aspect ratio right and then we're going to go ahead and say height of 150 pixels so now we get this beautiful design okay now that's the styling bit done okay so smash the thumbs up button if you're enjoying this because we're about to i'm about to teach you guys how we introduce google login okay oh man you get yeah well thirsty when you're talking at that speed right now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and do the following so yeah now what we're going to say is i need to import auth so let's go back yeah i'm going to import auth but i'm not going to import it like this i'm going to import for my local firebase right so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna go ahead and say import auth from local firebase and then because we already set everything up for that okay and then we're gonna go ahead and say uh aus dot sign in with popup sign in with popup and here we need to import the provider as well so i export that earlier so i'm going to say export import provider sign in with the provider okay and then all i need to do here is just say catch right i don't care about when it succeeds and i'll show you why yeah i'm gonna say and catch the error if there is an error and do an alert and i'm gonna say show me the error message if there is an error message right now that might seem like whoa whoa whoa like something can't be that easy man like it just can't be that easy if i click sign in whoa check this out everything loads dude so you need to make sure that you actually went ahead and enabled it in here otherwise it would freak out at this point but for example i'm going to show you guys an error so if i click another sign in box or if i close it early you see it says the operation has been cancelled due to another conflicting open window and it popup has been closed by the user before finalizing the operation so you see it caught the error and it just showed the alert right which is what i wanted but if i go ahead and sign in say if i sign in it will redirect back to my app and you see nothing happened right but i'm going to show you guys a little trick now okay so this is where the sort of really nice kind of listening persistence and all that stuff comes in so if we go back to app.js okay so let's go back to app.js and let's go here and now what i'm going to do is inside of app.js i'm going to use a use effect hook so use a fact hook is a piece of code that runs once when the component loads if you do this otherwise it will run with any sort of dependency here so if i put user in here every time the user change it would change it would fire this code off again but if i don't add anything here it just runs once you need to have this here though otherwise it kind of goes in the infinite loop okay then what we're going to say is again i'm going to import aus so import from my local firebase i'm going to say or on auth state changed so this is like a listener right so what this does is it says every time the user logs in it will basically go ahead and get the the the user so anytime the authentication state changes we just want to listen to them we say if there's an author can if there's a user oops if there's a user then what we say is we want to log the user in right so then we'll say the user is logged in right else uh the user is logged o right now previously what we did inside of our redux source if we got to the app slice we sorry the user slice we created a login and a logout action right the first one went ahead and set the user to whatever the oops set the user to whatever the user payload was and the second one just resets the user to no so that way it resembles the user's not logged in but what we can do now is we can actually go back to our app.js we can pull in those values okay so what we need is first we need a dispatch so dispatch allows us to do the following allows us to shoot things into the data layer right so we need to get the dispatch and what we say is const dispatch equals use dispatch we use a special hook called use dispatch we need to import this from here from react redux okay so that gives us the dispatch of the sort of gun to shoot into the data and then what we're going to say is what if there's an authentication user so i'm just going to prove to you guys i'm not lying right so i'm going to say user is and i'm going to say auth user and if i go ahead and inspect right let's go to our console make this a bit bigger because i can't see anything so you see it says the user is right and it actually has all my details it says user is sunny sanger and things like that so everything comes up okay now if i was to log out for example or things like that i'll show you guys how we do that but now you see it's persisting so even if i refresh as soon as i come back the user's logged in right so the user's still there all right so how do we push this into our redux store so that way we can use it and determine like what to render on the screen so here what i say is i say dispatch and then what i need to do is i say dispatch login action and the payload for the login action all i'm going to do here is i'm just going to set some of the user details so i'm going to set a user id and this is going to be the auth user dot and then you can see here we've actually got all the stuff here so the uid is this one here so i'm going to say auto user.uid i'm going to get the photo so auth user dot photo url and then i'm also going to get the email which is auth user dot email so as you can see this here and then this is another good reason about console logging things out okay uh hey my girlfriend's back in the chat there she is go ahead and follow her guys um and then what we're going to do is we have the display name right so display name is oops display name is the auth user dot display name okay save it and now what's going to happen is where is it freaking out 9 20. log in yes so my action we didn't actually import any actions okay so i need to go ahead and go here and i just say import login action and the set user action uh sorry no no no i mean the login action um and the logout action from features forward slash user slice okay and you can see now it stops freaking out hey look at that so as soon as i log in what it does is it checks if i'm logged in and then they dispatch the login so to check that this actually worked oops i've got that stuck on the screen uh um hey she's mama react now that's that dude um so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to inspect right and like those i'm going to go to the dev tools so redox and then you guys can see look the user slice login action was fired and you can see the difference was is that it changed the user right so if we go to our state we go inside the user now i can see that we've got this information about the user right so again i'm in the way so i'm going to go ahead and just move myself over here so you can see now i've got the user id the photo the email and the display name so what we can do is we can pull this in any other component and use it as we need to okay which makes it super super useful in the in in what we need to do so what we do now is we can and then why why actually things really cool is you can check the action payload to see what was fired off right so in case something's not working it's actually a really really powerful debugging tool okay so um you can also rewind your app guys so this is insane so like say if i go back here and i click on skip see that so now if i skip that action and the user wasn't logged in if i basically this is what happened when the user wasn't logged in and if i don't skip it the user's logged in so it shows you like things like to that level which is really good right um then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and say if the user wasn't there right so if we basically like if if for any reason they logged out i'm going to say dispatch a logout action right and that's pretty much what we need to do literally that right and then inside of the app slice uh again user slice you can see the logout basically just sets the user to know okay but how do we log out right you're probably thinking it's going to be crazy um so nagesh says the poor has been set to 3002 i had two other pro programs running that's why uh otherwise for you guys it'll be 3000 so don't worry uh going back to this what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our app because this is actually this one here yeah and then what i'm going to say is um we do actually need to introduce so inside of our app.js right if i go ahead and check our terminal this one it says you're forgotten the dispatch dependency okay so here i need to include the dispatch because dispatch is a dependency here and there we go everything's green so don't ignore those messages guys they actually are there for a reason um what i need to now do is basically go ahead and i'm gonna have it so when i click this picture over here it should log me out all right so let's go ahead and let's go to sidebar i'm to go to the avatar so avatar is down here and firstly guys i want to use my actual avatar information so i'm going to go to sidebar i'm going to go ahead and use a selector to pull the information from the data layer so just like this we're going to go ahead we pushed in at this point when we logged in and then so we pushed in at this point oops when we logged in and i'm going to go ahead and pull in at the sidebar so wherever the sidebar is okay so here i'm going to go ahead and say const use select oops use selector uh import from react redux like this i'm going to import select user as well from the features user size save it go back and then what i'm going to do is i'm also going to get the um no i'm good we're good so now what i'm going to do is go back to our avatar and i'm going to say the source is the user.photo okay so here we should see so that this is the one i set manually and my google picture should come up now so if i go here and i say user.photo and we save it boom it went ahead and grabbed my my actual uh google picture okay so that's pretty sick everything works as we expected it too now i also want to have you my display name come up so right now we've got the manual instagram tag over here and we've got my id so instead of this i'm going to go ahead and use my actual user id so i'm going to go ahead and say user dot display name user dot display name save it and we should see sunny sanger comes up now okay and also for the id what i'm going to do is i'm going to say user.uid so that's the user id and then i only want the first i'm going to make a substring of it so if i use the full user id it's kind of long right you get this huge one so i'm just going to say substring because i saw like in discord you get like once say grab the zero to the fifth element and then boom we get that and if i go ahead and add a hashtag in front of it now it's looking bit discordy right so that's gonna be unique for you and it's gonna work okay so we're gonna substring it to five characters and now for the on click so for the avatar this is how simple it is guys to go ahead and log out right so i'm gonna go ahead and do it anonymous function and i'm gonna say auth and then remember we need to import the auth so i'm gonna auto import it from my local firebase and i'm going to go back down here and i'm going to say when i do it i'm going to say auth dot sign out right and that's it and now what this will do is this will sign you out on google side right and then it will trigger off the listener that we have listening over here so i don't need the console log and then if there isn't so there wouldn't be a a user anymore so it will dispatch the logout which means that redux will go ahead and basically cancel out the user inside of our user slice right so let's go ahead and save it refresh and if i click this boom logged out and it actually logged me out right so if i go ahead and check my redux dev tools go down here now you can see look i logged in and logged out set the user back to no okay so let's go back and click sign in and i want you guys to pay close attention to this part over here okay so over over here sorry so as soon as i click sunny watch how it dispatches the log in action hey and then it basically then the front end reacted because of it so that's dope okay that works really nice and everything's good okay the next thing i'm going to do is actually add the channel functionality so now we have all this working so i'm going to add the channel functionality so i'm going to go to sidebar.js and here what i'm going to do now is go to cybor.js and what i'm going to do is right now i'm going to create a piece of state right and we're going to have we're going to assume that we have oh guys we're at 933 likes let's make it a thousand likes that'll be a banger start to these videos again so i'm going to create a piece of state called channels and this is going to be set channels and i'm going to say use state so we're using the ustay hook auto import from react and this is going to be an array by default it's going to start with an empty array i'm going to have a use effect which fires off when the component loads okay and this will fire off once and the main purpose of this use effect make sure you import the use effect as well so this runs once hence the nc empty dependencies okay um i'm going to basically go into my db so i need to go ahead and import my db so remember this is the default export and then i'm going to go ahead and say db.collection i'm going to go to the channels collection inside my database so right now inside my database i have nothing but i'm going to eventually have this so this is my finished product which i had before so we have the channels collection all the different channels so in this case we have five channels so which is why you could see it before five channels and then inside of each channel i have a message collection with all the messages and if i click that you have the message are you guys ready to be a discord clone see you guys ready to go disco clone with the user's information over here right so we're going to go ahead and build that right now um and exactly yeah don't rush guys honestly so i really like this comment don't rush you're going to be a dope developer yes you guys are going to be amazing developers this is all recorded so you can pretty much go at your own pace slow it down pause you know like you can do all of that stuff at your own pace do not freak out if it's going fast okay don't freak out that's why it's recorded so you guys can pretty much play at your own pace so let's go back and check it out so go back to our database which is empty but i'm going to go ahead and say that there was a channels collection then on snapshot means that if anything ever changes so if we ever added a channel in or something like that in real time right so real time like no joke real time it's gonna pretty much go ahead and update it right so this is actually like crazy stuff which happens when this hap when it does this so i'm gonna go ahead and do set channels now this is a bit of a mouthful this piece right so we're going to update the state whenever the the database channels changes so if we add a channel any point it goes ahead and updates all of this stuff so to do that we say snapshot.docs and i would recommend you watch some of the other builds if you don't understand this bit of code and we also have a youtube video which explains the snapshot functionality so go ahead and check that out um but here i'm going to basically go ahead and say for each doc i'm going to go ahead and return an object right so i'm going to go ahead and return the object now this object is going to have an id which is going to be the document id so the document id is this id over here so this one over here so you see these document ids right and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say the channel is going to come back and it's going to be the document data and the document data for the channel would be the channel name okay so this is the data this is the document id right so we're basically just getting it back and this means that if we add stuff inside it will basically go ahead and pull it as appropriate right so with that said what we can do now is we can go back to our code and we can pretty much render right now we're rendering um right now we're rendering the sidebar channels we're rendering four over here by default okay i want to have it so that we say channels.map map through every single channel and return the sidebar channel over here right so if we have none it will show none okay awesome that's good all right so now it should only show things which are in the db so right now there should be none but we're going to add something right so i'm going to have it so that whenever i click this button this plus button so when i click the on click on the plus button i want to basically do handle add channel i'm going to fire off a function called handle add channel so i'm going to go down here and say const handle add channel it's going to be a arrow function here we're going to say const channel name so i'm going to get the channel name by prompting the user right so i'm going to say enter a new channel name save it and then if i click this now oh enter a new channel name nice okay and then i'm going to say if the user didn't or enter a channel name because we want to protect against undefined error then i'm going to say go inside the db go inside the channels collection right and just add the channel right so add an object where the channel name is the channel name that we passed in here and there's also an esx shorthand for this you could do that but i'm not gonna do that today because it might confuse some people okay um also we're at 950 likes let's go guys push it to a thousand come on and um handle add channel right so with that said now we've we've hooked everything up so what we should be doing is when i click that button after i enter some stuff in here i'm gonna click cancel for now but if i click okay it should push into the channels db collection that means that it will fire off the use effect listener over here right so this should this is set up to listen so that whenever the channels changes it will fire off a snapshot and it updates the channels right so that means that the channel should come up here straight away afterwards so if i go ahead and do youtube i think if this works you should smash the thumbs up button okay so 10 so i'm going to go ahead and click on youtube and it should pop up here okay hey look at that everything worked as you expected it too so that's pretty sick that's pretty sick all right so everything worked really nice let's go ahead and do another one let's go ahead and say uh discord let's just say cp discord boom oh okay but do you see so it added it but remember that it's not being passed through with the correct name right so youtube is like a hardcoded name now that makes sense because we didn't actually change that down here okay so if we go down here to where we actually render it out sidebar channel here we need to actually pass it down right so here what i'm going to do is the channel breaks down i'm going to destructure and say get the id in the channel at this point okay in the id and channel at this point and then yes i can see the numbers getting nearer to a thousand let's go guys and then i'm going to say make the key for this the id also pass the id as a prop and also pass the channel as a prop uh i'm actually gonna actually know i'm not gonna pass it entirely i'm gonna pass the channel name as a prop i'm gonna say the channel dot channel name because remember inside of our db is channel dot channel name save it and now what i can do is inside the sidebar channel we get the channel name and the id right the key is for rendering performance and then what i can do here is i can say instead of rendering youtube every time render the channel name uh click it and boom cp discord that's though right thank you so much for the kind words eli you came along because you guys are really trying thank you for all the pre and we appreciate all your effort amazing stuff dude and thank you for the greatest ever so amazing stuff right um uh and what we're gonna do now is we're going to go ahead and do okay so now we're going to go ahead and make it so that when i click this right i want to update the redux store to the inside the app size i want to basically keep track of which one we're in so that way so if i click this you see it changes which which room i'm in and then this triggers off like the correct loading for everything right um awesome man thank you so much calvin again dude he goes coming in hot with the 5 donation he says yay by the way do you how do i get the sound effects that you guys use they're cool so i actually use something called a rode caster pro it's like this big device i'll take a picture on my uh on my snapchat but i've got all these hot keys on there so i can pretty much go ahead and like if you want to get real tense i could be like oh you know like it can get really tense right like really quick and then if you want to get like really sentimental you can go ahead and do that or if you want to get hyped up you can go ahead and do that right like you do loads of stuff with this thing and i've got like the the volume levels and stuff here um so that's actually how i do that um it's through a road caster pro um but yeah you can learn you can do it different ways but right now i pretty much have this queued up when we're listening to music but yeah that's how i do that um oh we're almost at a thousand likes let's go guys um so now we pretty much get this bit up and running right so we want it so when i click this it changes the store right so what i'm gonna do now is inside of sidebar channel i'm going to go ahead and pull in my dispatch because i need to update redux so i'm going to go ahead and say const dispatch equals use dispatch go ahead and pull that in from redux react redux there we go and then what i'm going to say is on click of the div so here on click i'm going to go ahead and save set channel id so i'm going to import that action from app slice um because remember in app slice what i did is i had a an action over here and we're going to update what this actually does in a sec i actually would do it now so here i'm not going to have this but instead i'm going to have i'm going to have the following so i'm actually going to pass in two things i'm going to change it's not actually set channel idea set channel info and i'm going to say state.channel id equals action.payload.channel id state.channel name because action.payload.channel name okay and the way that we do that is we go back to our the thing that i was in so where was i i was inside of this sidebar starting to go crazy all right let's hide the sidebar no i'm inside the sidebar channel here we go and then what i'm going to do is it's not set beside my channel i set side by info now all right so there's this one and then i'm gonna save it and now it says it's not exported from the app slice so let's go back into app slice oh yeah we need to change this to set channel info and we'll go back to start by channel here we go and on click it's going to fire off an arrow function and this one is going to go ahead and say um it's going to dispatch dispatch set channel info and as the payload i'm gonna pass in the channel id right with the key id uh with that key channel id sorry the value id and then i'm gonna go ahead and say um channel name is the channel name that we passed in as a prop so if we go ahead and do that now if i go ahead and check my redux inspector go over here go to redux and now we should see if i click this set channel info you see that it set the info to the that channel id and cp discord if i click this one i set it to youtube and it changed the channel id to that one now these channel ids line up to the ones that are in the db so it knows which messages to then pull and we can also use the these values in rendering the correct things okay so that's dope so now what i can do is go into app slice and i've got the selectors appropriate so i need i can use those for example here so let's go into the header component and rather than chest test channel name um thank you so much nicholas on facebook he says this is awesome sunny appreciate that dude nagesh goes only 16 left for um the 1k whereas it deserves one i think it's one million or one trillion likes uh thank you so much dude i want me okay nice um uh my motivation as an idea of going back to my old work i i think that's a good thing let's carry on guys so right now rather than the test channel name what i'm going to go ahead and do is pull up my chat header over here and i'm going to basically go ahead and uh why do we render chat header it's inside of the chat.js right so inside of chat.js what i'm going to do is i'm going to pull the channel id the user and the uh channel name right so i'm going to do it in order so it's most confusing so here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to import the use selector from react redux i'm going to import the selectors so select channel id import this one and then i'm going to go ahead and say select user i'm going to import that as well there we go and now i have the this information inside of here inside of chat header i'm going to pass the channel name as a prop so channel name as a prop and inside of chat header what i can do now is i can accept that as a prop so i can say get the channel name uh destructure it and then here i can say render the channel name and now if we go ahead and click cp discord youtube damn it works huh awesome stuff all right um hey bow down to you papa papariat thank you dude um and then jesus said i love you for your job appreciate you guys thank you so much seven likes away from a thousand likes damn guys appreciate you guys so much um okay so next now what we're gonna go ahead and do is you see like that works now okay we can add the channels we can sort of change the room now what i want to do is i want to make this a bit more smart so the next thing that we need to do is go into our chat.js and this is where i need to basically go ahead and um make it so firstly we need to collect the input so i need to be able to collect this stuff so in order to do that let's go into chat.js oh god when we're printing it's going to chat.js and um i'm going to create a piece of state called input right so it's going to be called input and i'm going to say set input use state and by default this is going to be blank string okay now to hook this up to the input field down below i'm going to go ahead and say value equals um oh guys we just hit a thousand likes let's go guys that is dope thank you so much guys for watching this we're not finished yet we're not finished yet but thank you so much for a thousand likes on this video the energy has been insane from you guys today um let's keep going strong let's keep going strong that is that's awesome guys a thousand likes that's what i'm talking about okay so uh and we have a compile error so you know you win and you lose but let's go ahead and carry on so at this point we're gonna go ahead and import use date uh let's jump back in so i'm gonna import use date and um so here i'm gonna map it to the input and i'm going to say on change every time i type in go ahead and capture so it fires off an event and set the input to e.target the value which basically goes ahead and gets the value that you're typing in so that means now we have this oh god not that one value sure there you go and then as i type in now boom it's stored in state as well okay so the goal here is that when i type in right and we also want to disable this if there is no messages i want to say disabled if you haven't selected a room so i don't want you to be able to enter in things if you haven't selected a room so disabled if you have let's go ahead and say disabled if there is no channel id there we go that should fix it and also do after the button just in case right so that means if you haven't selected something you see that i can't actually type anything in but as soon as i select the channel i can type something in dope and also for the input field the message here i can actually now go ahead and use the actual channel name so i can say channel name and then you see where it says test channel now it says no but if i click something cp discord there we go okay now for the messages we render out three dead messages here we don't want that right we want to have some messages so i'm going to say const messages set messages equals use state i'm gonna make it an array okay and then what i'm gonna do is here i'm gonna go ahead and say messages dot map so for every single message i wanna render out a message component right so now we should see no messages which is actually correct right but i want to populate this stuff so i want to say use effect and the use effect gets fired off it gets fired off once because we're going to have a listener and then we're going to say db auto import from our local firebase i say db.collection and what i want to do is go into the channels right but this is where we've got to be particular right so i want to go into the document which is this channel id because remember we have the channel id stored in redux i'm going to go into the collection of messages inside of that room inside of that channel right and then i'm going to go ahead and say dot and i'm going to say order by because we're going to add a timestamp order by timestamp and then we're going to say descending because i want the most recent things to come to the top i'm going to say get a snapshot so again real time i'm gonna say when we get that snapshot go ahead and do the following we'll say set messages to snapshot dot docs dot map for every single doc inside i just want the doc data i don't really care about anything else so i'm going to say doc data right so then we get this nice little kind of thing but you see it freaks out so we need to get say if there's a channel id then we do this otherwise protect right so we're kind of protecting against ourselves here monsters that's it boom works right so at this point everything's pretty good we pretty much have everything uh working um well kinda like we basically have this pulling in the messages but we can't see that it's actually doing anything right so i want to go ahead and say constant messages consent message equals e um we want to do an e dot prevent default because when we submit that form we don't want it to refresh the page and basically i need to connect this to that button so when we send the message remember like i said it's inside a form so when i hit enter on this field see right now it refreshes we don't want that so i'm going to say on click and i'm going to say send message but now we do e dot prevent default so if i do it now type in enter see it doesn't actually refresh which is good and then here what i'm going to say is db.collection message channels and then we go in again inside the room so we say channel id and then we say again go into the collection of messages and all we do here guys is we just add so we add an object inside and then here we say add a timestamp so first it will add the timestamp after but we say the message is the input right so it's the input of what you added i hate when it overlays it there we go message is the input and we can say user is our user that we pull in from our store okay the one that we logged in with and then i need a timestamp as well so i know when the user entered now for the timestamp what we do is we import firebase from the actual firebase oops from the local we say from firebase the one that's on the npm module and we do that and then what we do is we go down here we say timestamp oops times them and this one is firebase start firestore and then we say dot filled value dot server times server timestamp because we want to use a servers timestamp because that's going to be the same regardless if i'm in london if i'm in america or if i'm in anywhere else right it doesn't matter right so that will go ahead and do that now with that said we need to actually uh add a dependency here for this use effect the channel id is the dependency here because we use it here so we need to add that in that's very important don't forget that and then also here for the um we need to set the input to blank after you submit so you don't want to have this some text here okay so with that said if i go into cp discord and i say yo what's up guys enter you see i added the message but again right so now it's actually there but now our message needs to actually take in the correct props when we render it out so what we can do at this point is we can actually pass in the message stuff that we need so we're going to pass in three props and they're going to be as follows message timestamp message message and the message user and this is based on the values we put in here okay so we jump into our message we receive the props here so we can destructure them and we can get the timestamp the user and the message save it and now if we go into our message right now what we can do is the avatar source can be the the user dot photo right so this would be the user's photo from that value so if i go into cv discord now it's got my correct picture it's not my one it's the one that we actually sent the message with so if no matter what i'm logged in as it will be i will be showing that one now the here should be the user dot display name and then here this is a timestamp so this is where the interesting bit comes in so this one's a bit more tricky right we're going to say new date od and we're going to say timestamp dot and we say timezone could be there might not be there to date and then we say to i uh utc string all right so this will basically go ahead and pass the the weird timestamp we get back into the correct one so we go to cp discord and it says this is a message but the time stamps correct the name is correct but the message is the final part here i just say message and now cp discord boom and if i go ahead and say boom this just works look at that guys real time yeah and if i say wow this is dough so that's pretty cool right uh that works really really nice and i'm gonna deploy this in a second even if we're going to this channel and say the youtube channel oh works uh is this i'm gonna let you guys respond to that let me see all right but i think that's pretty dope all right so with that said i think that's the majority of the app done right so most of the apps down so we can pretty much log in so i'm going to actually go ahead and log into a separate account so i've got a different account here so i'm going to log into i've got karzi's account here so i'm just going to log in under his account and now i should say i've logged in there's graphic cards there we go and i can say yo sonny so i'm gonna pretend that was someone else now so you can see yourself and say what's up guys what's up guys there we go see that works in a different account as well it pauses information and say this is insane it's all real time guys like if i refresh it's going to persist it logs me back in go back to cp discord boom logs in all right so i'm going to go back to sunny and i think with that said what we're going to do now is to deploy right go ahead and deploy um so now what we're going to do is we have everything up and running this is insane i mean i think this is pretty cool i think this is pretty pretty cool stuff um so now what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and deploy so i'm going to first make sure i'm logged into the correct firebase so let me go ahead and just uh change your screen for a second because i think i'm in a work one so if i was logged out and yeah that wasn't one so i'm going to go into my terminal so let's go back into my tamil and first i'm going to do firebase login and i made this on my personal one so if i go ahead and just say i'll just find and it's going to log me so i'm going to continue i don't know on this account on this account allow there we go and he logged me in so firebase login is the first command you want to do then you want to do firebase init okay uh so right now we're deploying guys so it's gonna be awesome so then i'm gonna go ahead and go down to hosting hit enter i hit the space bar hit enter key okay so i'm gonna make this a bit bigger for you guys so you guys can see that and then here it says use an existing project so i have tons of projects let's go ahead and find the one discord clone youtube all right enter and then this bit is very important okay so uh so billboard bargo says shouldn't the newest text be at the bottom yeah you can do that and you can make it or scroll to the bottom if you want i didn't do that i just done it for simplicity it will come to the top um but here is very important to write build okay you have to write build guys don't right anything else has to be built and then what you want to do is enter and then here you want to do yes because every single react app is a single page app that's dope and then we're going to do is npm run build and what this will do is it will build the entire app into a build folder up here all right so remember we set the the deployment folder to build okay and it will actually go ahead and build everything into that folder so right now it strips out all the sort of heavy craps all the heavy sort of stuff that we don't need and it will actually go ahead and put into a very optimized production build so this is the one okay um and then what we're gonna do is bear with me while it creates the optimized production build and there you go so it built everything out so now we can check inside the build folder we got all this jogging right so you don't want to touch anything inside the build folder they basically made it into a very fast production ready i guess itself okay then what we're gonna do is we're gonna say firebase deploy and that's it i'm gonna hit this button and we're gonna we're about to deploy guys and i want you guys to all log on to this once i deploy it and check it out right now who's ready who is ready to deploy this app guys let me know in the comments right now because we're going to end this with a bang and i'm going to go ahead and share the link for you guys and i want everyone to come in clutch and literally just just go ahead and have a chat keep it clean but have a chat inside inside the discord clone to see that i'm not lying when i when i built this right so let me know in the comments right now if you're ready for this and i will hit the deploy button as soon as we get enough heat right now okay so let's go ahead and see how many people drop a comment on this we already passed a thousand likes we have 220 people still watching so that's insane let's go ahead and do this so david mason says you are awesome thank you so much dude um and with that said i'm going to give it one more second hey there it goes that's it so here we go this goes christopher siddharth says let's see it deploying the gestures yeah hey hi dude uh everyone's saying let's go drop it let's go all right let's do it dude let's go all right so i'm going to hit deploy so hitting deploy now and deploying hosting bikini deploy found the items in the build this is good this is good this is good and hey there we go there's the build right there so i'm gonna go ahead copy this and drop this in the chat there you go and let's go ahead and open it out i'm gonna open it up here and do this and now you guys should be able to see it go ahead and check it out go ahead and do something login check it out hey we got people here already nice yo what's up guys david mason's here dope oh we actually have a bug all right so i'm going to show you guys how to fix this right now okay so i'm going to show you how to fix this right now and then we'll redeploy so check this out right so it's actually a good debugging issue okay so you see we haven't got overscroll right now okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to chat and then over here well i'll show you how to very quickly fix this so as the messages come in we can fix this so inside of chat messages over here so i'm going to open up chat.css boom go down here and this is pretty cool as we're coding over there it comes down and i'm going to go into chat.css and you guys will see how fast it is to do this stuff right so inside the chat messages i'm going to go overflow scroll and then i'm going to add this in so i'm going to add this webkit scroll bar in so over here boom and i'm going to go ahead and say this so these two lines here hide the scroll bar but they implement the scroll functionality now i'm going to go ahead and do npm run build and i'm going to chain the firebase deploy command and boom just like that i'm literally pushing and i'm pushing a bug fix so once this bug fix goes ahead and gets deployed you guys are going to see it so michael pluto literally is going to fix that issue so it just created the build and then we're going to go ahead and do it again so now it's deploying again so let's go ahead and see out um omkar says don't you pee my girlfriend agrees honestly i don't know man like i can hold it together but look at that we have this issue but if i refresh now it shouldn't be cached hopefully so let's go ahead and see let's go ahead and do this hey look at that fixed it nice that's how you do it guys that's how you fix a bug live so go ahead and refresh and you'll see it the bug is fixed look at that that was pretty cool i think i think that deserves to hit the smack that smashed that thumbs up but i think that's pretty cool just debugged it that quick and we deployed it so that shows you just how fast it is to go ahead and deploy okay so that's pretty sick um with that said i thought that you know it's coming to an end when we dropped that um but you guys can pretty much see that we have like look we have some new chat channels being opened up here it's pretty dope all right so nicholas hell thank you so much this guy sonny is awesome learn so much we should try this react.js come on later definitely go check it out dude and uh yeah we've got loads of things coming in so we've got legend papa react subscribe to cleverprogrammer hey love this good your superhuman hats off papa react fix the bug yeah oh yeah dude subscribe for us bet chats the best chat ever sunny knows pedro what's up dude man it works okay this is insane awesome sunny fans nice all right so with that said guys with that said guys i hope you enjoyed the build we had redux we had everything inside this build we had the discord clone we had redux we had uh selectors we ran through the entire build process like that we showed you pretty much the entire redux flow how different slices like the app size the user slicer built we had all of that stuff inside today's build we had man crazy stuff or somebody says okay there's still a bug i mean i think it's also on the the sidebar but you know you guys saw it you know i had to go ahead and fix that um hey my girlfriend's coming in love you too um but yeah guys that was an awesome fun build hope you guys found value in that we pretty much showed a responsive design we showed how you can pretty much go ahead and clone um thank you so much guys for sticking around we still have literally 230 people sticking around so this is awesome we hit over a thousand likes already in today's build and as always guys your energy is insane i'm glad to be back and we can pretty much go ahead and i want all of you guys to go ahead and let you go ahead and build this i know which bug you're talking about guys you're talking about the sidebar you literally do the same thing you do overflow scroll and then you do that little trick that i showed you to go ahead and fix it but with that said tomorrow we drop an imessage clone so we don't stop here we've got an imessage clone happening tomorrow so literally the stuff that happens on your phone is going to be happening on the browser tomorrow i'm going to build that for you guys tomorrow um with that said make sure you go to the link in the description sign up to the free training do not miss that guys because it's completely free so i don't know why you'd want to miss it but this is the free training that you can get access to uh me and classy pretty much go ahead and show you guys how to build the next fix clone and use everything behind that build so um yeah josh shah says what's that shiny thing behind you these are the lights that my girlfriend bought me so they're pretty cool lights dude they're called nano leaf and they react to my voice so as soon as i talk it pretty much comes up so thank you so much guys and it's papa react aka sunny signing off make sure if you don't already follow me on instagram so go ahead follow me shoot a story if you're watching this live and i'd love to have a chat with that said it's your boy i'll see you tomorrow peace guys bye
