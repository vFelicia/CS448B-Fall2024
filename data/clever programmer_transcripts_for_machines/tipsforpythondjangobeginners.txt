what type of advice would you give to calm science major trying to get in the trying to get work in industry I would look aggressively for work apply between 3,200 places a day and don't just rely on your degree to do all of the work for you how much time did it take me to become a programmer about 3 to 6 months until I started getting work so I like to use that as a metric for how long it took me because once you start earning and compliment your programmer I was also coding between 12 to 16 hours a day so then it helped me become a developer and get those skills a lot faster that's what I would recommend for you tips for Python and Django beginners so the tips I would give you are master the fundamentals with Python learn the basics really get your basics down be able to solve lots of coding problems maybe even take them around with hacker rank or code Wars and those not the project Euler be able to solve problems be able to do simple projects with just purely Python so say you want to do tictactoe or you want to do rockpaperscissors simple projects be able to do them with Python then once you do that then jump into the tier of web development which is going to be Jango so then start messing around with Jango and create projects with Jango okay increase the layer of complexity one step at a time don't introduce too many things at once if you're a complete beginner to web development don't jump into web development right away with Django start with flask class cast less magic flask is a lot simpler once you get the hang of web development build a few simple projects of glass then move over to Django because it's a framework for perfectionist with deadlines and it allows you to build things really really quick keeps you super productive but it has a little bit more magic than class which means it's a little bit more complex inherently dense last so that's why you want to start with flask first understand web development and how routes work and how URLs work and how views work things like that though MVC you know the Model View controller type of mechanism works then switch over to Django and it'll be a smooth transition and you're gonna be a great great developer so that is the tip for a Python slash a Django a beginner how can one know if he's a developer if he creates something and gets paid for it if he works if he or she works for a company or a freelancing client you're not getting paid for it you're a fake if you're getting paid for something then your profession Python cuz the snake is cool easiest programming languages are popular than Kim Kardashian Google is built off Python Instagram is built off Python nASA uses Python Spotify uses Python so it's very simple to start and you can go as complex as you want that's why Python for making how did you advertise yourself in the beginning to get clients Craigslist why is that take lessons those were my main platforms I got me a lot of clients fill stuff so I just learnt scraping and how to get to store data into files or a database just trying to apply for a lot of jobs right now five cent a day fill try to get to twenty to a hundred a day but good job with five to ten a day and storing files and stuff learn how databases work to learn sequel and learn Postgres and writing stuff to a post whereas database that's going to be your key to winning so you want to understand sequel and databases with Python and then you will win best source for learning web scraping go to my youtube go to youtube clever programmer type in web scraping yep ssam court you can be a data scientist and work remotely but data scientists becoming a data scientist is very difficult so I like to generally break I would like to recommend people break in through doing web development first then break into data science books or web development I personally never went through any books on web development I just did a lot of stuff through YouTube my own learning and Udacity do you need a good university for web development you do not need a good you do not need a good degree from a good university for web development you just need good skills a piece of paper that's really expensive isn't gonna get you anywhere work on developing the skills be selftaught always be learning the newest thing develop the skill of learning new things really fast and apply to lots of places really aggressively you will do really well what do I do now it is fulltime Kluber programmer and build a business how do you learn API YouTube is going to be your best friend my friend look up api's look up Python learn API is there complex concept if you don't know it but once you get it it's really really simple it's beautiful so again I'm going to answer this question again how did I get my first clients Craigslist why dad to take us the best resources for Jengo YouTube YouTube YouTube and clothing for entrepreneurs he was one of my favorite resources for Jango look up on YouTube okay guys that's it thank you so much for watching thank you I love you guys I love your face this is Kazi i'll see you in the next livestream
