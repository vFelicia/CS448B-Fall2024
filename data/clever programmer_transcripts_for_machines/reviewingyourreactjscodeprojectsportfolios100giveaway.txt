today guys going back to the topic of today's session we are going to be testing your websites we're going to be checking if they're responsive is there if you have you submitted the code the github url i saw so many people submitted really really beautiful projects guys and it's just ah it kills me when i think because i think actually maybe i'm not sure about this one maybe it was this one um but guys there were some projects that i saw that were submitted and it just kills me that you guys are forgetting to put your github urls if you forget to put your github urls i can't give you personalized video feedback on your code itself i can give you feedback on your website so look at this one guys just to sort of break it up and give you a little demo in between that so look look at this watch this watch this like it's like the images are scaling in look at that that is what i call responsive guys that is what i call responsive like how nice is that all right that is a really really nice example of responsive design and look we've even got some we've actually got some state management here so look add to car add to cart buy some yeezys let's go ahead and check it out look at that nice and you know what blew my mind so not only have we got multiple products support here so you can you can add a bunch of product support here you've got a total um then you've got test payment using demo card so he's actually gone ahead and integrated stripe so let's go ahead and click let's go ahead and click pay now so i'm just going to go ahead and do um honey let's do something

sec don't wanna give you guys too many details in one sec so ahead if we go down here now check this out guys so if i go and put the card number in so four two four two four two four two four two two four two and then this one cv there we go and i click pay now oh i think there we go i'll go ahead and click pay now boom he just processed the payment successful payment that's what i'm talking about guys that is a working payment system if we click okay sure it's not doing a redirect but just that is amazing and even i saw the sign in guys we have normal signin methods here and we have sign up with google which is so cool to see and i did notice that when this loads up look he's using firebase which is awesome i love to see that guys i love to see some firebase use so that's amazing stuff

hit send let's go ahead and watch this right side boom look at that that's really nice we're going to dive into the code we're going to see how that's done but what i love to see guys is look it's built in or react so i'm just going to bring that down it's built and react you see that that's awesome guys so that is really really nice to see and if i go ahead and leave that kazi has left look at

going through them right so let's go ahead and wow guys check this out like we have a ton of submissions from you guys like this is just a few of the submissions that we have right now and you can see like it is full of everything that we have got right here so let's go ahead and check out the first one so here we have a todo app so i'm going to go ahead and open this up let's go ahead and give this a review so this is a todo app so here you go hello you are cool thank you very much we have full quad functionality apparently so let's go ahead and say this is a test update to do nice so it's actually working this is full quad functionality what i mean by crud is i can add a message so here i'm adding a todo so adding it to do and i click oh okay like adding a todo okay so guys did you see that you have to be careful with that honestly like when you have a form you have to make sure you call e dot prevent default to make sure that doesn't actually um that doesn't actually become the case so you don't actually want to have it so that bear with me one second guys you don't want to have it so that you accidentally um refresh your page because notice when i hit enter when i hit the enter key guys look what happens ah see we don't like that refreshing we don't like that refreshing also guys we like if you do build an app and you put this on your portfolio guys make sure that you style it okay like this is very like bare minimal basics and the problem with this kind of app is look if i go ahead and resize it i'm gonna start breaking things and now you have to be very careful here guys because this is the functionality is great so honestly keep up with the functionality um and let's go ahead and see who built this one so we have um abhishek dandriol so this is an amazing app bro but honestly make sure that you style it and make sure that you actually go ahead and add look even here we have i am a model so guys hey we don't want this we want a nice user experience but what's cool is that it's all persistent so i'm assuming this is on firebase so amazing stuff well done for doing that that's really really nice let's go ahead and move over to the next one uh let's go ahead and check out another one so we've here we've got name pro name proofer so let's go ahead and check this one so i'm just going to pull up the tables again so here we go we have a name proofer so an open source i can't see what it says an open source username availability checker nice so check out screenshot okay that's pretty cool so i'm assuming they're going to check all of these out and then we can go ahead and see that so let's go ahead and open this one up let's see let's see what this is about so while that's loading where can i submit my project for review click the link in the description bro and you can then submit your project and so there's a link in the description you can submit and you'll be brought to this page and you'll be able to submit your project over here so please go ahead and do that if you do want to be considered for winning this 100 prize so back to the project let's go here and now we can see that let's enter a username so let's say let's do demand so the man one two three and let's go ahead and check whoa check that out guys so it actually lights up and let's go ahead and do my username so this is my instagram right let's go and see what happens so if i do this check okay nice so they found like i think this means that they're going to be so signs are available silvers are taken greens are invalid but if i was to do this and check nice okay so i'm not sure the instagrams one's working okay apparently there was someone with that username nice so if i go ahead and do this right so i think no way somebody can't have that okay i mean maybe it's checking for a contains maybe it's checking here for that but the point is that's a really cool app guys that's really really nice so let's go ahead and check this out so we have dweep pancho so let's go ahead and dive into his code so i'm just going to go ahead and have a little check and firstly before i do that actually i just want to see if if we have a responsive site right now so let's go ahead and minimize this okay so you see here guys here what i would recommend is whenever you run into this problem make sure you guys make use of something called flexbox okay so in this case you see whenever you want to resize this stuff you want to be using something called flexbox and flexbox is going to allow you to have a responsive design so let's go ahead and check out that project what we talked about earlier which was uh this was blah blah blah i think i don't know if we have it open anymore um okay so it's not here but you see like whenever when i resize this one the app the website isn't gonna break right you see everything sort of starts to the images is shrinking correctly and everything works as it should flexbox is going to help you achieve that level of styling so back to uh the code for this project let's go ahead and have a look what he what did he use so we have app.js so let's go ahead and see here we have react so here we've got some you some hooks being used that's really really nice and we have a bunch of hooks being used this is awesome he uses some regex which is nice we have so this is some clean code right here so like here we have like some so a bunch of different promises this is a very nice way of handling this um okay this is really cool i think what you could do in this case is if you've got you see here guys we have a bunch of like repeated what seems to look like oh okay no it's not it's because we have different different um hooks being used but this is awesome this is really really nice i would recommend when your code starts to get past you see like here it's getting past the hundred hundred sort of uh 100 mark in terms of how many lines of code at this point guys i would really recommend that you go ahead and start refactoring so use like 100 as your sort of cut off you can actually start probably most likely refactoring most of this into separate components and you should be able to actually get ahead and make this code much more readable and maintainable but let's see how he's done his styling so guys i'm not a huge fan when it comes to doing inline styles right so i noticed here he's got class names of color descending but you see right here we have a mixture of css styling so this is going to be styled in a css file but then this is called an inline style right so inline oops inline style and the problem with this guys is that you have a mix and not only do you have a mix inline styles take precedence so these ones take so if let's say i have the same rule and then the css file and in the inline style the inline style wins okay the inline style is the one that takes precedence now when you when that you start to do that kind of stuff you're going to run into issues because you're gonna start having rules in your css file that aren't gonna be you think that they're not gonna be listened to when in reality you're just overwriting it with with this so this will actually go ahead and overwrite any css rules apologize for my handwriting guys i'm a coder i'm not the best drawer so there we go so here you can see like you're gonna have problems with that so just a little tip right there but in all honesty this is pretty cool this is actually a pretty nice project um we're going to just we're not going to dive too far deep into some of these but i like how he separated things out here we have a backend.js file which is nice so he has he's using process.n to keep his credentials very safe and secure which is really nice um so that's awesome so let's go ahead and jump out of this one so that's really nice and guys what do you guys think of this project so let me know in the comments now let me know in the comment section by dropping a number between 0 and 10 10 being amazing project like this thing it blew my mind and a zero being yeah you know we could do better but in this in this case i'll give this a solid sort of around the 7 mark because that's a pretty cool that's a pretty cool app right that's a pretty cool app so let me know in the comments what you guys think and if you're enjoying that smash the thumbs up button so let's go ahead and i'll keep an eye on the comment section as we go ahead and and we've got a nice little comment here saying hey sonny this is awesome thanks for doing reviews you are welcome dude and we will be happy to do this more often if you guys find it useful okay so let's go ahead and see so we've got eight five six okay so somebody gave it eight okay nice so somebody said hey it's honey big bro you are amazing we have a few numbers here we have a mix we have availa storm gave it an eight that's interesting nice so a lot of these i can see coming in at seven seven okay so nice seven six so let's give it let's give that one i would say a solid let's give it a six i think a six purely the reason why i'm gonna give this one a six is because the use case was amazing guys but the responsive design just didn't get me here right it just didn't didn't get me here and in terms of what we could have done is such a nice app guys it's a really really nice app but the responsiveness of the website let me down a little bit in terms of if i go ahead and change this to a mobile phone then again it does work pretty decent on a mobile phone let's go ahead and check an iphone okay but you see it starts to crop off and it could look amazing if we just use flexbox guys it could look so so nice and it could be really really good if we just used a bit of flexbox here um so let's go ahead and uh let me actually see if i could do something right now for you guys okay so we're not going to do that but oh here's using flexbox but i think the problem here guys is you should put all of these inside of one flexbox container so whenever you're using flexbox put all of these in one container and then apply your flex rules and then they would have been listed in a beautiful nice way um but yes let's give this one a solid seven let's give it a seven okay so moving on let's go ahead and check out some more of your guys projects so let me just make sure that i'm not going to post anything weird on the screen so let me go and check this out give me one second guys i'm pulling up all of your beautiful projects right now okay so oh here we go there you go let's unpin that one nice um okay here we go nice so i'm gonna go ahead and open up the grid view so there we go let's go ahead and have a look so now we have let's go and check out we've got the chat app i've seen a bunch of these chats so i'm going to pick something slightly different because guys we have a bunch to get through here today uh we have the amazon clone amazing to see that guys amazing to see that portfolio we have a realtime chat we have a movie radar interesting okay movie raider this is pretty cool let's go ahead and look at this one so you see what i mean guys there's some things that stand out like something which stands out is going to get my attention when it comes to this stuff um right nice this is pretty clean this is freaking please be responsive please i want this to be oh nice okay all right we have some responsive design right now so if i go ahead and click make this responsive look at this guys that's what i'm talking about that's exactly what i'm talking about that is what i call a clean look and fill look at that as it gets bigger it's splitting to a four a three a two and a one that's awesome if we go ahead and click this look at that it's really nice ui go ahead and click popular nice okay that's pretty cool and we get upcoming titles awesome now let's go ahead and click on watch trailer look at this guys he even puts the banner down here this is this is pretty nice it's pretty clean click play trailer and it renders the youtube video so this is actually really good i'm actually quite i like this one so let's go ahead and test something right now so here we have a film called the hunt so let's go ahead and use his search bar and type in the hunt nice look at that guys it's actually searching for everything with the honey let's go ahead and type in um i don't know let's just say journey so let's say journey or something like look a dog's journey the hobbit journey to the mysterious island nice this is a cool app this is a really nice app guys let's go ahead and see what the comments are saying about this this live streams oh nice i love stuff like that guys this live stream inspired me to learn and react i love that guys if you're enjoying it and if anyone else has been inspired by this smash the thumbs up button and let me know if you're psyched to carry one with these live streams and let's carry on going um so somebody says are you from england yes yes i am from england great question right so carrying on with the the the review so let's go ahead and dive into the code for this right so here we have g and this was by jean daniel d saw amazing work right here by gene daniel deities and let's go ahead and see so this was built with create react app so awesome stuff really nice to see that and you've used yarn i see so nice okay uh and let's go ahead and check the source okay firstly guys i really like how she split things up we've got an api inside of one photo we've got components containers really clean that's a good that's a good little pattern right here we've got images styles views and so forth let's go ahead and check the uh components this is what i like to see i like to see things when they're very like neatly organized we have movie details search components let's go ahead and check the card component this is what i'm talking about guys this is what you want you want isolated components you want small isolated components that you can upgrade and get things and you can build and add on top of right so we have a la quinley sorry if i pronounce that wrong thank you so much brother for the love and i really appreciate you being here right now and checking this out um okay so let's carry on with the review so let's go ahead and check out one of the components so here we have an example of the component so firstly very nice to see that they are using they are actually using a bunch of hooks so here we have a hook here we have prop types which is really nice so the prop types if you guys don't know enforce uh what a prop should be so imagine you had a bunch of props coming into your app so props props props here you would say basically like uh what the type of the prop was whether it was a number or whether it was a string so prop types is pretty much going to basically allow you to go ahead so let me go ahead and cut that oops let's go ahead and get that so prop types is going to allow you to enforce what type your prop should be so if it should be a string if it should be a number if it should be an object etc uh really really nice comments here by the way guys inspired you by your live streams awesome work thank you very much man um okay so let's go ahead and carry on so we've got a really nice this is called a destructuring so really nice to see some es6 functions right here uh and nice look at this guys he's even got this is some really really cool um this guy has been developing for a bit i can tell because he's got some very very nicely laid out code and he's using a a a library that concatenates classes called class names i've used class names before guys so this is actually a really really solid project so far so let's go ahead and check out movie details and let's go ahead and see this so here we have some more stuff there's some more styles right here we've got a so he's getting it from tmdb so awesome stuff tmdb is how we actually built the netflix clone so this phone that you see right here is pulling from the tmdb api so that's really really cool to see that um awesome so here we have axios axios is being used to make our requests to the api and that's awesome to see guys so he actually has props and he does console logs make sure you do clean up your console logs guys so when you do want to sort of submit your code make sure you don't leave any sort of over overhanging uh console logs in your project also i would recommend using prettier so you see here we have this white space very small issue but priya will help you get rid of that now here guys i recommend you see like we've got all of these sort of names right you've got class name you've got this class name you've got other class names something i really recommend that everyone goes and learns for all of to handle all of your class naming issues is something called bem right so i'm going to go ahead and uh let me just draw on the screen right now let's go ahead and draw this so guys if you want to get this nailed down and you want this to look clean as hell then i would recommend everybody goes and learns them class name convention so it's a convention um and that you got i recommend all of you guys go and learn and basically what it is is bem css so let's go ahead and check out bem it stands for block element modifier right now i know a lot of you guys thinking oh i have no idea what that means but i recommend that everyone goes ahead and checks out this website so it's pretty much bam so go ahead over to getbem.com and this will teach you how to name your classes right and it's very very good especially when you're doing uh react development okay so it's really really good when you do a reactive development so make sure that you guys go ahead and check that out okay um let's go ahead and see if the stream is good okay so everything seems to be okay right now everyone's saying the stream is lagging i apologize if the stream is lagging guys hopefully it clears up soon um but let's go ahead and back to the app so what i might do at this point is rather than going through the code of every single one let's go ahead and test the traits of different apps okay and then what we can do is the ones that make it to the sort of top tier level then ones we can actually go ahead and then ones we can go actually go ahead and give them a ranking from one stand so for this app guys i think this is a solid build i think this is a really nice app let's go ahead and give this a ranking between zero and ten guys i honestly think this is this is up there guys so let me know in the comments what you guys are thinking about this app right here guys let me know what you're thinking about this app because this is amazing and i will be dropping personalized video feedback for this exact app because this is a really really cool project here um which i actually i really like the front end i like how he's done it's got some really nice um styling on this page so let's go ahead and drop in the comment section below what we think this deserves in terms of a ranking i'm gonna give this in the meantime i'm gonna give this maybe an eight or a nine this is this is a good app right this is a really cool app okay so let's go ahead and check out some more projects so let's go see we have a bunch of different we have netflix clowns i'm going to try and check out the apps that we didn't actually build in the live streams so i want to go ahead and do something that we we haven't built in the live streams and hopefully guys that would actually help you guys um go ahead and get some more exposure to different kind of apps so all of the other apps here so you see this one so here we have a todo app portfolio so let's go ahead and check let's go have a look at this portfolio let's go and see what this one is about right let's go and see so here we go we got hello world i'm sea walk sand you a web developer awesome so somebody else just said your live stream sessions really motivated me to code react that's awesome to see thank you so much for your support and appreciate you guys being here right now um let's go have a look and let's go a bit down and see what we have right now so a lot of people asking what is my instagram id so if you are wondering guys just a quick shout is here is my instagram tag on the right so if you guys want to go ahead and follow me and you want to go sort of post a story and let me know how you're finding this video so far be sure to shoot a video on instagram and tag me and cleverkazy and thank the rest of the team if you know who they are nars jacob if you guys want to see them and you want to get there and a sort of conversation with them then be sure to tag them and we guys and we can start a conversation from that but let's go and have a look and jump into this um portfolio right here so i can't actually seem to scroll down oh let's go have a look we've got we've got a drop down right here we've got education and skills let's see um okay it says the stream is buffering so it's apologies guys if it is cutting out at all um but it should be clearing up soon okay so here you can see we've got a really nice portfolio actually over here but you see it seems to it seems to cut off underneath here so i mean okay so this is the latest but you see like small small things guys we want to make sure let me go ahead and check something yeah small small things guys we want to make sure that we aren't actually um that we aren't actually having design flaws like this right um so i see that the issue yeah so there is a bit of lag here guys i apologize for the delay but um hopefully guys we i'm actually going to go ahead and carry on with this video and what we can do is i will actually go ahead and review these myself and the stream should catch up by the time we go ahead and get started okay so let's go back and check this out so this app is pretty nice we have a very nice ui but again guys i don't like it when we can't scroll down like it looks beautiful it looks really nice but it's just a case of i can't like i have to click that little drop down in order to navigate the website and only then like you see there's a bunch of really cool apps here there's a music player which is really nice i can go ahead and click this so this i like this is really cool wow this is really cool now this is a really nice app and here you can see and let's go ahead and check if it's actually responsive so this is actually a very cool so you see right now he's got some overflow here which is nice but there's a little bit of a glitch here with the with the sort of um let's go ahead and click play oh nice so it actually goes ahead someplace nice that's pretty cool nice to see that okay so i can actually see a lot of people's coming in uh comments finally coming in about the movie app i can see nines and tens okay that is really cool to see guys so that movie app that we just demoed this one over here i believe everyone has given this a nine or a ten so that's actually that's pretty cool guys and that's really up there um this app right here is pretty cool as well but i don't i'm not a big fan of the user experience on this page it looks really nice but i have to click this top left awkward link to be able to get here so it's not a biggest fan of that guys not the biggest fan of that it should be very simple and i should just be able to scroll on my mouse um but i can't seem to get anywhere with it so you want to be careful of things like that when it comes to designing your apps um so having another look through this let's go ahead and jump into the gear no this is what i meant guys here we have an amazing github search app with some amazing functionality so this is the one i demoed earlier so sunny sanger we go ahead and click search this app's really nice like it's really really cool i would have loved to have seen the code for this i really really wouldn't love so let's go ahead and view his repositories and let's go ahead and see if we can actually get um some ah damn it so ahmed but lady if you are here then be sure to actually please please please maybe reupload with the code base because i would love to go and check your code and see how you did that right that would be an awesome thing to see and it'll be really really nice to see um how that goes um so moving on let's have a look at here we have snap it what is that so let's go ahead and check a screenshot validate email so let's go ahead and check this link out snap it so we here we have okay interesting oh nice okay look at this we actually have a little code terminal guys this is pretty cool this is pretty nice so look at this we have different coding languages here so let's go ahead and do javascript and let's go ahead and write some javascript in here so if i was to do like const name equals sunny that's pretty cool that's pretty cool and look at that if i was to go ahead and choose a completely different language like my sequel okay so it actually does okay i think what would make this app even better is if we had some some code which was actually rendered every time so you but you see it's got syntax highlight which is pretty cool but different code examples would be really nice for this but i can see the use case for this guys so let's go ahead and do css and if i was to get rid of this and do something like this now let's just say like let's just call it like um button class and you can see like let's go ahead and do something like display oh let's do background color white right well i think you just do it like this yeah background color white and you could do like font size equals like 20 pixels so this is awesome guys so like imagine you had this and then you had something like the button delete variant and let's say you had the button this is bem styles uh convention by the way what i'm doing here so you have the delete button and then we could also do something like the add button or something like that and then this one could have 22 3 pixels we've got 26 pixels and for example what you could then go ahead and do is just snap that so you can go ahead and screenshot that and you have a nice little thing so if i click snap it i wonder what that does does that actually post something into my okay i wonder what that snap does that would be nice if you actually sort of just like took a picture and maybe saved it as a download that would be kind of cool but that's really cool to see guys i like to see different use cases for that let's go ahead and check the code for that one let's go ahead and check the code for that one so amerban hello how's it going so that is my beautiful girlfriend i have not forgotten about you and thank you for always supporting me on these live calls love you to pieces and yeah there you go thank you ma i'm not for shouting that one out nice um i'm a knob says he's now in love with react i've always been in love with reactor i'm not it's always it's just one of those things all right so carrying on let's have a look at that code base we have source let's go ahead and look at this so here we have oh nice so here we actually have a context api so we have some a reducer here so we've actually got a date adobe and he's using typescript oh my god guys he's using typescript this is amazing i love to see projects that are using typescript and he's got a fullon reducer this is really nice and guys for a simple project because in for something which looks fairly simple he's actually built this out really nice he's got components with a folder structure here which makes a lot of sense we have a header here and you can see he's got a title and he's passing in oh my god and he's even using memo from react wow okay this is really really cool to see guys so if many of you guys who don't know about typescript typescript is basically what we call a superset so it sits on top of javascript and it allows you to have something called strongly typed like basically that type definition so it allows you to say if a variable is a string or if a variable is a number or if a variable is an object or array etcetera and it really will enforce that so it will prevent it from actually becoming a case where we have issues um where for example you're expecting a string and you get a number or you're expecting an object and you get an array typescript is going to allow you and force you to essentially have the correct data types it also gives you really good auto completion so the fact is that we saw that in here is really really nice to see um so let's go ahead and look through his code some more we have reducers tailwind okay really nice to see that app.tsx i love seeing app.tsx guys um because i know it's then in a typescript layout so i haven't got any fancy typescript stuff over here um let's go ahead and check out pages snap it dot tsx so quick mention guys i love it when i say oh my god he's even using used callback this is so cool and he's got the right type definitions for a select element okay this is very very powerful guys so for those of you who are new to typescript this may not make a lot of sense but what he's doing is he's using the the latest sort of react hook so he's got use state use callback use fetch context that's a new one interesting i haven't seen that one before but basically guys this and even use memo wow use memo guys is basically whenever we have an expensive sort of calculation in our code so for example if we have to map out a massive list of things then use memo essentially kind of kind of like it's like a cache which means that like if it loads it once and it takes ages to load it right it's going to just cache it and it's going to basically it's going to cache it and then it's going to essentially see um so let's go ahead it's going to catch it yeah and it's going to cache it and it's basically going to have it so that the next time it needs that element it doesn't need to rerender right it doesn't need to rerender it doesn't need to do all of those things it's actually just going to basically use whatever it just previously rendered unless the dependencies inside of this little square brackets change you'll notice this pattern um quite a lot in react and you'll see this more and more often where you have oops where you have uh you'll see this pattern more often wherever you where you need like a dependency to put inside of a hook for example we see that a lot in the use effect hook okay so yo sunny i can see you so we've actually got the clever programmer team shouting onto the page right now um awesome all right guys bear in mind yo is that code yeah i know right so here like we've got the team shouting out that the code terminal snap is lit and it is guys it is crazy and also guys if your comments are being delayed it is most likely because of the live stream so i can see a bunch of comments coming through but it seems like everybody thinks i'm not responding in time there is a little delay here guys so just be aware of that but yeah moving over to the snap it terminal this thing is crazy i think this is such a cool thing to see guys and it's actually such a clever use case i think we might we might actually use this like i find this a really really useful awkward moment when kazi is watching your live stream kazi what's up dude if everyone wants to give kazzy a shout out go ahead and drop him some love in the comment section yo where am i i'm not in the live stream awesome to see that oh man let's go ahead um how do i i think i've double it oh there we go nice so guys yeah i think this is actually a really cool one so let's go ahead and drop some fire for this uh project right here and if you guys want to drop a ranking from 0 to 10 where 10 is like holy crap i need this app in my life and where zero is like man we could do better than this i personally am going to give this this is hand in hand next to that movie app that we saw earlier so right now we have a pretty close battle here with the movie app and the snap it app i'm really liking bowfish but this one guys is using typescript so this one i love it for one main reason and that is we have typescript so not only is the use case really really cool but we have typescript which is an amazing superset of javascript and it basically just supercharges our code base so i'd recommend everyone goes ahead and checks that out okay so moving over to the next project um i thought so we have amino is a freaking legend shout out to my beautiful girlfriend lovely uh so let's go ahead and carry on so we have the oh wow dude we have a face detection app let's go let's check this one out let's go and see if this works okay so we have an image url so let me go ahead and pick an image um over here so let me go ahead and pick an image right here give me one second guys if i go detect enter image url so i need an image url so let's go ahead and drop it in here so so let's go ahead and boom oops there we go image url is going to be let's go ahead and grab an image of google's let's just go and say it ahead and say let's say steve jobs let's go get a picture of stevie let's see if it does face detection on steve jobs so let's go and grab a picture of steve and let's go again get this one copy image address and let's go back to oh my god i have so many tabs face detection and let's enter the image url boom detect what the hell that is cool guys if you guys like that app then drop some fire like that's pretty cool let's go ahead and do another one damn that's that's really nice guys i love seeing this i love seeing this i'm really just ah like i said guys i would love to see the github repo url for this because unfortunately i just i mean it's such a good use case but i need to see the code for that if i want to pick a winner for this but um amazing amazing let's go ahead and do another let's do mark zuckerberg and let's do let's make a harder one so this one he's standing a bit further back so let's go ahead and do copy image address and let's go ahead and not this one not this one not this let's do this one so detect okay oh wow that's insane yo that that's pretty cool that is that is pretty cool to see stuff like that i mean like damn it damn it i love seeing stuff like oh man that's a pretty cool app okay so guys let me know zero to ten on this app like oh i love it and look at the background guys i love seeing this like this little cool techie background i've seen this before as well if we change the width of this i wonder if that will actually make a difference okay awesome that's actually pretty cool okay so a nice nice use case there by md jamil kashem so really awesome stuff there dude uh we have a react lyrics app doh we haven't got the code we haven't got the github repo url so guys i really do want to see your code whenever you code this stuff so please please please do let me know so let's do a track name let's see what songs do i like uh let's go ahead and do let's do chris brown let's go and see chris brown yeah oh yeah we have some songs over here so let's do um do it okay i like this song this is pretty good oh nice we actually got the lyrics for it okay oh wait a minute there's some indian there's some punjabi oh going over here i didn't remember hearing that in the song um zach knight okay interesting so you have explicit no so we was actually pulling a bunch of sauces lyrics powdered powered by music match lyrics is not permission okay nice so i'm assuming this is pulling it from an api right here and actually we're actually using some code to do this but i can't see the code so unfortunately can't dive into that anymore so right now guys we have a nice little battle so so cozy we need to get sunny an internet connection it doesn't turn into a wooden potato yeah we do guys this needs to be fixed up and i will be looking into a connection that will get this up and peeked out because we had nearly had 700 people on this on this thing which is insane right uh okay let's go ahead and check it out right so a few more apps to look at so we have webdevs.com i think i saw that one it was a sort of uh directory let's go ahead covet 19 tracker okay let's keep going so kovid 19 tracker by my nan so my nan sha some fire right here guys because i'm gonna open this one up and i really do okay so we have this one this one i really like this is all on one page right so we have afghanistan let's go ahead and check that out we've got a few here so austria but guys this one is amazing so good work but uh manan sorry not sure but i saw something else which was just like an enhanced version of this by mamik das okay oh i wasn't sharing my screen sorry about that guys so the first one i mentioned was this one right here the kovid 19 tracker so argentina you see this like look dynamically updates the stats everything gets pushed out which is that's really cool right but we have that and then we also have this one which is covid info i think this is the one i was meant thinking about earlier so let's go ahead and check this one out it also might be slowing down because i've got a bunch of things opening on there but you see we have this really nice looking website and guys something i loved about this was is it responsive let's go ahead and check out is it responsive okay so uh let's go ahead and see so right let's go ahead and make this smaller look at that guys so firstly that's really nice and responsive let's see if we get the break point big enough it gets bigger it gets bigger it gets bigger oh snap nice so notice guys how if i draw around this so let's go ahead and pay attention to this section right here we pay attention to that section right here watch what happens when i resize so look at this movement snap nice that's amazing to see that we have a drop down instead now let's go ahead and check out the stats section and we hear we have the exact same sort of similar layout that we saw in the previous build um so really really nice they must be using the same similar library here or pulling this from somewhere but this is really nice to see so we have current stats and then on the international scale we have a really nice diagram which shows us all of the stats we have frequently asked questions this isn't this is insane this is actually a really cool use case for an app so i'm just going to go ahead and check out the code base for this so let's go ahead and check out the code base for this um let's go and see so we have source and here we have an api we have components and we have the images so i'm hoping that the components are broken up nice okay so the components are broken up in different photos we have cards.js so here we have some functional components which is awesome to see we have a react loader spinner i love uh libraries like this they're quite cool they allow you to have a little cool spinner when things are loading um which is dope um so it's carrying on and i can see here we're using bootstrap so nice he's using bootstrap guys i'm personally i mean like let me know what your thoughts are on bootstrap right so i'm kind of i'm kind of in between on it right so and i can see the numbers are now coming through for the previous project that we spoke about um so the snap it we saw some nines we saw some tams damn guys so i think it was not snap it we were talking about the face tracker so that's insane guys so i saw some tens come through because remember we are a bit delayed on the comments and live stream chat which is insane um i'm a bit i'm a bit like back and forth on bootstrap let me know in the comment section it's bit of a controversial topic some people love it some people hate it i'm on the fence i kind of wrestle with bootstrap when i use bootstrap i'm kind of fighting with it to get my rules in place instead of bootstrap rules so if you find that this is sort of like you find this issue too let me know in the comment section because i want to know if am i alone in this like do i am i the only one who fights with bootstrap or do you guys have that issue too if you do let me know in the comment section and if you guys are enjoying this remember smash the thumbs up button because it's always nice to get this video out to as many people as we possibly can to provide value to as many of you guys as we possibly can okay so let's carry on with this review so this is a really really cool app guys the kovid tracker here we have some very nice code he's used bootstrap very nicely we have the country selector so let's go ahead and check this one out and here you can see look here's how he is fetching it so he's using an async core and each side of the use effect and guys i don't tend to okay so this is something which i spot quite fairly a few amount of times we don't actually want to put the modifier so this set fetch countries inside of our dependencies you only want to put a raise like as in not array so you only want to put the actual variables here okay so you only want to put the variables of things here right because when you put this this is the function that we use to actually modify so what we're saying is we're saying fire off this code every time the function changes but the function isn't ever going to change it's going to be the variable so it's going to be fetched countries so in fact what we should be doing here is i mean right at this point we should actually be leaving this maybe blank we shouldn't actually be using this um we shouldn't actually we don't actually seem to have any dependencies here um that need to be in this block so i would actually go ahead and remove this because we don't actually need this okay uh also i just wanted to shout out some comments right now so i can see a reef islam effect says sunny i like your teaching style it makes me more serious about react.js thank you amazing to see that i really really do love when i see comments like this it's really a great thing to see thank you so much for the kind words and i hope you can stick around and if you're enjoying that be sure to um my mics in the way but be sure to shoot an instagram story tag me in it and

four live weekly coaching calls with myself with nars with jacob all of these people are here to help you become a javascript guru and actually go ahead and crush it with javascript and guys we don't just teach you how to learn how to code we teach you how to go ahead and earn some money with javascript because that's what we care about so if you guys are interested link in the description be sure to check it out 30 day money back guarantee definitely go and check it out if you are interested and guys if you don't enjoy it you can cancel on the 29th day no problem okay so make sure you do check that out if you're enjoying the video okay so i can see a lot of people are saying we can't see the page um oh yeah i think that is from previously before when i realized i wasn't sharing the page okay let's go ahead and carry on with the review so this one right here is an amazing project guys the kovid tracker so i just want to get some some numbers here guys so this one is a really clean build for me i even like how they've designed it over here like you see it's very nice i mean there was one element which i wasn't a fan of which was this like i'm not sure why we have this massive gap underneath here but i mean it's not the it's not the worst issue it's just the case of the user experience here was just slightly off just a tiny bit off by that small like i don't know why we have this gap but beyond that also look at this guys look news look at this little loader so this is asynchronous work at hand here really really nice loader here and um yeah so this is awesome so here we have some news about kovi 19 unfortunately it's not the best news but the reality is is the code itself is great and it looks really fantastic and everything in in there is really really good so let's see who made this project mimik das excellent work dude really really nice to see that um let's go ahead and have a look at some of the comments um this face section okay so i see a lot of people actually recognize the face detection app so nice it's really cool to see that um you guys are awesome i tried the first time and it's up and running in one go awesome would love to see that when people are actually trying out our live sessions and following along with us and doing really well that is what we want to see and hear guys um really really great stuff okay so let's go ahead and have a look we have a grocery app let's go ahead and check that one out so we actually had actually one i wanted to see was the shopping app so we have a few here that have just come through we've got ui gradient cpu merge and guys yeah if you're new to this video right now make sure you've got a super chat whoa somebody actually just donated hey look at that thank you so much rishabh so let's go ahead and see so richard jane says hey snap it does create a screenshot for your code i accidentally pushed a buggy version some time back i just fixed it also how would you rate it so i just want to say guys this is rashab's code honestly this is dude this has really impressed me like i'm not joking this is something which i mean i've seen this and i actually feel like i'm gonna personally use this when i'm making some coding examples and things like that and the fact is that you coded this not just in javascript dude but in typescript like you went above and beyond that's what we want to see and i love to see that sort of like energy and let's go ahead and see that what happens if i resize this is it responsive let's go ahead and see like oh my god look he even made it responsive guys so like a minor minor issue with the the top and that but beyond that guys look at that the actual look at that he actually has a break point here which is going to detect that's what i'm talking about that's really really nice that you thought about that as well um so i just fixed it also how would you rate it i would personally i'm going to give this honestly i'm going to give this a 9. i'm going to give this a solid 9 because in terms of the actual use case for it it's so handy like this is a really really handy tool to use and i can actually see how we can benefit from this and how we can actually go ahead and use this so this is amazing guys this is really really nice to see um let's go ahead and we've got clever programmer i love merge sort visualizer oh this is nice let's go ahead and see this what's this one so uh i just how do i um let me go ahead and unpin this one there we go nice so ten out of ten hey guys please share the game links of these projects with us i will try to guys there are a lot of projects here um the winners one i will go ahead and try and get the permission from the winner to go ahead and share that with you but let's carry on guys let's carry on with this let's go ahead and move forward so somebody actually submitted oh it's a shame this was actually one of those cool sort of merge sorting you know those merge sorting algorithm ones but they've gone ahead and given us the github link as the oops oh god this is horrible they've actually gone ahead and given us the github links instead um which is not actually the greatest thing because we can't actually go and see a live demo of the app so unfortunately i won't be able to look at that one because like i said guys you need to deploy your app in order for us to get this tested and go and see what's going on um right the github search engine i loved it but we just we don't have a live version of it up uh we don't have the github code there guys we have a photo gallery here let's go and check this one out let's go and check this one out here so we've got a nice little loading indicator we have a nice little photo album album so here if i type in like sun for sunny and then here oh nice that's pretty clean okay nice cool now let's go ahead and resize this to go ahead and see this okay that's what i like to see we have a small issue when it kind of gets to this break point but beyond that nice to see like look there you go i can see what the aim here was guys little trick for you you see how that image is getting stretched right whenever you have that if you go ahead and apply the following css rules so i'm going to go ahead here and open so this is something me and qazi went over the other day and he found it really useful so i think you guys might find this useful as well i'm going to go ahead and make this huge how do i make this pretty big so but but uh okay oh wow okay there we go much bigger so what i want you guys to do is go ahead and apply the following style when you see this issue so if you just want to select this so imagine you had your style here you're going to do object fit contain now if you do that guys you do object fit contain and you do width of okay so it's gonna just it's gonna do in this case it's gonna do it's just it will keep the aspect ratio so now look what happens so even if it like stretches in and gets smaller can you see how it doesn't stretch the image it will keep the aspect ratio that's really clean and that's really really the sort of the sort of the design and functionality that we want to go for when we are building these sort of apps okay so that's really really something that you guys want to be sure to be keen and make sure that you take into account but it's just a little top tip for you guys but this is a really nice project this is really really nice let's go ahead and check out the github for this uh let's go ahead and check out the github for this yep so we have a source and we have components inside of it so it's very fairly similar a simple app compared to the other ones we saw but nevertheless it's very clean guys very very clean build i'm gonna go and check out the image search here we have some es6 we have functional components here amazing stuff um nice to see that guys um i'm enough just popped out a good little uh comment here so it's very easy to style your react app with tail and css so if you guys actually are interested in tailwind css let us know in the comment section and i will be happy to sort of drop a video on that because i personally haven't used tailwind css much but i'd be more than happy to dive in and learn that so i can go ahead and bring some value to you guys um good comment uh amanath really nice you guys that you gave that one out um let's go ahead and have a look at this so carrying on so here we go guys here we go so we have the coding value we have heroku app ui typing speeding okay so typing speed game so ready to type let's go ahead and give this go so click and type so okay okay eight whoa z okay okay i'm trying three s w o b o but this should be a sentence right this is okay so i i mean i like it i do like it but it's more like a tap the letter game as opposed to a live game but right now i mean i would i would have found this pretty cool if it would have been a case of like i would typing out the actual words and then it would come up but overall very nice app and it's quite a clean looking ui um but let's continue on guys let's look and continue looking on so we had the face detection app we had a very nice shop that i'm trying to find so the grocery shop was cool but there was actually one here so i think it might have been this ecommerce one so we have the clothes shop the heroku app so i think this might be it guys so i'm gonna go ahead and close a bunch of these apps because i think they might actually be slowing things down so let's go ahead and close these apps oh okay so we're going to keep this one open because movie radar was on my top tier um this was one of the top apps for me so this one so the clothes shop heroku app this one is awesome guys so this one is actually really really cool uh and we can actually go ahead and if we go to the shop you can see that we've got all of the shop items so i actually demoed this one earlier on um and you can add some items to the shop and actually it persisted the data so i actually came back to the website and it kept track of my stuff that's really cool that's a really nice build please say okay and we have the app let's go ahead and let's go ahead and check this out so they actually they're using persistence so either for a data layer so here we have redux oh this is just this just got interesting we have redux inside this project guys so redux inside this project so here we have a reducer so let's go ahead and check out the reducer i'm not going to dive too much into redux because i feel like those of you who haven't used redux may get lost here but i'm going to quickly run through it he has set up his reducers very nicely and he split them up between the users the cart the directory and the shop so imagine like you have a data layer he split them up into four sections one for the user one for the cart one for the directory one for the shop okay um so that's what he's gone and done right here and let's go ahead and check out the components themselves so the components themselves are very nice layout here he's got a car the cart com car drop component.jsx awesome stuff so here we actually have um car items history cart action okay nice we have a bunch of stuff here he has his redux down at the bottom this is okay guys this is and he's using sass for his css right this is actually a this is a top contender right now guys because not only has this app gone above and beyond it also has a bunch of cool functionality in so if i want to go back to this app and go and check this heroku app out right now check this out guys so not only has it got this but we have sign in with google so it pops up with google sign in we have some sign up process here so let's go ahead and do like this so sssanga sunny gmail.com for example instead of abc abc submit boom there we go so the redirect's not working as such but he has some routing so you can see over here we have some routing going on over here so he's probably using react router in this case he's got some nice visuals here it's a responsive app really beautifully responsive app guys this is this is one of the top contenders i think honestly this is one of the top contenders we have sahil desai says you are love sonny really appreciate the support dude thank you for watching love you guys too um let's carry on with this build so here we have uh so you have authentication we have this guys he even had stripe integrated right he even had stripe integrated so here we had like the billing information and then we processed the payment earlier that's really cool like that is a really cool use case i think right look at this we even have for the home page i mean it was a bit confusing because when i was on this page i didn't see that so i would have maybe flipped this design around and had it the other way around but here you can see guys men's section oh wow look at this hat section oh wow it's even categorized this dude's done pretty sick nice this is really nice i really do like this app damn okay so this carry on let's carry on so guys this is something which i i am definitely definitely considering to be a top contender here so this is one of the top contenders guys if you think so too and you agree with me then be sure to let me know in the comment section right now and i want you guys to write uh 0 to 10 and next to it write clothes app okay so 0 to 10 and next to it right close up or close or something so that way even though there's a little delay going on right now i can see what you guys are voting for okay so here we have the final contender so to prep it up to to sort of prepare this right now let's go ahead and let's go ahead and actually wrap up this sort of final contender so before we actually went ahead and we gathered some of the sort of projects that we thought matched the winning description for this project for this uh contest guys and we actually came up with a few right one of them was this clothes app right so this close up really did stand out beyond the rest it has authentication it has react context api has redux which is amazing um so this is number one this is like one of our top contenders right now so i'm just going to pull that to the side for a second and then we had another one which was the movie radar so the movie radar app so this one was another one which i really do enjoy and i really do love so let's go ahead and check out the so this is the app that i was talking about guys i forgot i wasn't showing my screen so we had the first app which was the clothing shopping so this is a top contender which has redux authentication a bunch of stuff and then we have the movie radar app which is insane as well i really do love this app and i think they've done an amazing job at taking pretty much what we taught maybe i'm not sure if you built this before you saw the netflix video but you took something which we had taught and you ran with it and you pretty much done really really well with that so amazing stuff right there awesome what i'm gonna do now is essentially go ahead and get the final so we have two contenders right here and the final one i think guys honestly it has to be the snap it up i mean this one just blew my mind when i saw it it was so nice so clean and i just it's such a functional use case like i think it's just such a good project like i really think it's a really good project like i know it's so simple but the thing is like every it really does get like a nice consistent sort of it's a very usable project right and i can see a lot of people are saying the live stream is lagging a little bit i'm sorry for that guys once it goes up it will be clearer and it should be the issue should be fixed okay and we shouldn't have this issue anymore um moving forward now so we have um let's go ahead and guys if it is lagging to you feel free to actually just rewind a little bit and then it can pretty much um if you want feel free to rewind a little bit and then you should actually avoid that buffer because you'll get by the time you get up to speed we would have crossed that issue with the connection okay so awesome so now what i'm going to go ahead and do is i'm going to close this one because that might be causing
