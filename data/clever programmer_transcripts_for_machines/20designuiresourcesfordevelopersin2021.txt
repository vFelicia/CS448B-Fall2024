you guys i want to talk about the top designing ui resources that you can use as a developer so i feel like tools and having a good toolkit you know around you if you're a developer is going to do you great justice in the world because ultimately i wrote about this in one of our emails actually we were talking about you know how each different artist uses different type of tools so if you are let's say a painter you use paint brushes and paint and if you are you know a construction worker you use maybe you know rulers and an actual just just in general tools right that help you make that job but us as you as ui ux designers and developers we need tools that help us build you know the websites that we need and things of the sort so that's why i started this list how's everybody doing checking out everybody in the chat looks amazing much love from the whole cp fam i missed you guys anyways let's let's continue let's go on so people might ask you know why resources why resources frankie feels like most of the videos that you do man you're going over resources and you're teaching us a bunch of things but do we really want to know those things i'd say yes you do want to know these things just because of the fact that if you do end up picking them up man it's going to save you so much time it's going to help you learn the right way because it's not only about learning it's about learning the right things you know and you got to make this sustainable and fun by the way so this is why we're going to go over in the beginning i wanted to save you guys a little bit of time thank you guys for being here you know the people that waited i know it's it's a live event it's the premiere thank you guys so much i know it's late in a lot of parts of the world but as dj khaled right now is showing you guys you know we're going to talk about the best resources first and he says we the best just like cause he's ringtone of every but if anybody saw the the vlogs that we put out but you know off the bat i wanted to start with the best in the list because you know i want to save you guys time and also i feel like this specific list it's a list uh it's a github repo made with resources for web developers but it was made by traversing media i saw it i'm like man i got to give you know recognition to this company this guy it's amazing guys if you do want to check it out i'm going to show it here i'll try to link it i'll try to link everything in the description but it's it's dope it's amazing you know just going over it a little bit it has a bunch of i'm gonna i'm actually gonna zoom in a little bit let me see okay i see that you guys can see a little bit better so it has everything right so if you want to know a little bit more about icons and get specific maybe svgs or you know even even different pngs here you can see it has a description of what it is and also the website so if you click on it it's gonna take you to the website so this is a huge library that traversing media put in their github repo and it's it's out there for you guys a lot of these um specific things that i'm about to mention in this video do appear here not everything i did want to mention things that i felt were very valuable and are used by our team by myself people that i know all of these things but off the bat i know if you guys go here you're going to save yourself so much more time you don't have to do all the research people have done it for you now just trust the process guys find the tools and learn how to use them so that's a great resource okay and another big big thing as i was doing my research of you know the best things that i can show you guys you know where you can learn where you can get inspiration where you can get you know all your whether those are you know photoshop files have svg files png files all these things that help you design a website or even just in general you know anything design wise you know i stumbled upon designresource.es and it's an amazing website that i actually want to dive deep into in this video and if i click on it it's kind of like traversing media's i i was really not showing sorry about that guys but if yeah if i want to go deeper into this it's kind of like traversing media's list but in this list specifically let's actually zoom in a little bit so you guys can see so in this list specifically you can see how it's actually very much like um the the presentation style of of traversing but it's a little bit prettier right you want to go and learn about what type of apps or tools you can use as a designer in design systems you'll go into you know here in design systems right if you want to go and check out mockup tools you go into mockup tools and you'll see animal mockup and then you click on the link it shows you that so people have already done all of this work for you guys now it's up to you to use it and i'm leaving it here in the beginning for you guys so unsplash it's a great one too i didn't mention it but i've used it a lot of times as well but this is it so this is the website you guys can follow it it's it's amazing and we'll go deeper into that as we go but as of now i did want to touch on cool things that i've stumbled upon myself and let me see who's here man amazing we got 45 likes right now appreciate the love guys i missed you know being here live with you guys i miss just talking to everybody that's out right there in the world wanting to learn about ui and design in general so people say i'm late what did i miss i just missed a few resources man you might want to go back and pick up those things because it might save you a lot of time let me see who else is here nice people from turkey nigeria logan hey frankie what's up brother what's up logan how you doing man uh hopefully man you can enjoy this i'm going over a fun a few fun things so going over you know specifically going into the laws of ux i feel like this is a great little thing to have because you know as you're starting a design sometimes you kind of just project you kind of want to project or just experiment what you want to try you know depending on what you feel looks nice and sometimes you even you haven't even tested you know the the actual practicality of your buttons you haven't resorted to heat maps or anything like that to tells you to tell you you know the history of a user's mapping of a user or anything like that i think it's amazing if you can go into a website that shows you a little bit more about details of use like this one specifically it's 20 loss of ux and this is law number one apparently you know aesthetic usability effect users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable amazing so it's two birds in one stone then you go into two and two is productivity source when a computer and its users interact at a pace less than 400 milliseconds that ensures that neither has to wait on the other so wow already it's giving you tweaks practical tweaks you can use on your design to make a specific change in interactability and if you want to go deeper you can go into every law i mean i think it's great as a reminder but i think it's also cool just to have around before you start to go into design and here i wanted to add this little gif because i thought it was funny man i love this movie um zootopia if anybody has seen it drop it in the comments below what is up guys how is everybody doing their front end is somewhat of a designer as well yep i agree man sound fantastic official just said i agree man it has a lot to do with design and ultimately design drips into any every other part of development as well so going into photography and video which is a huge part of just any website if you see any websites in general you can see an image here you can see you know specifically you know how the spacing looks the hover effects the shadows all of these things are part of effects part sorry part of design and in general graphic design and in general just part art in general you know if you're doing if you're doing sketches if you're doing all these things all these principles apply the shadows the hover effects all of these things right this is a great resource that i myself love we use it a lot here in the team it's called remove.bg and remove.bg is awesome because it saves you a lot of time instead of going into photoshop taking out a background what you're going to do is go into remove.bg and do i have it here i do have it here man so you literally literally just drag let's see let's drag um do i have any images here chilling it's because this one doesn't have a background let's see what is this okay for the sake of for the sake of it or the live i'm not gonna do it live but i mean you drag an image there and it pretty much takes off the background and that's amazing to save you time canva is a tool that i really really love i know it's been you know mentioned a lot so many people love canva so many people never actually a lot canvas a response is responsible for making so many people not learn photoshop because they're like oh man i don't even need photoshop i can use canva but canva is has been tested throughout time and people still use it it's a great resource if you want to use you know different let's go over it a little bit if you want to go into it and use maybe you know you can use it as photoshop you can use it as as you know social media posts inspiration you can use it as having layouts and templates for social media maybe you want to do you know inspirational posts for your channel your instagram something like that you can use it flyers you know presentations even for instagram stories so canva already saves you so much time and i feel like right now it's it's it's such a big time for for consistency and you know if you are a developer and you are a designer as well a lot of design in general right now has to do has needs a lot of consistency and i mean consistency in the term of you need massive distribution of your work you're always pumping out content you're always pumping account if you're a designer for a specific brand you might always be pumping out whether that's you know inspirational quotes or anything of the sort or also yo frankie is back good to see you man hey what's up arifat nice to nice to see you brother thank you for having me here but yeah what was i saying um yep consistency man and these tools that make it easier for you to finalize work are gonna make you the difference between you and the person working next to you they're gonna give you an edge so these tools are gonna keep you consistent and that's why i like it pixels is really nice because a lot of times when i'm editing a video or i'm you know whether i'm doing a landing page anything of that sort i always think about having a nice background for example here in this pixels website this is a screenshot of the pixels website and pixels pretty much is you know free stock images so you search any image right here let's actually do it because i put the link here let's put let's find i like dogs but let's let's look for cats boom you see all the images that you can use for free of cats different sizing all of these things right so pixels is really really nice you can also do the same thing with videos so it has 162 videos 3.23 k photos and you can use all of these videos as well so pixels is really nice i don't know what users is people i'm i guess okay users and so that's a great great resource i feel for example they're using a an actual image behind it and it's very common for you know website design right now to have images in the background or even videos on the background that's also very common you can see it on the top major websites right now the most popular ones at least we're at 85 likes people thank you guys for watching if you guys are here right now make sure you smash that like button because i'm giving you guys fire if you do use this in your daytoday life i assure you that your skills are just going to go up and up and up because not only are we showing you guys resources but the fun part about these resources is you can actually get inspiration you can actually extract and absorb all of these skills to your own skill set and actually apply them right so that's gonna improve your income improve your skills improve you as a person and the impact that you can do whether that's on a company or for yourself so moving forward we're going to talk about iso republic it's the same thing with images i'm not going to go into it it's pretty much the same thing as what was this pixels so you know it's the same type of concept it's it's another option for you guys because i do use both of them i like both of them i prefer pixels in my opinion but here is another example of it and cover i really really loved because i felt like this is one of the type of products that the workplace i'm sorry the market just requires let me take a little bit of water um i see you guys here alexander what's up man greetings i i love that guy he's always i don't know why he always um every time he sends something he has a plus sign in front of of his word i don't know if he's doing like a git committee or something but that's pretty funny anyways cover i feel like it's kind of a product that the market just required it somehow because so many websites use videos in their landing page you know i think cover has a video behind it yep so it has a video behind it and it's it's very common nowadays i think some nike websites have it like that a bunch of websites have it like that so let's see maybe vampires and you can look for stock footage there's actually none no no vampires if you want to use vampire footage probably don't don't use cover guys but okay so we're looking at this and you can just extract it for free and use it on your website cover is amazing it really does add a lot of depth a lot of heart to your designs if you are using uh a specific video on your website it gives so much more context like you can't you can't even say the same within the image you know images say a lot but if you have a video you know if if an image is worth you know a thousand words how much is a video worth i've thought about that before it's kind of funny anyways um let's see what people are saying here best youtube channel i like to watch in any time you guys motivated thank you dello i really appreciate that man wish i could share this with you guys but my comments apparently are not working psy says on splash unsplash is amazing man i did want to mention it and i did show it in in the beginning when i'm going over those resources that we're going to actually go through a little bit more right now but as of now i just kind of want to ease you guys into it and show you guys different areas of design and where you can use them on your websites so off the bat if you're designing i feel like it's going to be super important i've actually used this in another presentation but i feel like it's worth mentioning just because if you guys had these three tools right here if you're using mac i'm sorry if you are a windows user i actually was a windows user my whole life till up to two years ago or a year ago and i just fell in love with the mac echo system anyways you can use and find you know the the windows version for these tools i bet so please if you guys do see the windows versions please drop it in the comments below that's how i'll let's help out all of the windows users rocket is amazing because it lets you do emojis it lets you type in emoji let me see if i can show you guys here um so let's uh actually go here and if i type in maybe punch yep i'll do a punch boom so that in itself is rocket guys and that's why rocket is so amazing if you are if i'm doing lists sometimes i do you know emojis of check marks which help me make visual arrangements of my own notes and it's amazing two alfred is amazing too let me see if i can show you guys alfred is cool because you clicked instead of using spotlight on your computer you click you know command and space which is the hotkey that i used to open it but you see this little thing that i just opened up that i'm typing in it's a pretty much spotlight but it's a little bit smarter and the thing about this is you can go like fine and then you can screenshot and you get a screenshot you know so or you get any file that you want so you can even use it as a calculator so one two plus three equals 15 right so it's a really useful really resourceful yoink i don't know if you guys can see it right now but it's gonna be okay it's on the side of my screen right here and it's pretty much a clipboard where you can pretty much drag things from and and off of it you can also lock them so if you want to lock them and and maybe not erase them that's why you use yoink so if you're a designer man you're going to be working with a lot of you know jpegs a lot of files that you're gonna be moving around so many different desktops and these three tools are gonna make your life so much more simple if you get these three tools you're gonna save yourself so much time it's like investing a little bit of money because this is eight dollars a drink i believe is eight dollars alfred is free and rocket is free so you know eight bucks pretty much and then you can get the paid version if you do like them or if not just whatever just you know go on with your life let's see what else is going here alfred is cool for mac uh arifat says you can use hane for video windows oh nice hein that's awesome so there's a alfred alternative called hind for windows if you guys like that click the link below actually drop it in the comments below i mean um so other people can know so moving forward i feel like you know if you're a designer obviously you're going to be working with people and 114 likes guys oh my god that is amazing let's try to get that to 150 thank you guys so much for being here and actually enjoying this content i'm gonna try to make it really a little bit more fast pacey for you guys so you guys can digest it but anyways i do and i am excited to share that you know if you are working with a team you really do need droplet because dropper is an amazing tool that just let me actually see if it's here so it's an amazing tool that lets you share screenshots just like this so this is a screenshot and then you can pretty much make a little rectangle around it an arrow so that you can pinpoint exactly what you're trying to achieve with that screenshot so i don't know if if if we can test it out here but let me see okay so okay yep it did work so that's a screenshot and now what i'm doing is boom and and i'm going to be like yo make this is how fast i'm doing it make the text bigger so off the bat i can point to something specific in design and just say to make it bigger so now i save and copy url and if i want i just open it on a new tab right now so as you guys can see that's how fast it was and i can just pinpoint things in design that i want to change with other people so off the bat guys i did want to mention that if you are working with people you have to use things like dropper cool fonts there's so many things so many websites that people mention when they're talking about fonts fonts are super important guys if you are doing design specifically if you're doing websites you know try to keep it to two to three fonts per website please you know in no design you want to see 50 types of websites unless that's you know what you intended for but honestly you can spend your whole life looking for different font websites but to be honest guys most of your problems are gonna be solved if you just use google fonts it's good enough it's amazing okay so if you do you know wanna dive deeper into it there's so many different font websites the font uh you know freaking be font all of these type of websites that are really cool that i use myself too but google fonts is pretty much all you need so you know off the bat i didn't want to mention that get it off the way because it's a huge plus to know typography to know you know the science of lettering pretty much it makes your designs pop and make you seem more knowledgeable about design and actually makes you way more wellrounded as well so dribble i feel like it's an amazing resource that i wanted to add here because i've we've actually used dribble before here in this you know on our list because it's been such a great you know helper for a lot of our designers a lot of our people that follow us nice 132 likes people are actually paying attention you guys are amazing guys thank you so much yo bro i'm a developer you are showing really great resources thanks for your help man michael michael brazen thank you man i really do appreciate that that's you know what we do here in clever programmer man we try to make it simple for you guys so that you guys can you know earn more money get better skills and become better as people because if we become more wellrounded we can apply that to different parts of our lives whether that's fitness relationships people in general or just you know mastery of self pretty much guys dribble we're gonna go into it right here it's one of the top websites right now guys everybody's recommending dribble because it's so good excuse me so oh man i got a little bit um carried out carried away there but it's so amazing because everybody's actually you know look hot jar everybody's actually using dribble to get inspiration to get ui kids to now i'm seeing people are using it as as um a way to advertise themselves so different companies are using dribble they're making content on dribble so that you can actually see their companies wow so dribble you can get animations you can get branding ideas ui kits illustrations you know files all of these things and everything is top notch look at this it's amazing artwork it's curated very very well now i get a feeling like it's kind of turning into in pinterest and i did want to add pinterest to this list because i personally use it a lot i did i decided not to use it on this list specifically but pinterest is you know if i do want to get designed for whatever it is whether it's a thumbnail or whatever it's whether it's a video whether it's just in general pinterest is an amazing amazing tool but you know that was dribble everybody loves it that's what i wanted to share with you guys don't sleep on it lapa is amazing i actually learned about this specific tool from nas you know and if anybody knows not everybody knows nas what's up nas this guy is probably dancing upstairs but this is a great tool because lapa actually shows the top the best landing pages and literally the best landing pages in the world as inspiration sorry about that guys i feel like my my throat is a little bit um sore so give me one second i love those seconds of silence because i feel like we're just breathing together a little bit but you know going back to lappa lapa is amazing because they're top design pages and you get to get inspirations from them whether it's files you know just in general you know the the sizing of it in general layouts or the colors the palettes all of these things it's it just shows you you know how other companies are doing it and that's in my opinion one of the best ways for you to learn things is learning from the best if you can learn the style from a very successful person whether that's a style and design whether that's a style than maybe playing soccer anything in general you're just going to app up your skills way more because they did a lot of research so they're saving you so much more time just by copying them okay so that's something that i'd say lapa is great for that behance behance it's really really cool man i love it i love it it's a very it's kind of a it's one of those you know websites sorry 140 likes man oh man you guys are making me cough that's amazing holy cow thank you guys so much let's get it to 150 guys let's drop some love let's drop some likes and some comments you know we're all here to learn behance or behance is really cool because it's one of the pioneer websites that actually made a type of community where you know whether you're a developer or just graphic designer in general or just architectural you know designer whatever in general it's a great way to have a community to get inspiration for whether that's photoshop that lightroom presets you know whether that's illustrations and maybe files for adobe xd and and just in general you know how to you know wireframe ideas for after effects anything of that sort is going to be part of behance beyond apparently it's part of adobe i didn't know that i don't know they bought it apparently they bought it um very recently i didn't know that that's crazy i don't think it's always been um adobe's adobe's actual company that's amazing man but it reminds me a little bit of envato um behance is one of those that are one of the pioneers back in the in the day and i did want to give a mention to you know different mobile development type of resources because mobile development although it's not as much used as it used to be a little bit before you know people are not downloading as many apps as they used to now we're using a lot of more web applications 145 likes hey let's get it guys thank you guys so much we're about to go to 150 likes thanks so much gonna go into mobile development right now one of the cool things that i saw was actually patterns patterns is amazing because it shows you different ways and inspiration for you know how to actually design in mobile development see right sometimes you're kind of there's so many ideas that you want to do and hit on and it's like okay i want to make my design like this or like that here you can actually see what other companies are doing as well so one second okay cool so you know different colors different different devices here you can see the ipad or the iphone and these are going to be different for you know those specific things whether that's dark mode whether you want to look at how people are designing shopping carts whether they're you know designing sign up cards comment you know different what is it called comment forms or sections you know if you are designing a book in mobile if you are doing drawings all these things man this is amazing like this makes me want to make apps that's pretty freaking cool okay so even the search right shows you different the coloring of the search the smart searches things of the sword popovers amazing amazing so patterns is really cool because it gives you a really really really good idea 153 likes guys whoa we got there thank you guys so much that's amazing and yep patterns is gonna be good if you're gonna be using anything related to mobile so i feel like one of the biggest steps for you to start designing is the actual inspiration and if you're not inspired you're not gonna do anything great okay you're kind of going to do the minimum work you're not going to be as creative as you should be you are not going to demand the thing that requires of you to either do a specific great job or a masterpiece matter artwork you know you want something that withstands the test of time by having a lot of passion for it so that's how you get inspiration from mobile patterns is a great tool figma you know figma we've mentioned it so much sigma is amazing guys thank you so much for you know actually using it i've heard a lot of people have a lot of great results from it just because figma does does give you the option for you to you know drag and drop certain objects and from there you drag and drop them and then you do whatever you want you know to them what's cool about it is that you can get the css code in the html code and a little bit of the javascript code as well and you can put it on your website so you don't have to you know code it from scratch you can actually do it with this specific tool and figma is amazing man there's so many different tutorials out there that i wish that i could just you know mention here specifically but i cannot so what's going to be cool is check out those tutorials of sigma i think it's going to be worth it if you guys are doing wireframing if you guys are doing you know design for diff different whether that's flows or websites or mobile apps and things of the sort figma is going to be amazing plus there's so much more now it's such a big company it went into you know even using svgs and different you know files that you can use for your design even icons things of the sort figma is that for you envision is gonna be amazing if you're doing wireframing and you're doing a little bit more design or mockups for apps and things of the sort i believe envision is adobe envision and it's it's great out there a lot of design school use it and it's it's you know people i've seen use it a lot for websites as well whether they use interactive websites and have a lot of animations i've seen them use within vision and it's it's a really cool thing material ui.com is actually or dot co i'm sorry is amazing i really really do like it just because i feel like you know you have to have certain resources for color color is so important if you're doing design guys especially if you're doing javascript if you're doing web development why first of all you know css is now so complex it started being a little bit more you know it was very basic it's like oh you don't know css man like what like you know you don't know html5 and css that's super easy that's not even programming you know it's a markup language or whatever you want to do or maybe that's html i'm and i'm getting confused anyways you know going into material material sorry um css there's um specific tools that you're gonna need for color css is color on websites most of the time and now like i said it's more complex than that so it's a great read tool that you can do for or use because one it tells you a little bit of um so sometimes it actually tells you news about what's going on with material ui and and because and the team anyways the development team all of these things but you know the actual cool thing about this is going to be the colors so it gives you the color and the hex code and it's already copied once you see it once you touch it you're going to copy it to your clipboard and now you can use it to design so all these are palettes that go together and already it saves you so much time okay so for development that's going to be dope and that's going to be just you know that was flat ui colors you can use metro colors all of these different types of colors and here is the blog that i was talking about i had actually seen it tell you a little bit more of news that have to do with the industry but i thought it was pretty cool you know here are different ways to use html colors and we can even see some unicode characters as well that you can use so all of these things are going to be very useful for you if you're doing any type of css and it's great that you know a tool like that that's why i wanted to add it for you guys thank you guys a lot for being here somebody said mohammed mohan it said this is really helpful thanks a lot thank you brother really appreciate you sigma is the best just like cp han thank you guys so much man so far which monitor are you using currently it's actually a tv it's a huge tv man it's like a 60 inch tv i believe it's a little bit too much to be honest but we're getting used to it it's it's it's you know i cannot complain i definitely cannot complain but it's amazing and here is you know speaking about css things that i can share with you guys since it's so popular i did want to share you guys you guys do not have to start coding everything from scratch okay that's something that you're gonna have to realize you're not going to have to code everything from scratch and what you want to have to do is get the resources and get lists of things that you can reuse and reuse and reuse on your future designs so one you can develop more style one if you reuse specific things you're going to develop a style of design and i'm not saying limit yourself but maybe do limit what type of design or style you want to use for your designs so that you can have something that's kind of like concurrent throughout your design so that it doesn't look like this is a completely different person in a different design it's okay if it does all i'm saying is like if you kill it in design and then you make it so that it seems like the same person designing it it just it's just worth so much more in my opinion so you know going into css effects i think it's a great website because it gives you a little bit of you know you can copy different type of hover effects and effects like loading effects for css so click on the animation to copy the css so you click it and it's already copied to your clipboard it tells you right here on the bottom so all of these are different things that you can just literally copy and add it on your design and if you if you just have these tools guys if you have all of these tools that i'm showing you guys on your bookmark if you have it on your bookmark it's going to facilitate so much of your workflow and it's going to help you become so much more dangerous you know in design so you know i really want you guys to take it into heart and do start applying these things right now um so this is a great great thing i was actually not showing oh man i was not showing that what's this link for nice um thank you for sharing somebody says you guys are welcome i'm going to go over it really quick so css design is really cool because you can go into the website and just hover over and literally clip click it and it's going to copy it to your clipboard it's going to copy the css code so whether you're doing a button that's pulsating whether that's you know an animation for loading or an animation for downloading anything of the sort if you have this link right here on your bookmarks it's going to save you so much more time you can just go there and copy the css and not have to code it from scratch and if you ask me that's going to be amazing guys it's going to help you and serve you so much so you know you always want to have different resources like that that's going to save you time i wanted to add css and here we're going to add a little bit more of chrome extensions okay so chrome extensions are going to be really really useful because thank you thank you so much um nacho says wow this is really great i'll make my design much more consistent yeah man definitely it's it's really a thing you know that's why jackson pollock that's why jackson pollock has one of the most expensive paintings in the world or picasso or da vinci anybody everybody you know if you're talking about paintings in general artists in general david cho all these guys even though they do change styles you can always see a consistency in their styles in a way that's the same person it makes you so much more better to have a type of style or design style for yourself anyways chrome extensions are amazing because they make the workflows so much better and here in cleverprogrammer we are just addicted to making ourselves way more efficient and if you are not using fonts ninja and you are a designer man you are missing out on so much i remember we were at an actual we were at an event it was qazzy and aaron and i i believe yeah it was just us at an event this year in january in in tennessee nashville tennessee it was the funnel hacking live event that's actually where we met daniel the you know the the one of our developers that works used to work with rocket chips anyways we were there and we were having a presentation where one of the lead design what was it what was it called web design hackers it was web design hackers right i believe she was called she called herself a design hacker and this lady was an expert copying other people's website's styles so they wanted to see websites that actually converted you know that actually sold that actually that could get people to update their email and things of the sort and have good conversion rates this lady actually would dissect websites and and even measure the the actual margins and measure the colors measure you know the font size that they used so that they can make those websites actually convert better you know i didn't know about that but i learned you know this specific chrome extension from her so she uses fonts ninja i use fonts ninja really to check out fonts that i like on different websites and you would literally go to the chrome store and chrome extension store and download fonts ninja and you can use it and it's going to be really cool because you're going to get to know what everybody's using if you want to go into maybe tai lopez's website and see what fonts he's using you can do that you want to do that for nike and see what type of fonts are using i bet you they're using some for them some form of helvetica you know i bet you anyways you know it's uh i mean most fonts are used are are inspired by helvetica so it doesn't you know even make that much sense anyways fonts ninja is amazing guys do use the momentum is going to be amazing because let me see if i have it here in this computer yep so this is momentum you know if momentum is amazing because guys we are all humans after all like that daft punk song says you know we are humans after all and if you are designing if you're doing something creative you want to have an expansive type of mind you want to be in a room where you can actually think where you can feel good about yourself about you know coming up with ideas and be like okay yes this works this can be practical i can use this i can actually create stuff right now if you don't want to feel like you're just in a room locked up on your screen and just like looking at some code and things of the sort make it beautiful for you guys every time that you open up a tab on your chrome momentum is gonna give you first of all the time second of all and beautiful beautiful beautiful background image it just brings you inspiration man just having this in my opinion gives you so much mental health that it's already a huge huge way to start your day and just opening up you know different tabs i see here who jaffa ben kelly khilil says thank you so much for your effort you're making this seem easy and inspiring thank you so much man i really really do appreciate that love you guys so much it's crazy to think that you guys are all over the world and you know just whether that's night for you or day thank you guys for being here i really do appreciate it guys do take into consideration do take it into practice you know use these things that i'm showing you because they are going to make your life a little bit better i wouldn't put them in this list if it wasn't true and if i wouldn't have a little bit of experience with them or at least have had research on them enough to show it to you guys eye color picker is amazing it's the same thing as fun's ninja pretty much but with colors so sometimes you're on a website and you want to see the color of that website if you get eye color picker on the chrome extension store you're going to be able to get the colors that you want okay and the hex code for it so you can use it on your code and you can use it on photoshop or whatever wherever so wapalizer is really really cool i really wanted to add it here because i actually learned this from nas as well wapalizer is dope because i i used to use a website called built with i think it's called built with and it tells you you put in you put in a username sorry a url and you type in the url and then it tells you all of the text stack that that company uses and you know literally everything whether it's made with wordpress or it's made with wix it's going to tell you exactly what it is made with wobblizer is cool because it's actually that same thing but on a chrome extension and it's going to tell you the whole tech stack of a company and it's going to give you a really good way to know what they built it with if you want to copy or clone their website which i think it's amazing it's an amazing tool you know you like i said you have to learn from the best for you to get way way better and it's it's a it's an amazing way momentum has a weird bug which locks you out every now and then i'm not sure lorenzo says man i haven't even i haven't really i haven't really experienced that myself i've never had problems with that salute you bro for such a great information thank thank you so much boom boom games appreciate it man i searched but can't figure out which website um there were no websites these are just chrome extensions man so look for those colorzilla is cool for picking colors too yep i've seen colors as well so those are gonna be amazing ones and

because it sounds so weird i don't know how that might work okay giffy huh i think it just shows you i think it just shows you like inspiration okay i don't get it man i don't get it anyways let's go back to the design resources so icon finder is really dope man if you know about you know finding icons it's such a pain because sometimes you know you cannot for the love of god find the icon that you want just like you want it not to have a background but you it's impossible for you to find it without a background if you do find it without a background it's like super low quality and icon finder is a great way for you to spine like maybe computer and they have you know whether you want to pay for the monthly plan or you want to pay for specific icon packages you can do that icons eight is a really cool one too that we use here in the company it's actually man it's like you invest a little bit okay you have to invest a little bit because these things just save you so much time like i don't know how much time i've spent just looking for facebook logos google logos all of these things and icons eight is such a great way and you can even do it for free you just have to register with them i believe but you know we do pay for the monthly one with icons eight that's the one that we use for the company for whether that's you know a thumbnail whether that's a video we get it from icons eight it's a really really great one and you can see those all of these resources here in descendresource.es it's amazing unsplash is cool that's what people in the comments were mentioning it's one of those websites that lets you see photographs and you know it's cool because all of these are going to be the popular ones okay they're rated apparently by hearts right so 393 figma's winning is the favorite and this is another favorite so 208 rebels a favorite okay so what's cool about it is that you can actually see it in in categories so why is it cool to see it in categories it's cool because it can it can actually break down your design in different whether that's a pattern of design or whether that's just the order of your development right so you know you're thinking about icons that you're going to use it's like okay i'm going to use this tool and get all of these icons for my app or my web developer i'm sorry my web application or i'm going to go into all of these so that i can see you know inspiration for the design that i want to do right now and all these are going to be amazing okay and you want to go into jobs what is jobs actually actually looking for jobs as designers this is super cool so this website not only shows you how to you know have so many resources at your disposal but actually also lets you find jobs related to designing so that's amazing guys you guys can go into here and find jobs with designing and if you guys do find a job let me know in the comments below let us know if this actually works ripple jobs that's amazing guys um so going back into this learn design i bet so this is pretty much learning how to design so it actually gives you resources of how to learn as well like i said before in the beginning of the video it's not only about learning it's also about learning how to learn because i've mentioned this before not everybody learns the same way and people are different types of learners you know there's visual learners there's audio learners there are you know um people that learn by hearing there are people that learn by touching things of the sort so you know it's great to see everything put together in one place if you do want to go into you know right now i guess this is designing a podcast whether that's you know the tools for it um as in the thumbnails or maybe even the the actual layouts for the videos for you know social media all of these things prototyping tools envision like we were mentioning framer is another one proto pi is another one phase you know all of these are going to be part of prototyping if you're doing uh you know the mockup or just the beginning design of your app you want to see the flow of it all of these things they're great tools for prototyping let's see what's going on here icons eight is ridiculously good yeah man natural lorenzo i agree with that not um not true i can't say it really changed the whole game for us hey thanks frankie oh i found the things which i'm looking for sanjar hey man no worries yeah yeah thank you guys so much i'm a designer and a frontend developer no lauren so nice that's amazing man so this is cool guys i i would suggest going to this specific website that i'm showing you guys here design.resource s and start playing with it use it for yourself look almost everything that i mentioned is here and i got it from other lists and just my research and my experience in general but you know i cannot beat this website it's such a good website so many people i've seen so many videos of these resources specifically look lots of uix it's amazing man everything is here open peeps is cool because it's illustrations i saw it in in so many different lists so if you want to get illustrations for people or just use you know avatars and things like that you're gonna use open peeps sidebar the five best design links every day what is this so i don't understand what this is okay so it's like a sidebar newsletter double design okay cool and nicely done you know all of these things man adobe xs blush is another very very popular one that everybody is right now um recommending so illustration right now is a big big trend in web development and you know most of the sas companies that you see out there use illustrations it's crazy you know if you have a complex type of product you might want to use design that makes it very simple for people to want to use it and illustrations is a great way to do that and that's why you're going to want to get resources that have to do with illustration okay so it's not just like oh wow yeah illustration illustration resources no man think about why you're using these things okay so that's the way that you use the things is what makes the tools special humans is another one for um specific illustrations design calendar nice so you can design events things of the sort just click here amazing the best online design events so what is this okay you can you can pretty much do things like this or what i don't know if it's tool that's one thing about you know some websites manage they they're not specific enough and into telling you what they do so they make me click away okay so let's look at that one ux collective so these are just these are you know collective blog posts to get for inspiration but anyways guys you know use this design resource that i'm showing you you know do use these tools do use something consistent on your arsenal so that you can start using on every project that you have you know share it with other people actually be part of these communities because these type of things guys is what's going to differentiate you from the other people that are working with you okay if you do have the resources and the tools not only can you use them but you can show other people how to use them okay and the thing about tools is that tools are such an important thing for your growth because tools is what puts us on top of the food chain pretty much you know we're not the strongest animal we're not i think we are the smartest one but we're not the strongest animal okay and the only thing that differentiates us from being eaten from maybe a lion is the fact that we can create houses and we can create tools that can actually battle a lion okay so tools is what's going to make you a great designer you are you cannot just stay to the staple tools of photoshop and building everything from scratch coding everything from scratch and designing everything from scratch that's incorrect now guys you know there's so many resources out there like i showed you guys this this one is one of the best ones like i showed you so many resources out there that you can use today so that you can make your design better and the better that your design is the more money that you're gonna make the more experience that you're gonna have the more better impact you're gonna have in the world and for yourself because everybody knows that when somebody does or you do a great job in your design you just feel like a hundred bucks okay and how about just investing a little bit of time into researching what are the tools that are going to get me to be that specific designer to get that specific job to finish the job to get the project to get the people together so that we can finish this project okay i need vision i need tools i need a direction and i need all of these things and what i will do is get them from this video get them from design research dot yes all these things are going to make you great okay guys so anyways guys if
