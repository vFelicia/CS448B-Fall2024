I have completely stopped using environment variables and envy files if I go ahead and empty out this whole environment file in fact if I remove this environment file completely from my reactjs project even though I am using process. EnV for API keys and many other things if I restart my nextjs server right here and if I look at the project and refresh my browser my local host in fact the app still fully works I've got all my boards I can go into and arrow all the boards I can pretty much use the whole project everything works login log out so Nas how the heck does this work how is it that you have removed the environment file you're using process. IV and everything still works that's because we have found the different tool we were sick of creating environment variables we were sick of sharing them with developers hoping they would go would not go into the wrong hands we were sick of updating environment variables across the whole team because if you update you have to let everybody know that you updated the environment variables we were sick of managing all of that and it was such a nasty experience so found this tool that changed everything it completely removed the necessity for you to keep track of these environment variable environment variables it completely removed the need for you to remember to add them it removed the need for you to keep them updated across the whole development team and it even removed the need for developers to see them so I want to show you this tool because I think it can really help you the piece of software I'm about to show you is not sponsored this is just an application that we love to use Kazi actually found this and that we've used on our team to build poppy AI it just has helped us so much and it's so simple to use as well and so let me show you what it is so it's called in physical it's an open Source secret management and it's all one platforms to secure manage applications blah blah blah right again very very simple to understand in terms of what it actually does what it does really well is just being able to save all of your keys your client secrets and sync them up between different environments and sync them up between different developers so if you add a new environment key then it will get synced up across all developers like how sick is that and so I'm making this video because I just genuinely want to help developers out there on the fact that there are better ways of doing this instead of creating your EnV files and doing it that way um now granted your EnV files might still be good if you're just one person doing this but if you have a development team then there's no reason for you to do this to to actually create those AMV files so like it's so easy if you look at this if I zoom in here oh let me see here let me if I zoom in like look at this you just do a physical run inv Dev and like and then do npm run dab and it will insert all the keys directly for you and it's as simple as that we have it so simply done I think let me go and actually sign up for our let me go and sign in into our application we have our Pop I one here and we have all these different keys that we get to use as you can see and you can actually click into it and you'll be able to see the keys right here you can edit the keys um change them which environment they are part of and then go from there and then sync them up as well with like versel um I believe they also have a bunch of Integrations like AWS um Azure BB bucket Circle CI uh checkley G I mean GitHub Heroku uh gitlab netlify so so many different Frameworks that they have are working with and with versel it's also super super easy like you see there's versel right here right with versell it's super super easy uh hopefully I can show you guys how versell even works settings maybe Integrations here right so we've got the physical integrated into there and this will literally sync all the keys automatically so if we add a key to physical it will be added directly into here of course you have to restart then probably the project but it'll be fully added into here which is so cool and then let me show you how this works on the actual application side of things so I have this thing where we use open API key we even use Gemini Keys here correct and so let me go ahead and stop running the application here contrl C boom boom I do mpm run Dev and mpm run Dev as you can see if we make this a little bit larger what it does is that it does in physical run next Dev which inserts the keys into the environment all of them and then see if in injecting 16 in physical secrets into your application process and that's it and like you don't have to worry about creating any environment variables none of that it just inserts it for you how sick is that I'm just blown away by how good this application is Kazi I give this credit to Kazi because he's the one who found this um but just not having to share this with other developers and then if you add new keys then you don't you don't have have to share that with our developers it just get automatically gets synced throughout everybody we finally have a [ __ ] solution and I don't know why it took so long so long to actually make it happen but yeah so yeah for new developers who are just starting out then yeah create environment variable Keys you know you don't have to use in physical for example but for people who are have a development team they're working on the project and there's a few developers on the project that definitely use it using physical um again not sponsor in any shape or form I wish we were I just think they're a great product and I want you guys to use it I want you guys to make it easier for yourselves hence why I'm making this video and of course this video is sponsored however by us which is by our product called poy aai so we have been building a product that using a physical the product called pop AI we're pretty much what we're building is is a whiteboard on steroids is what we call this it's a way to help other people learn create 10 times faster with AI right so that's the goal it's like the biggest thing is that we have our customers using this is talking to YouTube videos so I can imagine you can bring a bunch of YouTube videos from different sources and then you can simply talk to them and ask questions and get deep insights within seconds you don't have to watch a bunch of podcasts you don't have to watch the video 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes you get instant answers and then from there you can actually create insights and then from there you can create so much for more in terms of emails newsletters you name it but the biggest thing is just being able to learn 10 times faster so like for example for example like here as you can see I've used it for so many different things for example we're currently outreaching to a bunch of influencers on promoting poy Ai and so first I got a way got a way to learn how to use um how to reach out to influencers I took videos from Alex trosi from what this is another another person they had a ton of views took them in started to ask a bunch of questions about how to apply that to our videos or sorry to our uh product and then boom and then I saved that on here which is like hey it told me to create a list of 100 influencers in this my specific Niche send personalized messages Etc but I can go much more deeper than just this right then I took screenshots which is so cool I took screenshots of all the influencers that I have been looking and finding and the cool thing is these screenshots have links to these influencers right because it's their YouTube screenshots and then what I can do is so sick I can connect them and then I can ask very deep questions around like this let me zoom in here boo for example like give me all the YouTube channels right give me a nice bullet point list of of the name so give me give me me all the influencers influencers from um give me all the influence give me all the influencers with links and subscriber count and their industry boom there it is and these links go directly to the YouTube channel which is so cool so I don't have to save these guys anywhere on Goog Google Sheets at any point in time if they're all just right here and that can be like hey create Outreach messages for the F uh to the first two first two uh people around to ask to see if we can collab together on promoting poppy AI now of course you can probably get a lot smarter with the message right this is just an example there it is boom right hi Andrew blah blah blah like sick right amazing and and then make sure sure to mention their YouTube channel and even a YouTube video video that we liked and how their channel can help um falls falls in line with promoting poppy AI boom and so the cool thing is that even knows the videos too following YouTube channel blah blah and I currently impressed with your content Especial the video PhD like you see like it knows the content like how sick is that so same thing here use to write perfect essays like this is awesome I love this tool oh my God I get to use this every [ __ ] day um this is just an example but yeah just a few examples of how we use our own tool which is funny um let's see what else yeah we this is this is just for testing we had but I also use this for example like right use this for example to get key insights um from a YouTube video from a website that I wanted to learn from and then here for example I was talking about the number one rule um for copyrighting and I wanted to create an email right and then I use this and I added my voice and as a result I was able to create an email just like this this based on the copyright and rules of Alex trosi insane so but then but you can go even further because like you know I use this a lot for for example for learning like when I was thirr on my diet I imported a bunch of people's YouTube videos about diet and then I had and then I imported my body scan body my dexa scan and then I asked hey you know here's how I was feeling the past few days and I said I've been dieting for the past 5 months I lost 10 pounds and I have a crazy diet fatigue I want to eat constantly based on that info from Dr Mike for example let me go ahead and make this do not disturb so you don't see this there we go it told me exactly what to do based like your M device your current situation you might may benefit from a diet reset here's a brief outline of the next steps Etc so this is what we have been working on and physical was a way of actually showing that um if you're interested right now we have a very cool offer down below um with a 3day trial so go ahead and check it out um the price will go up as well and yeah we're just excited for you to try it out give us feedback we're constantly getting feedback from customers we're constantly improving this we just started this and we're super excited on how we can make this even better thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video video I hope you actually took a lot from it especially even in the environment variables part because I personally just like I hate all of that um and so in physical has helped me a lot again not sponsored in any shape or form um but yeah thank you so much have a good day I'll see you later bye
