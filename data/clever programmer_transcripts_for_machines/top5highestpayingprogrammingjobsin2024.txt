yo what is up you guys today we are talking about the five highest paying programming jobs that you can make as a software developer in 2024 so every time we make a video about money or developers you guys seem to eat it up everything about it you know making money getting positions networking communicating anything of these the nontechnical side of coding you guys seem to love it so we're doing it again for 2024 I might be a familiar face from the past for you guys if not then hi I'm Aaron yeah so let's just get right into it I want to make this really Punchy and to the point for you guys you guys can get maximal value in the shortest amount of time uh let's get started so I want to preface this whole thing with a simplification we're really ranking these positions by two factors there are two deciding factors that we are using to determine whether it makes the top five list for the highest paying programming job and the first one is this the amount of money that you can make from it right because I mean money is important right it's not everything but it it solves a lot of problems so we're ranking it in terms of the average salary that you can make you know some make lower some make more but also what you could expect to make as an entrylevel developer in that position number two is actually the amount of time it will take to become a software developer and get a position in that field if you are a complete beginner we are going to be giving you also the amount of time it takes to get that job so those two deciding factors together the amount of money you can make on average or as a entry developer and how long it takes to go from a complete beginner up to your first job in that position that's what we Ed to decide whether or not this made the top five list for this video all right now real quick you guys before I get into the meat of this video we've put together a free 20minute training that you can watch that teaches you how to become a developer leveraging AI leveraging tools like chat GPT or Gemini from Google if you don't know what that is it's basically Google's version of chat PT many other AI tools that you can also use as well but leveraging those things can actually really boost your productivity so we teach you how to do that in this 20minute training we're also going to be giving you three app ideas that you can build under 5 minutes using AI so basically if you want to use this Irreplaceable tool to become an Irreplaceable programmer and developer in 2024 you kind of need to know this because chat GPT and AI has has really leveled the playing field and if you're not on the bandwagon with this can you do math faster than the computer didn't think so in other words don't fall behind you really want to get on this bandwagon of AI so uh catch this free 20minute training uh link should be in the description and uh I'll see you in there I lied so one last thing before I get into the meat of this video is a short disclaimer if you're a complete beginner developer and you've never coded in your life before or you have you know less than a month of experience less than two months of experience I need to preface this video with these are the average salaries that you can make from these positions and don't expect it to happen right away you know you might need to put in a lot of hours you might to study a lot you might need to network more than other people um some might get really lucky some might you know pull the short stick so you're going to have to just really put your mind to it and really commit to this if you really want to make it but what we can say is these incomes um that are possible from these positions are very very possible and uh they're not from anywhere they're from a very very credible source which I'll get to in a second and second the average salary that we tend to have for entrylevel developers that uh learn and get jobs from our channel is actually $70,000 so that's not too shabby for an entry level position if that can cover your life costs great if not well then you're probably going to have to put in a little bit extra work to get that up that's just full transparency $70,000 on average is what you can expect to make maybe more maybe less hopefully more but just wanted to preface that video with that disclaimer so let's get started so now that credible source that I just mentioned we're actually going to be using buil in.com I'm looking at it right here and basically in in short if you haven't heard about builtin it's basically LinkedIn but for startups and Tech individuals and developers and stuff like that they started as a social Network and blogging platform for startups uh basically that's what it is it's a it's a social network for developers they have a lot of data there they have ability to actually search for jobs to find employers to find developers it's basically just a hub of really useful information for anybody in the tech industry or software developer industry uh that might want to meet more people or get a position so uh that's where we're getting it from they host a lot of surveys uh Anonymous surveys of us employees that's where we're getting our data and we like that it is anonymous and us so without further Ado let's get into the top five so number five on this list is actually video game developers so whether that's for mobile for console for PC for Nintendo switch or game Bo whatever it is video game developer is number five and let's just go over why that is so the average salary you can make from a video game developer according to the survey uh these Anonymous surveys that were taken from US tech employees and individuals and employers Etc uh is actually $116,000 uh which is pretty awesome $116,000 that's six figures plus and um if you look at this screenshot I'm throwing on the screen right now you can actually even go up to $200,000 plus if you've really been in the game for a long time um of course you're going to have to work for that but $116,000 average is pretty dang good now well a lot of you might be beginners watching this video and I'm going to say this for all five of these positions in the video but what is the actual average income that somebody can make as a beginner so according to this graph again from builtin. comom is uh the average salary you can expect to make with one year of experience or less is actually $95,000 as a video game developer so I'm not exactly sure again these are Anonymous surveys so take this with a little grain of salt but you can pretty much guarantee that they're 90 to 95% accurate you take those numbers little GRE s but they're they're more right than wrong is what I can say uh it is a little bit strange that there is a discrepancy as to why you can make more as an entry level than not but I mean hey if there's something in the uh industry that's making that happen um there's a few examples I can think of maybe when you first start out you're really passionate and you make a game and you make a lot of sales at the beginning but then it falls off so maybe it's kind of hard there's like a drop off at the beginning but then upwards you can make a lot more down the line not really sure could just be you know spoof in the data but regardless I follow the data for the data um and that's what these uh that's what these surveys have shown us so really great there you know your individual results will I can basically guarantee will be slightly different than what these what these say um but it should be in the same ballpark so that's pretty awesome so again $116,000 average that's before any bonuses or anything and uh $95,000 uh a year on average for uh one year of experience or less and also it just sounds like a pretty cool job to be honest imagine like making you know making the your favorite video games if you're a gamer whether it's FIFA sports games whether it's Call of Duty and shoo comps or online big online multiplayer games or really any kind of game um I just think it sounds pretty cool you know you can work with your favorite team work on your favorite IP intellectual property um and the other thing I want to mention is also as a video game developer maybe you can go on to become you know the creator of a new video game that makes a lot of money uh this doesn't happen a lot you know a lot of tripa titles they have a lot of funding and what not but a lot of Indie Games can make a lot of money with a very very small team so it really depends what kind of Branch you want to go down in this space uh but basically there's a lot of opportunities a lot of possibilities a lot of choices you can make a lot of paths you can go down um and they're all very lucrative and they all sound pretty fun to me now it also probably would take you about 12 to 18 months to get a job in this space as a game developer um if you're a complete beginner uh to work up to that average level income um but that's not too bad I mean you can get up and running as close to maybe even 6 12 months if you really really work hard and you have the right connections but uh you know more realistically will probably be 12 to 18 months moving on to number four on this list and that is actually a Dev op engineer so before I get into the average salary and the beginner entry level salary of this position some of you might not actually know what a devop devop engineer actually is you know video game developer is pretty straightforward but a devop engineer basically is you responsible for maintaining existing platforms you know things that already exist and make sure they run smoothly whether it's databases servers like pretty much anything it's just it's short for developer operations think of it like a pit stop in Formula 1 you might take things offline you kind of like do maintenance on things and make sure everything's running correctly and then once those things are working well then you put it back out onto the market and then people and the users start using it again so you're maintaining stuff sounds a little bit generic but I mean it's very very crucial and important it's like the oil you need the oil things to make sure the things are maintained and running smoothly so the average uh salary according to builtin. comom is $133,000 a year again just like video game um there is an upper limit to that or an upper potential you can make upwards of $300,000 as a devops engineer in the USA uh and again this is before any bonuses or anything like that there's all some bonuses you can make you know you can make 10K Plus in bonuses in this kind of position position you know that really depends on the employer though uh additional compensations but let's just stick to the actual average salary so $133,000 as a average devops engineer but what about if you're a beginner again if you're a beginner with one year or less of experience you can expect to make $882,000 a year that I mean know that that is the average for an entry level position so might might be more might be less but hey that's pretty good too you know it depends where you live if you live in New York or Miami or Hawaii or Los Angeles and it really depends how much your expenses are maybe not uh but if you live you know somewhere more affordable then that's perfectly appropriate for what you need if you're smart with your money do to be honest though devop engineer it does usually require previous software development experience because if you're maintaining and making sure a codebase runs smoothly you probably need some kind of experience to understand how it works to begin with so to maintain it you have to know how it works so it does take a little bit more time to get this up and running but if that's up your alley then then go for it uh do expect it to take around 18 to 24 months um for you to actually get a entrylevel position in this uh field in this position as a devops engineer um it just takes a bit longer than other positions so but it still made a list because of the amount of money that you can make moving on to number three on this list and that is actually Cloud engineer so as a cloud engineer you can expect to make around $138,000 as uh an average income based on the surveys from built.com with an upward potential of $190,000 which is pretty hefty for somebody who's a beginner what you can expect to make with one year or less of experience as a cloud engineer is actually $120,000 and that's pretty lucrative if you're looking to get a good high paying job right off the bat is a cloud engineer if you don't know the cloud engineer is you know most people know what working in the cloud means I'm sure you as a viewer does but just in case you don't it basically means you're an architect for data on the cloud think like Google drive or Dropbox or Apple iCloud or anything like that anything regarding datas and servers and things that need to be uploaded in internet download speeds and this and like crypting data and having everything together like anything in the cloud that's what you'll be doing you know automatic syncing to the cloud those kinds of things um that's what you'll be doing here and it'll take you probably around 12 to 18 months to get a job as this if you're a complete beginner just so you know the time Horizon that you need to expect all right moving on to number two on this list is actually full stack developer uh most of you know what a full stack developer is if you don't uh it means you do the front end and the backend hence full stack uh front end and back end being the front end is the user interface how it looks the design the buttons that pop up everything and on a website and the back end being the database so like what data is stored how does everything process you like Amazon has a backend once you actually process the payment all that stuff has to happen how does it save your cart those kinds of things as a fullsack developer you can expect to make around $147,000 as a average salary for the position the upward potential being $260,000 pretty solid there and if you have one year of experience or less then you can expect to make around $80,000 a year so still pretty hefty not as much as Cloud engineer or something but still pretty hefty and what's great about this is it's actually fairly easy to get this up and running compared to other uh positions as a full stack developer so you can actually expect to get up and running within 6 to 12 months months rather than the longer you know 18 to 24 months of a devops engineer or something like that um so if you really want to get a position quick maybe this is the route to go uh it's pretty great all right the big on so moving on to number one on this list is actually a machine learning engineer you'll basically be the brains behind building AI tools like Chad GPT or gemini or Elon musk's new grock AI that he's using on Twitter or X that is going to be renamed as um but basically anything AI related is going to be something that you can be working on and AI is a huge pop area in the world right now um it's leveling the plane field it's making everything faster um so being one of the mines behind this is actually very smart so as a machine learning engineer you can actually expect to make around $155,000 a year on average that's average that's that's six figures and a half on average before bonuses you know with bonuses you can make close to 200k and the upper potential of this um you're really getting close to $300,000 a year so pretty hefty incomes there like I don't know what you want to do with all that money but you can do a lot of stuff with all that money the average salary that you can expect to make with one year of experience or less as a machine learning engineer is actually it's already six figures is actually $120,000 on average around there according to the builtin surveys so pretty hefty is there as well so the reason this is number one is because you can make so much money and it's so future proof and AI is just a really popping tool that's so powerful it really really deserves a spot as number one on our list now that pretty much wraps up this video the top five highest paying programming jobs in 2024 that you can make the number one spot machine learning engineer is pretty fancy I like it honestly like I I I would probably choose that personally if I was going to get into the space right now I'm doing some YouTube and and other kinds of things I used to be a developer but not anymore but that would be my first choice if I were to do that so anybody who is interested in going down this route of being a developer I would highly recommend maybe even shooting for that why not shoot for the stars and go for big number one but if you really want to make video games make video games if you want want to be devops and you know make stuff run smoothly do that cloud engineer do that fullsack developer do that that's the beautiful thing about life is you can do whatever the heck you want so uh make your choice based on the information that I just gave you um feel free to do whatever you want with it but finally I do want to invite you to uh something if you would like to pursue a career in software development and if you really want to learn how to become a software developer with the help of AI and chat gbt in 2024 um then we actually have a free 20 minute training teaching you just how to do that so it teaches you how to use chat GPT and tools uh similar to that and any similar tools that will exist in the future regarding that on how to actually boost your productivity and your code quality uh because chat gbt is jacked it's just it makes less mistakes it can help code things for you you seem to be the Mastermind to actually put these together uh but really get on the bandwagon here guys cuz if you don't you're going to fall behind because other people will so very very crucial skill leveraging AI to actually code and we have a free 20minute training teaching you just how to do that uh Link in the description go click that and check it out and we'll be giving you actually like I said at the beginning of the video three app ideas that you can make using AI in 5 minutes or less yes 5 minutes or less because chat GPT basically does all the scaffolding all of the basic foundational coding and then you can go in and polish it on top if you want after you've learned all these coding skills that's it you guys if you really want to become a software developer in 2024 go watch that training again thanks for watching this video and I will catch you in a future video
