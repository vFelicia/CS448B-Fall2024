sunny guys how is it going super pumped for today we're gonna be covering the front end developer guide of 2020 to 2021 sunny are you excited about this or what i'm super excited we have so much jampacked knowledge for you guys like we just we're excited for this one like and guys if you're excited let us know in the comments drop a thumbs up and yeah get ready for this man we are pumped about this one guys this one just doesn't stop in terms of the value so buckle up buttercup because this is about to be one bumpy ride exactly so we're gonna so this is gonna be essentially your road map to becoming a frontend developer you know uh in this year and hopefully the next year even with all the crazy stuff going on so first off sunny what should they do with their phones guys grab your phones right now and hit that do not disturb button because you're going to need all of your attention right now because we're going to be going at a very very intense rate and we're going to be dropping a bunch of value bombs on you guys so ready get ready to focus hit that do not disturb button and put your phone way across to the other side of the room yup get into that focus mode if you have extra chrome tabs open quit out of them because today we're just bringing the value bombs this is going to be one of the most value packed uh this is the best video on this topic for a fact and we're just gonna make it even better so we're gonna give you our attention give us yours and with that said let's just keep it rocking and rolling so let's move forward now here's where the first donation nice oh nice sushan thank you so much our second donation vishal yeah thank you guys i really appreciate you guys so i'm gonna show here sushant thank you so much so here's where the fun begins and if you're thinking where do i begin right it doesn't matter just start i think that's the really important thing now let's just get straight into it so what's happening here sonny right so guys like we always get this question of like are we talking about front end are we talking about back end today everything we cover guys is going to be front end and what do we mean by front end right we mean what you're going to see on the websites all of the builds that we're doing are frontend builds at the moment um and then if we click on the uh click on the next i think the javascript should pop up right now yeah um and basically guys whenever we talk about javascript we're talking about the front end whenever you hear about node.js we're talking about backend right so backend is some server somewhere else but it's not the website that you're seeing when you're interacting with like amazon when you're interacting with twitter and those sort of things the back end is separate we're going to be talking about that in a different video today everything we talk about is front end right so just know that before we jump into this video love it karthik says your content is more worth than any other paid courses out there really appreciate that okay so here is what's going on so we got html css and javascript and what is what is what are we looking at why is this important right so these are the fundamentals guys that we're going to be covering so the three main things that you need to know about when it comes to front and web development are html css and javascript they are the three power points in this uh in this presentation they are literally everything that you need to be like concentrated on on getting better at when it comes to front end development 100 and now let's talk about job opportunities and salary for frontend developers guys so here are the salaries for javascript developers by experience and like take a look at this right less than one year of experience it's possible for people to make 62 000 a year and in 2020 75 000 a year and then going down you know one to four years you can see the salaries keep increasing but i know most of the people that are watching this channel have less than one year of experience so if you just put your head down not complain don't look up don't change your focus every two minutes and just put in the work i'm talking eight to ten hours or more per day if you can do that it's very possible for you to be hitting these numbers actually even way before the one year mark definitely and guys some of you might be wondering it's in dollars and i'm not in america it does not matter guys with the internet you can pretty much work for anyone your client could be in america and you could get paid in dollars so this applies to everyone yep it applies to everyone so the job opportunity is really crazy there are 45 000 jobs available as of right this second on justindeed.com for javascript on upwork if you look there are 8 000 jobs available and you guys can go there right now and they're probably even more because of kovitz so guys job opportunities only going up while a lot of people are losing their jobs that are doing a lot of physical stuff programmers are not exactly here you have what's going on here and we just got a 400 repeat donation from simba so thank you so much for that he says learn a lot today finish your instagram clone today uh quality content for free and i think this is about five dollars or six dollars usd so thank you so much nice now what are we looking at here sonny so we're looking at sort of the different um programming languages in terms of popularity guys so in terms of professional developers you can see at the top at the top two right now javascript html css those were those three that we just mentioned before in regards to front end development and you can see they've overtaken java they've overtaken python they've overtaken sql so if you're ever in that question of wondering what do what should i learn should i learn java should i learn this and that guys put your energy towards javascript html css and like we said there's plenty of money that's what you need to know moving can't go wrong with that now when we were talking earlier about different countries right it doesn't matter if you're in india you're in turkey you're in i don't know god knows where you're sitting in dubai and you're like what's happening you guys can always tap into these markets remotely whether you tap into the u.s market or the canada market or united kingdom or germany you guys can tap into this in u.s you can see average developers making fifty seven hundred a month which comes out to about to sixty thousand a year canada they're making about four thousand united kingdom thirty one hundred germany thirty nine so really these countries are so massive that it doesn't matter where you are you can always get jobs in these types of countries now top tech companies that are using javascript on you talk to us about this we have loads guys we have tinder uber paypal tesla netflix google ebay facebook the list just goes on guys and it you know it's a lot of these we actually went ahead and built some clones for so if you haven't checked those out make sure you go and check them out and you can practice your web development frontend skills doing those clones but like that you guys can see here there's huge money the industry is packed with javascript right now there's so there's so much demand here guys so really really is something worth investing your time in the tinder clone we recently built you guys is huge so go check that out we're thinking about making an airbnb one we made netflix so check that out we make facebook messenger clone look at that and we want to say we just broke over 500 concurrent viewers at once so thank you guys so much for that uh it's i see it's only going up i see the chat is going crazy i'm looking at a lot of your guys's messages so benny mr varun sanskari rajibura george fidelia like we're looking at all of this thank you guys and if you guys are watching this whether as a replayer watching this live right now with us please guys one thing you can do we spend hours and hours preparing all this material for you guys sunny put together over a hundred slides for you guys for this presentation so it's just value packed all we ask for is that if you want to appreciate sonny's work or you want to appreciate just our work and teams effort and energy to put into this doesn't cost anything just hit that like button please and it sends the video out to every single person so many more people that could get value out of this so if you just do that and you do nothing else that makes the world of a difference for us yeah guys just hit that thumbs up get this video out to as many people tell your friends to everyone watching let's get this video to as many people as we possibly can yep with that said let's just go right back so now this is the overall lay of the land so to speak when you think about a frontend developer there's a lot going on and now as we get more advanced you know back in the day maybe it was just you needed an html css and maybe javascript and your friend and developer now guys it's definitely a lot more involved because a lot of jobs expect you to know a lot of things so you got to learn the tools like npm webpack chrome dev tools this is some of the stuff that we're going to be covering in this presentation today you got to know html you gotta know css and pre pro processors like post css less and sas or scss you guys will need to know frameworks like angular or view or react which one kind of do you want to pick right you will need to know things like javascript or typescript and you will need to know about component libraries what's your flavor of choice is it bootstrap we talked about bootstrap 5 actually yesterday is a semantic ui or material ui you know where are you at exactly and i see a lot of questions about typescript guys we will be covering all of the things that you guys see here in this video so stay tuned and uh be sure that we are going to cover those yeah prince says in this lockdown i've learned a lot of things from you guys thanks to both of you for all of this free valuable content thank you so much thank you dude pretty cool now what can you do with javascript sunny oh nice we just got a three pound donation by is thank you dude appreciate thank you seriously appreciate that guys that's huge massive right so guys what can we do with javascript right we can do a bunch of things we can build web apps which you guys have seen in our amazing live builds hope you guys are enjoying those by the way you can build some native apps so not by learning something like react you can actually go ahead and build ios android apps which is amazingly powerful and you can actually go ahead and then take it further and have server apps using node.js so that is a backend technology that we're talking about um but yeah pretty much with one language javascript you can go ahead and do all of this stuff so amazing now let's get into the technical nittygritty guys nice we just threw that in there because we love sonny's british accent so when he says we love that we all love that drop a like for that accent now what's going on so here guys when it comes to this you got to learn the basics okay with html make a page make it work don't over complicate it so that's just the basic foundation right yeah keep it simple just get html up and running on your page and literally that just means like get some stuff on a page and that's it move and then move to start moving forward like don't over complicate it don't start thinking all these other things just get moving with it and then move over to css so css is cascading stylesheet and that's on the next slide and here guys you want to learn how to use different layouts so how do you position things on the page in different ways and for that you can learn flexbox and flexbox is going to help you achieve a really nice responsive design and then you compare that with media queries to get things working just as you want it on like mobile tablet and everything like that so something to look into uh it's definitely a massive fundamental here css yup 100 learn that now with javascript you guys got to make sure you master the fundamentals learn the basics learn them inside out learn problem solving learn things like data types learn things like functions and es6 versus es7 so for example what is that arrow looking thing right that's more es6 es7 as in before there would just be regular functions so learn those things because those are very common at every job you'll need to know them learn about dom manipulation learn about scopes and fetch api and learn a lot about asynchronous programming lolo thank you so much for another donation and he says what's the statistics on degree and no degree jobs i think at this point guys if you have the skills down it doesn't matter whether you have the degree or no degree there are tons of developers working at facebook at microsoft at google at netflix who don't have degrees and are making upwards of 200 or even 300 000 a year yeah even elon musk just said that he pretty much ruled out the need for a degree now so yeah official companies are rolling out yeah yeah so that's huge so now what about the visual design stuff guys that's so important so let's jump straight into that actually so let's talk about some of the visual design stuff that we think is actually super important we'll start from the start yeah so there are five key principles of good design and suddenly you want to talk about some of them yeah so guys the first one is visual hierarchy so this is all about oh and one one thing actually just before we go into it uh guys this slide these slides were made by somebody on the team alex who's actually the newest addition to our team at clever programmer and he is phenomenal extremely talented uh kid he's only 19 years old and he had amazing resources on the front end side and so we're like hey why don't you put together some slides so we can share it so is that okay if we share these with you guys i think he would be really pumped and i think hopefully you guys will get a lot of value out of this too yeah and also guys let's drop alex a massive welcome in the comment section welcome to this team nice that's actually brilliant and drop a like for alex yeah drop a like nice so the first point guys first key principle of design a visual hierarchy so this is all about how do you rank elements on your page so here we have like a banner we have a header at the top and the sort of size and scale of these components they all play a different purpose like so for example we're always drawn to banners when we see like a website so they play a really important part it's really an important part of being a frontend developer yep and i just want to say guys we broke 700 live concurrent viewers so thank you guys so much that is insane appreciate you now visual hierarchy is very important and what's another thing that's super important right after visual hierarchy is actually the typography how things are written so if you take a look at how it you know slack replaces email inside your company that text matters it's bold and like it's kind of powerful you see it the size of it matters the styling of it matters and so typography is something you kind of have to know and if you look on the left hand side it says the style of fonts you use in your design can really impact your visual composition you can either help a message stand out with heavier weighted fonts or bring characters closer together to help the message feel more pronounced and i think when we see how it says try slack see the demo when we see where it says keep conversations organized in slack when you see slack replaces email how all of those are together and how typography is used it's very powerful yeah definitely definitely so typography super important guys and the next one is color so as you can see from this webpage immediately that thing just looks gorgeous like as soon as you see it it just grabs your eyes it grabs your full focus that's going to make all the difference guys now color is not just as simple as picking a color right you need to have like how do you figure out which colors to use how do you figure out which color palettes so on the next side we have a really handy tool that we actually used internally and it's called i don't know how you pronounce it i think it's coolers.com right rulers.co yeah yeah and cause you've used this right this is awesome you guys this is one tool that i think all designers should use and as a matter of fact i think i'm just going to open and go ahead and show it on the computer and how you use it but this thing is super powerful logan is here he goes my boy's dropping the value bomb let's go i mean you already know bro it's every day bro like the jake paul song he's actually there uh fbi just raided his house yesterday so let's go start the generator over here and this thing is awesome for colors i am not a frontend developer but even i was using this and this is awesome so check it out right if you want to pick a color that's good you can just click and how does it do that random generation again don't i think it's yeah so look i'm just pressing space bar and it's giving me these different colors and color palettes and so i'll keep going until i actually find something that kind of speaks out to me and um i want to use so let's even if you find the color you can lock that color and then you can keep you can keep sharpening so i like this orange because that's kind of like the clever programmer orange so now i can actually just do i can click it and it just locked it okay i could have also done command three command two will lock this one the second one so i'll just do command three and lock it now i just hit space bar and that orange will stay locked in but i've picked it now maybe i want something really sharp and crazy uh i like purples a lot so i'll lock this one too so now i have two of my colors and color palette picked and if i keep going you know this is you guys can see how this can be super useful for your website design logo design uh brand that you're trying to create whatever it may be yeah really really handy tool guys and it's really handy when you're just starting out in your sort of frontend journey because it's hard to figure out these things like the colors that you should use and stuff so definitely go ahead and check that out yep so coolers dot co is a great resource now what do we have uh here on this one sunny right so here we have contrast guys so you can see like so we talked about colors but look how they use the colors right look how they're contrasting different colors together and how it draws your attention to each of those three different uh items on the screen so contrast is something which could is really really important and how to know which colors that complement one another so in in that case you i think coolest does that by default so you notice whenever we're going through our palette it kind of with colors that was just seem naturally to fit together so use tools like that to sort of get a grasp of contrast but super important yeah and hari krishan just donated four dollars so thank you so much for that really really appreciate you that is freaking awesome good thank you and there's a good comment that came in from david breck and he actually says coolers is the best i used it for my final project last semester and it was looking really nice awesome awesome nice okay so let's move forward with this so number five grid systems these are really important now you guys hear us talking about grid systems in material ui or not just material ui but regular css we talked about grid and then even with bootstrap we talked about grid a lot and it's an important thing when you're designing you know even when you think about photo composition right you're thinking about rules of third rules of third is a grid system essentially so here for your own website design i think a grid system is important you want to add something on the grid system sony yeah so massive power here guys even for achieving responsive designs using a grid system allows you to actually really easily achieve that that sort of design that you're looking for so i know we talk a lot about flexbox but if you go ahead and master something like css grid achieving a responsive design is actually super super uh it's like it's very easy to do that with css grid so definitely something worth uh investing your time in and learning together lira fernandez says sunny plus cause the ultimate duo thank you and resvan says love your guys's content appreciate it brother so thank you next up now with gr i think grid systems is all important but like what kind of tools can you guys use to actually prototype grid systems and prototype and come up with design ideas for your website before you start coding it up so this is why we put this slide together for you guys tools for prototyping and um go ahead yeah just gonna say just how we say guys before you even write a line of code you should kind of like get an idea write it down on a piece of paper what you're trying to do right we do the same thing with design like with sketch with envision with adobe xd and and figma um pretty much you you that's what you go ahead and do you draw it out as you want to achieve your website they provide tools which allow you to go ahead and easily sort the layout without any code or anything and then you have something to work towards so this is this is adobe xd this is indesign uh this is envision envision got it this is figma over here and then this one is sketch yep yeah so design it first you guys before sometimes you just start creating though like oftentimes i personally kind of just jump into it but also i'm not a professional front end designer you know our front end developer so i think if you use these tools you make your uh development a lot better definitely definitely now here are some adobe xd resources so there's some go ahead you want to talk about it yeah so we have app integration guys slack jira um i can't remember what the last one was that well that's nice so you when you're designing you can actually just shoot it to your team in slack yeah and i actually worked in a company where they did this every time a design was updated it would ping in slack and i'd get the latest design really really handy stuff even ui kits guys so like all the apple designs all the microsoft designs all those things are built into these platforms so you can go ahead and get the apple layout as you just expect it uh um so alex actually went ahead and told me about one of the plugins for example if you want to have confetti on the screen or confetti on your design sometimes that can be quite hard to actually go ahead and add to your designs so there's little handy plugins that you can go ahead and install so just a quick showcase of the thing you can nice yep and then apparently it has a plugin of air table and plug in a react so that's also sounds pretty handy and then it got ui kits for apple if you're developing for them or microsoft so this is awesome now also i think what's important that alex was telling me too it goes you got to have inspiration resources so where can you go and get inspiration from because one thing i see with frontend developers and why they sometimes they have good intentions but it end up ends up being bad because they're coming up with everything uniquely on their own and sometimes that's why your design will be bad so have inspirations to derive from so then you can actually create something really powerful and good yeah steve mccarthy says my front ends look like 1990s web pages i think every developer can relate to you on that and that's why we use the sort of things that we're about to speak about nice got it this is that's actually really small um that's funny because my stuff looks like that too and here is mostly search which is pinterest for designers have you ever used the sunny so i'm not using muesli i've used the one that we're going to speak about next but i definitely when alex mentioned this i'm going to check this one out sure yeah yep so this is like pinterest for designers and you guys can actually type in whatever keywords that you're looking for right and then inspirations will pop up and i think they have like landing pages and all that type of stuff for you to get inspiration from so i would definitely make mosley search one of your guys's resources for front end design and even sunny and i will personally add it to our toolbox yeah like guys they have like three and a half thousand dashboards ten thousand landing pages mobile app designs even if you have a rough idea of what your app should look like there's no harm in going and checking out a bunch of designs to see what could be improved you know yep 100 and guys i think we just broke 900 concurrent viewers so thank you guys so much that is massive appreciate the love guys let's keep that energy up and let's keep getting this video out to even more people and you can just do that if you're here and you haven't liked the video already go ahead and just like the video and then it sends it out to more developers and more people who want to become developers thank you guys awesome thank you so here we have so the chrome extension for mosley is available too so you guys can just download it i believe for free and install it on chrome so you can do that it's called muesli to stay inspired and it has over 300 000 plus active users yeah really handy now let's jump into some design resources so sunny take it away the first one that we have here guys is a design blog by adobe so it's completely free to go ahead and read this subscribe to it and what we always do is we actually recommend this with javascript so there's a few javascript newsletters and that's what i personally use to stay at the front of the javascript and what's latest and what's going on so this is the exact same thing but for design and as a frontend developer super important guys it's going to teach you the latest processes the latest principles and also what the latest companies are doing in regards to design right so really really important to stay up to like in front of the in front of the crowd when it comes to this stuff like the type of stuff that i'm looking at right now that seems actually pretty powerful to me i mean that stuff's just catching my eyes unique insights so for example i want to know about interviews and how did they interview people based on design how did somebody pass the interview based on that i think that seems pretty amazing for somebody who's looking for a job yep definitely here are some great free design resources you guys and so if you have any um you want to add anything sunny feel free to jump in at any time but yeah so we have behance and dribble for those yeah i'm just going gonna say behance is one i gotta put in my uh repertoire as well but behance is absolutely amazing you guys so make sure you guys add that as one of your resources and then the next one is actually dribble dribble is amazing let me actually just open up because i have some experience with dribble and these guys are is triple with three b's it's three b's yeah three b's yeah there we go so it's dribble with three b's and you guys can go here and get inspirations for what you're trying to build so maybe let's say you're trying to build like that uh bottom nav bar or whatever on your mobile device and you can actually take a look at this inspiration right here or if you're trying to build a landing page you can take a look at this design yeah that somebody built you go oh that actually looks really great let me actually model this so if you look at the top and what i would honestly do is i would go to this platform and let's see if i can go in filters cool popular maybe you can go click web design right and go to the most popular web designs that you can see so say this one then just try to design this exact thing that looks exactly like that and put it in your portfolio see what i'm saying that will guaranteed work because it's already popping on the design website yeah one of the most popular ones the best thing is is that these are going to be less popular than the sort of typical sort of projects that you're going to see in everyone's portfolio so if you go here you're going to be sure that you have some pieces which stand out inside your portfolio and they're really attractive really look beautiful and it's also going to make you a better frontend developer so no harm in doing it yeah no harm in doing this like this is another one and i think that's a really good point that sunny made because sometimes if everybody is making clones of things sometimes your those people will be like well you probably just follow the tutorial you know to do this or you just follow the todo list tutorial but here it's not everybody's doing it so this will also make you stand out if you try to exactly model these pages yeah that will be a really good test for you guys so let's go back to the keynote that we had for you guys and i think i mean damn we're almost at a thousand total viewers on all platforms so that is amazing unbelievable unbelievable thank you guys so these are free resources and then you might be wondering like how can i improve my visual design skills and this is something we just touched on a little bit already so make sure you discover creative work on these platforms i think inspiration is probably going to be one of the most important things and then you know what the next most important thing is even within inspiration right you want to find few people and then model them so tell me your thoughts on this one sonny i think this is a really important point i never thought of this until alex explained it to me so like go ahead and find some designers and follow them because like he mentioned to me it's all about pattern recognition if you start to see and you follow their designs you're going to see where they go from like a rounded design to a flat design and if you're following three people and all of them are moving in that direction you can you can be sure that the industry might be switching to that direction and it's like a queue to then learn that stuff and go a bit more deeper into it just like how you follow me follow kazee nars in the javascript domain it's just as important in like visual design domain that you go ahead and follow someone so these are people on dribble and alex recommended that you guys go and follow these so definitely go and check him out um and he's an amazing designer and he actually goes and follows these people as well so be sure to go it's super killer because even one of the things that i learned when i'm looking for homes is we couldn't find a lot of good listings so what we did is we found the owner of a home that was like nice and we hit up the owner and the owner just showed us all other homes that were similarly amazingly designed oh nice you know what i'm saying so i think with when you're looking for website designs just follow a few people and then you can actually start to develop that same eye as them and you will guaranteed almost always find good principle designs because you're following the right people definitely and the next one is sunny what is this go ahead and build some app clones guys so if you haven't already we have actually gone ahead and built all of the clones on the screen right now so which is amazing to say that really nice yeah you guys so nice to look at it yeah it's really nice you guys can go ahead and build those and go and check them out and that's going to help you become a better frontend developer and it's going to help you improve your skill set so seriously and it's going to it's going to be something you add to your portfolio so definitely go ahead and check those because we built netflix we built tinder clone just a few days ago we built spotify cloned we built ticktock clone and instagram clone so these are all websites that we built and the front end for them so what better than to have these on your portfolio exactly awesome so with that said we're gonna jump back into this pretty much uh right away thank you for the donation basil straight back into oh thank you basil islam nice and you guys we're about to hit a thousand concurrent viewers on youtube very soon we're at 971 you guys are absolutely freaking beautiful daniel sulliada says awesome stream guys i believe most web developers are not great designers would it be beneficial for a web dev to learn ui ux design and what we will say is absolutely i think it's one of the key components you could have hidden in your back pocket you come in as a full stack developer or backend developer and then you just blow their minds with your design skills yeah it's what takes you from a junior frontend developer to a senior frontend developer having that difference in that visual skill yeah yep so i think it's absolutely killer guys thank you so much drop a like for the video if you're here and you've been enjoying this content let's keep sending it out to more and more people let's break that thousand mark and with that said let's continue with the value bombs so watching base now onto the back to the technical stuff guys so back to the technical nigrate what the hell is a framework guys we always are asking like which framework do i learn is it like angular view react javascript's always evolving it's always changing so how do you know which one which framework to start on and kazi like when you first entered this domain what was your thoughts on that i was very confused with all especially the web development it was just like i'm like let me just do python because python was just python and then web development was like view react angular this that that other thing and i'm like that seems like too much is going on yeah exactly there's a lot going on so we're gonna we're here to clear that up for you today guys on what you should focus all of your attention on so here are the most popular go ahead the most popular ones that we're going to cover guys are the first one you've probably heard of this angular it's google's uh framework right so you have google's framework it's very popular it grew quite a lot but it's sort of on the downward trend right now and then they had a view um i'm not actually sure because you know who actually came up with the view i'm not entirely sure i don't know who came out with you very lightweight uh library extremely sort of popular it's very opinionated um but it sort of surpassed angular and then the guys at facebook just came along and just like blew everyone's mind with like react like they came along i love this and they just took it to a whole new level you know like they um have we have have we gone to the next slide we're on react oh nice yeah awesome yeah so yeah this one guys this is by the guys over at facebook and this is obviously if you're not if you're new to the channel go ahead and check out the last few videos and we'll clear up what react is uh yeah so yeah massive companies are using all three of these right now guys so you've got airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox using react you've got guardian upwork paypal sony using angular and then you've got alibaba and a bunch of others using vue but how do you know which one to choose from these so like what would you look at when you were when you would make this decision that's really important i honestly a few things i always look at which is why i looked at python as well i look for simplicity and ease of use i almost put that above so many other things just because i want to know how what's the learning curve can i pick it up fast and then i also look at how long is this thing here to stay so like is it popular is it picked up by a lot of people and then of course i want to look at like what companies you know are using it so when i see like i look at the guardian and i'm like that's cool but airbnb is like more badass you know like upwork is cute but instagram is really where it's at yeah exactly yeah so i mean i think all of them are being used by popular but i strive for simplicity and um something that's just you know popular and trending right now exactly so with that said guys we went ahead and checked out stack overflow and wanted to see what the most wanted framework was and you guys guessed it right whoa we just broke 1 000 viewers concurrent we're over 1 000 viewers on youtube you guys are absolutely amazing thank you so much thank you guys damn that is amazing let's keep it rolling so go ahead thank you guys so the number one most wanted framework right now is flying with react right so yeah at the top you've got react so guys there is no downfall right now to learn and react react is here to stay you can be sure for the next five years if you learn react you're gonna have a job but you're gonna have some kind of income that will come from that so definitely worth investing your time yep and it's the most wanted framework now if we go over here you guys can see react is just flying off and this is actually like look this is the real download so this is not just some popularity this is literally download so take a look at this versus angular versus view and honestly a lot of the reason with angular is because it's too um it's it forces you into a framework and it forces you to code a certain way whereas with react it's not a framework it's just a library it's super lightweight so it's plug and play and then it's also a badass and you know you it's pretty much just like javascript under the hood yeah so next time you guys have that question should i learn angular should i learn view think about this like visual right here like angular is going off react is going off the chart oh there we go okay this visual right here okay i think you were talking about this visual because i'm like that other visual makes me not wanna you know if you guys loved it drop a thumbs up warrior warrior says this is insane you guys are lit we're always lit somebody also said this is like watching two friends just kind of give us advice so that's cool yeah i love that it is guys there's two friends just giving you guys advice amazing so what what is this over here right so yeah so we talked about react so we're gonna dive a bit more into react guys so react is all about component based design and what that means guys is literally you go ahead and break a website down into different components the header the navbar the body the text and all that goes in like the cards on amazon all of those things and you basically just reuse them right so it's literally like once you get the hang of that the reason why it's really really relates it guys it's actually super simple it's actually really easy to go ahead and reuse components so getting your head around the component based design is crucial now managing data and react like how does this work so when it comes to managing data and redux this is where people start to kind of lose their and start going crazy and this is why in our clones that we make like amazon clone where we use context api where we start to introduce the idea of redux and we built another tutorial i think with spotify where we use context api so this is another concept which introduces things like data layers and you needing to understand that which is super powerful and super valuable once you learn it and the stepbystep process of learning is learn context api first and then get into redux and is the easiest way to do it send me your thoughts on this exactly what cause you said pretty much so guys well the minute the minute you kind of hear about redux and you look at tutorials for redux this is your reaction it's pretty much like oh my god like it's kind of freaking me out and stuff so all we're going to say here is pretty much like kazi said go ahead learn the react context api first learn that pattern and then picking out redux is kind of easy so it's gonna it's gonna be a lot simpler than as if you were just jumping straight into redux for the first time so the next one yeah react context api it's going to be a lot easier to learn and pick up um and if you are interested in the builds that we've done we actually went ahead and done that so you can definitely use those as reference yep and you you know we have a free training for you guys profit with javascript free training so you guys can go ahead and sign up for it at any time we have a webinar that we've put together it's a one hour free webinar it's in the description below so if you guys want to go ahead and check that out definitely go ahead and sign up for it because it just gives you the exact road map to you know here we're diving deep into the front end developer guide in your roadmap in that one we're talking about how are you going to go from your zero dollars to making a hundred thousand dollars whether you do that in one year three years or five years it's really the road map to learning the coding skills and the practicality of your first hundred thousand dollars so i put that in the description below click that link and then sign up for that training it's freaking awesome definitely go check that out guys free value so definitely worth checking out now i included this one because i have a lot of people who do ask about something called mob x right i had a question about it before uh it says basically another uh opinionated version of like managing data within a react app honestly my my viewpoint here is if anyone has this question go ahead and use react context api and then redux if you want to do this it's just kind of a cool thing to learn but honestly if you want to land a job redux is the way to go got it and now check out the live bills that we have free on youtube all right so bruce buffer is endorsing us apparently and over here you can see we got the zoom clone i mean i know it's really hard for you guys to see but we got the zoom clone that we made recently we made a spotify clone for you guys we made the tick tock clone uh that's at you know in six days we have over 117 000 people watched that one and a lot of them built it out we built a youtube clone for you guys you can see the exact frontend design for youtube and then we also did the tinder clone and then a bunch of more stuff so go ahead and guys like that's all there for free on youtube so make sure you get value from that as well exactly and guys if you were if you've watched any of these and you found value from that just all we ask is you smash the thumbs up button and that's enough for us to break break the thumbs up button exactly now okay so what's this what am i looking at all right so next guys we have design libraries so what are design libraries they help us achieve that clean ui they help us to achieve things like that grid system that we spoke about earlier so here are two popular ones one's called material ui ones called bootstrap now they give us things like icon sets so we can use like we've used it in a lot of our builds so like having those clean flat buttons which have the responsive click and that google sort of ripple effect and also that responsive design both material ui and bootstrap are going to help you achieve that now we spoke about react both of them are very very heavily supported with react they have a react bootstrap and material ui out by default supports react so definitely worth something looking into guys yep awesome so now we have node and npm so now let's talk about what is node and what is npm is it on the next slides or do we got to talk about it now uh no it's on here so node guys in case you're wondering because i know it can be confusing when you see javascript and node.js you're like oh i mean aren't they the same thing right so we talked about earlier frontend development is in javascript whenever you have any backend software any any code which sits on the server somewhere that's node.js so that's like living on a server somewhere and it runs in something called node.js now mpm is how you pull in essentially other packages and other modules into your code so if you're going to use material ui or bootstrap you would use npm now npm stands for node package manager and it basically whenever you write a piece of code that you want to share with others you store it on the node registry and then other people can go ahead and pull it so definitely what we do use that in everything 100 now over here we got npm and we got yarn and oftentimes people say how do i choose so how do you choose sunny right so this is very sort of opinionated uh yarn is quite a powerful one to use it's very clean actually and i used to be a firm believer in sticking with mpm but i would actually go ahead and use yarn but guys whatever you decide to use just stick to the one like then you can learn both there's no harm at all um but don't have your project and sometimes you do npm sometimes you do yarn just stick to one and that's going to be um you're sort of clear enough and and guys if you're going to a job and they're using yarn carry on using yarn if you're going to a job they're using npm karen using npm it's really not a big decision and it's not as scary as everyone thinks yep travel todd says travel tools says i was zero in react i watched all the clones now i know react context api and he says sunny's way of teaching is the best on youtube i love that thank you so much travel tools so go watch those yeah definitely go ahead and check those out love that now what is firebase and why is it so useful for a frontend developer now guys what's beautiful about firebase this thing is going to blow your mind is you actually don't even need a backend like node you can actually do realtime database you can do user authentication you can do um pretty much everything you could do with the normal data including hosting your website you can do all of that with firebase yeah massive value here guys so firebase is provided by google a bunch of different tools are included in firebase and literally what kazi said is what they do so it's pretty much they wanted to alleviate and get rid of that headache with the back end and sort of you they just want you to focus on your frontend developer they want you to make beautiful apps and make it simple for you to deploy them host them handle authentication and all that stuff so we're going to run through some of the things that firebase offer which can help you as a frontend developer yep so firebase can do hosting and it also allows you to think 100 million users and you guys should also think about 100 million users always so when your app has 100 million users can it handle it and with firebase the answer is yes it can actually handle it and it do it automatically for you exactly scales up scales down just by itself so very simple to go ahead and do that we also have the cloud of uh we have the realtime firestore database so guys this is amazing like power behind this and i don't think anyone realizes until you actually go ahead and play with it without doing any backend stuff you get a realtime database so like literally if you've got messages coming through you don't have to do any magic behind that it will just come through inside on your front end with very minimal code like literally three lines of code and you can have something coming through so extreme power at the realtime database and what's up with this yeah so here guys a lot of you guys are asking about machine learning can we do it can we do it or like do we need python if you guys are interested in machine learning you can combine something called tensorflow.js which is a way of uh training models in machine learning with the uh with firebase and you can actually have really really powerful machine learning uh functionality with jacked front end developer yeah like all of this is like crazy guys like you can do all of this very simply and on the next slide there's a little diagram showing you about how we can train a model and then we can serve it using firebase so really powerful stuff the training is taking place here right and then serving is all happening with firebase and firebase is all front end like what what is happening what is life so that's the beautiful thing so even if you don't understand machine learning you're sitting you're going what am i looking at doesn't matter like the whole idea is that with firebase it's possible so even if you learned it later you could do it just to tell you how far you can push it with this authentication dude check this out marouche says sunny and kazi i got promoted yesterday because of learning react from your tinder clone many things it's amazing well done dude we love that we helped you out that's amazing uh let me actually see this um that's awesome yeah i got maroosa sunny and yeah i got promoted that's awesome thank you so much dude i'm i'm pumped for you that's huge we got frank in the house paton says wow this guy is coding in 2021 you know us we're in the future we'll wait for everybody else to catch up guys we're all in the future everybody who's here it's the culture we're freaking driven we're grateful we're all pumped that's the culture that we're building in the team and i feel like that's what we have even in the community exactly on the user authentication side guys i imagine as a frontend developer you can actually add google authentication facebook authentication twitter authentication github regular email or even with the phone like all of this you guys can add with firebase and it's super simple to be able to do that with firebase yeah as a full stack developer guys i can tell you at first hand doing that is not a simple task but firebase make it extremely simple to do user authentication so save yourself the hassle use firebase when you're doing it exactly and thank you frankie for removing those messages because i was about to do that guys keep the chat positive otherwise you're going to get blocked we want the culture to be just filled with positive and amazing people so let's keep the positivity going we read all of your comments if you want to be a part of this community bring positivity bring love and those are the people that are more than welcome here cloud functions with firebase i mean you can actually do this from front end and this essentially allows you to be able to do all the backend functionality you could ever dream of cloud functions allow you to do that and they allow you to do it kind of from the front end so that's a really beautiful thing anything else you want to touch base on with this before we move forward um just really powerful basically if you ever need some backend functionality guys don't go ahead and start up an express server or something like that your your answer would be in cloud functions in case anyone was wondering that so definitely go ahead and learn those if you're interested in doing some kind of back end with your front end yup uh here is an amazing uh comment from the good gamer and he says i got a job as a developer thanks qazi i've not done any tutorials but i followed your other videos and django course damn amazing nice that is amazing man pumped to hear that well done so let's go here now now storage firebase also allows you to do all the storage so when you're storing media when you want your media to be optimized and served in the fastest way possible firebase handles that when you want to have a database and you want to store things videos anything like that firebase can handle that for you as well yeah exactly they do google on it they do a bunch of analytics and test lab stuff so analytics keeping track of your users who's doing what on your on your platform is massively useful and insightful especially as your business grows firebase test lab guys if you build an app firebase test lab literally will check that app across so many different physical devices and it will show you screenshots of how the app looks on every single one of those devices automatically which is insane like that's really really insane really powerful especially when you're sort of you want your app to work on everyone's device and be universal so really really powerful stuff super powerful henrik says do you have a tutorial using firebase almost every single one of our clones that we built on our youtube channel over the last few weeks you guys can go and watch them tick tock instagram um facebook messenger clone tinder clone netflix clone all of them pretty much are using firebase so you can watch them they're amazing tutorials on how to use firebase yep exactly it allows you to grow your business it allows you a b testing cloud messaging inapp messaging all that good stuff comes with firebase built in now what's the best part about firebase do you guys want to know exactly well let's go for it and what is that sonny guys it's free it's fast and it's easy to use free to a limit guys so all the use cases which you guys are probably going to be using it for completely free so you guys can go ahead even deploying your apps guys it will give you a really beautiful little url which is actually completely fine to keep that url as your primary url and you can pretty much host it forever for free so definitely and it's the easiest hosting solution i've ever seen when it comes to a web app so definitely worth going ahead and doing that agreed now let's move on into which code editor should i use because we've talked about firebase and i think firebase is phenomenal and hopefully you guys love that too but i think one thing a lot of people want to know is what code editor should i use so here we got you know that code editor war should i use webstorm should i use visual studio code sublime or adam what do you recommend sunny so i was actually i've kind of gone through a bunch of these i use sublime at one point i use atom but now my by far guys just for the simplicity of how you add on extensions and sort of the the growth of it uh vs code guys vs code is so powerful it's ridiculous like i would really really recommend and we're going to run through some of the stuff as to some of the reasons as to why we're firm believers that it's definitely the best code for you guys yep and here now we're going to jump into also the extensions that are actually the most powerful for vs code i think one extension alone makes it that you can't go and look anywhere else the one extension that comes to my mind is called live share this alone makes me feel like you can never use anything like adam is just like it seems like it's from 1930s now uh yeah so does every other editor that i could dream of the live share means sunny and i can code remotely he's in london i'm in us on the same freaking code editor and it feels like your local host it's not screen share it's not team viewer it's literally the same exact thing so he's seeing it in perfect resolution he has access to my command line my localhost 3000 and even when my browser localhost 3000 is up he can actually view the website and everything exactly guys it's so powerful and just for that one extension alone it's worth downloading and just giving it a try so really really powerful stuff we've got a few others which are not worth mentioning we've got prettier so a lot of us hate doing that indentation we hate adding spaces how many stuff is very opinionated so like we just want it so when you hit save it just formats all your code and keeps it concise pretty it does that for you really really handy stuff um any others worth mentioning here qazi the other ones that i think are worth mentioning here i like brackets a lot so in javascript and react and all this one thing that was annoying to me as a python user is like oh my god so many freaking squiggly brackets and parentheses and it's insane and then semicolons and you miss one of those and your code just doesn't work and it's hard to see it's hard to visualize so what this does is it gives you matching brackets so you guys see how this red one over here closes this red one right over there right and then the yellow one closes the yellow one so each bracket having its own color is very very useful because you know where easily it opens where it closes and you never will have that problem again another extension that's important to mention is this snippets one where for react it's super important where you can just do rfce and boom it just makes a component for you i think that's pretty damn handy but in terms of the usefulness of it like i think you know all of these are pretty important the ones we use the most is prettier i think another one that gets used a lot if you're doing remote programming is live share and then i would say uh the snippets and then the brackets yeah exactly so on the next side we touch base on pretty much what we spoke about the lentis and formats that you need are prettier eslint and es7 snippets in my opinion they are really really something which is going to dial you in and make you much faster of what you do also one that we haven't put on here guys i think it's built into vs code by default it's called emit emit is really powerful guys it's how we you'll see when i'm coding sometimes i'll just write div dot and then i'll have some stuff on there and it's very very powerful in in order to write html very fast so definitely worth checking out cool so these are your linters right eslant prettier and es7 snippets so you guys can use these these are good for linting and formatting and what that means is some of them will check your code so i think prettier will format your code and make it look pretty lint will tell you like you know this looks wrong uh you're using the wrong type of pattern here or like it'll like highlight hey you shouldn't use this many characters in one line things like that right sonny yeah do you know where the lin came from the name i didn't know this until like literally about a week ago you know those linters that you put on your clothing oh i didn't know that yeah so it's like picking up the the the fluff of your code that's why it's called yes lint do you know where it's debugging do you know where debugging came from yeah they found a fly right in the massive in one of the first computers or something yeah they would get flies or cockroaches and things like that in the physical computer so they would debug by taking them out they would take out the bugs from the computer i love that i don't know i think frankie or somebody told me that yeah vs code live share important extension pair programming this is how sunny and i usually program exactly the blonde one is me especially when it comes to react that's so funny all right guys how do you but like with all this said like how do you go ahead and learn like how do you what's our advice to you guys if you're new to this journey like how do you go ahead and learn um so we've got a few things on the slides coming up so we've got uh we've got youtube so we've got youtube and from youtube we're talking about our tutorials completely free guys you can go ahead and check them out we've also got um we also recommend that you go ahead and join a community guys so whether it be facebook whether it be linkedin whether you're recording your journey on instagram or whether it be discord or even slack so like uh we actually have our internal slack community which we go ahead and recommend definitely something worth checking out what's your thoughts on that yeah i think this community is super important you know this is why in profit with javascript we just developed a curated community of people you know uh profitable javascript is our paid coaching uh paid program for javascript where we teach you these skills but really the community like you kind of come for the course but you stay for the people you know you stay for the community and so we've got over 1300 members and they're just so freaking amazing and dialed in but guys it doesn't matter whether you join our community or somebody else's just make sure you're part of some community i think it's important it helps you keep moving forward and it keeps you accountable and yeah the people matter yeah so join a community and um should we talk about profit with javascript right now or i think we can talk about a little bit later yeah we took my eye after yeah okay so guys something yeah go for it so what is tutorial hell sonny you can talk about this actually yeah so guys what we find is like a lot of people what they do is they tend to sort of follow tutorials that they see whether it be on youtube or like a stack overflow tutorial and then what they'll do is they'll copy it line by line and what you'll end up with is like you'll finish 10 projects for example but you basically like you haven't really learned anything you just have 10 cool projects that you can show but if i was to go in and change something or break something you wouldn't be able to tell me like how to fix it or something like that and then we call that tutorial hub because if you feel like you're doing all these tutorials but you're just not learning anything right so my best advice in this case is don't uh whenever you do that either one extend onto what you've built so if you build a youtube clone add some functionality to the youtube clone so that it then goes further than what was taught inside of that uh any any other tips on how to get out of tutorial i think just build real projects you guys like dribble built for like for example if you're front end developer look at what's on dribble build that uh look at what inspires you build it um don't get stuck in tutorial help move on and actually start doing useful stuff with what you learned now when it comes to fundamentals master them okay yeah master them guys and the reason why we added this slide is because it really is a it's a huge step and it's going to be the difference between you moving very fast and you're moving extremely slow like go ahead break down the fundamentals and use things like w3 schools w3 schools is amazing i love this by the way i just wanted to throw this in here epic epic zeus says you guys are like assassin's creed forming a brotherhood of nextgen programmers we work in the dark to serve the light hey love that nice awesome coin by epic that's a cool name as well it exists yeah that is a pretty dope name yeah nice okay so yeah guys mastering the fundamentals and what is one of those i love this game that is the funniest thing i've ever seen oh my god so one of the fundamentals guys is get and github and you guys have to learn that and for those of you who know about git merge nobody ever wants to see it happen it's not fun yeah but you got to learn it i think it is very very important a lot of people are saying lag but i think we're going to keep going until it just ends yeah i think it's i think it's cleared up now yeah we're good yep so why you need need to know git and github why is this important sonny i don't care about it i don't need to know about it right you know i can just become a developer without it that's what i for dude but every single professional job that you go in any team environment where you've got more than one developer they don't work together by sharing the files right they work together with git right you need to know get if you're going to be a professional web developer whether it be uh freelancing and you're jumping into a team of a team of sort of developers or you're going into a permanent position you need to know gear and you because what happens is they store their code on something called a repository and then basically you need to learn how to push code to that repository pull code from so if another developer's done some work you can pull that in all of those things are covered with git right now the most popular platform that users get is github you've also got git labs and a few others but i really recommend getting familiar with github it's the most popular it's owned by microsoft now and it's here to stay so it's definitely getting more powerful definitely worth investing your time in that yeah and remember guys one thing i think that's confusing git is not github yeah a lot of people get that uh confusion github is like dropbox for code github is like google drive for code that's github is just like a place where you put your code that's it so git hub is not that important to learn like it doesn't matter if you use github or if you use bitbucket that's not that git you must learn git this is version control this is the time machine for your code if you mess something up you can go back in time so exactly pretty good time machine yeah it's like and also guys it can be scary i know when you're trying to learn github with the terminal so if you guys are experiencing that sort of fear or you're like oh i don't want to touch anything because i'm freaking out and i'm going to break something then something i recommend is something called get kraken which is actually a really nice interface for gear and you can pretty much drag and drop your branches and do all your stuff very visually so if you are afraid of it go ahead and check out get cracking really handy uh gui for uh for handling get yeah yeah i think that's important i'm sometimes mentioned that too so awesome so let's go back uh yeah henrik when he watched that part but git is not github he asked earlier like what's the difference between them and then he's like oh that's yup that's for me so guys just to kind of recap you know we touched on a lot of things and we still have a bunch of things to go but we talked about frameworks right and why react is the framework that you should actually pick uh we're going to talk we talked about that html and javascript is what you need to know to become a developer you know frontend developer and we've touched on other things like you know which code editor you should use but we still have some other things we're gonna touch on moving forward okay so just stay buckled in we're gonna keep going and if you're here and you're enjoying this make sure to like the video so it goes out to other people please it helps us definitely please do that all right cool now what is a pre processor now all right go ahead go for it yeah so a preprocessor guys is pretty much it's it applies to css so we talked about the three fundamentals html css javascript but we're talking about preprocessors all about css right and what it does basically is it's kind of like think of it simply as an upgrade to your css right so with sas they introduced um so on the next side we've got three really uh really popular ones we've got sas post css and less right they're quite opinionated you can use whatever one you prefer sas was quite a popular one that i saw and it basically introduced something called uh like variables into your into your css which was really really powerful guys and it also allowed you to do nesting and a bunch of other stuff so it basically made it more maintainable to go ahead and use um css i think post css and css modules also prevents one of those common problems that we run into where for example in react you you developing components right so if you have two different files and you have the same class name in each of those files you can have like overriding rules without realizing by using these libraries it actually goes ahead and adds an additional class name to it so you never get that issue so even if you had the same class names it wouldn't actually clash so really important things here very subtle but very important if you want to become that next level developer yep awesome all right so let's move to the next one styled components so what are these sunny so this is in react we use start components i really i'm a big fan of style components i think we'll actually go ahead and include this in the next build um basically in react you have something called props and it's very difficult sometimes to have like how do you use your variables so like your javascript variables with css for example if you want to if you've got like a variable which is true or false how do you apply that with your css style components is your answer it allows you to very simply go ahead and do that and you can pretty much basically go ahead and use your props in a component and and and conditionally render your style based on those and those variables so really really powerful stuff uh yeah really really and it's here to stay guys a lot of big companies use it yeah beautiful we just got another super chat by dpunk thank you for that thank you really appreciate it we're over 21 in super chat so thank you guys all right now steve says much less useful now we have css variables natively really good point actually yeah so that's the reason why sas is being less used now i'm also going to talk about sas is being less used oh yeah yeah so like because we have css variables natively now it's actually not as needed as it used to be and it's quite there's quite a few issues with it but we're going to talk about a few things which actually helps you alleviate the the problems that you use you experience with sas so one of them is css modules which we spoke about if you have two files with the same class names this is going to help you avoid that problem and the next one is sas actually allowed you to do something called nesting right but the problem was that people used to nest like five levels deep they would have like um let's just say like card underscore title underscore text underscore like uh link or something like that and it just got super complicated so bem is a really good naming convention which i recommend everyone goes and learns we actually use this in all of our builds really really important stuff i i hated it when i started by the way guys i really didn't see the value in them so i'm somebody who got converted on this and i really do live by it now so something definitely worth learning and because he's a big fan of them now too oh yeah now i know about this now guys with pwa oftentimes we get that question like hey what's a pwa which actually was a question i had in the chat when we were coding and then steve answered but like this is progressive web apps so this is where you're coding in a way where literally like whatever you're building will essentially be turned into a mobile app as well for a phone and it's like native so that's a little bit about how progressive web apps work you want to add anything on this sony um i think on the next side we have a really nice breakdown so basically you're gonna you're coding like a web app but it's very very similar to your native app right so here's a bunch of features of a pwa so you have it's fully responsive and it has a very high browser compatibility right when you use uh create react app with react it is making a pwa just in case you're wondering uh it works offline so you can use something like service workers service workers make the app super fast and allow that offline sort of functionality which you get with a normal app it has like an app like interface so you can actually go ahead and click the more option on like an iphone for example and you can add it to your home screen and it actually gives you a native app fill so it goes onto your home screen and even removes the browser the bar at the top when you open it so it's like super clean you can also get push notifications which is really important but i don't know why and if apple will ever watch this video i don't know can you guys hurry up on that because android allowed push notifications on pwas for a very long time but apple was still on the fence with it so it's been a big discussion and they're really pushing for it but i really do want them to do that but you can get push notifications on a pwa yeah nice and you've already talked about that it's fast with service workers so these are the features of pwa awesome now you got a lot of type checkers like typescript and then you got flow there's typescript and oftentimes people are like what is typescript so what is typescript sunny so it's a superset of javascript so it basically sits on top so it's not like a different language or anything like that it's just like a layer on top of java javascript and basically if you came from a java background or any strongly typed language background then you'll know what types are right so javascript's a weekly type language which means that you don't have to say that a string is going to be a string you have to say that a number is going to be a number et cetera your number's going to be an integer but with typescript you now get that functionality and it also gives you a bunch of other things like inheritance and all these other things that you had in those strongly typed languages so it's basically like like the visual here it's like a super jacked up jack javascript nice i love that image alex goes thanks for the comment shout out clever programmer but i've been asking this and just got aired are you planning to make an eight hour long video for learning react.js yes we are it's gonna be probably 12 hours long yeah and it's gonna have like a lot of amazing content in it so let's move forward with this this is typescript versus flow yeah so guys literally this is a big opinionated debate and i've actually got into huge debates in actual professional companies where we talk about are we going to use typescript are we going to use flow my opinion on this matter is use typescript because it's much more sort of picked up now it's much more in use it's much more robust and the power and it's actually supported by microsoft um i i believe so it's actually they're working as well but it's more of an official uh superset of javascript as opposed to i think that it has a new name now which i think you probably haven't heard about oh yeah yeah it's actually called hype script this is where we need the bell you know hey so yeah guys you know look into it all right we got dino so what's the hype all about all right so dino we always see comments flying in about dino and yes guys if you're interested in about you know we can go ahead and make a video about it it's basically a runtime environment so just like you have node.js right which runs on the servers dino also runs on servers and it's pretty much a case of it's like a it's like a more modern version of node.js so out of the box um it supports typescript whereas node.js you have to install a bunch of things to get typescript so that's an example of the difference it also comes with a bunch of uh it's built in rust i believe so it's very optimal it's very fast uh i think it may pick up but it's very it's very early in in that journey so definitely something which i mean is it's one of those cool things if you're interested in this and you're you're what you're enjoying the video sure go check out dino we can make a video on that awesome all right so now let's get into there's stuff going on here with webpack so webpack is pretty important to learn why is this important why should we care so yeah so when you're learning uh like especially when you're trying to build progressive web apps i recommend you kind of start with create react apps you don't have to jump in with and learn web packs because they basically get rid of that headache for you but when you go into a professional environment and you're doing any sort of javascript i can be sure like you can be sure that they're going to actually be handling the build process with webpack by itself or something like rollup.js which is a different one but basically what this does guys is it bundles your app so all the files all the css all of those things into one bundle which is then served and that's what the user sees as and then go right so definitely something which is quite important and you should go ahead and learn yep definitely dev tools guys master chrome dev tools you can do so much with this thing this is probably one of the most important things i mean i don't even know how you can develop apps or develop web stuff without doing this because that's the number one ask for learning but this is pretty much that thing you do when you go on chrome and you right click and inspect right the thing that pops up that allows you to do everything so like if i was just to demo it for anybody that doesn't know about this like literally if you go on youtube right now you should know how to use things like death tools at a very basic level at least and then you can master but you should master them so you know for people who have never like looked into it let's wait for this to pop up there oh damn our freaking video is the first recommendation let's go nice so nice so now guys over here we got logan paul he's thinking about youtube we have grant cardone talking about how to close over the phone but i can actually hit inspect yeah and then i can even choose this and i can go ahead and literally change the name of this thing over here or find out how youtube is using you know how is youtube formatting this how are they using html and css and i can then use that to reverse engineer this into kind of my own app and you guys can go ahead and change like some of the copy that's on here so this is something uh i this is something i actually do pretty regularly because i want to put my video here and check what it actually looks like so we can actually say you know we're going to be dropping our twitter clone project tomorrow with the react js and you can see boom it just popped that in so this is just a basic basic example of this i'm sure most of you probably know how to use it more than this and it's one gonna be one of your most important tools to use so dev tools and chrome 100 learn that yeah and also guys we like if you're debugging console logging everything out is a really good way of debugging so you definitely need to use uh dev tools when you're console logging yep 100 so let's go to next one what is this this is the react profiler so when you're coding with react it's all about once you get to a certain level it's about making your react app optimal so that you know that it's only rerendering what it needs to rerender the react profiler is just you access it in the same way that kazi showed you how you access the inspector but you need to install that i believe on the the chrome extensions but basically guys that's basically it's a very very good way of checking what's rendering inside your react app and how many times it's rerendering it also allows you to manipulate the state and the props so you can actually go in their head and you go you can go and check out and you can change the state and properly when you're sort of building out an app it can really help you out and assets just wrote a good comment he says stick with node for now dino's community is not that big big as it is very new and that's a very good point you guys for now before you jump on the hype train of dino stick with node kind of learn dino for like hobby projects you know do stuff on the side so you're just aware of it but npm isn't gonna go anywhere it's gonna be there for pretty much for a really long time and if dino really starts to take off then siri more seriously start looking into it but you know i do say that the hype train matters if you catch trends that helps put you ahead of people so you know i think it's not a bad idea just even as a hobby play around with it and kind of get to know it yeah definitely and guys it's just going to make you a better frontend developer when you when you mess around with these tools and then you sort of get more and more used to all of these things um so nothing no harm with going ahead and learning it 100 now native apps and react native what is this yeah so guys if you code in react just know that you're going to get the benefit of actually then transferring pretty much like 90 percent of that knowledge to something called react native and the react native allows you to build native ios and android apps so really really powerful to to be able to do that and i've actually first hand done this and you can get full full native apps with the same react code base pretty much so really really powerful beautiful and electron allows you to make desktop apps so this is uh electron js right that's the library yeah i think slack is actually built with electrons i think slack is built with electron and yesterday i discovered something else pretty huge was built with electron somebody messaged me on instagram saying some garbage uh zacky actually he usually says really great things but he sent a message saying something funny and then i responded to him let me see if i can actually pull up his message because that was pretty um insightful i mean you can talk about this for a second while i look for it yeah so guys really really uh useful stuff here like the fact is like if you know what slack is you know how popular and you know how much that's taken off it just shows you that yes you can also make you can make money from like mobile apps and web apps but guys remember their desktop apps started the whole thing off right like having like microsoft word having those things actually started at the whole i got it zacky zaki sent me a message on instagram and he said no offense but electron gs is crap with normal windows development you just need to learn c sharp with some xml you know some c c sharp with some xml in your set so that's it pretty easy huh and then he goes personally i'd rather learn that instead of electron but js is definitely powerful with no cap and i responded to him and i said visual studio code is built with electron js and also slack is built with electron js so i'm like i'd ease up on calling that crap yeah the visual studio code is what you're going to be using to code that c sharp that you were talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know just that's what it is like it's a valuable thing learn it i think it's it can be helpful if you want to make desktop apps now let's talk about testing frameworks so testing so let's talk about unit versus integration versus for functional testing so so three different types guys we've got an example here called of just called and basically that's an example of unit unit testing is when we test one specific area of an app right or like a website so it's a very specific thing right integration is when we integrate two different areas of an app and we test it together so like does this screen work with this screen or does this sort of functionality with this one crossing over with this one work together and then functional is like as a user if i do a login and i go through the entire journey is it everything working so you see like there's a big difference between the three just is a very very common um unit testing framework which is used and they usually combine it with something called enzyme so on the next side we have enzyme and here we have uh it's basically very very popular i'm sorry i just want to interrupt you for a second elizabeth who's also you know future code and she said and she was supposed to have a few interviews this week i think she's actually in la right now and she said she was having a few interviews and she said right now i had a major interview for a qa test engineer position while demoing my projects i casually left my deployed netflix app up in the browser and dropped it in they asked me to come back for the next round oh that's nice that's awesome especially if you're doing qa guys they're going to look at that and be like whoa this guy this person can like code this stuff oh wow we just got a five dollar donation oh thank you guys thank you so much and uh at one modus says hey kazi you help me to go from zero coding knowledge to qa automation tester way back in chicago five years ago oh nice oh that is amazing um dude can you drop your name in the chat because i think like i personally worked with you in person five years ago like literally i used to work with him in panera bread on teaching him coding so that would be awesome if you did that yeah i think so nice um before we started clever programmer but what future code was saying earlier was like the netflix clone that we actually built a few days ago and she had that open on the interview so you guys this stuff is powerful this can actually help you land jobs and then she went ahead and future code said i know my updated portfolio thanks to clever programmers getting recognized by companies for sure thanks guys awesome love that yep that makes us super super happy all right so we got just out of the way now what's up with what is this so enzyme so just as a unit testing framework that is most uh most of the time in react we combine it with enzymes so enzymes are testing utility for react and it basically allows you to test the user interface very easily so like if i click this button is the expected uh change on the page gonna happen or not right and it allows you to test all of that extremely fast and what people tend to do is something called test driven development where they'll write these tests using enzyme ingest first and then they would basically build the functionality until the test passes so something to definitely take he dropped it in and he said yes it's modesto from panera yep man that is awesome thank you so much for the donation i really appreciate it and that is amazing that was before any clever programmer any of that that was a great time so i appreciate you for sticking around and even now like helping out that's insane dude that's amazing nice go ahead yeah so we talked about enzyme enzymes a really popular one but what the problem was is that when sort of reactor really quickly evolved so we started seeing hooks and those sort of things uh enzyme quickly kind of got pushed to the side and react testing library is now part of create react app by default so this is a testing library and it supports hooks it supports all of the latest features um and when you use create react app you notice me and kazi usually delete these files um but if we're gonna eventually we will teach you we'll teach you guys how to go ahead and we personally don't like to test a lot yeah we test for like testing ourselves in a professional environment i guess yeah we could go ahead and teach some testing at some point like in a professional environment you would have modesto and he would be helping out with testing you would actually have somebody who has a job as a qa engineer who's doing the testing and so that way you yeah but i mean i think it's still important to learn test driven development i used to do it actually but i think it's just i'm lazy and i avoid it yeah and honestly guys my take on that is if you know how to do testing well for example if you get an interview and they ask you to build something if you write some unit tests in that interview watch them go a bit crazy like that's my honest advice to you guys just write a couple of tests and they will they will look at you and they'll put you above everyone else you submitted just by writing a few unit tests so just a little top tip there that's important that's actually really important uh to know that so you guys get your testing right and then you can actually um you know i think everybody should be getting tested right now uh anyway but you know get your get this right and you'll probably get a job too so the next one guys is functional testing we spoke about unit we spoke about integration but functional is when like it's basically mimicking what a user would do inside your app so an amazing one that i really recommend you guys go ahead and play with is something called cyprus to io and basically like if you want to log in the entire login journey see if everything's working you can pretty much record the journey and literally do it as you would do it and then it will programmatically write the code for you which is amazing uh and then you just click run and it'll basically run through your entire app super fast and you can do this in a really like a productive way and you can have this running in the background when every time you push your code something definitely worth looking into you now you guys might have heard of something called selenium selenium is uh modesto got a job doing selenium oh nice nice but yeah so like selenium was the most popular automation testing um framework for a very long time but it was quite clunky and then the guys over at site who who made cyprus style saw that it was clunky and soils outdated so they went ahead and built cyprus and cyprus i think it's only for chrome but it works so fast compared to selenium so guys like i really would recommend you just play with cyprus if you haven't ever tried that before and it's really easy yeah so yeah trice i burst you guys and um just want to say that we broke 18 000 views so far nice uh so thank you guys so much for that we're only an hour and 25 minutes into it we're uh yeah we still got a lot more value bombs coming for you guys but just to recap you guys we've talked about a lot of things we've talked about sas we've talked about react being the framework that you should choose we've talked about learning javascript we've talked about learning firebase and how that will be your frontend your backend your hosting cloud messaging like all of those things allinone database we have talked about even now we're talking about uh we talked about coding editors which coding editors best so visual studio code was our recommendation and right now we're talking about you know what testing frameworks you should use and between cypress and selenium and all these ones we recommend use cypress so there's a lot that we've covered but there's still a lot more that we're going to be covering so keep taking notes have a legal pad next to you because this is one of those videos that can really if you watch it and you follow everything that's laid out in here you can very realistically have a job plan three sixmonth 12month plan like a solid plan that can actually land you a job exactly we also covered just to add on to that list we actually covered the five key concepts for uh as a visual like a visual design yeah so really important stuff and guys oh one thing i want to say is i don't know i think yesterday might have been the biggest day of our subscribers i kind of just want to check real quick but we're hitting a lot of craziest number of subscribers thanks to you guys because you guys are coming in for the live streams and oh my god like look at this this is actually the biggest day we have ever had what so look at yeah so look at this this is our subscribers column and if you guys take a look at this you guys are helping us fly and we were hitting 1000 and then after you guys started jumping in two thousand three thousand four thousand yesterday was the biggest day we had in a really long time and that was 5 000 so thank you guys so much for subscribing to the channel and really just showing us your love and one reason i want to give you to subscribe to the channel which is actually i think really important is we're gonna be dropping the twitter clone uh we're gonna be dropping the twitter clone tomorrow so if you subscribe to the channel i don't want you to miss out on it it's gonna come up like a nice notification on your phone all the way at the top so when you subscribe make sure to turn the bell notifications on so just like gary vee's videos or whoever's videos you watch show up right here graham stefan or grant cardone or whoever you watch our twitter clone will pop up right there and then you can just click it whether you're bored you're in a line you're waiting for something or you just want to like learn and build it and add it to your portfolio you can just click and jump in so go ahead if you want to build twitter clone project and these types of things that we're building on a regular basis subscribe to this channel right now please and then turn on the bell notifications alongside it definitely make sure you guys don't miss that tomorrow will be a lot of fun and it'll be your chance if you haven't already to do your first build or add to your portfolio if you've been following us yep so what's up with the server side rendering yeah so this is a hot topic uh when it comes to sort of frontend development so server side rendering if you guys don't know what it is it's when most of the time when we sort of build a react app or any sort of app it's usually sort of we go on a web page we request the web page and then they basically send us all the files everything sort of loads the javascript loads on our browser right now that works pretty quick for the most part but what if you want the website to be super fast like if you wanted to basically as soon as you go on that website snap the things loaded so what happens is with server side rendering basically when you make that request when i go into for example google.com or something like that what's going to happen is we send that request google servers does all of the heavy lifting so it basically gets the entire web page bundled together right so it does the entire it bundles the entire webpage together and then it just serves the entire thing at once right so it basically does all the javascript calculations all that sort of uh that stuff which usually does take time on the page and what does this mean it means that the time to interaction is less so that's a crucial thing when you're a frontend developer how quick is the time to interact what i mean by that is when when you click on like say for example you go on facebook.com how quickly is it before you can start playing around with the page right yeah that's a crucial guys as a frontend developer you want that time to interact to be as low as possible serverside rendering is the answer to get that down damn awesome i think we complemented your words very nicely with the written yeah that's really nice awesome awesome so let's go here so what's this next.js so yeah next.js is one of the most popular uh server side rendering frameworks uh and it's very hot right now so if you're looking in this space i would recommend uh maybe look at preact preact is a very lightweight version of doing server side rendering but next.js is the one to use if you're gonna go ahead and do it in uh in a professional environment and i did actually use this so in america you have walmart in in england you have something called tesco tesco is like the size of walmart pretty much uh and it's they use next.js in that uh to render their web pages so it's massive um and basically it's it's extremely powerful it also offers a bunch of like powerups to react out of the box so really really something to definitely go ahead and play with it's a different way of thinking um but it is kind of uh once you learn it it's gonna pay off the value will pay off it'll be very valuable to an employer yeah so it's definitely something which i recommend you guys go ahead and look at um it's also going to take you this will definitely take you guys from a midlevel frontend developer to a senior like that you need this to be to be considered like a senior level developer when we're talking about a seniority inside of a company dang that is powerful by the way guys are these captions that we're providing for what sonny's saying or what i am saying are these actually helpful and valuable to you but i mean to me sunny this is actually super helpful because it's almost like we're making a slide on the fly yeah honestly i found it i find it really really helpful even me reading over it it clears everything up so yeah definitely let us know in the comments guys if you guys find that valuable and if you do just simply hit the thumbs up button as well [Laughter] nice that was a clean just smooth one was my favorite because it didn't even make sense but i like it i like it yeah i love it okay so build time what am i looking at here right so this is actually moving on to the next thing which is called uh where if i think if you hit next it will jump up it was basically we were talking about statistics right i'm kidding generators so the text i think comes on the on the click yeah yeah so now we're talking about stack site generated so kazi what is a static site generator so you have you ever used one yeah you know me i'm just using jekyll like before i even knew what coding was i was freaking using jekyll like crazy i don't know anybody use jekyll here drop it in the comments below i think it's awesome we're in a blog post today and i started laughing because hugo right yeah yeah hugo yeah so i know like most of the people yeah i see ali and hendrick they're saying actually it's very helpful logan says very valuable 181 modis modesto says yes awesome so yeah this stuff are you laughing at what just sonny just said yeah frankie is laughing too so this is this is uh this makes your site really really fast the static site generators i think are kind of useful to know static site generators also uh github pages generate static sites right and but there are things like jekyll that you want to know where they can take your dynamic content and turn it into static sites i just find it so funny because when you said jekyll i had no idea what it meant yeah yeah you were so confused you're like what is this yeah guys basically what jekyll's going to do it's going to take all your content it's going to make it into one stack like bundle and then it's just going to serve that bundle whenever anyone requests or goes on to your page which is a lot faster than it sounds like uh typically when you go into a website that javascript that you've coded actually has to load dynamically on the browser but when you've got a static site generator you basically make that bundle once and it just serves it every time so really really handy to actually go ahead and build something and if you're looking for speed stacks site generators are your answer the most popular one is gatsby really really popular right now if you've got any kind of sales page ecommerce site or anything gatsby's a really really powerful thing or landing page or portfolio if you go ahead and build a portfolio and say this is written in gatsby uh it's going to be quite impressive to like show to an employer so i'd recommend that you do that if you have got a portfolio um really really awesome thing to go ahead and guys these are all things that you can just like add to your skill set like if you can say i know react that's great that's really good but if you can then go ahead and say i can do server side rendering my portfolio like i know a portfolio is very simple but if you can say this portfolio is server side rendered or like this portfolio is built on react or on gatsby it kind of just adds that sort of like oh like if i was an employer i would get butterflies in my tummy if you told me your freaking portfolio's on using next js i'd be like holy crap because because the employee is going to know though interview he just did that right crazy okay awesome so what's going on here so we got all the are these these are all the static site frameworks right yeah these are a lot of points and next.js is also a static site hey made it up here nice what's next bro i always hear about this it just sounds so dumb yeah i don't know i've actually i've heard about it but i've never looked into it all i know is gatsby in there i think they're only getting i think they're just getting clout from nextjs traffic that misspells it they down yeah next next by mistake uh next djs is the real one and then next is uh something else yeah this is proper stupid name so what's the difference between gatsby and next.js sonny so gatsby is just a static site generator guys nexjs handles serverside rendering and also gives you the static site generator um advantages so if you're looking at um sort of debating between the two i would recommend nextgs is going to provide you more value so i would go ahead and jump into that so your research app your react dynamic app you'll probably use next.js but maybe if you're hosting a portfolio or something static like that use gatsby yes because gatsby yeah a very good point now yeah gatsby's going to be quite easier to implement over in xjs so i'd recommend going ahead and using gatsby if you've got like a simple landing page or something fast you need up and running and you need it easy to maintain gatsby if you're looking for a long term benefit or you're looking for something to get something out there or you're trying to build your portfolio for a professional environment next yes yep so definitely something worth investing your time in awesome let's go to next uh oh somebody said next is typically next.js but for vue.js oh nice yeah and thank you the greatest ever says gonna be watching this tomorrow because i'm finishing up the spotify clone but wanna thank you guys deeply and dearly for the amazing work the whole team is doing thank you so much really appreciate you i mean yeah we're all working right now so this slide was put together by sunny and also uh alex right now frankie yeah and amanoth from the clever programmer team i came in and help there are a bunch of slides that are coming in from like the previous slides that uh we had all made together frankie is working on responding to every single person making sure everything is going phenomenally well so a lot of the chat is me and also frankie and so yeah guys it's like everything every single one of these every day is like a really big team effort so thank you guys for being here and also just taking the time to appreciate that thank you now thank you guys if you guys are still not sure how to get started or you guys want to figure out how to make money as a developer let me know are you guys interested in learning how to make money as a developer this part we wanted to add in for you guys to show you how you can actually start going out and making money as a frontend developer or whatever type of developer you want to become today so this will be the part with freelancing tips with tips of getting your jobs if you're interested let me know and let's go let's do it so the first avenue guys is what kazi the first avenue is becoming i love this becoming a teacher so you can actually with whatever skills you have learned you can actually teach that to other people and you can make an income from doing that like for example okay this is the craziest example but you guys see we're just teaching you guys we're teachers right sunny and i are teachers sunny and i are not just like going crazy working at a job right now we're actually taking the time out to actually teach you guys and we're even getting donations and we're getting paid to teach literally and so what it looks like at a oneonone basis and is you can actually post your ad on craigslist and you could post your ads on kijiji if you're in canada or you can post your ad on really whatever platform you want and somebody can pay you for you to teach them and you don't have to be so far ahead of them you could just be a little bit ahead of them and charge them for teaching them yeah exactly and guys this is one this is one that i really emphasize in our course a lot with our students because this is the one that you can literally start doing even a week after you start learning how to code like if you're a week ahead of somebody who's never coded before you're now you're now in a position to provide a week's worth of value to somebody who's never coded before so you can actually go ahead and start teaching that right and then only from that day onwards that value only grows right so if you're immediately going to grow your income source and you and the earlier you start the better and it is uncomfortable but like when you just jump in dive into the deep end you're going to go ahead and build that skill and it's always going to be a skill that you can turn to to make some more income yep now this is one way that we'd like to show it to you guys okay so let me go ahead and do that for you guys so let's go ahead here and take a look at this what sunny is saying right so sunny you're saying if i have like literally if you think about levels right let's say you're a complete beginner and you're at level one you just know how to write hello world and then here is level 10 where you use serverside rendering for breakfast so in between all these levels and then let's say you're doing javascript you don't have to you can use any language python or you know go it doesn't matter but let's just use javascript for now and if you are a level one can you teach another level one probably not really right if all you know is hello world you can't really teach much to another person who also knows hello world so if you are over here and actually let's do this right so they're like let's say there's two people here and here yep and um you're like let's say you're on the left hand side and you're teaching this person okay yeah and this is over here i'm just gonna put a little mark and that's gonna say that's you okay now if you're teaching this person you're gonna they're gonna be paying you in return yep and um if you're a level two it's very possible that you can actually be teaching somebody who's a level one yep 100 right because you can you can teach them so like for example what does a level two mean maybe you have put in at level two maybe you've put in like 50 hours into coding yeah okay let's say you know how to write functions loops data types you know that stuff yeah you know what array is you know what you know so for example right now you can charge this person you could charge them maybe like ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars an hour so i'll just put like you know ten dollars at that point you can charge them an hour okay now when you get up to level three and you can teach a level two you're gonna get paid more for that yeah does that make sense so now you might actually make maybe more than ten dollars an hour maybe now you make you now you can make like 18 an hour teaching i just want to stress here guys notice now that your pool of potential students has also grown now you can target level two and level one students yep you can target exactly that's important so you could target both that's huge that's a really good point and then what happens when you're a level four or you're a level five let's say right if you're a level five well what does a level five look like i think a level five is somebody who has put multiple uh you know they've like followed of all of our youtube videos and made all the clones yeah exactly you know they understand like how apis work they understand how uh you know how to put together like their portfolio and they have multiple projects to show for it maybe they don't have real world coding experience where they're getting paid at a job but other than that they're like pretty decent yeah right and that might actually look like what maybe 500 hours of coding or maybe yeah 500 to like 700 hours of coding yeah might actually put you here and now at this level you guys you guys can actually charge a pretty significant amount of income so if you're a level five and you're teaching level fours and stuff like that it's very possible for you guys to make at least in us you know for your own countries you would have to do the rough translation but in us it's very possible for you to charge 35 an hour or even 50 an hour and you have experience with teaching people right sunny i definitely do yeah so even literally and guys there's no age limit when you come to teaching i've taught people who are like much older than me and i've also taught a student who was young as 12 years old who landed his own client which is insane like that's so it really does not matter what age or or what experience you're at you can teach yeah yep and so if you are teaching other people you just have to do the math right so at 35 an hour you know i use teaching to make well over a hundred thousand dollars a year now of course everybody's gonna be at a different level different like how much effort you put into it how much time you put into it but a few of these clients that are paying you either 35 or 50 an hour it the math to getting to 1 000 a month like that's the first type of math you should do so let's figure out sunny how long would it take like what it would take for us with at fifty dollars an hour to get to making thousand dollars a month okay so if i'm making 50 generally when you have students they'll do about two hour long sessions how long are your sessions with your students they're one hour 30 minutes yeah typically i start with one hour because it's quite an intense session and then i'll eventually see and if they can handle a twohour session so let's set two hours yeah i don't push more than two yeah okay because they get fried in that time so let's say you're doing one hour sessions yeah at fifty dollars an hour yeah right uh you're doing one session per week yep okay so one x per week that turns out to be four sessions per month right yep and uh how much is that you guys if you have one student at you know doing four times a month at 50 an hour in one month that is two hundred dollars yeah now what happens if now what do we need to do sunny to get up to with the same exact math to get up to one thousand a month we just need to land five students yep guys that's it so or increase or increase the frequency of a student but landing five students is going to get you that yeah yep so you can go both ways it's important what sunny just said so you guys can either in it's really hard to increase the price at 50. i mean it's hard to go with that sooner to 75 or 100 to double the price would be tough but what might be a lot more doable is maybe sunny can start to have two hour lessons with those students and now that student will pay sunny 400 a month yeah right exactly or sunny can get a total of five students uh for they each do four x a month sessions at 50 an hour and now that's a thousand dollars a month yeah and guys something i want to stress at this point when you get very good at having a lot more students and you can actually get to a point where you can do group sessions so if you find that you're running out of time where you find that you're getting like kind of intense with the timings you can go ahead and run i wouldn't recommend having large groups because you you lose the one to one but you can definitely go ahead and actually go ahead and split like maybe and have a group of three group of four yeah and you can even give them a discount right so for example if you were charging a 50 maybe you charge them 40 per session yeah but now it's a group session so in one hour instead of you making 50 dollars now with three students you make 120 in an hour of your time exactly and it's a good deal for all of them yeah it's actually a better deal than them doing oneonone if they do because they all become a part of the group too and they can all slack each other they can all message each other so that's powerful definitely so i i think that one of the best ways for almost all of you guys including the ones who have a job i think is like guys what would you do if you had extra thousand dollars a month coming in start dropping it in the comments below you know what would the thousand dollars a month allow you to do would it allow you to you know pay your bills wouldn't would you get netflix membership would you get membership to i know gyms are closed but maybe would you get like calisthenics equipment for your home and then do workouts there would you get a course that you've always wanted would you i don't know pay for your parents rent and help out what would a thousand dollars a month allow you to do i think it's important to have those goals because then you will actually want to do more and achieve more other than rather than just like going through life like a zombie yeah and these guys it's really important to determine what your why is like why are you doing this stuff like why are you teaching why are you even here right now trying to learn how to code like remember that because that is going to give you that consistent discipline and motivation to carry on when times get tough yeah so like for example sunny can't sit there through like hundreds or thousands of hours of coding and then like through all the debugging and all the frustration of not making something work where literally he's trying to figure out one goddamn trick with flexbox and it takes them seven hours of like how does this grow shrink thing work or like why you know it's a 0.8 or a 0.9 flex and how does he or somebody like me get through so much coding if our why was weak and we didn't have a good reason we would not get through any of that you know if so it has to be something more important to you than just money exactly a few answers coming in though uh for what people would spend with a thousand so it would allow me to pay my rent uh and also pay my sibling fees and get to meet some of their basic needs awesome mark says i would invest in stuff and develop myself nice and uh ken laps as he uh get a wife [Laughter] nice douglas says i would join profit with javascript awesome hey um so let's go back to what we're talking about here you guys so now this is the math to getting to a thousand a month you guys it's not that freaking hard now to go to 2000 a month what do you need to do and guys here's a better way to look at it this is not a thousand a month this is actually let me write that up top at the top left this is actually five students is 12 000 a year yeah that's the right way to look at it it's actually 5 000 or it's actually 12 000 a year yep and if you guys want to get to 24 000 a year or 2 000 a month 10 students and you guys can see the growth here from 5 to 10 students isn't actually a lot but the growth in your income is significant yes very significant so this is something you guys can do guys so easily like their instagram you can go and instagram people on coding channels and start having conversations with them and say i will help you for free for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on a video call with you and help you you can go into a facebook group and ask people if they need help and give them a free session and then at the end of the free session say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed this if you want me to help you more i'm um you know i charge 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge 35 an hour 50 an hour something like that does that make sense you guys you guys can literally do this today you don't need to wait for anything you don't need to wait for anyone so this is possible for you guys now there are online tons of amazing platforms where you guys can go and start teaching so i will give you more ways of making income but this is actually one really big pillar of having your income come in so we'll talk about some of those platforms right now and then we're going to go ahead and continue with the video but there are important platforms that you guys should know and write down so one is takelessons.com and the other one is wiseand.com so these are really good platforms look in the u.s that are great for finding lessons but if you're not in the u.s look at people per hour look at fiverr.com yeah and um also you guys have facebook and instagram which is worldwide right you can go into groups programming groups and help people there and you can get clients from there very easily okay we have some students try this strategy and they literally have clients the next day and of course i think craigslist is worldwide so use craigslist as well and we'll list out all of these resources for you guys at the end and also guys one worth mentioning is instagram so literally if you just go ahead and document your journey as a developer you'll actually be surprised that how many people reach out and ask for help ask for this and you can actually then convert that to a potential student that you start teaching yep exactly so let's i'm gonna go ahead and now guys this works if you're working extremely hard and you can teach people who are you know literally one level behind you you don't have to be so far ahead of them to teach them remember so you can be a level two teaching a level one you can be a level five teaching everybody underneath it so yep let me go ahead and save this and then go here and i'm gonna remove this now cool so let's move forward here now i'm gonna skip through a little bit of this you guys and we're gonna go you know i even have some math here you can take a look at it but if you if you wanna go on the instagram route or facebook route where you kind of want to do hand to hand combat you can dm 100 people something interesting like not please sorry mommy can you please i beg you we that's like 99 of the messages i get in my dms um so don't do that that'll be bad nobody will respond to you'll get ignored but if you give them a good message that's like positive hey i see you are crushing it at skateboarding absolutely love that and i see that you're also doing coding pump for you that's it don't ask anything don't want anything don't need anything don't beg don't put more than one question mark ever even in our chat if i ever see more than one question mark ever i'd never respond to that person so yeah um be clean be a clean giving caring human being and if you send those messages uh 20 people out of the 100 will respond to you okay five will get on you can get on a call with five of those people if you close one person that's just from one client you're gonna make 320 a month now you can do this strategy whether you want to freelance and actually code for people and build websites or build apps for them and this will work for you even if you want to do it for coaching okay this works for both now one student or one client can be worth up to three to four thousand a year if not more just one all right so that is a pretty important and helpful thing for you guys to know now if you want to go from 3 000 a month and you're like hey how do i actually take that from 3 000 um and go you know that 3 000 a month guys is actually 36 000 a year so yeah this is that's always important to kind of remember that and um i'm going to kind of move past some of these and here's the resources you guys can use so you guys can use facebook groups and sonny you want to talk about some of these resources as well yeah yeah so we have facebook groups we talked about instagram why's that and take lessons uh because you showed that they proved if you're in the u.s they work really good people per hour craigslist is something which you'd be surprised actually works upwork fiverr linkedin is actually surprisingly good guys yes um so a lot of people do reach out and and go on and linkedin is something where it's like a growth thing like you build up that network and you'll be surprised at what like if somebody would just share your name and say i know a guy who can code and before you know it you have a lot of my sort of jobs have actually been through word of mouth surprisingly um so yeah definitely go ahead and check out linkedin yep go check those out now guys one thing i just want to say is just like a direct message to you you are watching this right now yes literally you i'm looking at you 99 of you are gonna do nothing with this information okay you're gonna do absolutely nothing and i love you but it's also the truth it's just a hard truth it sucks i'm gonna even say it's less than one percent of the people that are gonna actually take action on it but my goal is that just that just that one percent person just one person to take action out of the 20 000 that watch this or 50 000 that watch this that's the only person i care about the only person i care about here is like modesto who five years later messaged in the youtube and he said hey i got a job as a q engineer because of our sessions that we would do so to that one person who's actually going to do something on it here's what i want to tell you please take action on this and what i want from you is literally next oh you to get an instagram message that says you landed a job that says you landed a client and you just sharing that with us whether it's on our live streams on youtube that we're doing every day or whether it's an instagram dm to me or sunny right our instagram handles are right there and so that's what we're looking for that one person to take action on this information go hey i actually landed a client i actually nothing is stopping you from literally reaching out to 500 people today i mean what are you doing anyway it's covered you can't go out so you're bored spend that time and reach out to 300 people or 500 people and send them something useful and helpful and then say i'm willing to jump on free calls free calls and give you help in coding and teach you coding i promise you're going to get one client at the very minimum just this week and then what we want to know is you saying hey i got that client i don't care even if they're paying you two dollars an hour but that's what we want to know so that's the one person i'm saying this message for exactly guys you heard him like literally that one person out there like it's just the truth guys like a lot of people were watching but this is cool but like who's going to actually take action and go ahead and do the things that they need to do to go and change their life because you just need to take action yeah all right don't think about it don't don't like overthink it just start doing it right now right today literally straight off to this live stream go ahead and do it yep alexandra says i earned 8 500 from just one student from 12t in the previous academic year nice that's amazing so he if he had 10 of those students he would be making 85 thousand dollars a year just from exactly execution guys i advise everyone to execute so do that ashkan and he says i myself don't do that we're gonna tell you to do it henrik says i will be that 0.1 percent if there's one person we're making this video for is that person who takes action on it so if that's gonna be you henrik i will personally talk to you and i will personally get on a call with you like that brings me the most joy that we're sharing something that you guys take action on and then if you do this and you land a client or a job or whatever i would want to bring you on the skype call with sunny and i or sonny and i would just even want to just call you and talk to you about the results 100 we wouldn't even hesitate literally if you take action on it and you get some results like 100 will jump on a call with you yep um so awesome love you guys so now let's move on to mark says i am already on linkedin and upwork but i still see myself as a beginner but i'm hungry guys don't say no for the other person this is one thing i learned from garyvee which is beautiful apply to the job that you're thinking about you know actually like send out the messages on take lessons wisen or whatever platforms to get clients you know uh if you're a beginner maybe you can still provide some value you know at the very worst case you can give refund or you can give the money back guarantee right but don't say no for the other person go all the way now with that said let's continue on here so boom got tons of things so working from home now you guys can use tons of online platforms if you want to do freelancing the reason why we mentioned teaching is i think it's the easiest thing to get into it's also a thing you can scale up forever like we're teaching you right now exactly so talk to me about this sonny yeah so we spoke about number one which was teaching and that's definitely something you guys can do right now but when you obviously in teaching i just want to add to one thing guys like when you teach it makes you such a better developer like i can't stress that enough every single live stream that we teach every single time i teach a student i become a better developer because you're teaching that principle you're teaching the ability to code so you get actually naturally just become a better developer so you'll naturally grow to a position where you can offer value to clients you can offer value and that's where freelancing comes in as number two so three really good sites here to land freelancing clients we've got upwork freelancer.com and top tool right yeah the one sort of recommend here as being the most successful is upwork because freelancer.com you can get into sort of some battles with sort of a trying to bid for things but again if you build up quite a handsome sort of portfolio on freelancer.com i've seen people do really really well on that and guys a really nice benefit to freelancing is also it's remote so most of you um who are watching from different parts of the world right now you guys can tap into different markets you can tap into the united states you can tap into london you can tap into any market you want provided you just build that skill you build that skill the ability to freelance is is in literature and guys this is one thing i want to stress here you can scale to very very high numbers when you're just freelancing big numbers uh we had uh we have a student in our program profitable shortcut last month he called me he closed he did 28 000 in cash from freelancing he did and then within the first 10 days of um i think yeah within the first 10 days of the next month after that this guy did uh 12 000 already so that's insane crushing it and freelancing and doing scraping web scraping and automation and all kinds of things but he's just hustling and grinding and getting it done there's tons of opportunity out there but people just you know they just don't take advantage of it um awesome so by the way i want to say guys we just broke 20 000 views on this video total over 20 000 times it's been viewed so thank you guys so much for the love and i do want to say a lot of it is because of you watching this and you hitting that like button because it helped it did help send it out to more and more people and if you're watching this and you still haven't done that go ahead and just hit that like button because guys we want to make as many developers on the planet as possible that's our mission exactly and uh that's awesome so now you know boom with that said you know the third step that you guys would want to do is so you know the second thing we talked about is freelancing the third is getting a permanent job that's a lot of what people want to do but people go about it i feel like kind of in a backwards way where the first thing that they're looking for is a permanent job and that's really hard to get you guys when you're just starting out as a developer and that's why most people i know quit most people i know quit within one year almost every single person very few people stay after that one year mark and end up getting a job so i think that's a very discouraging route to go i think it's not the smartest or even the fastest route to go i think the fastest route to grow skill wise is to first teach it's going to grow your own skills the most you're going to be getting paid while you're learning yourself and then i think step two you should try to get so i think with uh you should start teaching in your first three months of coding okay you should start teaching within that time frame then around your sixth or ninth month you should actually start doing freelancing and then after a year or year and a half of experience i think you should go for a full job uh definitely curious to hear your thoughts on this too sonny yeah i would definitely say guys and i just want to kind of rule out a myth here so the way that you typically see this is like as you said it's very backwards right like what i usually see is people will go to university and then they would like study for three four years never had made a single penny when it comes to like their coding abilities and then they would go straight to step three which is a permanent job and you see like it just doesn't make sense like it doesn't make any sense like literally you could watch your youtube videos and you could sit there teach yourself how to code through like youtube videos through us guys through um through w3 schools or a bunch of online resources start teaching like through the methods we spoke about before start earning an income and then you build up that skill set from teaching you build up the ability to build up an income and you can grow that income at a rate that's very comfortable for you you then become a better programmer you can learn freelance clients and then all of that experience becomes extremely attractive to a an employer and that's not a secret to it that's a secret to having years of experience before ever having a job exactly you know that like it's almost like a circular thing that everybody always talks about you know it's like you must have two years of experience and it's an entrylevel job and you're like yeah exactly and the truth is guys if you go to an employer and they said five years experience and you only had one year but your one year consisted of you teaching a bunch of students killing it with freelancing jobs i'm telling you they would forget about that five years of experience and they would consider taking you on board yeah like it really does it just comes down to what you can offer them in terms of value so honestly focus on what you can like provide in terms of value and that skill that you can offer as opposed to going the traditional route of like university and then straight to the permanent position it just doesn't work that way in real life cold wakeman says i don't like teaching can i just do step two straight away yeah i mean it's gonna as long as you can develop the skill of coding and keep getting good yeah you can do step two of uh freelancing pretty much right away so here's how i break it down you guys so we call this the modern javascript developer pyramid of wealth and i we feel like this is how you can kind of stack all this on top of each other so one it's learn the coding skills to become a modern javascript developer so that's just coding skills learn that step two is you can start coaching people now this is a you can be a beginner and coach other people and the time to build the stream of income is one to three months all right yep and you can get this stream of income up to three thousand dollars a month if not more this is more on the conservative side and uh next up you can actually work freelance so this is you can work for clients independently and you can get this up to now you can get with just freelancing alone you can realistically be making 5k a month right sunny yeah 100 and guys again like as you said this is conservative so you can actually raise those numbers up divided on how hard you're working and you can build a stream of income within for your first four to 12 months of learning to code okay first four to 12 months just put in a lot of hours into coding okay a lot of people are like hey how did i start uh getting clients in three months of experience i just coded like 15 to 20 hours a day yeah and then guys just to just add on there guys it stacks up so while you have the freelancing you can carry on the coaching so it can stack up yeah yep i love that quan quang says you guys are so good in the community's standard is so high i haven't even seen one negative comment so far amazing i love that yep so this is the power of culture you guys you keep and appreciate the people you love you over nurture and love them and then anybody who's toxic you cut them so you don't have a long conversation with them you don't have a long back and forth you don't try to change their minds you just uh you just not communicate with them and you you they're not part of the culture anymore so that's how you can keep the culture at the highest standard possible at all times this is also true when it comes to your circle of friends you might be outgrowing because you're here i mean you here learning about frontend developer guide i can promise you a lot of your friends are probably not doing this right now a lot of the people around you are not doing this and they're not growth oriented so you also have to start thinking about who are the people that are not anymore a good fit for your circle so you have to actually one part of self growth is to be really loving and over nurturing and be really accepting the second part of self growth is having selfrespect and boundaries so those people aren't going to grow with you and aren't going to respect you then you have to move on and get a new set of friends right and then those set of friends they have to go yeah exactly and i i couldn't agree more in terms of like that negativity guys it's it's like a toxic sort of trait and it does spread like it's might start off with a small comment here and there but that will literally can destroy your work ethic if you stay around it long enough whereas if you surround yourself with hardworking people who are literally driven every single day i'm telling you you will literally just you start to mask their behavior you start to master their their sort of traits and then naturally you follow the same footsteps so really really is important to surround yourself with the white people yep super important and the last thing i want to mention is you guys the step four is to go get a job and work as a fulltime developer now required skill level for this is advanced okay which is why we think you should try to do this last and then time to build the stream of income is 12 to 24 months all right so this is gonna take 12 to 24 months and again it all stacks so you could be coaching and making 3k a month on top of that you could be freelancing and making 5k a month so now you're at 8k a month and then on top of that i mean this is probably going to get really hard or almost impossible you're you can have no time and no freedom to do anything but you could also be doing a job that's paying you like 7k a month so it's possible that you could have a potential of 15k a month or more income okay uh it depends on your hard work depends on what you do i'm just showing you guys this to see what's possible i'm not saying any of you will actually achieve this okay can i just add here guys that literally when i started working with qazi i had a fulltime job i was freelancing on the side and i was coaching so oh living yeah like i did all of those things now like kazi said is it something you can really hold on to like with all of them stacked on top of each other it really depends on how you manage your time but then i chose to sort of drop the freelancing and work like full time with kazi and like and and to carry on with coaching so it's really a case of like it's very flexible but you can actually do all three like you can do all three if you need to and you're in a position it's all down to how hard you're willing to work and the effort that you're willing to put in yep it really comes down to you um yep so this is awesome harish says you guys are awesome you guys boost the confidence in all of us all right so there you guys go if you guys want to take a picture of this go ahead and do so now i'll be moving this uh in five four three two one so let's go on to the next one so now guys if you want to be able to take all of these skills that we taught you right being uh if you want to be able to like learn if you want to be able to coach if you want to do freelancing and job and you want to stack these skills and these streams of income in this exact order that's exactly what we teach you how to do in our course profit with javascript all right yeah and in this course you know we have tons of students and they just have really really great experiences and daniel over here says in the future i'll continue to learn more and teach students we have muhammad he says i hope this community will be part of my future projects johnny bridge going i have zero coding experience i'm proud of creating my google maps app kate says thank you so much for this challenge and in the future i want to be a full stack developer and start freelancing so these are all the people that are part of our community and um let me talk just a little bit more is it okay if i talk a little bit more about profit with javascript you guys because of course we've just invested so much time and energy into building it out and making it the best possible resource on the planet for most developers so i would really appreciate it if sonny and i could speak on it for probably like a few minutes yeah definitely yeah so let me go over here and open this up boom while kazi does that guys i think it's worth uh actually telling you guys so i know we showed a few of those customer experiences there but we actually just hit over i think it's over 1500 students in the community right oh yeah yeah yeah so that is absolutely insane and i think i will show that in just a second to everybody so guys in our profit with javascript course uh this is our program profit with javascript and we have the url up here so you can go to it directly or you can click the link in the description below and that will take you to this page right away but this course profit with javascript we cover all of these things we talked about so you learning the skills of becoming a developer you learning how to become a you know so it has the 15 javascript training modules that will give you all the training that you actually need right underneath that if you look you have weekly javascript and react training calls and son you want to speak to the weekly training calls live yeah so guys like this is where we really like differentiate from like a udemy course or anything else that's kind of out there right now because in these coaching calls and in these live training course it's a really a chance for you to be able to actually communicate and run through your problems with us that you're experiencing we run through different very cutting edge projects every single week so literally it's a case of you're not on like a live stream you're on a zoom call so you're literally on a video call with me with nars with jacob with a few people in the community and guys like what i mean it's one to one feedback here like there's people asking questions you can interrupt me at any time we got we literally take things to a whole new level in these coaching calls and our students love it they literally thrive off of it afterwards there's an amazing slack community where they literally send me messages of the sort of homework that we sat that we go through together um we have an amazing pool of success coaches and cars what is a success coach success coaches are going to be people when you join the program you're going to be paired up with a success coach and what they will do is every single project that you actually submit or every homework assignment that you complete or every app that you build they're going to give you personalized video feedback on all of your assignments so imagine getting video feedback by somebody who's a lot more seasoned than you and as a skilled developer or sometimes they're even professionals and they give you feedback on your code they give you feedback on your app design and we get very technical with that so those are success coaches and they make sure that you're getting all of the work done exactly and guys a lot of people actually say when you combine the weekly coaching calls with the personalized video feedback the modules that you get and then on top of that all of the skills that we then go and like we teach you that and then we teach you actually how how to go and take those skills and start making money straight away with that our students are pretty much called this like a 10 it's worth it pretty much the equivalent of a 10k coding boot camp yeah my opinion go ahead in my opinion i honestly i've been to university i've done a master's degree and this is what i would have like if i knew something like this existed i just don't think i actually tell students now don't bother going to university just join like a course or community and change your life through this where you save yourself a lot of money and literally will transform your life and take you to that whole nother level of becoming a developer yeah this seriously will is a game changer you know and so that's why jose shapiro he told me he's like dude this is actually more valuable than my sixmonth coding bootcamp and he goes i paid ten thousand dollars for that one so yeah amazing you know so a lot of students are getting amazing results like you guys should go and check this out and uh i want to highlight the community real quick for you guys so you guys can see the caliber of people in the community that's actually part of profit with javascript well it actually full screen hold on so i'm gonna open up my app so this is actually a good app that you guys should know about it's called spectacle and it's really good for um man my computer is just freezing yeah i use spectacular it's really handy tool guys when you want to snap things to the left side of the screen right side screen go full screen really really cool um especially when you're sort of trying to be productive yeah yeah super valuable so i'm gonna click this and hopefully my computer doesn't freeze but the guys the community is absolutely insane in this program and we have over 13 we have now 1 400 members just in our slack community and this is not we're not even talking about the 1500 uh students that are just part of the course so that community is really what makes most students who come to the program stay they love the training they love all the material that's there they love all the projects but the fact that any question you have can can and will be answered in less than five minutes is massive for people and it will be answered by somebody who deeply cares by somebody who would even be sometimes willing to jump on oneonone calls with you so the heart that is really important and um the weekly calls you guys will have i mean of course you guys are building real world projects so i think if you are serious about becoming a developer and you want to get a job then i would highly recommend you check out this course and you know consider joining and being a part of this community and being one of us you know and we would get to actually meet you and speak with you on a regular basis yeah i think guys like to put this into context like how many times have you gone into stack overflow or like a website like a forum and sort of like been scared to ask a question or felt like you're stupid if you ask a question right in this community like we don't there's there's no such thing as a bad question like if you can directly once you're in literally message me jump on a call with me and and i always jump on calls with students we pretty much go through like any problem whether it be big small anything you pretty much can get an answer to um so it's definitely something which i recommend and we answer a ton of questions in those weekly coaching calls and it's all driven by you guys so in terms of the weekly coaching calls i see loads of questions about like uh functional class space and i see a bunch of other questions like guys whatever everyone wants to learn we go ahead and we answer every single thing inside those coaching calls um so there's a lot of value that is delivered in those and if you're interested link is in the description make sure you go and check it out yeah seriously check that out and with that said guys hopefully you guys got a ton of value i mean we just packed it with value the front end developer guide 2020 to 2021 uses as your bible for success uses your bible for a career as a frontend developer or honestly a lot of what we said works as a full stack developer as well so you know the recap of like learning about firebase and react and javascript and visual studio code and you know uh what best framework to use for testing like cypress io what are the pre processors that you should use you know for css and we talked about server side rendering and how the difference between a midlevel you know developer versus a senior level is knowing things like next js and using those types of things we talked about static side generators like gatsby or jekyll or hugo and all of that and we said hey use gatsby learn it so there's so much value that was packed in this and we just threw it all at you guys just make sure to keep going back to this to keep taking notes and really just following along i think personally i think honestly the most valuable part if i was watching this video is the part that shows you practically how to turn this into cash for yourself so yeah really pay attention to that and take action on it that's the one part that most people don't take action on so i just want to emphasize that yeah really really massive there guys in terms of because what you'll see here typically on websites and then just throughout the internet is like you'll find all of these skills how to do it and then you just don't know how to take that to that next level and that really does become a question and it kind of puts you in this horrible place it's very disheartening makes you kind of want to give up on programming so we really hope that we helped you out today and just in how to take that to that point of where you can actually start making income and you can actually enjoy the process a lot more because when you start earning from this you really do start to love it that extra bit and it starts to become that it starts to drive your life and change your life yep so that's
