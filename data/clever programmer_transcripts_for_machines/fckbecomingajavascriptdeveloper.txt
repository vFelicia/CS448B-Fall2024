you're too focused on results that's one of the biggest problems I see happen with people who are learning to code you're constantly looking for that job you're constantly hoping and dreaming when will you land that job and when will this misery of coding learning JavaScript learning react will be over this is a sure guaranteed way to make your life miserable your journey feel about 10 to 15 times as long and for you to not feel essentially any ounce of happiness avoid this it's a trap it's a pitfall a lot of people fall for this Andrew huberman he's a PhD a scientist and he researches at Harvard University I believe and he researches dopamine and how that works and functions inside of our brain one of the things he talks about is when you become too focused on the outcome rather than the thing that you're actually focused on so let's say you're constantly focusing on the reward that you're gonna get from coding which is you're going to get a job one day if that's all your primary focus it's crazy but dopamine actually controls your perception of time so what that means is when you're constantly focusing on the reward it extends out your time your perception of time actually becomes incredibly long because you're constantly thinking about when this thing will end and you get your dopamine hit and that excitement that you want to experience at the end not during the process you feel the excitement the happiness The Joy the dopamine hit once it's done so for example if you had a three month long coding Journey or a six month long or a nine month long coding journey to get your first job you would experience your first dopamine hit at the ninth month Mark when you would get your job now compare that to somebody else say you're up against somebody like me whoever it is coding loving it feels like it's a video game feels like it's illegal that clients should be paying him the day that he gets a job I'm having the time of my life and I'm getting dopamine after dopamine hit every single line of code that I write every time I'm thinking about an idea every time I'm trying to express a thought and bring it to life and I'm constantly getting those dopamine hits I'm constantly excited I'm constantly happy when I get my first job in nine months to me it feels like time hasn't even passed it feels like time flew by for you it feels like an eternity has taken place so that's a very simple concept that it should explain to you that dopamine actually controls our perception of time now imagine you're doing something you really enjoy something you really really enjoy what happens to the time you look at the clock man five hours have just flown by you look at the clock again eight hours have flown by what is going on time's flying it can't stop think about something you really hate you're at the DMV getting your license registration or if you're International and somewhere else in the world you know whatever your equivalent is to driver's license or some kind of government thing where you're waiting for hours and hours and hours imagine like a flight you're waiting for the flight you know you waited a long time you know that it took a long time why because you're not getting any dopamine hits throughout the process and so the perception of your time is actually incredibly long uh this reminds me of story which was I went to my religious school for four years from the age of nine to about 12 years old and every single day I would get there you know I I'm a little kid right now I'm nine years old really scrawny tiny in Chicago brutal winner sir you come inside the school the religious school it was called the madrasa and um I would come there and I'm freezing right the teacher comes up to me he goes did you memorize the homework and you know I memorized about like maybe one page but not the two pages that I was assigned he goes okay lift up your uh pants so like basically uh reveal your pants all the way up to your shin so like pull it pull up your pants up to your knees or whatever right so your shins are visible so make sure the Shins are visible and then he would go to the bathroom take out a plunger take the red uh head of the plunger off you know the plunger using the toilet he would take that off I'm gonna be this you'd be left with this thick wooden stick and he would just take that and whack it and smash it against your shins and he would just hit you over and over again it would uh my my shins would get so bruised up and I would feel like my my shins are going to break I know and it and a wooden stick hurts especially harder when you've just come from cold so when your hands are actually very very cold from like negative 10 degrees or negative five degrees you know the Chicago winter feels like negative 20 negative 30. when you get hit it hurts like crazy it has a real real sting to it a very crazy sting to it and it'll burn you it'll stay there for a while and that would happen and that was just like just when I got in maybe at seven or eight a.m to enter the religious school and I'm hurting and I'm like my body's destroyed then throughout the day you'd be punished over and over and over again lots of crazy punishments okay become a chicken uh go down bring your hands through your legs hold on to your ears and then you know recite and read um extremely loudly to the max of your volume so you would be reading and reciting so loudly for hours on end that your veins would be like popping you know out of your out of your neck and I would be doing that and I'd be in so much pain and Agony and I would have felt like maybe 30 hours have gone by like 20 hours have gone by and I would look at the time look at the clock and it'd be one or two pm and I'd be like [ __ ] I have a whole more day to go of this and this and that day would go on and that day would last until and you know there are a lot of other crazy things that you know um I don't feel totally comfortable sharing but like everybody even in that school was crazy you know even the adult kids would like beat you up bully you everybody's bullying each other and you know so it was crazy but the time would go so slowly and we would be there until 8 00 p.m 9 00 p.m at a time so get there at 8 A.M sometimes be there 8 P.M 9 P.M long incredibly long days and I remember every time I would be leaving there I'd just be sitting there thinking man like is this ever gonna end is this what my life is going to be like for the rest of my life and I just remember always thinking this feels like I'm in hell and this feels like I'm in prison and it feels like it's never gonna end at the end of the day I would I would be laughing at my friends and I would be talking I'm like dude this feels like prison like this is never gonna end bro like this [ __ ] is wild and it was when that was just one day right then you'd go again four more days of that week and then every week again and again and again and again and again for month weeks and months and months months months months and to turn into years three four years how those four years felt like it felt like it was about 12 15 years and I always jokingly say this but I I kind of mean it that it felt like I did time I did prison time for four years it felt miserable but what I learned really well from that I mean I gotta I I don't want you guys to think of it like as some I'm trying to tell you like a victim story feels sad for me I actually developed a lot of resilience in my life every day I wake up and I don't get the [ __ ] beaten out of me is an amazing day for me whereas somebody else wakes up and they've crushed it and they wake up sad I feel sad for them my selfesteem because of that you know not that it it has gotten lower but I just feel like I don't deserve anything and every day like I'm supposed to be that kid who gets beat up and if I just don't get beat up I'm happy as [ __ ] turn into my strength but the reason I'm sharing this with you is dopamine is a very powerful receptor and and controller of time it controls your perception of time so if you have gone through that experience you know or something similar I know you guys have had you're probably really tough upbringings too and everybody goes through problems in their own way in their own childhood with your parents and you know um maybe you had something what I think is even worse like your parents putting a lot of pressure on you my parents kind of put pressure on me but not really that much plus I was a black sheep and never really cared and just did my own thing but I know a ton of people and I know I have a big Indian audience and a lot of you guys your parents are crazy your parents are like really strict right I'm Pakistani and my parents were super strict so that is so that could that that can be psychologically very demanding and very excruciating and it teaches you to live life in a way where Everything feels like an obligation you don't necessarily know how to do things for fun you're almost like this prisoner with suffering from PTSD and going through life like you can barely smile you just do things because you're meant to do them because somebody told you to do them you're just trying to achieve something so you can prove something to somebody and it creates a really [ __ ] up warped reality why this is important and why I'm talking less about coding right now and this is because I'm realizing these are the real problems people are suffering from these are the real issues that are actually stopping you from learning becoming better as a software developer coding because you have all this baggage that you actually bring but back to my point of dopamine if you don't learn how to enjoy the process things are going to feel like an eternity for you how how my religious schools fell for me felt for me felt like an eternity for you trying to get a coding job will feel like an excruciating pain how my religious school felt like prison time it will feel like prison time to you so a few amazing things that I picked up from the religious schools one I became incredibly resilient in my life two I made a decision if I don't enjoy something I mean there's discipline in everything so there's there's that too but like if I'm not enjoying the thing that I'm gonna do in life I just have no tolerance for it if I don't believe in it and if I don't enjoy it I don't know why I'm doing it I have zero tolerance for that thing I think for you it's important to know why you're doing something understand why you're doing something because you can like I'll be specific in my religious school I was supposed to memorize Quran okay so think about this I'm memorizing in a language I don't actually understand they never taught me the language so imagine memorizing something for four years without knowing what it means now I'm not saying all religion is like this there are places where they'll teach it to you in a beautiful way where you'll learn the meaning behind it and everything that was in our school we just memorized it now think about how nonsensical that is because there's hard drives there are there are like you know Google cloud and Dropbox and everything on the planet that could store materials you don't actually need to physically with your head memorize stuff and keep it right because idea is if everybody forgets well then the people who have had have it in their head will remember but like now you have machines now you have computers you could store it there the more important thing would have been to teach me the language Arabic to actually make me understand what this book says I have no idea what the book says the reason why I'm going so far into my own personal life is I want to draw out these analogies for you because a lot of you are spending time coding but not going deep into it you have no idea what you're even doing you're just going through tutorials and you have no understanding of what it is that you're actually doing because you don't enjoy it because every time you're doing it it's almost like you're in pain until you get that job if you're in pain guess what's going to happen you're not going to take the extra time to learn what that thing means you're just going to take the time to be done with your pain that twohour session is going to feel like brutal amounts of work my message to you is find the joy and the process of learning to become a software developer learning to code please find the joy enjoy that process because it's beautiful man like coding is amazing you're getting to speak to this powerful Genie you can tell it what to do and it'll do it you just have to learn to speak its language you can take all the thoughts that you have in your head bring them to life I mean it's just so cool it feels like you're playing a video game it's very creative and there are people that are going to pay you for that I mean that's nuts to me that thought is kind of ridiculous or you might realize it's just not for you at which point I congratulate you because in life there are two things that are extremely important what to do and I think the thing that's even more important than that is what not to do there are only two things what to do what not to do what not to do I would argue is even more important for example I learned in my life I hated Information Technology I.T stuff subnet masking computer networking I hated that stuff it was garbage for me garbage hated it I decided what not to do put it on my not todo list help me out tremendously in life I also learned that if I put my hand on something incredibly hot it'll burn the [ __ ] out of me my hand burned at some point when I was actually young that was a terrible experience and I learned wait let me put touching a fire in my not todo list let me also put falling off of really high heights in my not todo list so my not to do list actually gets me to survive every single day and move forward in the you know hey don't eat this food it'll make you fat and disease written hey don't do these activities like drinking at night because you're actually just poisoning yourself that's all that alcohol does you're actually because you can't develop social skills and you lack social skills you're just drowning yourself in this liquid that poisons your liver every day because that's your coping mechanism hey you don't need to drink coffee the only reason you're drinking coffee is because you're masking the fact you're not sleeping properly and that your nutrition is messed up that's why actually feeling tired so coffee is in my not todo list alcohol is in my not todo list Touching Fire is in my not todo list it's very important when I felt abuse and I felt the pain of people who were narcissistic and who would physically beat you and emotionally and mentally beat you I put narcissistic behavior in my not todo list so now my relationships in life are better so not to do is actually very important so if you decide that computer programming is in your not to do list I congratulate you I salute you you've actually made tremendous amount of progress and that opens you up to whole world of discovering other things because there's so much to life besides just coding so your not todo list is incredibly important become friends with it don't fight it okay bring discipline and work ethic to things that are really valuable and meaningful don't bring discipline and work ethic to things that don't make sense like me just memorizing a book without understanding any of its meaning bring meaning to things that are supposed to have meaning okay bring discipline to the things that deserve you having that deserve you bringing discipline into them okay that's my message to you do that for your own life I hope that you enjoy coding and I hope that you fall in love with it but if you don't then also understand that it might just not be a thing for you okay so don't just force yourself to do it but if you're gonna do it and you've committed to doing it then find joy in it find the process fun like even when I'm doing my multi training it's brutal brutal training and most of the times when I'm doing it I apologize I have a meeting in one minute so I'll wrap up this video but if you're in if even in Muay Thai when the workout is brutal I keep telling myself I'm enjoying it and Andrew huberman you guys should listen to his podcast on dopamine and how it controls your motivation is incredible he talks about if you you and you you can control it if you keep telling yourself that you're actually enjoying it you chose to be there for Muay Thai I chose to be there I'm choosing to go through this pain you start enjoying it so now I'm actually start looking forward to Muay Thai now I'm looking forward to lifting and the only reward I give myself is a reward of the pain and the suffering that I actually experience I'm not going to give myself the reward once I get a six pack once I become a fighter and knock somebody out I'm gonna give myself the reward during the hard works for coding reward yourself mentally tell yourself I'm enjoying the process of coding I love how difficult it is if it was easy everyone would be doing it I only do hard things I am blessed that I did get to do something so difficult that most people want to quit and can't keep up I enjoy this this is beautiful when my head hurts trying to solve a problem that's actually a brilliant thing because I know people are falling off right now people are quitting but I'm going I enjoyed this process the more my brain is going to hurt that's how my brain hurting that's the feeling of my brain growing as a feeling of my brain growing associate the pain and the suffering that comes with coding and thinking deeply for so long with growth you're becoming smarter you're able to perceive more you're able to intellectually understand more Your Capacity to think is greater you're a much better more thoughtful more intelligent more capable more competent human being than you were a few hours before you were doing that look at it as a mental exercise that you can enjoy once you can do that over a prolonged period of time the results will come but the results shouldn't even be why you do it I love you
