okay pause no yo what's up guys i recently did a reaction video and you guys really seem to enjoy it so this is real developer reacting to tv shows about coding or development is there a bunch of [ __ ] in there we're going to find out together so let's just roll right into our first clip we have a tv show called scorpion where a genius forms a group of super geniuses where they defend against threats to the modern world so let's go and check that show out okay pause no no developer has ever done this nor will they but i'm hooked so let's [ __ ] see what this developer is up to no you know no no this is not [ __ ] happening right now this is not happening no developer has ever done this no developer will ever do this they're not involved in car chases bank i mean you can have developers in bank robberies i'm sure this is not happening where somebody's on a [ __ ] plane you're pulling a [ __ ] their g string or whatever this freaking string thing is and you're connecting it to your computer and writing code i mean i don't know what's going on it's really over the top sometimes i really like [ __ ] that's over the top i'm not gonna completely pass up on it this is not a day in the life of your average developer at least let's just say that let's go so i see a lamborghini i see a samsung laptop and i see a plane going off she was getting up to like not disconnect i don't really understand what she's trying to hack if she had an apple computer he could have just airdropped it to her so i think apple should have [ __ ] sponsored this video instead of samsung and this would have been a much better scene i like how the dude is just so chill like look at the dude's face driving he's just [ __ ] like just straight up chill developers definitely are not doing that on the regular though we want to feel like we are i think in our heads we feel like we're doing stuff that's like very high intensity but it's not you know a lot of developers don't like pressure most developers are very introverted don't like to like have confrontations don't like to have a lot of pressure and don't often perform well under pressure which is why in most coding interviews most developers just like crack right because most coding interviews will have them write up an algorithm or a solution live it's a nerve wracking experience for them you know they try to avoid that most of their jobs and most of the times you're doing a very calm relaxing job very rarely you're driving around in a lamborghini trying to coat something that a security guard is like passing you from the edge of the airplane but you know if you're into that type of thing that could be a lot of fun this scene was really entertaining to watch how realistic is it to a developer scenario zero out of ten now this clip that we're gonna see it's from a show called it crowd this is a british show where there's a bunch of i.t people in in the office and they work together and it is a comedy show you know i mean for for example moss you could take me through what you're doing right now i'd be delighted oh wait hold on pause okay so random but i see this one gif all the time anytime i go to jiffy and i see the meme and there's like a dude with the laptop and like flames coming out of it i think it's this dude i actually think it's this dude i could be wrong but like holy [ __ ] i feel like my life just found meaning i was so confused every time i would see it seems like what is this so that's really cool so it's from it crowd okay let's keep going i'm just working on a very simple piece of programming code i see oh god no i'm lying again i didn't understand any of that i don't know anything about computers i mean i'm absolutely useless to you i might as well pack up and go her what just happened i didn't get it oh [Laughter] okay so my real reaction is that that part you know the show could be really good i mean i didn't really it was weird it didn't really mean anything to me but what it seems like if i had to like really reach and decipher it is when somebody hears you talk about coding it's very confusing for them so i can attest to that a little bit when i'm explaining it to my girlfriend whoever they do seem a little bit confused by it so that part i understand but based on that clip i'm gonna give that show a three out of ten even though that probably doesn't do that show justice okay so i'm sorry for those of you who are gonna be upset in the comments i know i should really watch that show and i'm sure it's gonna be great but i'm just basing it off of what i saw next up we have chuck and this is about a computer geek that downloads government secrets straight into this [ __ ] dome so let's go ahead and check it out okay wow wow i mean i don't know what the hell this was we just watched like like this is not fast in the future this is like a fast and furious version of developers i mean i would love to meet where these developers are maybe i just have never ran into them but like these guys are opening up like hundreds of terminals and i don't know how their terminal and their command lines are already like running so like what are they opening they have some code on the left hand side which looks like it's creating a file and then it just basically closes that file so it's like [ __ ] code and like literally all the code does is it just opens a file and just closes the file that's really it this guy is doing something really similar i think i don't really see much happening there and then he just has a screen that's like generating keys which again i don't know why they're generating so many keys all at the same time and opening up so many screens most of the times as a developer you're not necessarily opening up so many screens so fast but again if there was a dude with a gun in his hand i might be opening up a lot more screens on them in that same amount of time and your screens most of the times when you open these command lines they don't make that weird sound like that weird sound number sound no developer's computer makes those sounds if you are a developer that does that drop it in the comments below i'd love to check out your setup but so far i have not met anybody like that fun scene to watch in terms of it mapping to reality with a potential boss with a gun in his hand with a bunch of people cooling and hollering around you as you code under time pressure otherwise you're gonna get shot doesn't really map that much to reality so i'm gonna give that 3 out of 10 on the developer scale but it was cool that this showed at least some type of code so actually let's move it up to a 5 on the developer scale this clip is actually from a tv show called csi cyber where there's a dude who's helping the fbi find out about malicious activity let's just play it and see what happens html injection check it out someone hacked a curtain ad on the scroll md site looks like a normal ad right this is the code for the ad peekaboo there's actually two codes written right on top of each other all right so in coding and in development you never have like these 3d screens that just pop out of no [ __ ] where and then you have like code in front of it and code behind it that never happens you're actually on really boring command lines or vs code or you know sublime text or whatever is the text editor of your choice that's usually what you're using and that's usually what you would show something on not necessarily a 3d thing pops up and stuff happens now the part where he's talking about html injection those are very real things and there's a lot of danger to those types of injections so what's happening here is there is an ad when you click that ad you think you're going to buy shoes but a hacker when you click that ad there's code behind it where you click and it takes you to a completely different website that might not be shoe related or it might look like that shoe website but it really is just trying to steal your information and it's not taking you to like nike.com it might be taking you to nikes.com and you just don't realize it now you put in your credit card you buy the thing you just gave them all your information sometimes it's also known as a phishing attack okay phishing where you get taken to a wrong domain that's what kind of might be happening here let's mix all the machines with ip addresses associated with big corporations executive assistants and guys in the mail room probably aren't counterfeit drug lords 218 gone okay so that was cool and he's like okay let's find all the ip addresses associated with this thing but like no developer ever is working under that much like time stress and has like 20 people it's like what's happening right now usually it's a lot more boring somebody's going to give you a task you go to your freaking office and you're just sitting there for hours you're bored out of your freaking mind and you're just like coding trying to come up with a solution you don't have 20 [ __ ] inspectors standing there like boom give me something right now i'm gonna that doesn't happen again also he's like getting the ip addresses and then there's like some 3d [ __ ] happening like what is that like where is this 3d stuff coming from do these guys have like a dedicated graphic designer that works with them so whatever code this guy writes he like shows it in this 3d way it's much more boring than this it's not as exciting um as that plate unbeatable the cameras all four tires give out bluetooth signals for poor when you're low on pressure what are you thinking it's got a little white box right there picks up bluetooth signals report traffic oh [ __ ] okay that was pretty dope like bluetooth technology does pick up things like that i'm not an expert in bluetooth technology but it is pretty cool that they're using bluetooth technology to figure stuff out if you are a developer or you're a hacker and you know how to do those things you can tap into that information from people although in reality the security is going to be much more strict and now the security is a lot better with these things so it's much harder to get to that so csi cyber it's cool it's flashy but in terms of how it maps like real life i think i'm gonna give it like a six out of ten for uh developer scene the next scene we have is from a famous show called silicon valley it's a funny show about these people doing a startup so let's go ahead and check the scene out that's weird they always travel in groups of five these programmers there's always a tall skinny white guy short skinny asian guy fat guy with a ponytail a lot of developers that hang out are often times like an odd bunch and there's a reason why programming has a stigma around it even though there are a lot of developers that are like not very stereotypical but a lot of them you know like even right now me my [ __ ] up like my weird beard hairs everywhere i mean that should tell you that i'm a real developer and it's because oftentimes we're thinking about code we're thinking about building apps and that stuff doesn't live in the real world so our head is not in the real world a lot of times sin what is possible what could we create and so often times you get people like steve jobs and mark zuckerberg who have one shirt and they just keep wearing that same color again and again and again so enough to use brain processing power on a mundane task and they can just stay focused on what they're doing which is building these really fascinating things this is funny i mean even the high school i went to i saw groups of four and fives like that you know so it's kind of funny let's keep watching and then an east indian guy it's like they trade guys until they all have the right group i like that it does seem like they trade people until they have the right group so i mean in terms of the groupings and how it is i mean yeah taking that aside i have seen really cool developers fun developers there's a lot of like random stigma around it too and movies and shows paint a picture but honestly in real life really anybody can be a developer the person you're sitting next to might be a developer so you never really know there are a lot of times these stigmas and stereotypes get developed and you think developers look like a specific type of person or they are we really have to break out of them and make development freaking cool again because people have turned it into this thing that only like weird people do this right but if you started to know tons of developers there are a lot of developers who are just like really cool normal people because of movies we stereotype them as like weird fat guy that sits behind the [ __ ] computer and just like uh and just like eating chips or something and then just types really fast that's really not how it is most of the times that clip not the show itself but i think that scene i'll give it like um six out of ten you know mr robot brilliant cyber security engineer and he tries to take down a corrupt corporation so let's watch a clip from mr robot and i actually really like this show gur so some kind of like cryptic algorithm you can see in here so oftentimes as developers even though i'm not in cyber security but when you're solving tons of algorithms as developers you solve lots of problems where something's like a palindrome and you try to find hey what's the reverse palindromes are like words that are reversed so for example like a race car spelled backwards is also just a race car whoa what yeah try spelling that backwards this is something happening with like text based cryptic thing let's see what hap what what well what they're gonna do here shift value of 13. it's a route 13 algorithm the parent pages will help you find your calling but don't be duped cut down the woods each letter is actually shifted by 13. if you do that you'll get to those letters at the bottom the parent pages will help you so what he did is he just took it into a rot 13 encryption which essentially shifts each letter by 13 and does it now in reality if somebody's doing encryption they're probably not going to be doing a basic encryption of like 13. if they're good they're going to be doing an encryption that's much harder to crack but still pretty pretty cool but like as developers a lot of these algorithms you sit down and you you do do them and you can solve them hairdos we have some type of formula here a function and we put an n in here and it gives us back something okay so did shift the number by 13 and then they go and put it inside of the formula that they found and they're getting the numbers okay cool as a developer this is not most of the time of your job this is for cyber security for developers we build [ __ ] we don't hack a lot of the times but for cyber security people they do have to encrypt and decrypt codes and see what they can find it's a phone number oh [ __ ] so that's cool and then the last step is to take it and put it as a hexadecimal now i don't exactly know what made them choose hexadecimal instead of binary or all the other options that they had available maybe they just had instinct and they're into the cyber security world but they took that message kept encrypting it now what i do like about this is it's real and you can actually follow it along it seems like there's validity to this so i like when things are valid that's really cool unlike freaking queen's gambit where she's just looking at the ceiling and learning chess that's not how you learn chess like i went over to a hundred tournaments in actual real life and played chess that's not how i got better by ever looking at the freaking ceiling so here there's real validity to the way they did this it was a cool scene to watch not totally like developer related but cyber security related so i'm just going to give it like a 7.5 out of 10. now let's get into a show called person of interest which actually reading its synopsis i would be excited to watch but this show is about an xcia guy who uses artificial intelligence to find criminals i think that is super cool and as a aficionado and somebody who enjoys machine learning which is you know basically face detection image detection all of that kind of fun stuff they're using that to automatically detect people who could be criminals that sounds like a really cool premise to me let's watch the show now holy [ __ ] no okay kevin spacey excellent next question who am i oh very good damn admin now let's begin i'm testing the core code the higher function pause all right so far that's really freaking cool this makes me happy like if i saw that and i was watching a show i'd genuinely be excited and i would get lit because it looks real like this looks real first of all how the face detection started you can actually check out one of our coding tutorials called the python ai tutorial right up here and in that one that's actually literally what we do we teach people how to detect facial images based on camera so like you could show the camera an orange and it could detect it and we use a programming language called python to do that machine learning when he's doing that thing at the start where it says admin right on his face that's really what he's doing he's teaching his computer how to detect faces how to detect objects and how to log him in now he switches over to code he's probably using c or c plus plus or something i can't completely make out on the screen definitely not python because of how the if else statements are so using some lower level language i'm seeing void std call blah blah unassign ins so to me when i look at this as a developer i'm thinking either i'm looking at java or some form of cc plus plus i don't code in those languages all the time i code primarily in python or javascript but once you learn one language it gives you ultimate power it's like knowing how to speak to a genie once you know how to speak to a genie in its own language you unlock unlimited power and then it doesn't matter whether you speak in french whether you speak in english whether you speak in python javascript c plus plus there's just different languages all along you speak to genie so i'm looking at the code i feel like a little bit java now i'm looking at the computer i'm like what the [ __ ] is this but because they set the show in 2001 this makes sense the file system you know as a developer i like that i see code editor at the top i like that i see file systems i like that they're showing real looking code really good i love that they're doing that so let's keep going this show has my respect code the higher functions to ensure that the system we're creating will have the right value set morality in a machine we can't introduce real data until we're sure that the program won't abuse it hmm i really love that the talk about morality of the machine that part is like dope the guy is like hey you're actually talking about the morality of the machine void machine learning you actually can even teach computer morals it's kind of like teaching a dog right i have a english bulldog her name is pudgy she's a huge troublemaker she's adorable she's fat she's stupid i love her to death when she does something bad i go bad pudgy and when she does something great i'm like great job here's a treat here's a treat here's a treat she learns to pee outside and not inside because she knows she's gonna get treats us humans are like that too you can teach computers morality in the same way you reward it for something you wanted to do you punish it for something you don't want it to do okay with machine learning you can teach it to do that you can teach it those behaviors the next thing he talks about is real introducing real data as developers one of the things we get so lazy at but it's the worst thing you can do fellow developers if you're listening pay attention if you are a developer and you don't properly test your code you suck please properly test code and the reason why you don't do that is because it's not your company that you made so you don't really give a [ __ ] and we get lazy i get lazy myself sometimes even when i'm writing code for my own company so sometimes i suck it's really important because if you don't test your data and you just the first time you're testing it is on real live applications you can destroy everything right so for example if i'm making a robin hood like app that can do stock trading for you if i don't test it and i just open it to the public and you can put your credit cards in what if my app has a bug in it that just like it spends all the money that you put into it so if you have a hundred thousand dollars and even if you wanna buy a stock for a hundred bucks it just uses up all hundred thousand that would suck and it does that for everybody so if it has millions of users it'll just do that for all millions of users how could you avoid it you write tests and test your app so it's kind of like you trust the machine you're building by giving it little tasks and then when you can trust it on its own then you give it bigger tasks it's kind of like a relationship or a friend or a boyfriend girlfriend whatever right you get into a relationship you're like let me give this person my you know house keys that one day let's see if they abuse it if they're breaking in 2am in your house like what the [ __ ] first of all i already gave you the keys so why are you breaking in at random times second it's obnoxious and it breaks your trust but if they're like not abusing it and they're trustworthy and they're only there to care for you you're like now i trust them more now we can do more things together that's how it is with your code and how it should be first you give it little tasks and see if it can build trust if it passes those unit tests great now we move the app into what we call production and that's where the whole world can start using it and we move it out of the development environment that's what they're saying let's actually test it first strange did you write this hmm there is a new method at line ten thousand so pause real quick so something really interesting just happened there was a line of code that he actually saw that he didn't actually really write and he asks hey there's this code at this line let's actually see what the computer responds let's hit play are you aware of this additional code can you tell me who added it damn okay so what's crazy is that he didn't actually add that line of code but the computer just said admin added it so what is really going on here that's really weird let's see if they maybe reveal that in a little bit damn that is a [ __ ] sick cliffhanger so this is so cool so he goes something weird just happened and it goes adventure it's like yo i didn't clearly add this and now i actually love that he's about to run a line of code which tests your app and oftentimes as developers we run tests what we call unit tests to test our app and see if there's something broken or not and right as he's about to run it the computer just shuts off i literally almost get goosebumps because what the [ __ ] is going on here what is happening here our editor will check that out don't worry your children can watch this mr kazi is safe to watch come along children let's figure out what happened here so he's trying to do a unit test the app just vanishes and we don't really know what's going on now this is the very very fascinating and existential question that a lot of philosophers and computer scientists think about night and day and that is what happens when you give the machine the ultimate power these machines are so powerful that even something under the hood that most people don't know when you post a picture on facebook under the hood me as a developer i know this i've seen this the machine knows if it's a happy photo or a sad photo it knows if you were overwhelmed and it can actually look at your face and detect fear and it knows even what percentage of fear that is and these machine learning algorithms are only getting better and better and if you don't trust me think about even at a very basic level when you post a photo on facebook it automatically tags you that's using machine learning it's automatically detecting the faces so if you have those machines and they start getting lots and lots of power well think about a machine that's standing right in front of you and you can detect your fear it can detect your heart rate and based on the sweat and knows what you're gonna do next because it can see your past and all the decisions you've made imagine competing against something that's smarter stronger its predicting capabilities are far stronger than any human one machine can have more power than all the humans combined in the world intellectually physically all of the above so that's a scary proposition so when you're building things that have machine learning and you know whether it's supervised or unsupervised and you're putting it out there in the world it's a scary thing and i think what this show in this scene did so brilliantly is it painted this picture and just left it over to you and i as the viewers like what does that mean for our world tell me in the comments so far this show was super amazing i had a lot of fun just watching that one scene and the level of detail that went into coding takes my heart away and breath away i love when it's coding related and they get technical and there's even technical lines of code i'm going to give this a 9 out of 10 on the developer skill that wraps up our worst to best i hope that you enjoyed watching a real developer react to all these tv show scenes let me know what you would like me to react to next in the comments below you know what else is really cool just recently i reacted to gilfoyle from silicon valley debugging his code this video is absolutely amazing if you enjoyed this reaction definitely check out this reaction video that i made it's incredible click it go watch it now i love your beautiful face smash that like button subscribe to the channel and go watch it right now yes you go watch it i'll see you in that video okay you
