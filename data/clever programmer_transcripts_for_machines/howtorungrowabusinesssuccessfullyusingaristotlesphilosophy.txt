hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I am with my host or my good friend today Brian yes Brian runs a company called CrossFit illumine and before we get into the company and we talk about it I want to talk about how you will benefit from this video okay so as a software developer or whatever you're doing if you're an entrepreneur or intrapreneur right and you want to either get a fulltime job okay or you want to become a freelancer and kind of run your own business or you want to become an entrepreneur and kind of start or kind of start a real business a lot of the things we will talk about are gonna be very strategic and very very tactical so basically a lot of advice you'll be able to apply to a lot of those things okay and in this video we're just gonna kind of have a freeflowing conversation cuz a lot of the things we were talking about you know I started connecting with him recently he was my coach when he came to fitness and just incredible guy and he was just offering me so much value and like insight into a lot of things in life and in business and so when I came to Chicago I'm in Chicago right now my hometown I decided to drop by and speak and just a little bit about Brian you know he started you started CrossFit illumine in 2011 you said 2012 yeah in eleven twelve yeah okay cool so you know he started then took it from a 1,700 square feet like little place to a 17,000 square feet is that right 7 2002 and it grew from almost nobody to having 350 members at this point right yeah and how many people do you have on your staff at this point so we have a lot we have about 25 in total parttime fulltime all that right okay perfect and what's incredible about him and this company and CrossFit is that it's not just about fitness but a lot of like mental mastery as well yeah and this gym when I was going to it honestly none of the gyms I've ever been to ever felt like this it kind of feels like a family when I was here it's like everybody when I was working out and doing Crossfit I was a member here four and a half years ago and I see you guys you guys went to like dinners together you know and a lot of these people when you post about it on Facebook a lot of them are just like volunteer to come and help you yeah right it's like set up set of the stuff right and you don't get to run a business like that unless you truly care about other people and bring them incredible value and incredible results and brian has been able to do that and he likes to call himself like the connector of dots which is which is pretty cool and basically he thinks in the clouds at high level and he brings these people together and he's the one who comes up kind of a division and then you know he worked for this team to realize it and you know a lot of the work we're gonna be talking about it's gonna be based on understanding yourself self discipline self mastery and understanding yourself and understanding everybody else around you so does that do a little bit of justice it does yeah yeah it's a good overview but yeah it's so much more than a gym yeah so much more than about fitness right we say it's an enlightened approach to human being so mind body and soul ready you have to nurture all three and we help with that that's epic yeah that's yeah so I'm excited man it's uh we were able to connect about what three weeks ago now yeah a reconnect I'll call it reconnect but yeah we've had some deep deep facebook messenger conversations really crazy and it's it's amazing man you keep you don't connect at that level with everybody yeah and not everybody's ready to hear a message which might be written off as you know motivational crap right yes not a lot of people are ready to hear it I definitely feel that and once you grow your business to like a certain level or you're working on building a business I feel like you become very kind of what we were talking about you feel very isolated yeah cuz your problems are very different from what a lot of other people's problems are right for example maybe somebody who is trying to get a job their problem is to like make X amount of money or to get promoted to the next level in the next level and get like more and more years of experience yeah but if you're an entrepreneur you're growing a business once you hit those revenue marks where you have enough for yourself where you have enough for your family it's not just about like the money or anything anymore but it's like kind of about providing that value to other people but also it being in line with what you want to do ultimately yeah so when you get that time to think for yourself and reflect like is this really in line with what I want to be doing like 10 20 30 60 or 70 years from now yeah and it's really scary when sometimes the answer is no yeah it's very scary but it's necessary to be introspective frequently yeah because you could get too far down a path and maybe trap yourself or you know or worse right yeah so you know Harvard actually has a study called the happiness index Wow pending on where you live you know California is different in Chicago different in New York there's a number that you know let's say Chicago is 70 grand beyond 70 grand you're able to take care of all the necessities of life some luxuries you can buy a house a car go out to dinner and feel safe right it's basically safety anything above that or beyond that doesn't get you any more happiness Wow so gives you more things which maybe could cause you to be more unhappy sometimes yeah so then it becomes like okay now that I've secured this level of security yeah now what right and it's a scary thing that's what the midlife crisis is for people when they're 50 luckily we've arrived at it a lot earlier and I think a little more proactively than reactively yes which is a good thing you're definitely you know I would say ahead in terms of like where I want to be in terms of when I listen to you talk about your alignment with your business goals life goals and kind of you're at and I really appreciate you know that about you where you took the time to really look introspectively because a lot of the coaches and motivational things out there just like do more do more do more and I feel like I have done a lot more and I have grinded a lot and I did put in twenty hours a day but it's not about that anymore yeah you know like I really want for example the students to be really successful so one of the things that is you know like there's an online course that I told you about that I have yeah and students are going through and that's great but I want to be able to be there for the students in a better way in a way that they'll become more successful and I can be more accountable right you know and that they can have more accountability and a higher success rate and so will that make me more money maybe yeah but it will definitely give me a lot more happiness and fulfillment fulfillment you feels good about what you're doing and you don't know what you don't know yes whatever you did up into that point it's what you knew yes but now that you now that you see it you can't unsee it yes right and this happened to me within the gym you know we use the analogy of we used to do a group on ramp and the goal is just get as many people to try CrossFit right yeah I was in nonrem we were in the on ramp yeah and it worked for some people yeah but it didn't work for a lot of people and it's because we had one product a round peg and we try to you know fit a round peg in a square hole kind of thing yeah and so it works for some people and it's not the survival of the fittest really if your goal is to help people and help people deeply rather than like help as many people as you can right so you come to this realization of like am i helping people by introducing to this and then having them fail or can I do it better yes right which is pretty interesting and then when you know that then you have to do it yeah if something can be better yes you have to pursue that and I have a thing called the relentless pursuit of better Wow and if you can live by that principle and it's not like pathologically pursuing better because that could be it too but there's a fine line between pathological and in genius Wow right yeah so yeah so you're hitting that or you've hit that I've hit that I think it's a natural progression yeah of just the growth the inner growth of an entrepreneur right yeah I agree I love that you the reckless pursuit of a pursuit of better being better the relentless producer says that come does that kind of come from Tim Grover the relentless book a little bit or doesn't know so you know what's funny is I don't consume a lot okay from the outside in and it's only because I've realized like I do better with with less input because it it introduces more noise and confusion for my own direction yeah and I think there's like universal truths that people arrive at yeah no matter what they do because they run into problems and you have to solve them yeah that was like super interesting to me dude like when you told me that you were I think they were talking about Facebook Messenger and you were talking about like looking introspectively and I feel the more the business was growing I was kind of you know I'm hiring mentorship and I'm getting coaches and they're great they're great but I feel like I'm just looking more and more outward rather than inward and what ends up happening is I might end up doing the thing I was gonna plan to do in the first place anyway right but now there's just like a lot more resistance and it just takes way longer to do that thing whereas like before I just executed that you acted yeah and when I you know based on all the different business models based on that clever programmer shouldn't have grown as fast right but the reason why it grew normally fast and in a good way was because there wasn't a lot of noise I would just go to my office that I got in Chicago Regis I still have it God you can't get out of that contract yeah get out of here yes I've been paying for that forever but okay when I would go to that place I just sit in this little like 400 square feet room yeah but like nothing else to do but work you know just execute now get there 500 a.m. in the morning and I would leave 900 or 1000 p.m. go home sleep yeah and then maybe go to the gym and just like rinse and repeat rinse and repeat yeah now those were in the days where everything grew the fastest because I feel like I had the least amount of noise and now I have all these ideas and like you know internal fulfilment and clarity and alignment and like doing something that gives value but it is also really true and authentic to myself and you know speaking with different coaches and different opinions and it's like there's a lot of it just takes me a lot longer so when you told when you share that with me that kind of really rang true with me internally like you know that gut reaction yeah it's kind of like a gut reaction and I'm like I feel like I need to start looking more in it introspectively yeah like in wordly and trust it more and I feel like as people we're scared to do that because then we can't blame it on something else yeah you know I agree yeah you really have to you gotta believe in yourself what worked for somebody else might not work for you and in how you actually operate right so I operate on on I'd say I operate best when creating and to be creative you have to use logic as a tool but logic cannot be the only tool like there's there's something that transcends logic and I create amazing things when I can transcend logic and then do things that maybe other people would not feel comfortable doing yeah that seem counterintuitive to success yes um and maybe you could never work for them because they don't see that there is another layer yeah and maybe logic only work for them so they're gonna tell you the logic is the way and it is a way yes a way but it's not the only way you have you know what I mean yeah um and you can't be definite that logic is the only way and tell people this is the only way yes anybody that tells me this is the only way it's right off immediately yeah I prove people wrong all the time all the time so Zappos I just got back from an awesome training company called wat if I flew them out to train their entire staff on customer service and culture Wow's apples flew them all zap no butterfly paid them as consulting so it's apples so worldrenowned for customer service Zappos gets 40% of their orders returned so 40% of the orders get returned logically that sounds like a horrible business model but they're hyper profitable Wow and their purpose statement and they haven't always been this way but they've developed this culture that their purpose is to deliver wow it's very big yeah deliver wow what does that mean well it means that some customer service girls stayed on the phone for 12 hours with the customer and that was delivering mom not logical but they're hyper profitable Edison say they'll get 40% of their orders returned if somebody wants to try eight pairs of shoes yeah they'll say order I'll eat all colors wouldn't return the ones you want not logical but it works right but is it work because everybody believes in it Wow here's an interesting anecdote ease that is tied to me personally and I'm the idiot that learns the hard way yeah all the time and but but these lessons stick with me and I fail and I make mistakes I've learned I grow I just I built this place without any expectation of outcome I had a corporate job as making a killing in sales and I built this place with passion and purpose literally just making people happy and doing the right thing all the time and then I went a little too deep on logic at one point and began diving way too far into metrics way too far into numbers making decisions based on the outcome hmm and there's a a time stamp in my revenue where that change occurred and it began to dip and it was tough man it was like okay and then and then the more dip the more logical I got because I needed to solve the problem and it came up with intricate solutions architect at all these beautiful things based on logic and the reality was I needed to get back to who I was and who the person was that actually the Brian that created this place yeah and it's been like this uh it's been this amazing journey because I've learned so much and owning a gym like this and being a leader it's kind of like the the crash course your crash MBA yeah you make a choice in a decision in and you can see how it plays out in reality yeah you get instant feedback ultimate crash course it's amazing so you make tremendous progress as a leader if your intuitive and introspective and you can look at things objectively and say wow that did not work or that's because I did this or that so it's amazing to think logic is great but it's a tool I hundred percent agree with that and I think what happens is that you get put at a very disadvantageous position when you think that logic is the only way or you think the creative ways the only yeah and I think you have to be open to both so for example my audience you know some of you guys are software developers or want to become software developers we think very logically right code is either right or wrong yeah a lot of us also do math right there's always one right answer yeah you know but maybe they're different ways to get to it and then also I have played chess you know and so it's very logical right but it's also very creative there's a lot of creativity that gets involved but you know at the end of the day it's like pretty logical and so we get incentivized for a lot of our logical behavior by accept then and there are certain points where you hit plateaus you know and if I think about like would say Copernicus who had a vision that there were multiple worlds yeah you know and he proved it to be true you can't logically just come up to that complain you can't just logic your way through that there needs to be some imagination to some creativity right and then he had to prove it maybe using a tool like logic that could prove it and it was like a system that everybody else could understand right and the Newton had to do the same thing where he developed calculus apparently on a freaking farm right and that was a tool to communicate about certain like ideas yeah but those are just that tools yeah the imagination is and creativity is what created something out of the literally thin air and I like what you said about your the asset you're the magician yeah and so for example in the world of programmers were very logical and so you know I'll hear that on my channel like sometimes you know and sometimes it drains me but now it doesn't really bother me anymore but like I'll talked about like you can be making $50 an hour you get me making $150 an hour like it's not hard by I had only a few years of experience and I was making hundred fifty to two hundred dollars an hour right and when I share that with people I almost feel like I'm scamming them right because I'm thinking that they're thinking that yeah because I get comments they're like fifty dollars an hour I've been working for 15 years and I'm making $40 an hour right you know so it's like something that's just not even possible except the layer that they don't see because the only way they're thinking about it is like well I need 10 more years of experience right right don't I need like four more master's degrees ha ha and that's gonna cost me X and it's not worth it or this exactly yeah how about this you go in and you talk to your boss but you know you take him out to a lunch or you build a relationship with him and and you know maybe find a way to provide more value than anybody else does may find those biggest leverage points and ask yeah you know a lot of the times in my life I've just asked and I've received yeah you know huge um and so that's not logical no but you know how comes somebody makes a billion dollars right works less hard than you yeah and it's making that money right right right and so I don't think it's one way or the other it's like you have to be kind of open to it and let it you know and so that's why I talk a lot about soft skills on my channel you know guys sharing them yeah yeah 80% of what I say is like but you already got the logical mindset that's why you're watching these videos you're holding more power right that's already your superpower but like you need to open yourself up to the soft skills and that's the biggest leverage point like that's where people can easily break through sixfigure salary yeah so it's it's wonderful to kind of hear that yeah it's pretty cool um you know you mentioned something about you know planning out or being fulfilled and planning out 10 20 30 years from now yeah and I'm really big on leading people to feel fulfilled on a daily basis right right so I've caused a lot of unnecessary suffering for myself and other people because I didn't understand my strengths yeah I didn't understand my weaknesses I try to be everything to everybody um but I also put the lot of my team into positions of weakness and I believe in the growth mindset like I believe that that is a very necessary mindset to have them all about mindset so describe growth mindset just a little bit so the growth mindset is you know not avoiding the things you're bad at and using everything as an opportunity to learn so if you fail there's always a lesson in failure learning and not being afraid to fail right the fixed mindset is thinking that people are just good at things right off the bat all right you know you're you're born with the talent they use words like gifted right or he exploited like the business just exploded all right he became a successful or Knight oh sure and he might have had natural tendencies toward his career path which allowed him to really go all in on his strengths and make them superpowers but it still took deliberate practice yes it's a building of good habits and all that you know so to think about like the fixed mindset and growth mindset I actually grew up with a fixed mindset just thinking people were better at things and other things and I just was never gonna be good at it and when I found I was working at CDW first corporate job ever and I hated every minute of it it was phone sales you had the cold call people and I sucked that was awful and I come over every day to my girlfriend who's my wife at the time and I'm like honey I can't do this anymore like this is not me and I ended up joining CrossFit at the time yeah and I just wanted to change I was like thirty pounds overweight and it was really like this this transformative point in my life where I started realizing like hey I suck it at this but I can see how I can get better and it's a daily thing that like okay I'm a little bit better I'm a little bit better so you have a faster path to realization yeah for the work that you put in and the feedback that you get back yeah and I started applying that to the job at CDW in sales and I went from being like the worst guy in the team literally to making ten times the amount that I was making originally yeah making top 10% ten times and or ten Xing my my income damn after like five years it was all the shift in mindset that was in in it took time in developing those skills but it is the shift in mindset right would you say you were working ten times harder to make 10 times more income at that time no um I didn't quite believe in my my strengths at the time either it was you know ten years ago maybe yeah like ten years ago a little longer um I put in the hours but it was putting in the hours to learn how to work less like working hard or first so I can be smarter yeah and I'm work less and it came to a point where I'm you know I realized uh I could probably do this in like an hour's time Chuck and it's very similar like Tim Ferriss 4hour workweek using the same kind of role probably as middle management doesn't like that they want you to put in the hours but like deliberate hours versus just fluff hours are different right very different um in it's very difficult to just put in fluff hours when you know if you have an hour it's a good time busy versus effective correct yeah yeah I'm just like working out you go to the gym and mess around for 23 hours and getting nothing accomplished we can go to a CrossFit class in an hour you get everything accomplished you're done for the day and it's super effective right but it's an intense hour right yeah I feel like it's what gets reinforced over time you know and so we learn it's like learned behaviors and so for example the school system or a lot of those things they don't they don't incentivize you necessarily for being more effective it a lot of the times incentivizes you for putting in that time quote/unquote right you know like for example you can't get more than an A but so somebody who is smart let's say figures out how to get an A now they don't have an incentive to go more than that right and you know those are the things that kind of build that behavior or overtime but you have to but when you're running something like a business there is no a right you know it can always get better it can always improve and so that's why sometimes as entrepreneurs we feel like it allows us to really push ourselves to the limit you know yeah then you you keep going a lot at the time right and the scary part about that is the good part about it is that it helps you push yourself the scary part is you can just keep going forever without like looking introspectively and like Tony Robbins says and I you know and I believe this that success with our fulfillment he says is the ultimate failure yeah and it literally leads to horrible horrible things from like a psyche perspective right um feeling trapped feeling like what you've created has trapped you being you know one one move away from checkmate yeah I've gone through it all within my own passion yes I've done it to myself right yeah that's why I think it's really important to know who you are know other people and help them understand who they are so you can't do that to yourself yes yeah one exercise that I I do with everybody and it's not religious but can I write any for sure so this is like an audit of yourself and where you staff on a daily basis okay look introspectively and I say it's not religious because I'm using terms but let's call it hell purgatory tie these together cool so I asked my team frequently Wow hello predatory heaven I like it when we preach the gym owners everybody myself everything um hell is the things that you do on a daily basis that you load for how that drain you that you detest right yes heaven is the things that you do on a daily basis that make you light up were the things that you want to be doing that you're not doing that make you light up right yeah um so no I mean it's gonna be like your strengths and superpowers right now purgatory is things that you're proficient at and indifferent about so it might be good at something limbo limbo right yes thing that you're proficient at indifferent maybe you have to do it temporarily because you're the business owner but really the big focus is okay let's list five things here five things here are five things here let's just completely get rid of these instantly your life will be ten times better and happier and then let's make a plan to offload these now the trick is you cannot offload the things that drain you to another person that it also drains that's that's not fair that's so important like anybody who's gonna be running a business thing about running a business just say that again for them that's so important so you cannot offload the things that drain you that you load to other people who had also drains yes below that it's a temporary solution but it's not a fix I'm done it yes I think we all have right now the half year to a year long painful mistake may have been more years and you have to let that person eventually go or something and it's a painful it's emotionally painful as mentally painful and it's it cost she's financially painful yes I call it unnecessary suffering yes and a service for everybody for everybody involved and so that's why you say that it's so important to understand your personality type but yeah what not and so you know Colby tests and all those things yeah many ways to skin the cat there yeah now just because you load things and it drains you yes does it mean other people don't light up while doing those things yes right yeah and we we make them as stay it's really hard to believe that it is it's like if I hate it who's gonna like this right and I feel that I don't want to I don't want to you know like you know push it off on them but the reality is like you're not doing it anyway and you're doing it poorly if you are yeah so if you're giving your 20% and they're giving it 100 they're gonna be better off happier by doing the things I make them light up yes so it's really easy on it to do frequently if you have a team you should do it for yourself for sure yeah in life you can put you know people that dream you rather than things that dream you same philosophy really easy to do right well yeah that's brilliant it's it's just a universal truth that you arrive at after screwing up so many times we do this with your team every week not every week no or like kind of once frequently like let's call it quarterly right or earlier um because things how you do it kind of oneonone or do you do it mostly like let's say in a meeting with a group of people it depends um I've done it in groups I've done it you know I gave a talk 250 gym owners and 100 coaches we hosted a business summit here oh that's all for a company that I business mentor for to bring business and have footage of that I do a little bit it was awesome but I made everybody do this and the the owners brought their team members the coaches and I told the coaches like guys by the very principle that we teach we teach what we call the perfect day like we should be striving no when you were when you were calling it that you know there's something I've created I don't know if I shared it with you I literally call it the my perfect day technique okay and I thought I was the only one who came up with it universal truth this is crazy and I made this video a while ago on top floor ways to stop procrastinating okay and it's not a motivational video it's like very strategic and tactical yeah and it's a great video I have it on YouTube and in that one of the things I say is like the perfect day technique so okay awesome so go ahead shorter you know the gym owners brought their team and there were separate rooms Hunter coaches 150 gym owners by the way guys it's that's incredibly hard to do like to get people to show up it's really hard like clever programmer you on YouTube it's like pretty huge but I'd be lucky if I can get like three people to show up in one spot cuz it's like it's just difficult and so getting 150 gym business owners like that's tough so that's awesome and you were giving a speech to them so to them and then 100 coaches separately so what are 50 people in total we're here for the to bring business summit for the coaches I said listen guys we teach the gym owners that they should pursue their perfect day and here's what and you've probably heard of it by the very principle of them pursuing the perfect day they have to do it for you too as the coaches as their staff members right so I made them describe it a little bit perfect perfect it's just like an ideal day like what would that look like it changes frequently but what are the things that you want to do what are the things that you don't want to do like do you want to work in the business for two hours do you want to work on the business for two hours you want to work out you want to spend your time with your family everyone has a different purview just define it and use it as a an anchor point or a goal to strive towards you might never get there but your life would be better if you pursue it right yes so I made the coaches go through this exercise okay and I'm like guys you you have to go to the your bosses who are in that other room yeah and tell them personal training drains me and then it's not doing anybody any any justice yeah I have another philosophy that I personally use with the team and everybody it's win win win you're a business owner and you're teaching your staff members to make decisions without you the winwinwin philosophy is it's gotta be a win for the business a win for the staff member and a win for the client Wow and if you can run everything through that filter then it's great that's great so if you're introspective enough to know that you're not effective in one area then you should fire yourself and then work on the things that make you light up because the clients not winning the business isn't winning and you're not winning right yes so relate that to personal and if you don't own a business the world isn't winning if you're doing the things that aren't within your strengths and they drain you right yes and that's sometimes what stops you from you know growing through that like a lot of times people are like I'm stuck at that one level where I'm making certain income how do I get past it how do I get past it if you can really understand the people who are in position to give you a higher paying job the only way that will take place is if their business wins and that businesses clients win right and so for you to be able to do that you have to see where your biggest leverage points are not where you can put in the most hours right but where you light up where you're in your zone of genius so you can leverage your skill set and that's where you will see the biggest impact on your bottom line in revenue you know for people who are like let's say you're doing job right and that's like an important thing for people who are doing a job right to do good work you have to do things that you're passionate about period so when you talked about procrastinating if you procrastinate on something more than likely it's not within your realm of strengths and there's a reason why you're not you're not working on it right yeah I mean okay so sometimes like honestly so one thing that happens with me is I get bored right I'm like I get it like this is how you do it and it's it gets boring so it's like I had I love training people like I love kind of making videos on new coding tutorials and whatnot yeah but it's like sometimes it's not the thing that wants me to wake up in the morning no yeah and maybe at one time it was it was but if it's not now then then you have to find somebody who excites up the joys and so one of the things is like for clever programmer you know what I am thinking about is like I don't you know I wanted to be something bigger than myself and before I started and before it was kind of like it it became too much for me personally yeah my vision was I want coding to be like a course subject in the world like I want everybody in the world to know some form of coding yeah that's all because I think it's so important it's such an important way of thinking and it makes you so like so many people have so many ideas but then they can't create it yeah you know so for me it was like you can have any idea like the crazy side you know you know how we're operating in cloud 9 yeah and then imagine being able to turn into this physical thing everybody in the world can download right so it's amazing yeah it's like the ultimate artists you know everybody can use your art like in seconds and it's the ultimate gift you can give somebody it's teaching them how to fish right rather than teaching them how to fish right and so you know history is a core subject and masses of course subject you know I sucked at math and I tell this to everybody I sucked at math people think I was so good at math no I was like feeling it yeah but when I found coding what I would do is I would take physics and math and those things that they just give you as formulas yeah I don't we don't learn with formulas you know people like you and I and so I would like create the thing in programming I'll create a little cannon Oh shoot like the ball at different angles yeah and I'm like oh that's why 45degree angle is the best English shoot a javelin or a throw a Canon at right and so for me allowed me to see those abstract things right and it allowed me to turn things into tangible reality and not just like talking clouds so for me it was like this amazing thing and I wanted to share it with the world and I'm like this should be a course subject she's not taught right next to history English all those things but as I got more and more into the business and like kind of I am the business like last month I was sick and there were no videos right you know there's no business yeah and if my mood changes and let's say I'm depressed well people see that energy so I'm not gonna create a video and don't can't be on all day long and what I'm thinking it's just work work work it takes that enjoyment out of it and the masterpieces I would create because now I'm not thinking I need to create a mass should be something I need to create something every week right and that just sounds like a chore yeah and I don't want to do it anymore right right and that's a scary thing yeah um and so now I'm like I you know and so basically the things that used to wake me up in the morning don't wake me up anymore and so I'm I was thinking last month I'm like am I just lazy or did I lose the hive yeah and then I started thinking about what would wake me up in the morning and I thought about something and I don't do that anymore but what would wake me up as I remember I would go to chess tournaments okay and I don't care how early there were 7 or 8 a.m. and that was my [ __ ] favorite thing yeah to wake up for it doesn't matter if I slept at 4 a.m. I wake up 6 a.m. get there nice and early I have my coffee I find out who I'm gonna play against I started researching their games like talking with people right it's the most amazing experience ever for me so I'm like there are things I would wake up for sure but I just need to look more in inward leaf 1 it made me realize that you know I need to stop beating myself up for not wanting to do the things that you know are I'm like I need to do it because gonna grow the business and if I'm not doing I beat myself up right right and maybe like you said you know turn clever programmer into a platform for cashing the developers who want to share that message right and then give and let them have the platform you know and share with the world so the world gets even more about yeah yeah so that's it's a it's just a natural evolution of the entrepreneur especially the creative entrepreneur where you've personally grown so much from this but almost detrimental e to your point of now being like okay I've done it all you know I know how to do it all I like being the bottom like you're the lot of next year you're the one thing kind of like holding your business back from exploding because you are the icon yes yeah you you are you're the business e you're super successful but as long as it requires you you own a very very high paying job yes and it's everything I mean I've run into every every entrepreneur runs into that good book the emyth and it's a natural evolution but now you need to figure out like okay if you're creative and you you're you you've learned all you can learn you've done everything you can do to figure out how do you make this bigger without you let me ask you something so you know I've grown up with the mentality of and my family all this is if you want something done right yeah and I'm sure we're all very familiar with this do yourself yeah and I wanted to outgrow I started realizing that that's not the right way to think because that's not how businesses grow right you know so that was one and another thing was like I want I'm gonna ask you like how do you feel about handing how did you overcome handing off responsibilities to other people because here's how I think about it and how I explained it to my brother so I was talking to my brother one time and I was on a call and he was he was talking with me and I was like I'm trying to hand off you know a lot of responsibilities to new hires new people I'm hiring yeah and different people but I'm like it just doesn't feel right and then he goes yeah because you know it's kind of like they're your babies and you have to mentor them right and I was thinking about that and then the more I thought about it and I'm like you know what I'm like it's not like that it's more like the business is like this little toddler it's my baby yeah that I work really hard to grow and make it survive up until this point and then somebody else kind of comes in they take the baby and they're like hold a baby up at the top and then just like flip the baby and just drop it on its head from like ten feet yeah and I'm like I just witnessed that and now I have to go to that person and be like that's okay you [ __ ] up right and you drop them you drop my baby yep and now we're gonna work through it yeah and I have to remain calm and I can't get angry yeah and I have to walk them through the process and so I'm like that's more of what it's like and that's where it feels really painful handing off things from your business it is how did you kind of over overcome that and what made you what was that first realization that you had that you're like I need to overcome this and I need to hand it off you know it's um for me it was being the the the point the central point where everybody was pulling at me like there'd be a point four years ago I had walked through the gym and I couldn't I couldn't not get stopped and saying hey I have to change my membership this happened that happened the coach was would come to me and say hey I can't figure this out and it was being pulled in every direction like this super high paying corporate job where I had freedom and and wow you know amazing things by that standard and what I built here required everything from me everybody needed me I'd built it was my fault and it wasn't necessarily things are fueling you they were kind of draining you a little bit and I was I was you know walking out on the floor and 20 people would tell me something and I have to try to remember it yeah I didn't have proper systems in place at the time I was actually pisspoor at doing all of it actually I'm not a detail oriented person so I was in misery just like checking boxes and doing all this stuff so it's just many many lessons over time I realized that was not the way in if it had to be the way then I didn't want to do this anymore yes and it was very early on and then I realized like you can't like how did you learn you learn by dropping the baby yes many times so I believe that you have to give clear instruction you have to give blackandwhite like here's how to do it so SOPs anything yeah but then beyond that you have to give them the freedom to fail that's scary but yeah it is scary but it's detrimental to their growth if you don't because it's the only reactant I learned it's only way you us and you stunt their growth if you're always over their shoulder it's kind of like I don't helicopter parent yeah they don't feel trusted yeah so you know a lot of a lot of misery and necessary suffering for me trying to be the puppet master and then me realizing like wow I'm literally hindering these people from growing because I'm not allowing them to grow did you go like really aggressive on some people in the store yeah and it's um you have some stories from that where you there was one specific time you remember where you kind of went hard on somebody and the way you criticize them yeah I have many sure um my wife specifically okay so I thought everybody could be or should be like me okay and I was like tyrant to myself yes and I produced some outcomes from it there was some severe consequences to my psyche because of it yes um but that's how I treated other people too like I was very hard on myself so I was very hardened other people like just very similar try harder like no no you're not getting it just put in 16 hours and just try as hard as I try yes and then I realized like I was making people miserable and actually the outcomes were ineffective and worse worse and it took a lot of introspection and you know learning about who I was and how people interact with each other yeah to realize like that is puppetmaster that's leading by fear and control and all of that in the outcomes are always better if you leave with love and empowerment right yeah but you know I've kind of forcing your wife to like put in that work and yeah and it just wasn't who she was it doesn't get she's lazy by any means it's just not how she operates like yeah yeah I was speaking German and she was speaking English and I was trying to force her to speak German and she's not you know she does it doesn't know it yeah I use an analogy of a starting lineup of a basketball team oh I've learned a lot about strengths and weaknesses yeah I was a great analogy I've shared that I've heard your shared recording on that and I was sharing that with multiple people I've told about that they were like that's awesome I shared this my brother because he's not building a team okay you other entrepreneurs are building a team and I told them you know I was from you and I'm like it was epic so yeah just you can share that now too because I'd be like a condensed version but I don't even watch sports but I think we can all relate to the physical attributes of a starting lineup for a basketball team so you have a power forward shooting guard point guard small forward in the center they all have unique strengths that allow them to play their position really well so what happens when you pull that team off the court bring them to the bench and begin moving people around and you put the point guard at center in the power forward a shooting guard and you throw them back onto the court and this is from a team perspective you can put them back onto the court and yes they'll still be playing basketball and actually yes they'll still be playing the game that they love yeah but they'll be ineffective yeah their confidence levels will drop because they're not playing optimally yeah they might grow through some adversity a little bit but the point guard is never going to be a great center it's just they're not equipped for it right yes so you know physical attributes it's a lot easier to see yes but strengths innate strengths that people carry it's not laziness it's just who they are at their very core and a very being I absolutely love this if you can figure out what your innate strengths are and figure out what other people's innate strengths are and then build your team around your gaps to support that yes you can accomplish amazing things yes and it's not tangible you can't see it yeah right it's not like the this five point nine point guard in the seven foot three seven yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's it's real yes just as real just as real that's how entrepreneurship and businesses work there's a lot of invisible things that people see that you and I might see or somebody who's running a business might see where other people don't see it in the start right they might not even see it right and this is what I you know money is you know value you can exchange it for money you can you can actually your value and vision in time right you can turn it into money at some point if you if you want to right if you don't you can keep just offering more and more and more and that's where kind of money comes from and so as entrepreneurs and people who see business you know that's how they the grow now the counterargument to that is if you're so basically for other dummies like me who didn't know about basketball when you share that analogy yeah for me how I think of it about it is like if you're a leftback you know you're you're not gonna be a great striker you know if your strengths are left back or if your strengths or more in playmaking then maybe you're better in the center and not as a strike or you know as a Seabee center back right and the counterargument is well what about trying out different things and then you can grow through adversity sure and you can go through growth through pain but I love what you said you said that there's a path of least resistance yeah and then there's every other everything else I love that and basically I think what that means how I interpret it is you can try every other position you can be a Seabee and a striker or a shooting guard and a point guard and all those different positions and bro you're gonna become better but would Messi be messy if he was or you know most people know cristiano ronaldo cristiano ronaldo be cristiano ronaldo if he was a defender right for a very long time and he was a mid Fielder and he was a striker right probably not but he became who he is today because he stayed in that one position somebody saw that vision now he took the path of least resistance but I still think he faced a lot of adversity there's no doubt that you can find adversity and opportunities for personal growth right within your lane and that's where least resistance yes I love that and then everything else is stumbling falling you know kind of bouncing around trying to find yourself it's good to try to find yourself through all that but I think there's a better ways to find yourself yeah and then you can actually took a shorter time if you can find yourself earlier on go allin on your strengths make them your superpowers and then understand how you can work with other people yes right I love that I absolutely love that like one of my clients who works with me in my youtube program so I'm you know I'm helping people overcome obscurity scale their business yeah successful entrepreneurs and help them you know crush up with YouTube to sell their products or whatever it may be and I'm working with him and sorry what we were just talking about I forget a lot so about about strengths yes and so one of the things is that he's working in like C he he's making a lot of money doing what he does currently yeah and that's great but he's also doing a lot of tasks that can be so easily outsourced and every time he talks with me and I asked him what's draining him and what's causing this mental fatigue then all distress and he's sharing with me that he's sitting there doing invoices for like 10 hours right or doing invoice of 15 hours and he's like Kazi but that's what makes me the money and I'm like but you don't have to do that like you know um somebody else can send the invoices yeah and he's like yeah and he's making more than enough to easily hire but he wants to even keep that chunk of the money for himself yeah if he has not even a full time independent like gosh it will take 10 20 K a year right paying that secretary or that virtual assistant yeah but the peace of mind that he gets and I easily feel like he in half you know 11.5 ex's income yeah what having very minimum have emotional bandwidth and energy gas I mean just just to be happy just to be happy that's the minimum the maximum is you can even four times your income yes get 50% of your day back to then leverage your strengths and superpowers to make more money yes um 100% oh god it's a hard hard lesson to learn so when we were I was at CDW they start you at CDW as a technology company business the business they start you have 25 grand they give you a list of some accounts to coldcall and sell to the minute I began making money we hired a fulltime assistant on our dime for 50 grand so like people thought we were not for your like two years in to like do you guys are way too young you don't need it but me and my partner realized like that that stuff we actually sucked at in fact it might have been detrimental to the customer customer service so it wasn't a winwinwin because we didn't love it we sucked at it and we kept messing things up so we went all day and we were making me be a hundred grand at the time and we each put in you know about 30 grand each get this fulltime assist but what that bought us back was emotional bandwidth in energy damage our strengths and superpowers which was building relationships yes typing so yeah we were losing 25 grand but we ended up making 250 grand each so why not but people don't have that that that thinking outside of the box they don't you have a sacrifice a little people don't want to make a shortterm sacrifice like even if they're getting something in the long term yeah like they want to eat like they say they want a sixpack but then you put a chocolate in front of them yeah and the longterm vision of the sixpack it starts to get very foggy Mike and the shortterm satisfaction from eating the chocolate is so strong and clear yeah that they'll eat the chocolate right now what's lacking is clarity right if they're extremely clear on what their body looks like and feels like they're not like well those six months from now you know I want a six pack they're like I want 82 pounds of skeletal muscle mass yeah 14 pounds of fat 10% body fat this is look like yeah this is what my height and body weight is gonna be once it's so clear yeah then they can look at the chocolate or the six month vision and have the same restraint right now holding us everything they do then aligns with that end goal so then making that tough decision is just as easy as eating the freaking chocolate right how did you start letting go of some of the control you know like what was that first thing that took place where you were like I'm gonna bring somebody else on or have them help me out was it your wife or was it but even if it was your wife how did you feel at that time to give up some of the control so with my wife it was a little different story because I fully trusted her to do anything like I believe she can do anything did it mean a broader fulfillment happiness no in fact it wasn't what she wanted to do and it brought her misery right so the the trust thing and giving it to her was easy but giving it to other people you know I would like feed a little bit see what happened feed a little bit see what happened and things would just keep dropping down like I'd throw it lob them a pass and it would just drop down and it happened frequently and it came to a point where I thought I just had like the opposite of the Midas touch so I thought that everything that I touched turned to [ __ ] Wow not gold and really it was a horrible horrible lens to view the world through because now everybody was like a threat Wow in a way right but the reality is I just I was in taking accountability for not understanding human nature and he'd been people yeah so what I learned from it all after a lot of a lot of suffering and a lot of mistakes and a lot of introspection a lot of learning a lot of like almost ruining friendships all of that was I didn't understand the team that I may need to build around me based on my leadership style Wow okay um so I'm not very good at teaching people how to do what I do I can do but I'm not very good at teaching people how to do what I do okay because what I do is very different than other people and yeah actually like the the in the weed stuff I'm not good at so I don't feel great teaching them that step by step I can teach them the concept here's what has to be done here's an SOP can you teach them other stuff like not related to how you do what you do but do you feel like you can teach them about some concept step by step or teaching step by step is not just not your thing so if people need their hand held and it's not a bad thing it's just what they need yeah I'm not optimal to do that I'm so high and far far up in the clouds okay that the micromanagement is not your thing I'm not good at micromanaging in fact it drains me I move it like a thousand miles per hour and I throw my fraps and I if you want to jump on on the boat and go for a ride it's beautiful my mistake was I would go back and try to save people and pull him onto the boat with me right right people that didn't necessarily want to be saved yes in people that just weren't equipped so like I'm not good at micromanaging but the people needed a deeper level of coaching from the business standpoint yeah that I didn't really I wasn't equipped for I can do it but my natural mode of operation is not there which it brought me misery right yeah and I didn't enjoy it and it drained me so if you build your business around that and you don't understand your leadership style you could end up hating your life right in the biggest turning point for me was we brought on a former gym owner who ended up closing her gym down went to go coach and we brought her on and I was able to throw her a few life rafts and she grabbed on Wow he knows that oh wow this is how it's supposed to work like okay wow I'm not better or worse than anybody right it's on our wall though don't shrink so that others don't feel insecure around you Wow um and it's not going down to the level but I cannot not be me yes when I'm not me everybody loses and everybody's miserable because I'm miserable and that carries over to your clients to everybody yes and I did it for a while yeah in that realization it kind of like shifted things a little bit I'm like oh this is how it's supposed to work Wow yeah and this is actually how I thrive as a leader and how people will thrive under me yeah but the people that still need a bit of handholding that's never gonna change I just need to find somebody who can do that for me Oh understands my strengths and my weaknesses understands that I'm not just being lazy yes I'm just not effective and it's uh it's selfawareness yeah it's also vulnerability to tell your team here's my strengths and superpowers and everything else I'm actually horrible at Wow beautiful but it's a scary thing as a leader yeah because then you you know most people think well what if they just go and open their own gym or open their own business because they realize you can't do anything it's outside of you know I call myself the connector of dots yeah but they don't want to do what I do yeah I never realized that yeah I'm really good at what I do yes okay just suck at everything else yeah as long as you can fill your gaps yeah in CrossFit um in Fitness it's all about working on your weaknesses yeah but you only have one player it's you right so you have to bring up your weaknesses to become better right in life it's so different because you could fill your gaps with human beings whose strengths are your own weaknesses yes and that creates sanity so important yeah I think that is so important what you said that you have to bring up your weaknesses just as much as you might bring up your strengths because if you don't bring it up those gaps aren't gonna be filled and people aren't gonna be able to help you with it right um it's kind of like the example of you know whether like when you say that you can work on your weakness versus work on your strengths and your like work on your strengths that's kind of like a striker he can work on defense when I could work on his defensive skills or he could just continue to work on his striking skills yeah so you go hey I'm a striker I suck a defense yeah could somebody please help me with defense yeah I'm gonna work on striking right um it takes a lot of giving up your ego yeah it's very difficult yeah for me personally ego luckily was never a thing because I had two older brothers to overshadow me in everything yeah one two I always did everything competitively like so when I got into video gaming I would play competitively online in tournaments and just get my ass handed to me all the time right so I became very familiar with losing and I became very humble right and then when I started chess competitions everybody would just mop the floor with me all the time and I thought I would be so good and I just naturally crush but it's objectively you lose but a lot of the times in life nobody calls you out on losing and if you don't compete a lot of times you don't know what a loss really is we're we're talking some and talent of like everybody is a winner for example right and I don't think that's healthy no um you should know where you're a weekend where you're strong and I don't think it's a bad thing no it's it's essential yes it's essential and so what happened with me locally was like when that happened I'm just very okay we're telling everybody what my weaknesses are yeah I can't micromanage I'm not very good with day to day my mood changes I'll get bored but I'm very good at thinking at high levels yeah I'm really good at coming up with breakthrough new ideas or new business ideas and like rallying the troops same thing yeah and so I can either fight myself for the rest of my life and hate myself for not wanting to do those things right or I can admit that I'm a striker yeah you know and build that team and so even about once he gave that analogy about the basketball team I started and I'm a soccer fan yeah I started to think of my team as a soccer team yeah and I'm like the customer service people that's kind of like your defense this line right you know that's your defense line like refunds and making sure everybody's happy and then you have like the centerfield playmakers which might be the people we're thinking in the clouds yeah so one of my favorite players salespeople or whatever you might wanna call me yeah so like for example the people who are coming up with the ideas or the different plays so you know Zidane is one of my favorite soccer players and it's like they have to decide is it time to pass a ball to the center backs or is it time to pass the ball forward right and sales team in my mind is kind of like the striking yeah you know they're the strikers they're closing the deals and they're closing the sales but just so important understand yourself completely and then to understand other people and so even the people who are doing jobs right now understanding yourself is very important because you can understand what role you will thrive in yeah you know what role you will crush in because it's not okay doing something that makes you miserable or makes you feel indifferent when that's most of your life right what an average Americans work from eighteen till they're 65 how many years is that a lot of years a lot of years third least a third of your life and the other third you're sleeping you're working eight hours you're sleeping eight hours and then you might and you come home with bad energy yeah so the time you spend with your loved ones it's like average and mediocre time right then your children are not like who they could be yep and then it's like a generational thing and it just passes on and next generations are you know and so if you're okay with that then do it but if you look at it very introspectively quat in quietness no noise right and I feel like a lot of people won't be okay with that no and they they really shouldn't but it's um it's almost like you have to snap out of this Hayes Hayes acting mode that Napoleon Hills and his outwitting the devil calls it Ratanak rhythm right recommendation by the way it was amazing I read the book it's unbelievable outwitting the devil Napoleon Hill beautiful analogy of a conversation with the devil and the devil really is just the voice inside of your head that stops you from becoming what you could become and it just uses fear and outright and we all can relate to that but people you know though everything that I've learned up into this point made me realize my new purpose in life is to provide a canvas for people to understand themselves so to help adults figure out who they are a lot of the times people go through life and they stumble through life just trying to find themselves and then maybe they have student loan debt maybe they're in a career because they have student loan debt that they thought they wanted to do but really hate but they have all this debt now they've bought a house and they begin to kind of painting themselves into this corner then they have kids and then they paint themselves deeper into the corner and then they look up at 50 and they realize and maybe earlier I hope earlier but at 50 they realize like what did I do like I'm trapped yeah and the reality is you're not trapped so long as you're willing to sacrifice everything you have for what you can become yeah and it's a common theme but people are deathly afraid of giving up their car or their house because of pride and ego yes or whatever it is that they're attached to that's stopping them it takes a lot of sacrifice it does I mean I'm sure it took a lot of sacrifice on your end and on my end I never really thought of it as sacrifice but it is sacrifice so like one example is when I was starting the business like clever programmer and I wanted to go allin here's what I did when I started seeing very little traction I'm talking we didn't even have a thousand subscribers yet yeah sauce a little bit of traction this is where I'm like kind of like how you guys got the assistant before anybody else thought it was a good idea right I already had my iMac on a loan I had my lighting kit on a loan yeah my this mic that you see right here actually we got a loan ice the laptop literally everything yeah okay it was just on pure credit card debt and all the clients I had and the software development I was doing the freelancing I was doing I cut so I went from having a sixfigure salary as a 19 or 20 year old to zero dollars in revenue every month to having debt and then what I did on purpose is got an office where I was paying $1,000 a month okay I get additional expense and I'm like now I'll survive purely out of just need for survival almost like your back against the wall back against why and that's when I think the best and that's when I'm excited and that's when I come alive ya know like now this is an interesting challenge and so for me I did that and it a lot and and I dropped out of college okay so there's another of that and then so I did oh yes I feel like it's a common theme and it just makes me feel reassured every time I hear that I think just I hear the rate of people you just you're listening to really like like what am I gonna use this yes I could do I can make it without all of this yeah yes yeah it's you might like it's not a piece of there's nothing wrong with education but what I've always said is use it as one source of Education right what people do is to shut their brain off from all forms of education they're not listening to audio books or not going to conventions they're not following anybody they're not listening to even themselves yeah and they're just using colleges everything yeah and they're letting they're just letting it think for them yeah they're letting it decide for them and they're hoping and praying and wishing that that piece of paper will entitle them yeah to a job um which they don't even want right scary yeah and it's I don't know it's a scary scary thing so ultimately it's like you know you don't need it if you want to go through it go for it right but you don't necessarily need it and it's ultimately you and just understanding that you know commonly coming up with something when you're providing value to the world it just can't go wrong but that's hard I feel like wrap your mind around it really is and it's it's you know systemic almost brainwashing of society to say you have to do this yeah this is just part of the American dream go to college you know get me when that dream isn't a lot of people I feel like that dream is though the dream that people see other people have and then that's when it becomes their dream right so the dream of getting a degree yeah getting married and having kids yeah and while there's absolutely nothing in the world wrong with that the thing that might be wrong with it is if it didn't come from you and it just came from like FOMO like you're missing out by and that's kind of why you just chose that path yeah yeah and then you get it all and you're still not fully fulfilled because there's a hole inside of you meaning like your your your your soul that you're not pursuing your purpose you've just pursued an outcome no you can do more you pursued an outcomes that I've gotten the outcome and that's not fulfillment or happiness yeah the outcome is and it's the journey earnings it's finding your purpose and so you feel like you become numb through life and you kind of go through it and like this haze you know on the autopilot and you just accept it it's like some reality a lot of it um now if you can if you can jolt yourself out of that hypnotic rhythm right or you know we can call it programming we can call it brainwashing we can call it anything you want to call programming in a good this one's in a negative sense but yes patterns have thought through repetition that are enforced by society in the news you know everything your family yes you need snap out of that pull yourself out of the the brush and catapult yourself into the helicopter and look down then you can see clearly the clarity that we're looking for yes you can see the water you can see the lion and you can see the traps that are set yes waiting for you and you're like no I'm not gonna I'm actually gonna I'm gonna sacrifice the reality I created I'm gonna build my own reality I'm gonna construct my own reality around Who I am yeah and it takes so much courage awareness yeah but it's possible very possible but it just takes sacrificing everything you have from a material perspective yeah the attachment to it and everything does mean don't care it means not and it doesn't mean like sell everything you have or just go live it like a hobo no it's not like woo boo stuff but if you have a Porsche it's like and you're still miserable then the Porsche isn't making you happy right the job that bought the Porsche probably isn't making you happy maybe sell the damn Porsche and buy a cheaper car so you can afford to leave your job and do something and maybe it's a oneyear plan maybe it's a threeyear plan yeah but something is broken and you need to address the the cause and not the symptoms buying more [ __ ] is not gonna make you happy yeah you proved it by buying the Porsche you proved it by buying the house you proved it by getting married all the things buying the ring the the Rolex or the Tag Heuer yeah and you're still you still have a point so it's not that these are the symptoms let's not keep treating the symptoms let's find the root cause which is you haven't pursued your purpose yes let's be introspective figure that out and then develop a plan to allow yourself to do that maybe it's an hour a day of giving back I don't know what it is everyone's different yes yeah in but the looking inward is probably the most painful experience I've ever had it's scary man it's the scariest thing so I can understand why somebody wouldn't choose to look inward it's easier to just continue on or the status quo it's less painful it's very less pain but it's it's longer you know it's not as a cute but it's it's a lifetime of pain rather than just one snap out of it and I got that sucked but yeah now I can see clearly yes right and there's a lot of like so a lot of it comes from selfawareness and also like I feel like it starts at some level with selfawareness and just catching your own thoughts or the thoughts of like the people around you you know for example like this inner dialogue of you know when I was growing up a lot of the times when we would be we would go through this village of Wilmette and Winnetka oh yeah and it was actually our like this drive that my family and I would go on every weekend okay it was our thing and we would always go through it just look at the homes and we're like wow they're so amazing they're so beautiful and the dialogue was always like oh these are like really big people's things you know like oh we just come here to look at it right that's not something that like my mom would be like you know we it's not for us right it's like for people at a higher level right or this is something that we don't we don't know we can't do you know come on like that's for somebody else and those things would kind of suffocate me at a young age yeah and I heat like you would I would get angry and now nobody ever really understood why I was getting angry at that but those dialogues what happens is it just stops you from thinking about a possibility of something else like completely right you know and so you have to challenge that reality and question that reality and so you know the whole reality of like my brother became an engineer and he got a job or like somebody becomes somebody gets a degree and they get a job in a promotion or promotion or promotion and then they're retire and whether they get pension or not and then they die right you know and they barely are surviving every month yeah it's like when I really sit back and think about it even if you're making $100,000 a year and United States very tough yeah to get by with the type of life you want the type of life you want for your kids type of fulfillment that you want yeah because like okay people say you enjoy spending a time with family do you really because if you did then you would find a way to spend more time with them right that should be the centerpiece of your life and then build it around that right right if you really enjoy spending time with your family I love what you're talking about now where you're like I'm gonna create this business like and the business is gonna be selfsustaining where he provides like the main vision and what it's headed yeah and you're gonna be traveling for a year yeah in in what like in a in a portable house pretty much yeah all around the country and Airstream yeah but it's it's an adventure and I you know one on one prove to myself that this all can stay without me my my contribution to the business the brickandmortar business I've done everything I can do outside of guidance mentorship and providing opportunity and now it comes a time where you know people who are very good at executing and operating are gonna be working within their strengths and the things that make them light up they're gonna be rewarded handsomely for doing so filling my gaps and then it's gonna allow me the opportunity to continue pursuing the things that make me light up and really at the most meta meta macro level it is I like creating I like providing opportunity I like architecting solutions I like creativity and if I can do that for the rest of my life I will have one and everybody will miss everybody else myself my family the world if I can create and fill my gaps I can create beautiful things and everybody wins and if everybody can do that because not a groan can be mean Andrew or should they be because then nothing would get done there'd be ideas all over the whiteboard all over the wall and no execution thing would be there so nothing would be done you need somebody to execute implement and and all that yeah but it can't be somebody like me who does it because you're gonna crush them under their own own weight it has to be somebody who lights up while doing that right now yes uniquely equipped yes they are the center yeah I'm a point guard I'm never gonna be a good center right and it doesn't do the team any good if I try to play center yeah never that's why I need to I need to know what the center does okay I need to be able to relate to this position be empathetic and then work synergistically together as a team right Wow yeah ultimately I think that's really what it is just like when you understand yourself at that level it's allowing you to now leverage and grow your business probably the fastest it has ever grown yeah while you've probably I'm just assuming some of the things you've probably working less hours yeah you're probably the most effective and now the business is making the biggest impact and probably it's that it's have a highest revenue point yep yeah and it's it's by sacrificing some of the pie that doesn't exist Yeah right it doesn't exist yeah eating into the pie a little bit the existing pie by sacrificing some of the pie that doesn't exist as an incentive work as a collaborative team to build this to what it could be right and something I could probably never do by myself given my capacity my strengths or my my at this point in my career my willingness to do it right yes yeah so the the pie thing that you're sharing I just want to make it clear to the people who are watching it's like you know when you were when you were sharing that example with an assistant like what made you hire the assistant a lot of people would see it as like okay there is this pie you guys have half of it yeah now you have an assistant the system is gonna have so now it's like 33 3333 right percent of the pie is gonna be eaten except what you end up don't not realizing is the pie doesn't exist sure and second of all how I like to look at it is when you bring that third person in now you can actually figure out how this pie was made so you can just start making more pies yeah and maybe instead of that one pie being shared between two people when the third person comes in and there's synergy understanding of personality types putting people in positions where they can win all of a sudden use for making two for eight pies yeah and it's a beautiful thing everybody no resistance and everybody eats yeah right but you have to have the the four set of vision to say okay well I might be losing half of the pie right now but with the bandwidth and energy I get back to leverage my superpowers yeah I'm going to create ten more pies or I'm gonna make this pie ten times bigger however you want to put it and it can never get to that point you can't wait until you get to that point to do it because the only way you're gonna get to that point is by doing it you can't wait until it's there you know what I mean people make that mistake like oh I gotta wait until I hit this before I do that right I do that with happiness happiness that's the worst where you do it so where people are like I'm gonna be happy with when when right dangerous thing so for example a lot of mindset coaching I have to do and I'm putting people through my youtube program you know my good friend his name is Tenzin and he runs a channel called thank you yeah he runs a channel called what's dev okay the coding channel and he started after I started my clever programmer channel so he was really like my first kind of student going through the YouTube yeah Ram so to speak and I was mentoring him through a lot of it and you know there's a lot of um a lot of mental blockages that come in the way yeah where you where you don't want to do it but you kind of have to guide the person through it and just quickly I'm sorry to remind me what we were talking about because about like the pie and not not being able to see it like when we can make it bigger right yeah yeah so that's definitely one of the things so when you're kind of in the thick of things yeah it's really hard to see what's kind of taking place and there's always like mental like oh but what you end up realizing is that it takes just the same amount of work yeah as you put into your current job or you put at your gym or you put into anything else yeah and it takes the same amount of work to let's say grow a business it's just different type of work right same energy you know but yeah same same energy yep same manage because and I believe in this grant cardone says this is like energy is infinite that's something that you can never run out of right but you have to focus on where you're gonna kind of plane it to and yeah and I add or argue or inject that energy is finite if you're working on things that you write infinite if you're working on things that like you light up on doing yeah it's really really interesting so now in terms of you know this business kind of what's the vision and for you CrossFit illumine like where is it heading let's say 5 10 20 years from now so you know I call this brickandmortar right just the physical location I've done everything I can do from creating the framework / providing all the tools finding the right people for the right seats who are also on the right bus the right bus would be like culture and now it's time for them to optimize everything that I have and make it better but also allow them to make it different yes then what I may have originally set out to do but giving them the opportunity and empowering them to to make it their own yes we talked about it you talked a little bit about you know being attached to the business yeah and the way you can put it my good friend Ryan DeBell from the movement fix use this analogy he's a very very smart guy outside of the box thinker and he ran into the same problem with with his online thing used to do he's a chiropractor he used to do movement the seminars yeah we travel the world and he just kept levelling up and kind of growing as an individual and we've been locked stepping in that process and he said you have to be able to imagine you have a suitcase yeah and you have to put everything that it takes to run your business into that suitcase and you have to be able to put the suitcase down and then work on other things and when you want to pick the suitcase back up to work on it you can do it yeah but you have to be able to detach yourself from it Wow and maybe maybe what your idea of what the outcome could or should be yes I mean that that's brave that's that's courage yeah but I believe that given the right team even though it might not be exactly my vision now and I'm helping form that but I'm allowing them to be a part of forming that vision instead of me pushing it down no it could be more beautiful I don't know but I'm willing to take that risk right now yeah because uh I think it could be more beautiful it's gonna be different it might not be exactly how I would have done it but it could be better yeah but you have to trust those people you can trust the systems you've built yeah put in place yeah it's it's but it's cool now let me ask you are you when you're speaking with your team are you focusing more on the todo list or are you focusing more in terms of empowering your team and management or are you focusing more on the outcomes with them so I'm focusing more my role and I have you know people who do coach development because I'm not good at coach development and actually I'm a I'm a good coach but I'm not a great coach and it's I could be but it's only for like an hour hmm right yeah and it's I can give everything I got it I can get super technical and I can do anything yeah but where I revert back to is I begin talking about philosophy nice and it's it's important but people yeah here they like that but they also have to be coached I need people with attention to detail some strategy and some tactical right and that goes for even coaching my coaches I can uh I can do it but I mind the optimal person to do that so my whole role with my staff is is leading them to pursue their purpose and continuing to readjust right what they do based on what they love what they light up while doing and in purgatory Wow and that's a constant shuffling and you know they evolve and they grow as you go so sometimes it's like oh god nobody wants to do X Y & Z and it's it's good to understand what those gaps are and continue to see those gaps rather than how people do them miserably just because it's part of their job or maybe it's because they don't want to let you down yeah maybe they're afraid to say something maybe they don't even know they're miserable yeah but you can see it and everybody else can see it yeah they're just stuck in this haze yeah of just doing and you have to pull them out so I call it like leading them to water and you know some making them drink by saying hey you're miserable doing this actually I see you light up while doing this let's figure out how to build your career around the things that make you light up yeah you might have to make a little sacrifice and and give up X amount of money in the short term yeah but here's where I think we can get and you're gonna be more fulfilled and you're gonna be happier yeah and it's really like making them believe in themselves yes and that's so important and I don't think I believed in myself until recently umm fully believed in myself hmm and it's it's once you do that you have to help other people do it Wow you know what I mean yeah yeah and making somebody believe in themselves sometimes it can be a scary thing like for example I shared with you the you know the recent friendship that kind of came not friendship didn't come to an end but the involvement in the business came to an end right and it was like me projecting my belief in that person yeah and putting that belief you know and kind of believing in that person but then I don't think he was ready to believe in himself yeah and sometimes that's a very that can be kind of a dangerous thing because you can lead them down this path where they were never meant to succeed or your son ever cause it kind of forfeit you're setting them sitting whatever fail or failure based on where they're at right now right mentally maybe exactly and you know as somebody who is you know an entrepreneur who romanticizes who finds the best in people and I feel like I'm doing a good job of finding the best in people and finding kind of even like what they're talented at but maybe not at this point good at understanding people yeah in terms of what would fulfill them years from now what would their ultimate vision be and so my struggle now is to kind of understand that about people where I can understand where things are gonna had six months or a year from now and what things they would find fulfilling yeah you know and I feel like you're you're doing a pretty good job at that no but it's through massive failing at it you know what it'd be a frequent and massive feeling in being introspective and you have I feel like you have to a certain level fail a little bit if you do learn it and I learned in the hardest way possible so the way the way we teach coaches to kind of figure this out is we have three circles Chevron yeah yeah I like drawing I love everybody loves me all right so we have three circles we have the classic Venn diagram of three circles so we have perfect day mmhmm sorry okay then you have career goal so like monetary how much money you want to make and then strengths so like what we do is we try to find out where this is and we'll have less of the outer skirts right yes and then more of like okay well let's not even bother having you do things your miserable doing and really let's just focus on like getting here but maybe it starts by getting here first right yes maybe you're doing some things that you don't love to do but you don't necessarily be testing low then maybe that's just to make this right yes but eventually we want to eliminate these and we really want to get to here yeah so it's building their career plan based on that I love it and then so if you're if you're at point eight today and you want to get to point Z then you have to have benchmarks and stepping stones for them to get there and you have to visually show them that you're working with them to get there and you're always gonna constantly readjust at every point when you meet with them and say how are things going you know and it's a twoway street at that point they're vested in building their career yes it's not you telling them what to do they're choosing what they want to do and then they're building it around that and people are more fulfilled that way then they will ever be if you start with this dollar amount I need to make 70 grand I will do anything to make 70 grand that's not sustainable right it's not say no I absolutely how you said that when you're sharing this with the people or your team it's more outcome driven yeah I said I'd like to do list because and this is great I kind of had an epiphany just looking at this I feel like combining hello purgatory in heaven along with that outcomes that you want what people you figure out is like they can work in their own element based on this road map yeah and then because you're giving them you're having them focus on outcomes rather than to do lists they'll come up with their own way to get that result and so they're becoming leaders and they're finding their biggest leverage points right you know and so they're gonna grow the business and themselves in the fastest way possible so I think this is a really great map and something I also want to share his life in the start you're kind of like when you were when you were saying everybody was pulling at you yeah and the start so a lot of people are like as a business owner you feel like you have to be doing everything yourself yeah except ultimately when the business grows to a certain level you want it so the business can run without you right and it's not because you're lazy and you don't want to do it it's so it's a real business well right and if you're sick you know like I was and I literally couldn't make content for a month yeah you know or if I'm going through like something you mope like somebody in the family died right where some emotional thing is happening I can't make content because I my energy is low the people who are watching is like Kazi why are you so sad right and I'm like but yeah well don't you understand what's going on in my life exactly like it's wrong with you and so then yeah there I'm I'm retaliating at that your defense I'm on defense and then it's creating like a hate relationship yeah then it's draining me every time I'm doing something that resentment right what is and then it starts building resentment and so basically you were you know here and you had all these other people around you who were who were kind of pulling on you yeah you know who were kind of pulling on you and this is the business in the start you know and if you any of you guys follow al Scharffen he talks about different levels of the business so you have between zero to $40,000 a year he calls it the seeker you're kind of just figuring things out between 40 to $100,000 in a year a year I believe he calls that promoter okay then there's one hundred and hundred to three hundred thousand dollars a year and then three hundred thousand to a million dollars a year where he's like you really need to pull yourself out of the business so you can work on the business rather than within the business right so ultimately what you want to be is like instead of all these people pulling on you you want to take yourself out of it and kind of be a person who's here and providing guidance to everybody when they need it but not like being being a bottleneck right so these people could work synergistically with themselves and the business could grow you know every day right right in their their incentive invested on growing it without you yes does it mean that you're not there for them that you're not gonna help them right but yeah like if you do everything chances are you doing everything at 20% of your capacity yes and that's poor yes in we've all been there but anybody who's working within their strengths that has eighty or a hundred percent of their capacity is gonna crush you at doing the house shoe and really it's more about if you're a business it's about consistency yes if you produce content it's not one great piece of content it's that drip of content where license they might see once but then they can expect you write like Rogan every week like a row dude he's a machine but he's built their reputation so service consistency matters everything is all about consistency yeah and if it relies on you chances are you're gonna screw up yes eventually yes or are you gonna just become miserable and become resentful different personality types exactly and so Rogen's personality type you know he's done taekwondo um he's done black belt in taekwondo jiujitsu i believe black belt and a lot of different types of martial arts and those really teach you that discipline to be able to work everyday without seeing any results right at all yep like YouTube you still see growth yeah business you still Steve Revenue all right members coming in a lot of these things you don't see any result like you don't know whether your skill has improved in writing but you're just doing it every freaking day and then that personality type and that discipline type carries over into something even like podcasts yeah you can do it every day whereas I will do it and I will be obsessed but then I'm like I want to do something different and impact people in a different way right so I don't see myself as being a good person who will be consistent over like forever every week yeah like that that literally makes me anxious me too I I mean I need to have the freedom to create yes and maybe it's new things Rogen's interesting because he's built this podcast around being authentically himself no matter what right and I think that allows him to do it every day as frequently as he can where it does yeah when people are doing things that kind of have them shrink down to somebody they're not yeah because they're afraid of like how other people might perceive them of protecting a brand that they might work for yeah then yeah you're not gonna be able to do that all the time it kind of song he's gonna end up kind of like shrinking down rather than you being yourself right right yeah let me ask you so if you have that personality to where you want to change things and you say you work in obsessive cycles rather than like just one thing over and over again because you get bored how did you work on your body because body is something that takes discipline and like it's slow process and it requires consistency is like the most important thing for it right so you know right now what are you at eight or nine percent body fat yeah like eight Jesus that's that's incredible for anybody doesn't know about it eight percent is like you know super athlete levels so like how did you get to that and you know work on your body and have you know have the body that you've always wanted how did that happen so I was 30 pounds heavier than I am today when I found CrossFit I saw a picture of myself at my bachelor party in Miami in a pool shirt off and I was like what is going on here this is uh eight years ago in 2011 okay and I was wondering I'm like well why I'm spending two hours in the gym a day and this is before a CrossFit okay um what's going on it's not working this because I was doing the same thing over and over again so I can just describe what your body look like um I'll give you a picture okay plaster on here okay um and I wasn't happy I'm like why I have to do something drastically different so I joined CrossFit for the first time and it blew me away fell in love with it ever since now the mistake I made was being a tyrant to myself and I got really into CrossFit but I produced outcomes by kind of not loving myself and just beating the hell out of myself yeah and I became addicted to that and I saw resulting I know a thing or two about that yeah and this is physical this is via work this is anything um you know it's kind of like you're you're growing as a human being so I'm very similar to you where you would throw your back against the wall every time and then dig your way up in there there's some it's it's an addiction and it produces an outcome and usually a positive one but there's usually a cost down the road yeah now with CrossFit the same thing I would go six or seven days a week I was obsessed I'll just crush myself and as I learned more and as I opened my own gym and started seeing how it was that thing you said it's like pain I'm going to the gym and trying to like pay for your sins or something atone for your sins or just you know beat yourself up I love go to the dark place I see so many people doing that in again I use results so it's not bad it's better than nothing but from okay so in 2011 you saw that picture of yourself yeah and you were going in the gym at that time but you weren't getting the results you wanted and so after that you started beating yourself up so going to the gym not getting the results I wanted and like the Globo gym before cross but I signed up for CrossFit and I was just obsessed and within six months I lost thirty pounds I was ripped I I started eating like just meat and vegetables and in fat so I found a way to like hack the system get really lean feel really good but it was kind of like almost pathological where I wouldn't ever have like a bit of ice cream or I wouldn't do this and I went way extreme on the other end and then you know I was beating myself up in the gym just doing more work for because I thought more was better right now get better results if I just did more work as I learned more I started realizing like you can do this very intelligently and make it very sustainable and produce bigger and better outcomes with less suffering mmm yeah and when I realized that I had to teach other people that in but it's a very natural thing for people to want to work longer hours of work harder to get more results just like I was sharing with you where I'm like I don't feel good when I work less and make more money and right it doesn't sit well with me yeah yeah no there's absolutely nothing wrong with that correct yeah so we see it all the time play out now in the gym and like people doing competitor's programming thinking more is better the equation I use is if you create this to like the real world and in working it would be like working 52 hours a week let's say for 70 grand and then compare that to working 25 hours a week for let's say 65 grand yes so you're working well more than half the amount yeah for almost the same outcome and it's probably more sustainable it's a healthier thing yes you yeah and it's not pathological and it's not being artificially held up by your will yes like just like brute force like I'm just gonna come in and crush myself every day yes so you know you're yes you're making five grand more but is that five Britain worth you know 22 more hours per week probably not you can you can take that 22 hours a week and probably make another 40 50 grand yes you know what I mean so teaching people that in Fitness it's very important teaching people that an entrepreneurship is very important as well it's the same lesson you can work hard but if you work smart and hard and then figure out how to work less you can yield bigger and better outcomes if your strategic enough right yes and if you're informed yes 100% and so for you once you kind of have that realization you it took you six months from 20 and 2011 things changed for you yeah I'm kind of like body changed completely in six months yeah so 2011 going into 2012 Wow yeah and then from there you started teaching this to people yeah oh yeah I was obsessed I'm like I have to share this this is this is what the world yeah trying to think of the date so if I got married in 2011 yeah it had to be 2011 it's favored 1 2010 2011 Wow for me it was very similar with coding where I felt like I found a path yeah because I was like coding and I started generating a high five six figure or like a low six figure income with coding yeah without a degree right and I found it I learned it in a very simple way where people were like teaching you that people all over the internet are like you need this much math and otherwise don't even think about coding right and it was like that was a lie so many lies box I think drew yeah there's a box and like 30 years of experience before you can even think about making more than like 40 bucks an hour it was just like crazy lies or like limitations not even lies probably just limitations and I was like no there's like a much easier way I kind of got lucky finding it out yeah but whatever it's freaking awesome and I just want to share it yeah and then I got started on that path and I was like yeah like wanting to share and now I want to make it much bigger than myself yeah you know so that's kind of and what year was that when you first figured it out twenty 2016 was where I kind of figured it out and 2017 like start was where I started the business right you know yeah so the business is really like one and a half year old I would say yeah that's awesome so I think people inside of the box don't know they're inside of the box yes and to them it's just like there's no shortcuts you just have to work hard logically here's the checklist go after it yes problem is I don't live in the box yes my brain doesn't operate there and when I'm there I'm miserable yes and I live on the fringes of the box and far outside the box yeah and I see things that other people don't see because of it yeah and it's not a shortcut it's a different way yes um so my brother cuz other people might see things you don't see either they when they're thinking logically it's like whoa I'd never thought about this for that I or I overlook certain things right right right but to be able to see things from outside of the box sometimes it's viewed as lazy yeah sometimes it's viewed as being unrealistic that's it lazier programmers are the best programmers yeah because it's like you're finding efficient ways to do what other people are doing it's again working more hours for the same outcome yeah why would you do that yeah if there's a different way and it might not be a way that people relate to yeah but that's like do you really think Richard Branson is working more hours than you right that why he's a multi de línea right the guy runs like 50 companies I think like some ridiculous numbers and a Elon Musk is like doing all this stuff like you really think he's working more they're like he's just doing more hyper efficient yeah like there and I think outside of the box yeah and they know how to leverage resources and people and bright ideas yeah and the world needs both cuz again if you're outside of the box sometimes you can't make things happen in reality yes but if you're in reality sometimes you're never gonna create beautiful new things because you're just doing the same thing right yeah and so that's why the best thing you can do with your time or to grow up business I feel like is to master yourself and master and then start understanding other people yeah you know never give the best leverage point you can ever lead anybody until you understand who you are otherwise it's literally just guessing right yeah yeah beautiful so know thyself I guess know thyself yes the number one thing that everybody needs to do boom there you have it any parting words or you think we covered good ground I think we covered a lot of ground we get help me sit here for another four hours and talk easy Sun is going down in Geelong oh yeah but yeah it's it's been amazing I'm sure we're gonna continue this conversation yeah outside of it yeah one parting thing that I'll leave you guys with the ancient Greeks there were seven sages that created hundreds of Maxim's or words to live by beautiful things above the pillars of the Oracle of Delphi there was only two things inscribed above the pillars number one was know thyself number two nothing in excess so if you can follow those two rules you can save yourself in the world from unnecessary suffering beautiful well that was awesome awesome thank you man I really appreciate it no this was incredible thank you for coming on here and you know spending this time I really appreciate it and I hope you guys appreciate it well that's it guys for this video as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video yeah you
