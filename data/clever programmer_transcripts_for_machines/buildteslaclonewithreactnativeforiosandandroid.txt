morning everybody hope you guys are doing great we are back yet again with an amazing clone the tesla app clone welcome welcome everybody we are building the tesla app clone using react near that's correct as you guys can see what do we have here well we got the tesla app clone right here this is the app that i actually use and you can scroll through it it's using react native so you can use this on android on ios pretty much everywhere right you can go through it feels like it's actually buttons you know it's got everything right i can click to unlock click to lock most importantly what you'll be learning today is how to take an application and turn it into a native application right that is one of the hardest things to do so like i said this is the reactive and the react native clone the world building as you can see the way it kind of works is pretty simple right well it's kind of like any react.js project you have your app.js project hello hello welcome everybody good to see you here i see a lot of comments now at this point going going forward beautiful what's up what's up what's up usa usa yes yes yes yes yes why manual with the car menu over the car because that's how the actual tesla clone uh the tesla app works if you guys go check out the tesla app that's how it works in real life that's right thank you thank you family thank you i appreciate it my friend appreciate it appreciate it so guys this is like any other reactions applications you guys can see right we have our app.js which is right here okay which is right here and of course you know it has a view now instead of using something called divs we use views everybody view view and so forth okay now uh just like in every ids you can also import components you guys can see so i have my component called card item and this card item right here is basically all of this this is the card item you guys can see right here right that's the whole application that's inside that so if i click on the index.js for it as you can see we have all these different views right touchable views images and of course then we have like scroll view so this scroll view right here is what allows us to scroll through this application like it like like you see right here okay and this is yes this is live everybody if you guys are one this is live there's a reason why there's a red check mark there's a red circle around it guys i'm excited to believe this because this looks amazing how good does this look you know like the it feels like especially later on i can go ahead and download this that's right i can download this application and actually use it for example this is my uh you know you guys can see this is my little code right here i simply scan it with my phone i open this up and check this out guys if you guys can see this but i use it on my native application phone let me see here boom right here boom just like that yes there is yes that is really cool and i love it exactly right so let's go and get started guys how does an react native app works well pretty pretty simple right well it is react gs but of course we need to be able to run this with you know a native in in in in native environment can you react around the windows yes you can use react native on windows as well ryan said yes you can yes you can okay right love this thank you thank you thank you so much sabino appreciate it my friend that's right yeah you got it there's a lot more coming guys a lot more coming a beautiful so clearly this is just a ui but later on we'll definitely expand at some point right now the ui and this ui in itself is not easy to build so we'll make sure just to make sure how do we build some of this using right now because it's completely different than any other application right so first things first that we need to do is actually have a get started page here for you guys you guys can see and it all just starts off from this right here expo init awesome project i mean we're not going to call awesome project but you guys have to make sure to install uh expo cli if you guys don't have that so make sure you guys have that installed all right and then we'll do exponent so let's go and open up terminal i will go ahead and open up my application right here i want to see the comments from you guys right here i want to be able to see all the comments thank you everybody hi guys hello hello i know the dark guy is really good at decorating very good really good i agree i will open up my folder here and i have a projects folder and inside here my awesome project and then i'm going to do a new folder called react native react native project native project native boom and so forth okay inside that i will right click and right click services terminal at folder open this up zoom in for you guys so you guys can see it beautiful sweet and the first thing is first we need to do is expo init right and let's go and export it and we'll say expo it and we'll init with a uh tesla let's just say tesla app that's right we'll call the tesla app that's right and of course guys if you guys are liking this videos go ahead and like this video subscribe for more videos like this we have a lot more videos coming forward to you so like this video let's get this video guys 2 to 500 likes can we get to 500 likes we're currently at 200 let's get to 500 likes that would be amazing okay all right let's go select the blank project just blank project right here that's all you need let's hit enter on that one it's installing all the packages now and that's all you need at this point okay like the blame project and of course guys you know if you want to learn more things like this how to build applications using reactgs you know profile javascript is gonna be your number one program number one course to take you there we have the link down below in the description as well all right if you guys are interested beautiful that's going to continue on i see a lot of people someone says i was waiting for the stream for a long time you got it well it's here it's here now beautiful thank you thank you so much love so much love a dark mode i love dark mode as well i agree hi guys superb thank you thank you beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful awesome sweet so that's it pretty much all we need to do now is the following so i will go ahead i need to remove this portion this portion and now i go actually going to open this up in my little terminal right here oh right there i'm gonna open this up right here in one second one second yes okay good there we go okay i can still see all your comments here beautiful night guys guys now for us to get started i'm gonna close this out let's gonna open up a new folder file this code so file new window for vs code it's gonna be right here i'm gonna open this up right here and let's go to our project so let's go to react native project the tesla app and let's open this one up okay just like that okay beautiful and then what you want to do is right click open an integrated terminal that's all you need to do and for us to get started you simply just need to say yarn on start okay let's see what happens now it will probably yes yes yes new port a and it opens up in this little window you guys can see right here this is the window we we're gonna use okay right here that's it pretty much now for this window i will go ahead and take this window and i will actually put this window put this window into my little little thing above here so i have a little corner it's right here okay this is my current project this is my new project right here and now we'll go ahead and run an ios simulator let's see what happens attempting to open yes yes now yes guys it did completely erase the other application it's okay right you see the other app was here before uh but that is okay not a problem so now of course guys for those of you who are on mac you do need uh to install xcode very very important those of you who are on windows you can simply just use android so if you're on windows if you just simply select android right here that's so new so it's like run an android device emulator that's all you need for this one okay beautiful that's it that's right bitcoin tesla is amazing this is amazing it's still building the javascript bundle so give it some time yeah the tesla like native applications that usually take a little longer to build guys than the normal applications but that's completely fine that's not a big issue here okay beautiful and just for safety brushes you see i did save the other application we had before i am using this mainly for reference so we can see what we are working on today right right here beautiful beautiful guys have any questions feel free to comment down below i will answer your questions later on after the live after we are done but you know i highly recommend you guys follow along if you guys can just watch this and that's pretty much it guys we have our right there open up at the gs and start working on your app that is right it is pretty much i mean it's not done i was gonna be like peace out see ya uh if you have windows you need to install android studio guys worst case scenario if you don't have android studio nor do you have for example io simulator open up in the web browser and so you can work in a web browser as well so that's one your other option okay or you can just secure scan this barcode using your ios or android device and it will show up on your ios device but you need expo install for that one okay so cool let's go after json let's see what we have right now so this is it guys this is this is it this is app.js is where we are working from okay everybody now inside this application you guys can see what do we have well we have a few things as you can see that thank you so much victor appreciate that my friend says learning a lot from you thank you thank you thank you okay so as you can see we have a text we have a view which you know in regulator is pretty much like a div and all we are doing here this is the text so if i go ahead and remove this i say let's go and i say fire fire like this when i say this let's go fire you see so there you go now flutter is great uh fallout is great as well but regulative has become it's become very popular because it goes directly in native into ios and android so awesome let's go let's go beautiful so to get started guys what we need to figure out is how do we divide this application into multiple pieces right that's always how i start i usually start out with a few things well we've got kind of like this header section right here this header section right here right we have this section that does the the mileage and the status of the car we had the actual car if you actually have a tesla comment down below i'm curious if you have a tesla here anyway anyone has maybe you guys have driven a tesla who knows right this is our tesla logo and we have kind of a few uh controls we can use here you know like the fan the the this is the the key button this is the lock button and and so forth yes thank you thank you thank you appreciate this guys and of course here we have the media and a few other controls that we can use that's right that's right okay let's move forward now the first first i'm gonna i will be working on is i'm gonna create a component just for the car item itself right this whole card item is gonna be a view and i'm going to create this whole component for it and that's pretty much it so to create a component let's go ahead and create a new folder here called components it's a new folder called components boom okay and there you go and the site is comportable creating new folder inside here and called car item or are we called card item i think it's called cart cart yeah no it's car item that's right so we have new folder called card item inside this car item i will create a new file called index.js that's going to be our javascript okay and i'm also going to create a style.js everybody okay this is just a ui that is correct this is just the ui everybody yes i love it thank you so much thank you so much bitcoin i know javascript is insane the crazy stuff you can do with javascript nowadays right yeah it's it's crazy right so initial.js and then uh we're going to create a new file also called styles.js a new file called styles.js boom and done all right so every single you know um component kind of starts out it starts off with the bear structure so in our case it's going to start out with the following okay it's going to be r a f c e right here it's a react arrow function right it's a function component right that's what we need to build here okay so right there so this is our div of course now but we don't use div in the react native we use something called views okay let me go ahead and load this a little bit down so you guys can continue watching with me with this now for this view i'm going to imp i need to import this view actually for my purposes and i don't need to use here to import my view is going to be the following so here i'm going to do see here so we need to import the view from react native so i'll just say like this import right here i say view like let me know if you guys can see this actually from react native thank you so much thank you so much mr tom tanmai that's right that's right so important view from react native amazing okay and what we'll do is we'll just import this view like this view and we'll close it out with the view over here as well just like in any other react.js app project and at that point i need to import this into our app.js okay and to do that all we'll do is the phone will do import and i will say car item from from what i'm gonna do that slash you can see here i have different things i can do components and then slash what car item and i can do that index but because we're using index we don't actually specify index but i mean i'll do it anyways it's okay that's it first time yeah that's right first time right now that's amazing yeah yeah yeah yeah beautiful okay and then what we'll do is we need to go ahead and what use this now so i will do like this so car item that's how we use any you know components and it says now error object you likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined and that's correct so if i go to nxgs i have to it's not there where's our oh we put our fast that's so funny we put our whole component into the style.js that's not correct we should put that into our index.js case okay there we go much better and now we'll call this call this uh car item save it beautiful it says uh expected a class book undefined that's okay don't worry don't worry and i will simply call it call this let's go beautiful beautiful now uh looks like it's still not working the way it should be that's totally fine so i will go to app.js car item looks like i'm importing my car item correctly from the components folder looks like that should be all good let me see if that's something wrong it's on my side closed car item i need to export default i think is what i need to do i need to export default right here save that default so i have my here i'm gonna do like this here i'm gonna say export default right car item boom and i'm gonna define my const here boom textures must be rendered within the text that's right and if i want to use a text now string like this i say text boom right so you cannot just put text just as is you have to use a text you know a text view now do the text you have to import it here as well every single time so this is where it gets a little bit different guys and here we have let's go you know in our new component okay right so for this specific portion guys the way kind of voices views are generally like divs and our text is like whenever you have a text you have to surround it with a text little uh text about a text component that comes with react native because remember a native is very different from like you're simply uh online you know web components right very very very different okay that's right okay now so that's that's portion is done let's go ahead and actually convert that and now start building our actual view and the first thing that we have is going to be what well the first thing we have is going to be i want to talk about the actual header so let's go to you here another view i'll be called the header so i'll say view view and this will be for the header so i'm going to comment like this header and i'm going to put into comments this can be the header okay guys beautiful awesome now in this header of course in this header guys right well a few things are gonna happen if you take a look at what do we have well we have what do we have this section we have this section and we have this section we have a cog wheel which is for settings right which is a icon we have this model three and then we have you know like kind of like a surprise is what they call it i'm not sure what that what i actually calls but in here i'm gonna put some text in here just so you guys see it okay and then we'll convert this into use an actual like font you know uh to use it to use actual icons so inside here i want to say here settings okay then i will say here i'm gonna call this the nas mobile okay don't judge me i'm gonna close the nas mobile that's right that's right i'm gonna call this the nas mobile the nas mobile and then there's another one called surprise i know i like it too surprise beautiful save that a beautiful now now we just started with the styles okay so we need to give some styles for this specific project now how do we create styles styles are actually created inside the styles.js guys right and so the way you'll do that is you actually need to import a style sheet so we'll do import here import and you need to import a style sheet that comes from react native from react native right so we'll say here style sheet style sheet like this okay and it's gonna come directly from react native right there see it's already done for you okay next thing we'll do is i'll do const styles is equal to i'm gonna say style sheet right style sheet dot create and boom and this is gonna be our style sheet now you might remind you something called style components guys that's what it might remind you off honestly right if you want to really think about it yeah that's kind of how i think about it sometimes honestly but you know it's all right now we have the style sheet container which is right here you see how they do it inside uh the main project we're going to simply delete that we don't need that anymore or what we can do is simply say yeah well that's fine you can still keep it access not not the biggest deal right so for our starship for the car container what we need to do is create a car container you know uh style okay let's go back to our gs and let's do here car container right and so forth and this is going to be this whole carton which is this whole container correct guys and we need to give it a width of 100 percent and actually yeah width of a hundred percent right here and we need to give it a height height of a hundred percent as well that's right that's right hey let's go and since we've given this card container a style but we need to actually give it a class i mean set a class tool right so if i say go to view instead of saying hey view class you know class name whatever you usually call it you have to say you know style equals so we'll say here style style equals something but what is it you might be asking well we need to import our style sheet so we'll say import styles styles from from what styles you see directly from here everybody guys then we say here style is equal to styles dot car no styles dot car container right here car container car container save that boom right now this is a style now if i give it for support like um let's just say a background color if i give it a background color here let's just say maybe it's like um let's see black does not oh it does not work actually because we did not export the styles everybody right so we need to export the styles as well so you need to go here into export default default i need to say styles boom save that hey you can see right there right that's about a color black if you wanted to you could do orange if you wanted to that's the no whatever you want orange save that hey we go see and so then we have our for example our nas and uh surprise all in there everybody guys see that see that okay opponent's header mate yeah that's right the third point the header the main and the list above that's a good one that's a good one okay this is the make your point that's correct this is the main component victory guys that's right beautiful so what is the next thing that we need to con to create we've got this view i'm going to also give it a style and that's going to be the header right so the actual header right i'm going to say styles style is equal to what styles dot header right the way the way you were literally just grabbing the styles is we're referencing back from what from the styles that's in here going into the side here and then checking up these styles right here right and i have it very careful because styles and react native are a little bit different styles in like react.js or on the web guys that's right good good good good good so flex one i'll i'll tell you guys about flex one later on don't worry all right now styles ahead let's create our style for the header right here i'm gonna say here comma i'm gonna say header all right continue one and for the header well a few things we need to do you see how there's a lot of likes because we had this notch you know we have to really push down this whole this whole little uh you know uh container using m margin so what i want to do is i'll say margin top boom and it's a margin top of 50. now i don't see 50 pixels here because it's a little bit different here in rec native instead you just say 50. header see here does it work styles that header margin top 50. i did that okay good so i just need to save it so styles the header great marta 50. okay awesome next thing we need to do is i'm going to give it a margin left 20 as well so we'll say margin left get some spacing on the left side as well of 20. again might be very different because we don't have pixels here okay save that that put pushes it a little bit on the side right here boom and then we have the what we're gonna give it a margin right of 20 as well good good awesome okay now at this point i'd be wondering okay well nas that's awesome what do we do with these icons but before we go into icons guys i want to figure out how do we put these settings you know from left to right if you remember guys we have something called display flex that's correct right one of the best things in the world display flex right for us right in order for us to go you know to flex it in a direction like this we say what flex direction row so that's exactly what we need to do if i go back to here i'm going to say the following i'm going to say here header comma flex direction is gonna be row check this out row save that you see now it goes from left to right which is exactly what we want if we look at our actual application you see right here from left to the door so it goes three div items left to right you guys see that great awesome the next thing we need to do is after that we need to go ahead and space these things out and if you don't if you know the way to space things out we say what we say justify content what just like content we say space between it's gonna push things to the side as much as possible okay so if i see here space between why not flex direction horizontal because that's not a that is not a a property that we can use that's not a value that it does not exist in flex direction it's only a row or column if i do space we can check this out guys between save it and boom you see it pushes into the side right away okay okay next thing we need to do is i'm going to push put these vertically aligned item center like this i'm gonna say align items center boom good oh items there we go now let's talk about um well these little cog wheels or you know the little icons right because where do we get these icons that we have right here and honestly they came from one place and we're gonna use something called font awesome anybody here here you have used font awesome if you guys use pandas and let me know i'm really curious okay but for us to use font awesome we'll go back to our page we'll go back to yes there's a live video but you guys will be able to find it later on don't worry and we'll say font awesome for react native guys like this okay we identified awesome you want to click on that scroll down go to api docs right here and there we go it shows exactly what you need to install for everything to work and then it's pretty much just follow the instructions right i'm going to copy this npm install the reactive svg so i will do that right now i will open my terminal here i will click plus you guys can see right there click plus and i will do mpm install react native svg my friends beautiful very creative not indeed very creative indeed not just dev what's up so beautiful beautiful beautiful i love it i love it i love it so by building this application right here guys tesla app clone okay okay okay okay what's up not just there how you doing my friend we got hazam what's up how you doing my friend good good good good good good i love it guys okay i love it let's keep going keep going it's going to install it of course guys i want to remind you guys subscribe like for more videos like this of course let's get this out to oh damn look looks like we got an error oh that's okay that's not a big deal if you guys want to see more content go out go ahead and give us a like guys let's see how many likes are we at this point i think we're at pretty good one to think we have about 286 guys 500 is the gold 500 we can do it let's go next one is install this one and then install fort fort awesome it's so funny how they called it ford awesome okay install that one this could be our next project yes you can go back and watch it from the first minute that's correct yes you can not be found that's okay it says radio cannot be found now for some reason oh no it's so weird okay all good let's go back to here let's call svg icons something happened with the react native portion it's okay fuji icons scroll all the way down to install the other one nice 300 susa let's go beautiful beautiful thank you everybody i love it nice okay and then finally the last time we need to we need to install is going to be this one really native font awesome this one right here nice nice nice beautiful okay so now we've got these specific uh you know uh files it's all inside inside no modules i think i'll have to just simply refresh because i feel like it just needs to refresh or restart the app i feel like let me see here publish or republish the project to restart the app let me see here let me go back to my problem terminal back to my node here stopping server it's okay sometimes you might have this where it's like you know you just installed a new uh a new and you know module and so it will just crap out of you as well that's what i'll call it that's okay sometimes it just happens okay so for us to be able to clear this out i'm gonna create a new terminal and i will do yarn start again here yarn start one more time to make sure it's all good nice yes it's going to continue on sometimes that that will happen when you guys like could maybe create a new uh what's it called you know is it what is it called one let me see here what you can think this usually means regulator is not installed really and what the hell really interesting and react native is not installed what happened there npm install react native hmm i see here guys no that should be actually the yarn start that's interesting yes let's see let's see what goes on here i will say sometimes it can be a little bit tricky expo start cli again it usually means right now is not installed without dependency pocket.json okay let me see if i got json here seems to be all good honestly seems to be all good i don't see why this would not be working but seem to go back to here look at the json log i mean i could do uninstall again let's see here make sure it's all good let's see that's so good because i installed a icon library here and that's all it did to me was uninstall react native it looks like which is i think was weird i don't have to have it had to happen before well that's coding for you guys a lot of fun yeah i might just reinstall the no modules you're right on that one i might just do that right now oh good okay so okay so install again that's now the yarn start let's see what will happen again yes please work please work please work please okay that's working okay good let's do run an ios simulator let's see if that'll work attempt to open and is it working okay it's building it's building it's working let's go beautiful thank god we have solved i'm not sure what happened there but that was weird i will tell you that that was weird okay young cash clean do the trick okay thank you you guys are so helpful you guys are amazing very helpful everybody so okay we've got this portion okay the header is all good now to go ahead and now use icons we can just find awesome icons for this everybody okay so check this out guys if i go ahead and i go to my font awesome here on awesome.com you know for example the gear icon you see the gear cog icon that we need to install right here on the left portion i'm going to install this little bit bigger boom icons and here i'm going to say the following i'm going to say um cog right here there we go got the cogwheel right here and the way the way we would do it if you scroll down right here on the right hand side you guys will see that to use the icon when you use font awesome icon and you need to import it so you import the font awesome icon like this right here right there as you guys can see and then you actually import the icon itself so that's what we'll do i'll do command c here i will import the icon right here boom that's what we use and then we'll import the actual icon as well now we're going to use fa coffee that's now we're trying to import here but we will use something else so here a copy okay we imported that portion no problem we will use fa cog now you can see here we cannot just say facog okay that's not how it is instead i'm going to use fa like this f a f a like this f a cog like this oh f a boom save that and so now for me to use it if you scroll down you see i can use it just like this right here boom right there beautiful and i simply just say i go to settings here i remove these settings and i paste it in oops not what i want paste it in like this okay and then for the icon i just simply say the following i say effe save it let's see oh you guys see what i'm talking about here there we go that's what i'm talking about okay so that's the next thing the next one we need to work on is gonna be the surprise the surprise one okay that's the next one i'll work on let's go same thing and that's gonna be um i'm gonna call it the not surprise it's like um it's like a box okay it's like a box right here so dennis can you try into import definition as icon from path you could but we're using find us on we're just trying to make it as easy as possible for everybody you know what i mean well you definitely could i don't see why not expo icons that's actually a good suggestion that's actually i will check it out next time for sure good suggestion for sure for sure for sure okay i'm gonna actually go to my little thing above here right now guys let me ask you this question what do you think we should be working on next what do you guys think what do you guys think i just switched my little icon here right here you guys like it there you go let go much better okay right so what do you guys think we should be working on next well again let me get that other icon i'm gonna call the box icon i'll call the box icon or toolbox maybe f a toolbox no no no no no let me see there's our toolbox here two box oh there is right there two box that's the one that's right so f a toolbox beautiful okay i like that one i like that so if i just simply import here i go to import comma fa tool box save right let's do the same thing situation here command c command v everybody and we'll say fa toolbox save that and we have it icon not found for icon is equal to i think i know why because it's not tool box with a capital b so with a with a small case b right here boom save that hey let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful all right next thing i'm gonna change up this nosmobile to be a little bit different okay i used something called screen brush guys if you guys are wondering what app i use for drawing i usually go screen brush everybody okay okay all right now for us we need to change the header let's change the header styles a little bit here and i just want to change out the colors and honestly that's that's that's pretty much it that's all i want to do so i'm going to give the header title so i'm going to give this a class as well so i'm going to say here style is equal to like this styles dot header boom that header the header title header title save that beautiful right so we need to give this a its own little class right here and for this one i'm going to say now comma let's go back to our css now we'll say comma a header tile maybe remove let's just add to the bottom i will say header title okay and what is it going to be well for once it's a color of white so we'll say color for the text color of white okay nice then we have a font size of 16 of 16 comma and then we have what i'm going to change up the font size is 16 so it's a little bit bigger i'm going to give it also a a font way bold boom bold uh string always in the string okay nice beautiful oh you cannot put that one huh that's funny okay nice good technology stalker i like that's an interesting name so next time we have we have we need to go and align this vertical horizontally so i'm going to say here what a line item center for this one center and i want to center in vertically and horizontally center i'm gonna justify content center as well boom okay now it's not fully centered just yet you might see that right here well it kind of is though actually it is pretty much centered i don't see why not yeah that's pretty much centered next i want to do is i want to give uh this cog wheel and these icons a little bit more of a size so to give a this font awesome icon the size all you need to do is specify just the size so here i'm going to say here size is equal to 24 boom save that see right away bigger and i think of this one size is equal to 24. veinte quatco is that right in spanish i think so okay beautiful all right guys we got that portion i love it um i want to change up these now colors you see how it's currently like a black color when i want to change this up to a white color because if i scroll back white color you guys can see it right here exactly got it nice right so to make that happen what are we going to do very simple give it a what e style everybody let's go ahead and go to styles.js i'll do the same thing here and i'm going to say here the i'm going to call this the icon yeah why not just i'll just call the icon so i'm gonna say style here style is equal to styles dot icon now i send icon playlist for android icon right here okay same thing goes with the other one so i'm gonna say styles styles dot no style is equal to down with the icon icon awesome sweet save that command s on that one okay and then what what will i do well i will simply go back to app.js okay and actually no style to yes and let's say here i'm gonna say here what icon boom and for this i can always say is the color i'll just say color it's going to be white that's it guys save that hey now it's white color the next thing i want to work on is they're going to be the background okay the background's gonna be awesome uh because it has like actually we made a special background so that it mimics the actual application because if you look at the application let me show you right this is the actual app i know it's crazy this is the actual app right here right it's crazy you might see it maybe you don't let me see maybe it will uh come on focus right here right so we need to be able to build this as this right here okay and we have something called for you at the bottom down description guys we have for you the assets we have a background and then we have for you like a battery icon okay so if you go down the description you will have a google drive folder like this and all you need to do you will control it it will literally just be like this right here and it has assets and there's one more thing inside here which you will later on see it's called items.gs which is important for our menu okay so it's actually pretty interesting so ryan said will this actually work as a test lab so it's impossible for you to create a fullon tesla clone because of course their code is very hidden and in order to be able to access their code you have to be able to one i know i mean it's it's pretty crazy so this is simply just like a view of what you can do right but of course we're not building an actual tesla where you can use it for your own tesla you know car if you have one that's that's downright to say right now is pretty much impossible pretty much impossible guys right that's just that's how it is i mean they want to protect their cars you know it makes sense so what do you guys want to do you want to download this whole folder tesla clone assets like we call it again it's down down below in the description guys it's going to be zipping up the file for me right here beautiful good good good good beautiful so then at that point what i want to do is open this one up nice and get the tesla clone assets right here everybody see that yeah right there beautiful tesla clone assets all you want to do you can see we played around with just trying to do two sensors or something no no this is this is not connected sensors guys at all though that would be cool right now in terms of assets right here you guys can see we have all these little assets in terms of png icons but i want you what i want you guys to do is take this background and this battery and just move them into the asset folder that's it just move them to the access folder for now and the items that yes since you're here already feel free to move well don't worry don't worry about that is the gs just yet okay that will come later on guys so that's it everybody got that little link let me know down below you got that link guys that'll be awesome and that's it now to create the background image right all you got to do is let's go back to nsfgs and there's something called the background like it's actually just called a background image inside um you know tesla inside of react native so i'm going to say image background and again you need to import this from the view i'm gonna say image background like this okay save that and now we'll do is default i'm gonna say here to do i'm to say image background background like this right and of course it has a source and it also has a style which we're going to give it as well so for the style i'm going to say it's going to be styles.background image the background style the background image that's right if tesla exposed the api maybe then maybe we can use that that would be cool if i did you guys should talk to them i'm gonna close this out right here for the source we need to actually give it a source now right now for the source we need to require an image so we're going to do is i'm going to say require here okay and inside require you i'm going to say require and requires basically we're bringing in our actual you know um our actual image so kind of like this now i need to use dot dot slash because i'm trying to get out you see i'm currently inside the index.js for me to get out of index.js i have to go back up to cart item right here then from there i need to go back into components folder and then from there to go back into the assets folder so i need to back out of my folder two times that's how we navigate you know folders and do dot slash then dot dot slash again and that now you see i'm inside here which lies into this slash what i can say now slash background background dot uh png save that let's see it says undefined what undefined uh define undefined is not an object it's okay to find a nonobject a source it does seem to be all good let me see here i got the png it looks like the beat that's all good i got um things to style now let me see what if i remove this certain portion that work okay that works okay it's okay let's see let's go back to here i think i think because it requires a width slash height so we need to go back into our styles for the image background and give it a width and a height okay so let's do background image let's go to background background image inside our styles i will say here comma background not color by image oh i'm going to say here width of a hundred percent boom boom and then when i say height of 100 as well ikea's giving me the the semicolon because it thinks it's css but it's not save that there we go so there you go guys this is our image i mean look how good is that by the way yes we created just for you that's right that's right we did so that's a pretty sick looking image honestly yeah i agree with that and of course you know to make this image look even better we can resize this because sometimes for example maybe you have a bigger display right and you want to resize this maybe a little bit better so you can use like resize mode resize mode and you use reset mode of what or for example like cover cover right cover save that and then now here's the issue now because this you see the thing is now is this yes this is hidden and now our text is gone if you guys can see our nsl gs you can see the art text has nowhere to be found this one why because it's actually all the way down below somewhere over there okay it's somewhere like over there and because this this whole background image is covering it you see guys now to make this not be like that we position it absolutely so that it's underneath it's actually underneath the whole thing okay underneath the whole you know it's a it's actually is viewed as a background image so for example let me show you if i go to our styles and i say here position it's kind of like you position absolutely position in the web as well same situation remember it will take its own div out of context and put it behind everything else or position absolutely to some sort of a div right save it boom you see now this right away came because why these things have structure but when you position absolute something it has no structure anymore it just almost like clings on to something and that's pretty much it that's kind of how you want to think about it that's right thank you we got to 1 million subscribers so guys give this a like guys would really much appreciate this for the million subscribers guys we worked really hard and we still are working really hard to continue giving you guys as much value as possible so if you guys would like that would be much appreciated all right let's assure this youtube algorithm and uh yeah because you know sometimes youtube algorithm is just not good sometimes it's good sometimes it's not depending on the date but yeah but we want to just yeah thank you guys all right so that's all good it's looking much better already next thing i want to work on is going to be this right here 150 miles and parked okay so let's do that okay now what's next so for us is going to be is going to be we've got the header i like that and let's work on the the actual like the the battery thing right so battery section i call it the battery section that's right oh come on so let's walk in the battery section let's go ahead and create a new view here i'm going to say view number views like divs style and i'm going to give it a style of styles dot battery i know section boom okay okay save that is that our better section what does it consist of well it consists of one an image right here and then a some text correct so just how we're gonna do the same thing to use an image we need to import our image so i'm gonna say here view text image background comma image right here we cannot just say mimg that's for web guys remember that okay so inside here i'm going to say here image image and we'll say again also the source source is equal to what source is equal to what well require good awesome require what well let's go back to our you know folder of assets again dot dot slash to go back to the you know components folder dot slash so now we're back into the home folder which is you know the whole tesla app folder we can access the components or the assets now and then inside here we can say battery dot png just how we have it inside here battery.png you see that that's right it's a custom battery that was created for you okay let me see here let me see here let's go back now and of course we need to give this one a style as well so i'm gonna say here style is equal to is equal to styles that battery image styles dot battery image boom done done so my friends save that oh yeah that's one big battery guys uh that's a lot that's one big battery thank you so here if you think that yeah thank you that's that's a appreciate that my friend okay styles the battery image that's awesome now inside that then we need to go ahead and do the following we need to go ahead and cr to put the text here so we'll say text text like this text close that one out and the text also has a style style is equal to what is equal to styles battery text oh and we'll say here 150 miles like this boom and it's all the way on the top you see how it's right here this is the whole image again now we need to do um yes a lot of them are yes are going to be images that's correct right so what we need to do to do now is kind of like the following we need to go ahead and replace this and make this image a little bit smaller so let's now go back to styles.js comma and we'll say battery image image and what width and height do we want to use well a few things well we go to our battery image okay i'm gonna give it a height right here height of what 26 comma and then i'm going to give it a width of 70. that's right nice see it's a lot smaller now which is much better and then and that's pretty much it but now on the battery section though right you guys see that we have from left you see how it's kind of top to bottom it's because of flex direction by default every view has display flex on it so we need to set the flex direction from top to bottom to left to right using what flex direction row that's correct let's go back to here right i'm going to say here battery battery section boom i'm going to say here a flex direction boom it's going to be a row i like that save that beautiful okay okay it says if i token comma where is it oh yeah because i need to actually give it a comma right here beautiful and so you can see now it's from left to right from left to right that's correct and for the battery section i'm going to center everything inside here i'm going to send right now so to center horizontal we say justify content center center comma save now it's center you see and then to center vertically we say align item center everybody boom save that awesome now it's centered the way it should be okay next thing let's focus on this battery i'm gonna give this battery a little bit of a margin right better image i'm going to say margin right to push it out a little bit here right i'm going to give it a margin right over let's just say 12. okay just to push it out and now let's focus on the battery text as you can see here if we go back to our what is the gs we have what we have a battery text right here battery text okay i'm going to copy this one go back to styles comma boom battery text nice awesome in the battery text what are we going to do well i'm going to say the color is going to be white comma beautiful right so if i change this up nice color is white i'm going to say the font size is going to be 35 right and you notice how you know in terms of css do i like tail when css somebody asked yes i do it's pretty good actually i used still with css uh you know a few times now and so that's what we actually made a video until when css you guys can go check it out yeah but it's really really good i like it thank you happy you can join as well thank you my friend beautiful next one is it's gonna be font size but then i need to add a font wait for it too so i'm gonna say here font weight font wait is equal to bold boom save nice look at that look at that let's create some spacing above it so i want to create some spacing above this to that i'm going to go down to my header and i'm going to give this a margin bottom right here because i want to push out this whole thing away from this you guys see that let's say margin bottom margin bottom and margin bottom of what 10 pixels yeah i'd like that nice that looks good okay next thing i want to create is gonna be the status of the part status okay uh which is just all it says it just simply just parked okay everybody i'm gonna call it status let's go back to ernesto gs okay beautiful we have a battery text i love it our next one is gonna be and i'm gonna give it a this this is the mileage is that how you spell mileage i think so i don't know i'm gonna say status here and i'm doing this mainly for cleanliness purposes okay and now i'm gonna say view again style is equal to what guys hotel who knows who knows who knows style is equal to styles dot what dot header no not header what is it um status boom okay again this test can be the actual status of like a you know of a state okay do we have right so status and then we'll give this a text component boom and this all this will be is simply just what well let me see here test component i'm gonna call this parked for now save that beautiful awesome okay good good good good let's go back to the gs and let's see what what we've got well we've got this parked thing right here but we need to again we need to make sure that this is a line centered and everything so i'm going to go to comma and say status colon okay what's up amex music what they do my friend good to see you yeah she said ngs i guess yes that's right we are using react native so let's just basically react to yes uh but react native that's exactly what we're using all right let's go back to here i'm going to give this status a color of white because i want everything to be a color white let's see we'll actually change the text no it went i have to change the actual text or me to give this style manually so this won't work because i need to set the color of white on the text itself which means i'm gonna say that style is equal to like not like this is equal to boom styles dot status text okay nice okay somebody said please show me how to hack tesla no you are not hacking tesla and why would you want to okay next one so view okay i just thought that's funny so then let's go back to our view i'm going to say here for the status again we need to align this centered okay guys we need to go ahead and align the center so again what do we use what do we use everybody what do we use who knows we use what well we need align items and justify content but in this case i'm going to say align align items center there you go awesome and now let's focus on the status text like this and for this i'm going to say is the following i'm going to say status text is like that and then i'm going to give it a font size font size of 20 comma color of what white save it boom done and font weight oh bold font weight weight of old everybody okay and there we go we've got our parked tesla model x oh yes that's right that's it so guys guys thank you so much this is what we have so far we have an amazing again we just have views right now okay but i'll show you guys how can we click on some of these things right like how do we click on for example this cog wheel right how do we click on this for example you know this gear icon you know so to do that we use something called and i want to show you this here it's using react native but let me show you here react native um click for example okay it's called touches no no not this one not this one not not this one button example i'll show you here it's called touchable opacity so basically kind of like this right when i press on here you can see it just feels like it's a press and two we need to import something called attachable opacity right here and that's honestly all you need to do let's go back to our touchable opacity so if i go to inside.js if i import touchable opacity right here check this out save that i'm going to put my touchable opacity around these you know image background so let me see uh not around these little font awesome icons let's say touchable opacity touchable opacity closes out and you want to surround this around that cog icon boom boom and boom let's see what happens here and then hey see now it feels like it's a touchable thing you see i click on it and that's what happens to it let's go let's do our next one here zoom oops touchable opacity command x this one nice nice nice command v and that my friends is it save that and go here that's it right so now we have an actual clickable button and later on you guys will learn how to do something on the click of the specific button okay beautiful guy so guys like i said thank you thank you so much i love seeing you guys in the chat i can see a lot of you guys uh will be much appreciated let's go ahead and get to 400 likes guys that'll be so so so so so good somebody had some decided what do you prefer coding designs for functionality i like both i like both designs and functionality to me that's always a lot of fun all right i like both of these things all right so guys hit this hit that like button hit the subscribe button and of course really important guys if those of you who want to take your next level to becoming a reaction developer right and also want to become a developer using javascript right we have an amazing course called profit javascript down below in the description that we've been building we have an amazing community down below so you know we're going to go ahead and check it out click the link below and you'll see what i'm talking about okay let's continue all right beautiful next one we've got that we've got the view i love it the status is good the next thing i want to work on is going to be what well it's this portion it is these controls right here you see these right well next this can be simply this one then i'm going to work on these controls right here okay thank you slim yeah the touch opacity button is amazing i agree with that i agree with that so to work on this one what is it called it is going to be called for us the three icons i call the the the three uh scroll icons or maybe it's called something else i'm not sure so now let's go ahead and give a view and i'm going to give this dumb um the control icons yeah that's what i'm going to call this all right and yeah that's just going to be the name for me okay so it's creating you here here guys like always view beautiful and inside here i'm gonna say here style is equal to styles dot and i'll call it for myself the three icons or i'm gonna say the control controls controls yeah like this okay save that of course there's nothing inside here it's okay so instead we're gonna do is we're gonna create three buttons okay and three buttons gonna be a view and again we have a the our first view is gonna be a button of what like this little fan right here little fan then we have like a key then we have a lock okay so do that view and inside that is going to be very simple we need to add our font awesome guys our font awesome icon so what we're going to do like always we should we use what we do font awesome i'm going to copy this whole thing and paste it into here the font awesome tab it out okay and of course there we go but we need to use something called let me see here so you guys can see let's search for it and it's called fan okay fan right there see fa fan that's all we need to import let's go back let's import fa fan inside here fa fan save that and that's what we're going to use inside this style fa let me see here that's the icon f8 fan fan boom done that's it fafn is most likely done guys yeah the styles icon size of 24 that's exactly what we want to do and now for this view we need to create an icon kind of like circle or button circle so i'm saying style is equal to right i'm say styles and let's call this the controls button right why you'll see why exactly what i'm talking about and we need to create three of them so here one let's do another one two another one three right so there's three now these gear icons of course we use three icons so the other one is going to be a key so let's go back up to here and we say key here okay yo williams how you doing my friend go to key i need to import this on to go fa key from the top so let's do comma fa key like this beautiful and i'm going to this one that's going to use in the next one fa oops key nice beautiful and then finally the last one is going to be what the the lock i guess the lock icon the lock icon yeah i'll call it the lock or the unlock right here lock icon nice so fa lock everybody got it so let's do import and then fa lock that's gonna be our last icon we're gonna use fa lock okay beautiful so that's what we need to do next one we've got the fa lock we've got the fa key we've got the fa fan looking good on that side and now let's go ahead and just simply style them out let's go back to style.js and we need to do is let me see here icon icon border three icons right here now for these specific icons a few things to happen well you see how you do they're currently kind of like this they need to go from column down to row everybody and so for that to happen all we say here is the following we say here um control con see here let's go controls here go controls let's go back to here say controls boom boom and inside the controls inside the controls we do we're going to do flex direction because by default flight direction is column row good save that the network flex direction control con all controls right here right there save that nice okay and then i'm going to say justify content center so it's center horizontally good click content center hey that's what i'm talking about okay and what we need now to focus on is individual buttons in my case and and my key is going to be these the icon board right here okay let me see here so for the actual buttons it's going to be a little bit harder because we need to create a circle around everybody right that's what i need to create so if i go and copy this controls button that's the cell i'm going to use let's go back to my style and i'm going to say controls button right here boom done got it okay it's controls button now for this you see we number one we need to we need to give it like a a little bit of a border but i want to give this pork test i feel like there's like not enough margin here i'm going to give this a lot a lot of margin i feel like so that it will push this whole view down this whole view of controls down right everybody yeah that's what i think that's what i think i need to do so i will that will i will make that happen later on in a second here but for now let's just focus on this portion okay controls button i'm going to get this out of control i'm gonna say border number one i'm gonna give it a border so border uh style of c border width right it's gonna be one pixel okay that's right i'll even margin the top right guys yeah i agree with that one right then i'm gonna say border color color is gonna be white okay save that beautiful then i'll say border style okay that's solid automatically i'm gonna say border now radius order radius is going to go to 50 to 50. nice you see now it's going to become a circle right and i'm going to say well and honestly that's and then for every single border of obviously a little thing i'm going to say um padding padding is now 18 because this will create some spacing inside of it there we go now we've got some a little bit better right here and i'm going to say here margin left margin margin left here left is going to be because i want to create spacing between every single thing or i can do something i'm not sure if gap exists let me see if gap exists here a gap of maybe what 25 pixels not a valid property no it's okay it's okay it's okay so i'm going to say margin margin left of 25 nice there we go see so now it's done this and now for the controls guys we need to add a margin top so you see how it's over the top i'm going to say here let's say margin top and that's going to be 175 everybody let me get a comment here there you go we've got a little buttons okay they're not clickable right now but it's okay so let's make them clickable okay guys okay ready so 50 that's right technology stalker and 20 pixels that's okay we made that round 25. now to make them clickable guys who remembers what i need to do to make them clickable remembers we need to do what touchable opacity again so touchable opacity let's put that around what around the whole view like this touchable opacity on every single view right boom boom save that next one boom come on x tap it out and boom and save that next one touchable opacity boom boom boom good tap it out save that there we go my friends that's it there is no display there's no display i mean i'm not sure if there is a display grid or not that's a good question i'm not sure there's display grid all i know is that we have display flex and react native by default every single view that we see on here like this view this view every single thing is display flex right away so i'm not sure if it's fully you know this display grid or not i don't think so i'm not sure i might be wrong though if you guys know that'd be great that's right that's right that's right so then okay so we got this now look at this if i click on this a and now it feels like an actual button everybody an actual button now one really cool thing that we can do guys okay one little thing we can do because we can change up this button oh i can actually do this that's interesting i can zoom in one thing we can do is change up this right here to this whole thing so that it's actually locked and not unlocked every time i click it so for example if i click on this i want to be able to change it to an unlock button how are we going to do that well to do that what we'll do is is we need to create a state of making sure when is it actually locked not locked so if i go to my here control you see this touchable opacity right let's figure out what is the current state of our lock right well in use day i'm gonna import you stay here from react say use date beautiful save that and inside here i will create the following i will say okay const locked i'm going to create a used call locked set locked boom is equal to use state right what is the current state what is the current state of our lock die a locked icon that's right so i'm going to say use date of maybe a false for now maybe our car is unlocked so i'll say false here okay and we can use that now to actually change something up so for example here's what i'm gonna do inside this font awesome icon faa log i'm actually just gonna simply say a javascript um infidel statements okay so you understand react.js first before watching this live no honestly you can just you watch this live have fun see how regular works i call it as oh you know i call i sprinkle this it's like a sprinkling at you guys i'm kind of putting seeds into your brain that's what i call it right uh it's okay to put seeds into your brain that's okay you know that way you know what to do next time okay boom this is better probably i think right no all right okay cool next one uh what this want to do is the following i will say here icon i'm gonna say if the icon if it's a lot the state is locked question mark this is a shortcut for the if all statement guys the statement is locked i'm going to use the locked icon which is the what the fa lock this one right let me see here i will say i'm gonna use the fa lock icon however otherwise if it's not locked i will use a different icon and the icon i'm gonna use for the unlocked one is gonna be let me see here make sure i get it fully it's going to be the total make sure i got it it's going to be the fa unlock alternative right here command c you guys want to go ahead and import this it's a little bit bigger let me import this inside here everybody okay all right and i will go back to the bottom and if i say here fa unlocks so what does this do it says the following hey if it's locked and you can see everybody changed look at this you see it changed right away guys what is the stat what does this tell you well basically if it's locked you will use fa lock however otherwise if it's not locked you'll use a fa unlock alternative that's all it is now there you go you see we have this is it's a press nothing happens but it's currently unlocked if i set this to true that's not what i want to do then look then now it's a lock button you guys see that beautiful but how do you but how do you go ahead and actually do something with this so i'm going to use this and i need to create a function on the press of this touchable opacity so on this touchable opacity i can actually specify here unpress of what i will say unpress on press equals the following right i'm gonna say unpress of what on press off okay i need to call some kind of a function i'm gonna call a function here called you know um i know what should we call this i'm going to say const click lock yeah const click lock let's go to a function of course and basically i'm going to say the following every time i click on this i want to do the opposite whatever i'm doing so if my car is currently locked i'm going to unlock it i'm going to say set locked to false right here otherwise if it is currently unlocked i'm going to lock it set locked everybody to what to true save that okay that's an air don't worry about it i have to go back to my own press and i say click lock save that a beautiful now look at this if i now click on this guys ready watch this one watch this one click on it oh oh you see small change but it shows you that this is the unlock unlock section so if i click on it again now it's locked now it's unlocked and actually if you look at the test lab and this is i'll show you a tesla app right here this is the tesla app for sure the if i show the real tesla app which is actually this one looks like there's maintenance going on right now which is actually this one if i i can click on an actual button oh you guys don't see it right now look at the actual button you will see it right there still updated right now but it will actually do the same thing as what we're doing right now what does this be written it's usually using something called react native everybody react native right by that's right okay so this is literally you guys are building for android and ios that's correct right so we have this set locked unlocked and you can click on this as much as you want no problem so ever the next thing i want to focus on which can be the harder portion is this menu right here this menu right there okay so everybody strip the strap down settle down let's go ahead here the next portion okay now for this menu i'm actually gonna create a new component right here i'm gonna create new components for this menu i will insert my components folder i'm going to say new folder because i just want to do that and i'm going to say menu manu inside here we'll do a new file called index.js okay and we'll also create a style.js style.js beautiful beautiful thank you thank you thank you thank you for the buddy bro ad carmel what is that recording 403 guys three 403 likes guys 500 come on come on you got this okay so we had the nfl gs same thing here i'm gonna say uh rfc see here i'm gonna do a little bit differently here const cons menu is equal to this i'm gonna say export default default manu my new that's it okay beautiful what is better a quick question what is better a if else or ternary operator so turning operators that you like to use for like very fast um turning operators are really great for you want to display different things so turning operators are amazing for example just how you have right here guys you can see here i use a turnaround operator for this portion you see you're not going to say if else statement inside here you're honestly not going to do that that's just you know it's not clean at all yo sean what's up my friend good to see you right it's actually not going to happen at all you instead you want to use a turner operator for this one because again it makes it clean it's easy to use and if you do if bunch of if else stables it's just going to be a really hard and complicated right so we don't want to do that that's the only reason why you use turner operator okay so we have now the menu here and this menu is going to be a view view same thing here called view view okay let's go ahead and import that view into our car item right here right i'm gonna say here view view view you view and i'm gonna say import menu menu from what from what import menu from well this is the tricky portion right i need to get out of car item i need to go back into the menu slash index boom save it okay got everybody then i can now actually use it i can go to here and i can say here uh my new menu i'm gonna say here i'm gonna say menu i'll give myself a little comment below so i can know what i'm talking about i'm gonna say here too oh menu what's that right away boom cannot find the variable view why because of course we need to import this stuff so i'm going to copy this whole view thing i'm going to copy this whole touchable opacity react nature because we're going to use it as well in the other one command c go to my instags command v boom and so we have all those little views okay every single thing you need to import directly okay that's right very very trending i mean uh react native is built for ios and android so it's very very different than like pwa like you know one page applications so progressive web apps i mean i don't know which one is different progressive web apps or react native both are really useful i don't know reactivated apps are just becoming very popular as well but i still i still think that progressive web apps are very very popular guys all right let's save that okay inside this view now we need to do a few things well let me see here first things first is i'm going to create a give it a style here so i'm saying menu it goes styles styles is equal to you know go to what equal to menu items items styles and many items styles and menu items save that to give me an error because you need to import styles here import styles from what dot style oh no from styles into to change this name right here to be called styles right here everybody got it yes please styles right here awesome so we got that portion it looks amazing that was pretty good okay got the clickable buttons everything is all good i like it and inside there now thank you my friend appreciate that thank you leaf inside here we need to now create the actual buttons right and of course this button has a few things if you look at our buttons we have what we have like an um we have this portion right here so if i go ahead and show this to you because we can create this into a view and then we have a few different things we have the icon we have the text here portion right which might have like a secondary text right here and then we have this little you know arrow i call the chevron chevron icon that's right that's how cool it looks right that's the one we want to build okay so let's go ahead and do that we've got the styles menu items the chevron icon that looks amazing now inside here let's create our one first view i'll call the menu row so i'm saying view here view style is equal to styles dot what menu row that's right that's right okay menu bro okay save that next thing we need to go ahead and create is number one like i said um and what we had this little icon so we need to create our icon let's do that right now so i'm gonna say here just how i've done it before let's go back to minus.js here here's my icon i'm going to copy this icon just for my sake and we go to here now what i'm going to use we're going to use a musical icon that's right that's right not ethical but a musical icon so let's go back to here i'm gonna call it music let's see what we need to use so yes we're gonna use the scroll view but i'm gonna add that later on that's correct but yes we are going to use a scrollview that's correct so music right here fa music you guys can see that that's all you need to use or maybe yeah after me that's what we need so let's go ahead and import that one so to import our icon same thing you guys need to do that like like the last channel guys you need to import font awesome boom and then we need to import the individual icons boom it is the gs right here we can remove all these other ones we don't need that and inside this one we need to simply just say let's just say f a what fa music okay and that way if i go to my icon let's say fa music now where is it uh icon i need to bring in the style of icon styles for my last one so let me see where's my icon style which is this color white that's all that's all it is honestly i'm gonna put it into my dispo style now for this style same thing guys as the last other one you see guys need to import style sheet here let's go to our style sheet import style sheet and we need to create a style sheet so we need to go back to here it says con style styluses.create same thing styles that create okay i'm going to create that open this up awesome sweet beautiful okay okay we got the styles that creates that's the create and within this one what am i doing missy here i'm gonna show it to you guys i need to import the icon one so i'm gonna say here icon boom icon color of white got it i can color off white all right that's right and then that way when you should see the menu icon somewhere icon fa music where is it i feel like i see it but i also don't see it import styles styles dot icon music icon let's see styles i need to export the styles i keep forgetting this export default styles right here boom save that nice we've got ourselves the icon what's up muhammad how are you doing my friend good let's go back to our next js sweet sweet sweet and then of course inside the menu that's what we have after that guys what do we need to do after that is gonna be the following so i'm gonna create a um inside after font awesome i'm gonna create something called a text box right here check this out because of course if you look at it here guys right this is the media this is the text portion but it might have two different things that's right so i'm gonna create it i'm gonna call it the style the menu text box here okay let's say view style of course styles dot menu text box boom beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful okay that's awesome then i'm going to say here text this is going to be my menu text menu text menu text oh no that's the style my bad hold on the style is equal to styles dot menu text and in terms of the actual text what i'm going to put in here well i'm just going to put here to say media right that's what we have right here media everybody okay so save that and let's see what we've got so far nothing so far because the media it's black color so we actually need to give it a white color okay let's go back to our here style gs and i'm going to say here my new text it's going to be color of white boom say that a beautiful nice job okay that's looking good pretty good that's looking pretty good i liken this and then finally last thing to do is that that little arrow icon so let's import that one right now as well okay same thing font awesome let's see boom and it's called the chevron icon those who did not know this but it's called chevron so if i go ahead go back to here chevron i command this right here and we need to chevron right there we go fa chevron right you guys see that that's right i know i did not know what chevron man's at the first time in my life i figured out what chevron is fi chevron all right see even give the suggestions nice and that's what i'm gonna what i'm going to use here fa chevron holland fa chevron right save that beautiful awesome sweet now let's go back into our style sheets and let's fix up the styling of this specific you know uh view i guess you can say so let's go to here the styles and i'm going to say here menu text box which is or menu items i'm sorry menu actually no menu row so one menu row okay let's go to all this menu row let's go to style let's css right here my new row beautiful open this up it's exactly what we want now for this menu row again for us to be able to do that yes it does support typescript that's correct for us to be able to do what to do um you know horizontal alignment what do we say guys who knows we say flex direction row that's right flash digestion row so i'm going to say here lex direction direction i call a row save that boom see now it's in a row awesome next one i'm going to say um align item center i'm going to give it an outline items center align items center comma okay and honestly that's that's that's that's pretty much it on next this one let me see here for a second i have my new text box okay let me see here but this menu text box needs to be a little bit different so you see how they're called they're currently so close together there's like there's like this right here this right here this right here well in order for me to make this grow as much as possible i have to say flex girl one so for example let me show you here i'll go to my style.css and i say this on menutextbox i say flexgrow of one save that here let's fix that hey you see so now flexco one is what makes this media thing grow as much as possibly can that's right so that's actually what we're doing here okay next i'm gonna do is i'm going to add a small margin so i'm going to add a small margin to the actual menu this whole menu items i'm going to small at a small margin this so let's go to my camera menu items here boom okay right here what's up how you doing as a dean good to see you it actually still looks like that guys it actually still looks like that really no because i have it i have the latest tesla app my friends and it still looks like that so yeah it does it does it does that's interesting portion about it but yeah anyway so flex direction of row align item center flex scroll one for the menu items i'm going to give it a a what's it called a um margin top margin bottom so we'll say give it a margin top margin top 20 okay i'm going to say margin left left of 20 right because see what i'm trying to do here i'm trying to keep it aligned together with this you see that that's what i'm trying to do i'm trying to keep it throw through here okay margin that's oh 20 as well see nice and then margin right as well so margin right is also going to be 20 everybody boom dunzo got it nice got that section that's awesome and then honestly that's pretty much it in terms of alignment now let's focus on the alignment inside the menu row as well that's right so for the menu row i'm going to say here margin top here margin top margin top of gonna be 15 pixels because i want every single thing to have a you know spacing in between each of the specific things okay now let's focus on the menu text here now the menu text the menu text right here my new text okay that's right ryan is from mobile apps everybody menu text boom right and i want to say here font size font size of 16 that's part one a little bit bigger um oh hold on right here disappear because i already have a menu text right here fonzo sixteen okay next up after that let's go ahead and give a font out of bold oh bold oops bold like this boom see it's a little bit bolder now let's go and give some spacing in between what this and then this whole thing right so i'm going to say here font way ball but also i'm going to say margin left margin left of what or 15 to give us a space in between the actual icon itself and that's pretty pretty pretty much it my friends right so in terms of that that's all we need to do all right so we have margin left 115 and that's it so we have this menu and of course it's not touchable either as well one thing i do want to do however is i want to add a um the style for the right icon i call it for the arrow icon so if i go back to here i'm going to give this a arrow icon style arrow icon because it has a different color if you guys take a look at it here you see there's a different color than the rest of this right here so i'm going to say here arrow icon okay save that i will go to styles here and i will create a new one called aerial icon let's see here arrow icon beautiful and then the color for this one is going to be the following let me see here arrow icon it's going to be this color right here guys that's it boom so you can see now we have a button everybody now it's a very simple button nothing crazy to make this a fullon button i'm going to do the following i will make this into a touchable opacity so again touchable opacity okay command x tap it out and then what command v save that and stuff like look at that you see it feels like it's an actual button it feels like it's an actual button that's right now of course now if i want to simply replicate this whole thing only to use this i just command c i will do command v another one another one and another one right and i will have a lot of media icons and so forth now for us to make this a little bit even better what i can do for you guys is we can simply just um i want to put a margin bottom on the actual menu row as well so just how we have a menu row margin top we're gonna do menu row margin that's right that's correct we're gonna do 15 yes let's go yeah there we go that's much better guys right so much better yeah yeah yeah yeah and of course also we need to make it into an opera case everything needs to be uppercase so for the menu text right here i expect to go back to here we have a menu text with this media right here let's go back to our styles do we have my new text anywhere we do where is it right here i'm going to give it a text transform of text transform text transform always going to be um uppercase i want to make sure everything is uppercase boom media see so now of course we get all these buttons guys you guys can see that that's right that's right it literally that's right elenor it's literally react is library framework for websites and web apps that's correct that's correct so now we've got all these buttons guys it looks pretty amazing okay but of course i know it's not going to be efficient if i want to can have all these buttons right here you see this i want to have all these buttons so to make this work what we did is we actually created a object file for you so like i said we have a down below in description we have a tesla clone assets folder just simply download right click on this right here click on download that's all you have to do this will have all the assets you need the images and you have something called items.gs and i want you guys to import that alice.js into the menu so if i have here my tesla clone assets right here i'm going to take my my itunes gs and put it into the menu section okay why because here it is so what this does and again this just makes stuff a lot easier for all of us okay we've made this so for example you can see we have items boom right here and every single item is a menu item right here you see so for example let me show you here if we have the media here this is directly correlated to let me show you correlate to the music portion right here boom boom you guys can see that we specify the id we specify the actual icon which we import as well by the way let me specify the actual title two you see that you see that that's right so that is what we do my friends okay so make sure you guys go ahead and download this down below description and make sure you guys hit the like button because if you hit the like button i'm gonna do this that's right that's right that's right so hit the like button subscribe guys for more videos like this we just hit a million subscribers which is it means so much to us so we will really much appreciate that all right moving forward go ahead all right you guys can see we've got this object file which you can simply just download from the down below in description okay thank you jackie appreciate that down below from description just go ahead and and download that little object file and this specifies all of our buttons you can see we have all we have the title that's the actual text we also have the subtitle if you want to use that and so forth now to use this we will go to innis.gs so check this out okay i will go to my index.js here all right and i'm going to import this so i'm going to say import items from not item zoom items from from what from items beautiful okay that's it so i just imported my items now how do i use those well we're gonna usually call them mapping so to map through or to loop through it i just need one so look at this i'm going to say boom boom items tab map okay that map and for the map we get one item for so basically it loops through every single item one by one by one by one by one and for every single one i'm gonna go through it and i'm going to output something with that okay well to output i'm gonna output this one specific button right here boom you can see boom save that okay so that's all i'm gonna do here now of course con each list each child list should have a unique id so that's we're going to add that right now i'm going to need to add a unique id for every single one so i'll say key is equal to right here it's due to item id that's a must for sure and now you have all these buttons which are not scope a scrollable by the way so don't worry we'll fix that in a second here but now let's actually change the text for every single button okay the difference between a map and a flat list so a flat list um is directly comes from react native it does not does not exist in react gs versus a map is just simply just in your normal javascript mapping guys right and that's it so you know that's the biggest difference honestly i would say but you know i think they can they can be used together honestly a flat list yeah so let me take a look at this let me show you here i'm sure i actually want to stick on the topic here so we got this item that id to replace this text right here i'm going to say what i'm going to say item that what who remembers we have the title you see if you go to my answer gs we have item dot title that's right so if i go back to my thing if i save this a you see all of these now have different titles which is exactly what we want not next one we need to now update the actual icon so instead of doing styles that icon sort of do icon is this one i'm going to say here what icon is equal to item dot what icon like this boom and look how fast all of that just happened software climbed everything okay that's right last thing to do is to add a subtitle if you guys look at it right here we have this subtitle okay the subtitle right here two two two two the subtitle right here you guys can see okay and well it's kind of like right there this one this one to add the subtitle i'm gonna say the following now it's not always there because sometimes it doesn't exist but here's well here's what i will do i'm going to check if it exists i'm going to say here if the item that subtitle exists if it does then i will output the following i will output a new text i will say here text text right style is equal to i'm going to say styles dot subtitle right right here close it out and then and then i say item.subtitle so i'm gonna hear item item.subtitle right here beautiful right so we've got those three things okay so basically we're checking here if the subtitle exists then we update then we actually show this if it doesn't exist then we don't worry about showing this and look at this you can see here let me see this does it work if on the subtitle oh yeah it does actually work so now we need to actually create the subtitle uh what's it called the subtitle um css or styling yes you can say let's create our subtitle styling boom boom boom looking back to see and there's a special there's only just a special kind of font size you want to use i'm gonna say here color color is going to be gray color and boom you see it right away shows up right there guys right there gray awesome i'm going to say here font size of what 14. just a little bit like that nice i'm going to say margin left of 15 margin left margin uh left 15 15. just sort of together fits with everything else right and my friends that's pretty pretty much it we had these controls but of course you see i can't con scroll anything i can't really do anything with this specific thing and the reason being is because and you know in react native in native applications you need to specify like a scroll direction just go specify scroll view and that's what we need to do right now so let's specify a scroll view so we can actually scroll with this okay okay i will go ahead and open this up i will open this one up okay and and if i show you here what a scroll view is guys scroll view scroll you react native right here i just wanted to show to you here for a second right here see it's just i can scroll through anything pretty much you see i can actually scroll because usually you really can't really scroll usually but if you specify scroll view then yes you can so we need to go back to our in car item and i'm going to import scroll view inside react native let me import scroll view here rule view comma scroll view awesome let's save that one and since i've oh oops oops oops oops oops and where are we going to put the scroll view around is my maybe your question well you put this around the whole menu so i i want to actually put it around this whole thing check this out guys this whole thing because this is what scrolls right this does not scroll and this is this stays put but this however does scroll this has a whole big margin and it that's what we want to allow to scroll so let me see we have the control icons we include that the status we don't include that so i'm going to say here now scroll view scroll view that's where i'll put it here boom boom boom command x that i'll put it around together with the menu boom so now if i go ahead and do this boom scroll view save this let's see oh look at that we have my friends the scroll view so look at this now go back to instags right we don't need any of these other ones we just remove these other ones we don't need any of these we just need the ones that we loop through save this and guys we have ourselves a tesla mobile app fully working for you it's not the tesla app that you'll use on the on your iphone but if you want to compare this let me show you this is the tesla app that i have right here and if you're wondering yes this is i mean you can yeah this is my tesla right here let me show you right here can you guys see it oh come on come on i'll put this used but you guys can see i can scroll through different things right here i can scroll through them right here it says my charging it says my charging it has i can click on a button for example to lock it to unlock it and that's that's pretty much it this is and it's very similar to what we just built right very similar we just built which is again like i said if you look at it we can lock it we can unlock it and go through media you know and a few different other things you can say boom boom boom media cellular updates climate to me this is really interesting honestly to figure out how to build an app in react native personally i have not been the master of react native so for me this was also like a learning opportunity and i'll be honest if you with you if you know react.js you you will learn react native very easily probably like this took me a day to build this on like genuinely and to learn this from scratch um but you know if i did this you could do this too exa you know as well the whole point of this was not just only for you to learn how to build this but also for me to learn how to build this honestly guys and this was a lot of fun for me to build it honestly and i can only see how far we'll get with something like this you know with projects like these you know the next project with my hair is uber eats and and so forth and there's so many other products that we have in store to build you know for you so definitely stay tuned everybody but yeah let me know what you guys think what do you guys think of this project you know did you guys enjoy this i'll put the github link for this you know down below if you guys want to check it out but that's pretty much it what do you get what do you guys think i'm curious those you who are on currently on the live uh the live section so i'm saying we need more projects thank you guys i appreciate that appreciate that you got it we got more projects coming for you we got more projects coming for you and so and here's the cool part so now because this is expo right i'm going to show you something to you so here's our app right this is the one that's running if i simply use my see i've got my handy dandy my iphone here if i simply just put my iphone on that little barcode see the backup pops up and i can now open my thing right here boom you see so it actually opened the build version let me show you it opened up the build version right here i can click i can click you see so it actually have to build the version of this specific app how cool is that yeah so literally like you will show this to your friends to your family and they will see like wait what this is this is a real app like you've actually built this yes this is i know this is only functionality but you know building something like this honestly even for example in swift is hard enough trust me uh even just the view is not easy to be able to loop through something to just show it to you able to have a clickable buttons to have the glue buttons actually react to something and change the state of it for example the lock unlock button it works the way it should be right there's a lot that goes behind it i know in terms of making sure this actually works so i mean the gear icon works the i mean it all works it's called an osmobile which i love um but this is so cool guys i really suggest you guys try to make this by yourself as well just you know make sure you install xbow that's right thank you so much somebody said this is what happens when a program is passionate and generous you guys are the best thank you thank you everybody thank you this means a lot a lot to us okay so yeah well let us know what kind of more builds you guys want us to do you know oh we got hold on one second hold on okay okay okay okay all good so yeah let us know what kind of bills you guys want us to do and then we'll do them okay we'll just do the builds okay and that's it but guys that's pretty much it for me wait that's it for me guys of course you guys know hit like hit subscribe and really really important if for those of you who really want to take your career to the next level and you want to make sure that this happens guys we have a program called professor jealous going to be built with our heart our soul right where you get to learn how to actually become a foster developer using react.js so i'll show you
