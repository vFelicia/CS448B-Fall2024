hey guys welcome back to the learn objectoriented programming in Python course whoo mouthful so in the last video we talked a little bit about how we had the student thing and then we were able to use the initialization method so we talked about kind of an it method of classes well let's go and talk about the difference between classes versus objects so it's the some of the terminology is important to wrap your mind around even if it's a repetition or even if you've seen it somewhere before it's good to practice and just hear about it again so you can differentiate when you're speaking when you're thinking and more importantly when you're researching online because if you're trying to create a game one of the most common things people will do is you'll go online go on stackoverflow.com or whatever and look something up and if your terminology is not correct you're not going to look it up correctly as well so even though it might be knowing right now focus on learning the terminology so when you see a class constantly in your head set class or tell your friend class or you know say it out loud and same thing with an object do the same thing when you identify it be like oh that's an object from a class so on and so forth now let's go ahead and break down the difference between classes and objects so let's say again we create a class called I don't know fighters okay and in this class we have let's let's do this okay let's let's create that init method that we had earlier and let's go down here and let's just put whatever we don't care for now we will just have a name okay and we will say solve that name is equal to name and we will delete the pass and just like that okay and now I'm going to say Kazi is equal to fighters dot or no let's pass them a name so we'll say Kazi here and i'm going to save it stop giving me that error about spell check now I'm going to run this code in a little bit salsa Kazi name and I'll say print around it and I'm going to run this piece of code so let's run it and you see that it says Causey right over there okay well what just happened so fighters is the class name this name here is an attribute and this initialization thing is a method Kazi is an object I know I said a lot of things it's okay if you don't completely get it objectoriented programming is one of those things that the more you do it the more sense it makes in the store that will kind of flip your brain a little bit but fighters I repeat fighters is the class and cause E is the object created from the class fighters all right another way of saying it is that we just instantiate it an object and that object happens to be Kazi okay and now whatever kind of things we want caused you to do we can do or we can create another object we can call Bob is equal to from the fighters class give them the name Bob or you can give them the name cat it doesn't really matter we can say print Bob's name and again you will see you know you see cat's name at the bottom there so might be a repetition of a little bit of what we did but I wanted to go a little bit more in depth and break this terminology apart and again the more classes you see the more methods you see me create and the more methods and classes you create you will get more comfortable with it therefore you will get a better under standing so I want you to pause this video or after you're done watching this video and before you move on to the next video create your own class kind at the top of your head create your own initialization method can create your own kind of objects and go from there and before I forget here's the code so go to Chrome or Safari whatever you use don't use Safari start using Chrome and go to that link up at the top I'll give you guys that link okay it's very simple github comm slash clever programmer slash clever programmer underscore stuff I'll leave that hopefully in the description below if I remember and I've pushed all of your code up here so whenever we put something just go right there so OOP really stands for objectoriented programming click that and here's where all of your code will be alright so do that and please please which just go and smash that start button okay right there just just smash it okay like that saw that now we're at three but I'm gonna on start it because it's cooler when you guys like it instead of me okay guys I'll see you in the next video
