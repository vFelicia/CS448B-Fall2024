now moving on talk to us about like personalize your messages okay so this is um this is where we met causey oh this is actually holy crap this is actually your real message to me the first one actual first one yep yep there was a kind of um a little proposal that goes with it but this was the cover letter so this is what i sent to try and stand out when i saw your your the job application and now you've been working with us for what two point uh first ever message uh and now this is so cool this is so cool you guys like the fact that and now she's been working with us for two and a half years at cp that's insane like that is one of the coolest things i mean nobody i've never seen a training like this like this is so cool that we can talk about this it's crazy right yeah that is insane go ahead hopefully that kind of speaks to how much power there is in um just really putting some effort into the right kind of job application or whatever whatever way that you're reaching out to people putting some thought into it doing your research on who the other person is um really taking your time and especially on platforms like at work you see a lot of copy and pastes yes you know oh my god people just they just apply for this every all these jobs with the same thing it doesn't speak to your own application to the skills to the character which if you can just take that time to really um really hone in on what they're asking for yeah um because i mean all the time to your point i would get these like garbage messages on upwork and just like hey really interesting project you have there i could definitely help you and then blah blah and i'm like that's your what 104th copy paste of the day you know yeah and so when i saw a message like yours it was extremely refreshing to see somebody who actually read what we had written and wrote specifically for that so like what rachel is saying is like guys stop using canned messages when you reach out to these platforms it's not a game of volume it's a game of like reaching out with quality yeah yeah oh totally totally um and i want to even read out your message because i think it's really important you guys could even use this as a template so rachel reached down and she said hi there and she goes i really enjoyed reading your job posting and it would be awesome to chat with you about whether i'd be a good fit for the role honestly when i read this i thought it was like a canned message probably you know most likely because that's what i got from a lot of people but then this is where i got interested i love problem solving and getting tech tools to work together my background is ten years in accountancy and admin but six months ago i transitioned to a va tech and my ideal work is in problem solving so here she said problem solving love problem solving in my initial job posting i had mentioned problem solving multiple times um yeah i think i've popped the post a little further down as well because so it's there in case yeah oh yeah that's awesome we can actually take a look at that too um oh wow even amanat is he's like um he's this letter is amazing i've never thought of writing a letter like that finally wishing him good this is awesome so here um so i've got experience in leadpages and various email webinar payment course systems these specific systems we were talking about but not kajabi and this is honestly one of those things that kind of just like hits you in the heart like this was one of the things where i'm like not only do we not have somebody who's possibly really good at it but the fact that she says openly she doesn't know kajabi and not like some wishywashy answer like literally she's like not kajabi that is huge because already i can tell so much about her character and integrity and i want to work with somebody on the team who has character and integrity i don't want to work with people who put politics above everything else right so going on and she goes yet i'm really keen to learn all of these systems so that's important to me that she's very flexible and so would be very happy in my element in fact to learn them quickly and on my own time like that is just beautifully written it's like somebody's dream to have somebody like that working on their team where they're like hey i would i don't know them this is actually funny right because at the start of this video that's what i said if you don't know it just say it and say i'll be able to willing to learn later literally what you say here and um we have messages that are like joseph says this is a working template nice one rachel o'shea says rachel's letter is perfect it's brief specific and detailed really good job so lucy says this is so useful hassan says eloquent amazing job says amanath abdullah says yeah rachel amazing job no thanks guys yeah seriously it's actually really amazing and then she goes i love research and have found some great resources so i can quickly get familiar with them i pride myself in being proactive a strong communicator and a great team player honestly this statement i trust if anybody else says it i would just ignore it but like do you guys know what makes me want to trust this statement more like what out of this entire thing what was it that makes me actually trust this statement more and if you want to guess drop it in the comments below but for me it was actually this statement where she just openly is so honest and willing to say i don't know kajabi and then when you say you pride yourself in being a strong communicator and great team player i trust you see what i'm saying yeah yeah like because i'm like okay i she why would you say that if you were somebody who was just lying you know because you literally went out of your way to say you didn't know something yeah yeah um abdullah says amazing tips thanks for the advice sure says this is nice um we have everything ipad pro says the way she writes is just beautiful yeah minik says i've never thought of writing such a thing this is awesome yup and then she even goes on to say look forward to hearing from you if you'd like to discuss more and best of luck with finding someone awesome i mean who goes out of their way to even encourage you and be happy for you to find somebody else that's awesome ending on such a positive note is another huge thing everything eyepatch pro says rachel is an independent and strong woman and uh she's proud of you oh thank you yeah yeah and um i'm gonna read i think ahmad had a really nice message to this and he says he said the letter is amazing i've never thought of writing such a letter finally wishing them and and he goes you finally wishing somebody good luck and finding that is this seriously shows the mindset of rachel so so that's yeah so that's huge because it shows where her mindset is and this is the letter that like resulted in i don't know fifty thousand dollars and more like i don't know i don't even know at this point how where we're at but like this is literally has led to over a 50 000 transaction and probably we're gonna work till many many more years like we like literally i would love to have rachel on the team for the next three five ten years on clever programmer and it all came from right here so it doesn't really get any more real than this yep pretty crazy that's crazy right you never thought one day your letter that you were gonna write was gonna be like broadcasted to thousands of people no i really didn't oh man i think you're right you're right it just shows the power of taking that time taking that time to really stop um stop think put yourself in the other person's shoes as to what they're looking for and yeah and like like we were talking about to put yourself in the right state when you're when you're approaching it as well you know put make sure you're in that positive place where you can write it with like all of the enthusiasm and best intentions and then you know let go yes yep uh john ford says rachel is a true professional her work her insta profile and this letter now everything speaks about how cool and good at her work she is simply amazing be like rachel no damn and o'shea says it takes just one good letter to change your life yep and uh kringet says nice message it's awesome the whole thing especially about being honest yep so i mean yeah this is something that's really valuable if you guys want to take a screenshot of this before we move on go ahead and do that it'll give you kind of like a template but again her whole point is personalized yeah yeah totally but even within personalization this is a good template to kind of work off of so what else rachel before we move on to the next slide yeah i'd say um obviously i'm talking about how important personalizing is but there's a little note there about um a swipe file and by that what i mean is not copy and paste in um the same thing to every job but just having a couple of notes um if you know if you're doing a lot of outreach um you're reaching out to quite a few people that you're really interested in just having a little kind of swipe file of phrases that explain your skills that you can steal wording from so you don't put too much mental energy into that that's unnecessary i think that's something that's quite handy too yep a hundred percent so definitely use have those handy so that you can use them as reference and then grow like leverage them to be be able to write but guys yeah this is something that's really important it shows you it's not so much praying spray and just like reach out to 5 000 locations you can if you spend more time and you reach out with precision your success rate honestly is going to be much higher don't overthink it as well like don't spend three hours on a message but if you just spend 15 minutes and 10 or 10 minutes personalizing write it and move on that would be really good yeah awesome so assad ali says i'm about to start my first freelancing job this is really helpful you guys deserve a lot thank you guys awesome yeah congratulations yeah uh tam mayor tim maryland says rachel i would want you to teach me writing true and very like detailed messages like these that's cool how to have a chat with you awesome okay so let's keep it moving so let's go on to the next one and uh this was the actual job posting right mmhmm yeah yep so this is the job posting go ahead i'm just gonna say we just cut it up so yep that's it so yeah this is the posting guys this is part like this is you know the first part of it this is the second part of it it's the same posting yeah we just cut it up so it's all on the same page but like uh my main thing we were looking for was people who knew about all these technologies kajabi drip click funnel sam cart webinar jam zap zapier but i said like we need someone who can manage these systems understand how they work and be able to do it and um i wrote some specific things like you should be able to understand what we mean when we say x y z and if you don't know this you'd love to research it until you understand how it works and can put it together so you know going back and here i mentioned kajabi and going back to what rachel said she said in her message that she doesn't know kajabi but she's willing to learn it right and so she also understood like where i was coming from and then she mentioned that and she said i'd be willing to learn so it matches up to kind of what we were looking for and we said the right person will be confident in his his slash her intuition to figure out figure it out and get the job done correctly you may not know every platform but this is a type of work that makes you feel invincible and you are smart enough to figure it out and definitely when i spoke with rachel she already knew a lot of things and what she didn't know she said she would be willing to learn and then when i went on her social media on her facebook it confirmed with me she that she wasn't just saying words to say whatever she needed to say to get a job she was backing it up with her actions and i could see three months ago she was like posting about going down rabbit holes and learning about technology yeah so that was huge cool go ahead and remember also with that kazee right at the end of the requirements um and it said you wanted a minimum of two plus years handson administrative support experience oh yeah yeah so and i know things like that would sometimes put people off with the specifics oh yeah that was just complete like i don't even know what that meant i just put that i had no idea what that even meant i don't what is administrative support i have i had no idea exactly so it's always it's always worth it's always worth applying to something if you read it and you think yes and you connect you know even if there's something like that yeah so i mean like it also goes to show you that like and you didn't have that right just to be clear you didn't have two plus years of handson how much did you have um i think gosh six months to a year maybe at that point yeah so so basically another thing like don't say no for the other person yeah so like she she could have easily just said oh i don't have two years of experience i'm not gonna apply for this but she's just like she she replied for it anyway and it turns out that i was an idiot and i didn't even know what the hell i was looking for and i just put some random stuff in requirements and a lot of people who are looking like a lot of people who are actually posting these jobs from the hr department they even have no idea what the specs are yeah yeah exactly exactly i think you put it so well they're not saying no for them yeah so don't say no for them apply anyway intelligently and don't don't have those weird things put you off you know like um i saw this one post where the developer of the react.js library or something along those lines something really massive got rejected from a job and because they wanted like 10 years of experience and he says i have five years of experience or something along those lines and they're like sorry we need somebody with 10 and then he made a tweet and he says well i got rejected from my job but he goes i wrote the react.js library and it's only been out for five years oh wow so i was like oh wow so somebody can correct me in the chat below it's not really react and it's not the same time frame but the point is similar yeah uh so you know it's it's crazy but yeah all right moving on so what is going on here with this guy yeah this this guy's hiding from video oh no yeah i think the the one thing the other one thing i'd maybe do a little differently now um if i was kind of actively looking for on upwork right now is i would add in video so and in addition to because people like different platforms in addition to that written um message that i sent i would probably make a really short video just so that you can really connect with the other person because video's so powerful game changer so i think if you hop to the next one kazi um we're just talking about loom there and i mean even when you're working with clients like there's an example there um this is loom if if anybody hasn't used it before it's a free tool yep and here's your face this is a video here's her face talking over it and then she's sharing her screen but keep going rachel yeah yeah exactly this is me talking about something in one of our systems in kajabi but yeah i mean even once you're working with clients this could be so powerful just to kind of catch up especially if you're on different time zones and things but in the outreach phase um so so good for them to really get a feel for you um and i mean i've i can imagine that you would do this like if i would say research in clever programmer talk about club program again you could be on the clever program or website you could have that with the screen shared you could show what you were finding and talk over it and yeah the video was so powerful so i would just get comfortable with that um and with something like loom i mean you can even start by practicing if if video is something that is really um terrifying to you um you could just take baby steps yeah you've got things like instagram stories you can use loom and you can just make videos for yourself and just steadily get used to seeing yourself on the camera um and then by the time that you're in a position where you're working with clients and you've got video calls it's just second nature yep exactly i mean i try to start loom but i think my camera is being used up by another device so it's only like a yellow little mark here actually let me yeah let me end it right now but you you guys won't get a yellow mark like this which will happen is loom will record your screen so here i just record it for just a few seconds and you'll see it already created a link and the video is online so if you guys actually went to this link right here you'd be able to see this exact video i can even drop it in the chat and uh i mean it's not a very awesome video but you get the point the fact that i was able to make a video in like a second and then boom it's up so what rachel is saying is she would now actually make a video talking about what the client is looking for and then send that directly through upwork and that will crush if i had seen a video from you i would be like it's game over like i would just yeah i would probably skip the interview that's it it just gives you that so much extra connection doesn't it there's so much you can get from a video yep as an extra tool exactly so let's let me go full screen this huge tool all right so keep going rachel and if you want me to move on to the next one i can do that too yeah sure let's um let's scoot down to the next one all right let's do it and ahmad says seriously the years of experience doesn't matter if you have the skills and that's it most people are afraid to apply for jobs when they see that years of experience mmhmm yeah so true it's
