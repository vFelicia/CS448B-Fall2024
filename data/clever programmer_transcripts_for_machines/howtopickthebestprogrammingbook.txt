what about learning Python the hard way yeah puck that is a good book I am a fan of this to be honest because it goes through like building actual projects I mean learn Python the hard way does as well but I'm a fan of I don't know I'm just a fan of this you create these games and stuff and I like it you know I kind of nerd out on this book a little bit you create like tennis simulations and here's just a rule of thumb with books I talked with my good friend Ben marks he works at Google and he writes code and Python every single day and he was telling me that when you are using Python or sorry when you are learning coding and you're trying to learn it from a book one of the best things to do is just go to a book with a lot of exercise and my friend um Jude said the same thing okay um Jude is one of the founding engineers at code Academy and if any of you guys have used repple it or have seen me use repli'd repl i.t um Jude was the founder of it okay so um Jude also says find books that just have a lot of exercises in them so if you're gonna get a Python or coding book just pick it up and just go through it and just see how many exercises it has and if it looks like you're working on a lot of handson exercises and projects then you're in a good place
