and we are live we're live with all of you out here today um we are this is a clever pro programmer audio experience and we're actually about to go live also on uh club oh yeah we're lava clubhouse as well so club what is up everybody uh like i said this is a podcast clever programmer podcast and we're doing this very simple something very simple we're doing this every single day every single day as we're doing this and the purpose of this is to give you guys bring you guys more value have fun and have fun yes so today we're gonna do something fun what are we gonna do naz we're gonna go to the apple event we had the apple event that kind of went through that that i think is pretty cool um and so we're we're big apple people here yes yes yes yes we don't like pears we eat apples yes yes yes exactly exactly hopefully we can have people join clubhouse what is this how do we have people join the clubhouse um this is this a private one for club members only unless open everyone has opened it up then how hit that link again what link did you just you hit one right now that kind of popped up uh wait what love is in yep yo okay if you happen to have clubhouse guys and you're following clever program yeah jump on clubhouse because we're gonna take your direct questions we can have conversations with you there if not oh we got artem in here look at that that's cool so we got them in the house here what's up what's up what's up that's awesome so we have guys go out to clubhouse if you're in clubhouse right we are there and then it'll be actually cool because though that would be a way for us to connect with them yeah answer questions you can have legit conversations right like on the youtube channel here we can answer your comments but it's just not as engaging as actually having conversation asking you questions you asking those questions having it back and forth meanwhile invite to speak and he's going to move him up here there we go damn do you hear me not yet give it one second brother once he physically moves up right up that should happen when he exits oh oh yeah if he doesn't then there's no way he's gonna be able to hear us so invited i mean i did if i had to speak send them an invite okay if he doesn't speak that's fine i don't think if you don't speak that's all good is there a chat window is there like a chat window or anything like that no it's what is this ray's hands that's it they raise their hands this is so cool guys holy [ __ ] it's pretty good guys if you have clubhouse get on clubhouse follow clever programmer because we can have an actual conversation with you guys yes yes and you're going to come out here oh car was in the house yo what kind of how are you doing my friend damn that's not speaking better speak at harvard you let's see if they join otaro can you speak let me see hold on let's see that like you'll there we go check it out oh wait karl can you speak now turn down the volume ataro what's up man yo how's it going bro can everybody hear that yeah everybody can hear that hey how's it going my friend i'm just great how about you how's everything going i'm doing amazing i'm doing amazing doing amazing yeah yeah yeah awesome awesome cool cool cool what you've been up to man i just watched the apple event what's up oh you watched the apple event yeah i just watched it that's awesome coming up with the new imacs with the ambulance chip let's take a look at the actual let's take a look at these these m1 chips let's take a look at that i'm very curious so what's going to happen so let's look at what what happened in this apple event right here um oh [ __ ] this is so cool bro i have a macbook yeah i have a macbook with m12 yeah nice do you like the m1 chip yeah it's super fast i love the designs i love the designs um everybody's like what's up hard workers yo what's good yo yo yo yo by the way i thought about you're you're in clubhouse here but we're also streaming this on live this is the imac bro oh my god that looks so skinny look how good that looks yeah this is live on youtube by the way my friend uh you're live on youtube yeah the audio yeah oh yeah i thought it was on youtube whoa holy [ __ ] dude i don't know if i like that bro why not do you guys like it let me know in the like can i do like a poll in here in in youtube or no i can't do polls here on youtube right i don't know great highlight video stream marker no i cannot do polls here on youtube it'll be cool if i could but just let us know in the comments guys let us know in the comments because if you like something this is if this is really cool for you i think this is awesome that hinge wait can i get like another view okay let's see let's see it says hello say hello to the new imac inspired by the best of apple transformed by the m1 chip uh stands out in my space profits perfectly into your life yes yes yes that's not bad honestly from 29 that's not bad at [Laughter] i all know about are you taking it back or whatnot i don't know about this guys [Laughter] i don't know i don't know what changed your mind dude you were so hyped on it what happened i was hyped on it but i'm looking at these colors for those of you who are on audio experience i'm looking at all these colors right now and i don't know it just looks like cha childish yeah i thought it looks like childhood but i guess they have a silver version like i said where's the silver version because i'll buy that version this whole thing with like the white and like this portion oh man i don't know i mean i don't know what do you guys think what do you guys think what do you guys think let us know in the comments below what you guys think of this i'm very curious crazy how flat it is though it's really really flat i'm surprised on that portion i will say yeah because for the processor now it's replaced by amazon 11.5 millimeters that's the now that's thin that is thin it's a shortened design and one chip the system and when i took its processor graphics into a single chip that's awesome i love that portion um what else i love their just website design by the way it's just oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that color look at this oh that's like that's like a magnet oh [ __ ] easily attaches via magnets i like that animation that's cool animation right yeah brilliant 4.5 4.5 key right on display what wow that is sick let's see what else we got they also released like the pro display like the apple pro display i don't know how did they do that bro sorry for interrupting you but this user experience is crazy like you're scrolling down how do they think that is insane dude that is insane sorry bro so what were you saying man i was saying that they also released some display like prores displays like apple sells their own display i guess yeah yeah yeah they have some improvements on that too yeah yeah yeah turkish stun is like 4.5 key display i don't know would be cool for us to be able to figure out how we can do this in css or like like that's possible i'm sure it's [ __ ] is what what is what's going on here they're zooming in it says it's screaming but the thing is it's not a screen like keep scrolling up like in the beginning it's not a screen like scroll up scroll down i mean no no no scroll the other way so at first it's like the typical css transition or when you scroll down you see like the background image right like scroll down sorry sorry when i say scroll down i mean like go down on the website yeah so it's just like the typical background image as an embedded yeah yeah yeah yeah and then when they zoom out and they make it look like the screen that looks james james foreman says it's a 3d library that's really interesting yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah do you happen to know what a library is yeah yeah yeah this is cool holy [ __ ] i just don't like this does i don't like this division right here this is what i don't like the color no there's division between the this right here you see the division between the yellow and the white i don't like this division it just looks odd to me that's it you know hey neil patel just said they want to see this clone we gotta close this dude that'd be a good challenge man wait so auto balance studio quality mics oh [ __ ] okay well the new macbook pros have the studio quality mics as well so you know they always heard that yeah six speaker sound system audio that really fills a room whoa six speakers what the [ __ ] this stuff you know look how tiny these things are bro like it has to fit into how thin that thing is i don't oh yeah that's insane to me the sound system on amex brings an incredible room filling audio to any space yeah i guess i just don't my macbook pro goes like two days of battery life without dying what's up does what my macbook pro goes like two days of battery life without dying two days on battery without dying wow yeah that's do you have the ammo do you have the m1 chip at harvard yeah he just said he did yeah i have that oh that's awesome that is sick is that shown on top in the live yeah okay gotcha so that okay okay cool yeah let's make sure yeah it's showing us yeah so what do we got what do we have uh so we got this m1 and big sur with great power i do love the m1 chips that's awesome that means safari faster than ever i mean of course but i don't use safari that's for sure even the transition that as you're scrolling down and it's showing like other things what the how i like it dude how you see you guys see this right here i mean i mean if we can actually take a look at how how does this is done like like if you want the user experience wait it's stopped hold on oh it's the second it wanted me it was like all this guy's trying to find uh you know the loophole into how we do this stuff he's on to us he's on to us oh so hold on hold on if i refresh this that's so interesting what's up frankie hey what's up everybody how are we doing hey beautiful beautiful all right so let's see what else do we got let's see give me one two yeah okay so look okay so i see okay i got this guy so i got this i'm gonna go i'm gonna do it like this okay i'm gonna take out the inspect element i'm gonna take out the actual i'm gonna undock it right here so here's we have now got the code right here so if we have this code okay right here okay so what's going on here let's see we have here this and as i scroll it transforms so you can see on the right they they have this matrix right here so they do in order for us to be able to properly see transformation they have a matrix look at this bro you see this they have a matrix yeah you have a matrix and i'm doing transform so as i scroll opacity changes you see yep and then this is a little javascript bro i 100 know it and then it's cool wait the [ __ ] the image does not change like there's also some json data into that html what else changes hold on whoa oh no this is this is interesting this is this will be a good those of you guys who are listening to this would be awesome for you guys to take a look take a look at this actually um yeah and when we scroll it will change right yes it does change it that's the crazy part look at this that looks nice dude it looks like the waterfall effect how the f [ __ ] that transition is just so smooth i don't know how they do it so crispy clean because here it is it's it's this thing oh right here so it'll they're all doing through something called the matrix look at this i just wanna um let me go put this on here oh wait it's all going through a matrix so if i scroll on here see there's something called transform matrix if i go here it's the h2 so as i scroll boom dude that's cool crazy man it's crazy how crazy css has gotten to where css takes care of some of those animations yeah i know things you could start to do you know can i do transform trans form matrix on here so if i did if i do matrix transform let's see transforming matrix in css so css css2d transforms is what you're going to use matrix for so if i do okay so i can rotate i can rotate i can skew is there like uh what about what about matrix though like a matrix set what the [ __ ] is the matrix i don't know click on it let's see where it takes us i won't click oh i need to find it first there it is right there the matrix method combines all the 2d transform methods into one ah okay it's like the skill the skew the skill y all the translate watch oh so translate what is the last one that's like when you when i go into here let me go back into my code the code now i'm like about their code you see this right here stays the same but what's actually going on is this number this is translate why this right here is changing the y on the this so basically for those of you who are listening i really wish we had more people on in clubhouse guys if you are on clubhouse guys join us on the club clever programmer can we share it somehow can i share this actually this link somehow um if you could copy it to your computer you could drop it in that chat let me see yeah go ahead search room not andrew audio quality normal you guys interested join this room right here is it not coping into your mac or what so i thought just air drop it to your mac then air drop come on air drop come on copy all right okay that's gonna work nope give us one second guys we're getting that link for you guys get you guys on clubhouse if you guys i mean okay please send the chat link okay you got it guys send a airdrop let's see copy copy pasta text it to yourself texting myself i don't i don't do texting here i do copy pasta my pro this one is that yours would you a pasta copy pasta i got it okay i got it i got it got it got it got it right here here i'll give you guys the link right here guys so you guys can see it boom that's the room for those of you who are interested okay pasta yo david what is going on brother oh this is within clever programmer by the way so you can if you guys simply just go ahead and join clever program that's all you gotta you guys gotta do awesome sweet so that's cool i like that so i make has apps just about everything mac iphone i'm actually i want to ask you a question what do you think about this whole m1 chip system because it's running a completely different system right like even for example for all these other apps they have to use emulators like what do you think about this i'm curious like the future of of what apple just did with the m1 chip gotcha so so i guess i do you mean it's basically a different os and it runs the emulator of the old one or whatever the os right now is the same right the last right now is the same it's what has changed is is very simple what has changed is i think the i don't know how it because for example it's kind of like a different less system because for example if i you know it's kind of like when i do ubuntu and if i want to run a windows application i use an emulator they're doing that with the m1 chip on the mac os system so for any for example yeah so for any for example um you know for any not project but for any application that is not m1 chip compatible they're they emulate oh that's dope dude that is dope because now they have more compatibility with the whole thing's got you exactly yo that is cool i didn't know that was what was going on really didn't know that you didn't know that yeah so like i just i just thought the m1 chip was just jacked and it was like super powerful i didn't know it was all not backwards compatible so so to deal with backwards compatibility meaning to deal with applications that wouldn't be able to use this new technology what they did is they run the old applications on emulators yeah yeah yeah yeah you didn't know that really crazy dude yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so fun part is that the ability applications are actually running faster than the actual intel application no way dude wait what'd you say so you see emulated emulated apps are running way more faster than the original apps which are used in the intel mobile yeah so like they need the new yeah the new ones are just running a lot more faster yeah so let's see the m1 chip is an air on processor not x86 processor it integrates more components than an intel cpu yeah together you see so that's why it has to has to run it differently double one one also integrates around the same package it features rosetta dynamic binary translation the tube boasts eight cpu cores in addition to the integrated gpu it is manufactured using five nanometer processors that has 16 billion resistors that's a lot of resistors actually um dude that's jacked bro that's all that's that's crazy crazy i actually didn't know that was what was going on man yeah no bro yeah that's awesome we have do you want a person one person abrar in the clubhouse let's go yeah let's just talk to him let's see go ahead and wait to sleep he's i feel like david should be able to just pop up to the top yeah yeah david dear what's up my friend what are you saying bro [Laughter] m1 um noncompatible double applications too good to be true plenty so they're not compatible yes respond you have to check i want capability for a mac with this yeah there is no app that is not compatible with it there's the rosetta which does the heartbreak yes there's a lot like even photoshop is compatible as now yeah yeah i i mean it's going to take them time it's going to take time for all these applications to be compatible but yeah uh for those those that are not compatible it's ready running rosetta stone rosetta stone to be able to make them competitive basically it's an emulator rosetta stone i think it's called rosetta stone what is that what it's that something totally called or is that a rosetta stone is like to learn a language dude you want to pick up spanish you get the rosetta stone somebody says no doubt apple's worth 2.23 trillion dollars yes i i i would not be um yeah it is worth a lot i will say guys it is worth a lot a lot exactly but just dropped that i don't look at that i don't look at i don't look at the short uh yeah i look at the long term the long term from apple has always been up so that to me doesn't matter too much exactly so let me see i mean short term after every apple even it drops so yeah emulator oh i just i just buy my apples from costco that's it looks apple silicon m1 mla x86 is still faster than every other mac and single core benchmark no [ __ ] way wow that's insane the first native benchmarks of apple appeared on the green bench uh site last week showing impressive native performance today new benchmarks have begun showing up for the m1 chip emulating x86 under rosetta two separate other two is what what what it's called right yes um so let's take a look at it thank you intel for playing yeah good luck good luck so we have what so the eight chords are the what the that's crazy wow what's up what's up no there's a ssd problem in this mac like the swap usage is waste way too much and people are complaining about this is getting degraded quickly really that's interesting yeah but the swap usage is only only big if you are doing heavy workload and you only have the eight gigabyte ram version so if you have the 16 it's all good yeah i mean i didn't have any issues but people on twitter are just going like boom like yeah yeah yeah yeah i've never had this max so the new rosetta 2 geekbench results uploaded showed that the m1 chip running a macbook air with 8 gigs of ram has a single core and multiscores of one thousand hundred and five thousand eight hundred eighty three respectively since this version of geekbench is running through apple's translation layers are the two an input performance as to be expected reset the two running x86 appears to be achieving 78 percent the performance of native apple silicon code wow that's crazy despite the impact on performance the single core resulted to rise up to scores though still outperforms any other intel mac including 2020 no [ __ ] way so basically we need to get the m1 oh yeah what are we doing bro let's go get the m1 get the m1 chip put it on everything i mean i mean my macbook is doing great is yours m1 no no it's intel damn but yeah funny story about a funny story about my funny story i kind of actually actually tell the story yeah it kind of came free by surprise surprise anyways yeah so uh okay cool cool cool that's awesome yeah so yeah so what do you think about i'm very curious like what what do you think about you know where this m1 chip is going to go this m1 um you know um like what are they doing to the industry the next thing is the m2 bro obviously i have two i mean i get it i get it but like what do you think is gonna happen like because i think what i've done is something really interesting right uh they've completely outperformed any any other what's it called um you know processor processor out there pretty much right um yeah but if you think about it like they already have it in the iphone in the ipad like it's the same architecture yeah like every other phone is there that's true that's true they have it in the in the iphone they add in and so forth i just think that what's really cool for me is just seeing the future of this right because yeah the thing is the thing is this just kind of showed everybody how intel sucks right so um exactly right i need to i mean intro could do it too i mean or maybe this can lead to intel creating their own computer like in their future plans they don't have any um based processor in the in the coming years like they have just announced it wait wait what are you saying what are you saying i mean they don't plan to make armbased chips in like the near future oh they don't plan to make any more processors in the near future no no our arm arm base like this this kind of process like the m1 because right now like like you said uh the ram and the processor is on the same chip with the m1 yeah and and and intel is only selling standalone chips and that's why that's why it gets outperformed interesting interesting oh look at what they just released by the way look at the they released it the ipad pro got an update right there so the ipad pro m1 chip 12.9 inch liquid retina xdr that's on with center stage what is that supposed to mean dude that's like the firm facing camera is gonna follow you if you move around and when you are on facebook do you see this bro the animations the amazing so good but i mean it's all software because it's an ultraviolet camera and they just softwarebased like crop in focus hold on hold on david david we're we're talking about the ui experience here on this on this on this on this website look at this this is by far the most insane experience i've ever had oh [ __ ] wow oh my god it gets better wait wait wait oh oh oh oh oh omg on the last one bro omg 5g omg oh my god guys who think this is who who thinks who wants to see this clone guys it might be like a video playing in the background when you scroll it wow oh that's a good point do you hear what he said yeah what's up what's up it's just a video i don't think it's i don't know no it's not really because it look it's scrollable you see so like i don't know i don't think yeah oh you think so like that you can scroll it and i'll pull up the code again pull up the code again doesn't see it looks like it's a video let's see we're gonna test it by looking at the code oh no it's an image no these are all images that are just this is all crazy animations all right this is sticky overflow do you see anything changing cause i don't see anything anything changing in terms of matrix wise bro they're hiding it they're good they're [ __ ] good as well i'll tell you like yeah because what we're looking at right now is just all these animations that are going on when you when you're on the ipad page and there's just there's just honestly how are you doing hi hold on you gotta invite them bro chill i thought cause my dance teacher by the way oh listen she's at my dance teacher in uh in michigan nice this is awesome wow i know she left it's cause the people that join us in clubhouse yeah yeah if they're coming from not from youtube like from clubhouse yeah they don't know we're just on youtube experiencing this i think we just have to figure out like a better integration with cl like i love the fact that we could bring people into clubhouse like atari and then just have a conversation we have to figure out something there with the audio video okay i think i mean i mean because he also sees everything a couple seconds behind than we do that is sure true that's true but you know we'll figure something out that's okay we'll fix it so it looks like we're looking right now it says faster performance and and graphics the 8 core cpu m1 delivers up to 50 percent faster what i'm curious about is actually not this processor speed i'm not just curious about the battery life on this thing damn look at all those it's more than like two days like it's two days my my board my macbook pro doesn't die i mean it never dies i feel like i feel like the ipad would last what's up man i'm doing great how are you guys then chilling out on clubhouse i guess yeah on youtube too oh [ __ ] you guys are on youtube yeah yeah you just got recorded cussing on youtube amanda good job oh [ __ ] do you see this so what's going on is it moving hold on as he's moving it's moving the camera yeah that's what david that is so smart yeah that's what i said oh [ __ ] you guys are watching the apple event huh yeah like the imac like that's the best thing like yeah yeah yeah this is awesome this is so good i love this portion so lighter the lighter scanner measures how long it takes light to reflect back from objects so they can create a depth map of any space you're in and unlock immersive immersive with immersive ar experiences and it works with the powerful asp to market guys if by the way guys if you guys have any questions let us know in the comments below we'll definitely be able to you know we'll definitely uh talk with you about that so a thunderbolt a port that's ready to rumble that's interesting that's interesting for sure let me see what's my next call my next close by one thirty so i'm good okay thunderbolt ported to rumble yeah thunderball is just crazy i will say that it's a crazy crazy insane is this a thunderbolt now you got the m1 on an ipad what the hell is better oh they finally have the the white version of the keyboard damn i don't think did they have the white version of the keyboard beforehand or no yeah it's a new it's new it's a new one right hell yeah yeah that's awesome now their keyboards have like touch id for the imacs yeah wow i mean we have that right now so like that's what this is right here but it's not as cool as this one wow it doesn't have an animation with it yeah i also see a lot of future in the ipad west sn2 by the way like i now use my ipad as a macbook as a computer now because like i can do the whole command space searching i can shift normally between different different things like you know like this stuff right here i can shift normally it's so it's so seamless it's so easy like it's literally almost like you're making it it's literally almost on my microphone like damn okay i can have my windows open everything something you said now with the m1 you could be like color grading videos and video editing stuff there's a new reconfiguration offers more two terabytes [ __ ] dude go to the pricing bro let's let's let's jack it up and see how let's do it gonna do it the most expensive one what do we got here 12.9 inch okay so first of all let's do some spaces two terabytes two terabytes let's that will only decrease the cost that won't decrease two thousand two thousand four hundred that's not bad oh my god sonny said do you know what library to use to make these cool transitions i mean i mean you know there's multiple libraries you can use we can definitely definitely do like a podcast at some point to figure out what library you can use together something like this yeah do you know there's like a video editing library for javascript what's up there is a video editing library for javascript oh yeah i know i i thought it was coming out coming out recently um it was like wait what was that name actually i couldn't remember that's so cool we had like five people we have my thumb people come and go come on guys oh someone just jumped on where oh he did oh man thank him who's maitam do i know you dude we went to uh we all done together we had uh me you and um that was a steve and robert [Laughter] oh [ __ ] damn it's been a while it's bad amazing no remember holy [ __ ] how you doing man i'm doing really good i uh still in the blocking world are you still in the blockchain world dude that's crazy she's absolutely not are you in dogecoin you know like i every time i'm like you know i should put money in it i'm literally working in this business bro just put the [ __ ] money into it man don't wait gotta gotta learn how to take rent i put in uh let me see i put it myself i put in 500 into into dosh coin and then show them the money i put into 100 i mean it is currently i put in 500 it is i am up 2 800 right now damn son that's all right that's crazy that's not bad huh i mean that's pretty good that's not bad at all i mean compared to some people who have like eighty thousand dollars you know that's up you know so like you make some crazy cash on this i'm like what the hell i know i mean just didn't say 500 and you got like 2008 2 800 from the yeah right 2 800 return yeah yeah yeah yeah black magic of something yeah it was literally what is it like a third of a cent like a month ago like two months ago and now it's thirty three steps i think it will go up to a dollar you think so what do you think i mean you you choice i mean i mean daniel you trade stocks here daniel yeah i don't i don't trade crypto though ah it's the same [ __ ] it's the same stuff it's the same thing i mean not same stuff but you know but yeah yeah the market is the market the market is the market yeah i mean i don't know go ahead [Laughter] circle church he was just collecting the commissions that's what he was doing not going to that axis so now guys so guys raise your hand here uh who is a believer in in in uh in coins when you say raise your hand here crypto are you tying youtube are you talking clubhouse you too and clubhouse you can raise your hand too right oh yeah you could raise your hand on clubhouse you can raise your hand you see so raise your hand on android i cannot change my hand but yeah here we go do you believe in crypto i'm on android i'm gonna do that thing yeah yeah blockchain's pretty dope yeah yeah so methamphetamine why why are you so why are you so into crypto tell me okay so first of all i've wanted to get out of script for a while and give it to ai dude the money's too good it's just like i'm like i hate what i do and i want to move but like they sell cash in my face i'm like god damn it again wait what do you what are you still what are you still doing because i i remember the last time is that you were traveling around like europe or some or some something i remember and you were and you had you were like you were doing i could already forgot you do consulting for some guy and crypto or some some stuff like that correct what i actually meant making like a long time ago back when we were doing some stuff with robert and steve actually like guys how are you finding me robert was on the youtube live call yesterday it's crazy you're on clubhouse today with me i need to get steve on here now you got the uh people yeah yeah yeah wow isn't he already on what's up i think these are let me look at i think steven is following me yeah yeah yeah yeah but anyways so what do you what do you do right now tell me mathem okay so back back in the day i used to do like straight ups about mixing if you want to build something on ethereum i would say that like temporary project manager role right um i gotta come up with a lot of banks like traditional institutions and these guys were like all across europe all across asia i went to korea a few times lived in europe for like about a year um so that was like that was living the highlight but dude i spent like every amount of money i made i just spent a party wait you split you spent on what partying partying like yeah oh so you're a party all the time i was partying like here's the thing if you want to become a consultant it's not about what you know about who you know and the way i got science was straight up going to party and meeting these like crypto guys and like having fun with them and then like if they like you they'll give you their business so so so what did you say in terms of because in terms of consulting did you basically basically help them start a coin like have their own you know ico you you know what what did you have them start with initially with ico ico sure okay but then what i transitioned into was helping helping traditional institutions get out of blockchain yeah and that might have included like one of my olympic clients was they wanted to build an exchange for tokenized securities like poker night stocks tokenized companies chairs and they needed to be fcc regulated and they also needed to work with blockchain so bridging that gap between regulation and blockchain technology was kind of my job yeah let's see what you like i literally went read like act like like law passed by congress like straight up started reading like 500 pages and kind of like talked with both the bullyers and the technology guys come up with a plan yeah um so it was getting a pretty good knowledge how much let me ask this question how much were you making how much will we make it per month on the consulting i was i remember 14 20 sometimes 20 000 that was for one year though yeah so 20 000 a month you're making from consulting on uh ico

in like you look at your linkedin profile you're uh dude i i knew you're always like you're you're always saying how you want to teach people i remember that i really had that fire you need to do it yeah and you're doing that right yeah yeah that's what we do is we now we now teach people what basically some somebody said mr beast is here oh let's go mr beast [Laughter] yeah like i mean it's it's been crazy it's been one of my for some reason from one of my goals in life has always been to teach for some reason i don't know why but and and i loved it and because my mom was actually a teacher when i was in her belly like when i was just pregnant with me she was teaching damn so it's in your bed bro it's literally in my blood you know and then i kind of started out that would make sense why not as a really good teacher like he's he from the womb he got the teaching skills exactly exactly and it was crazy you know what's crazy is that i went um at one point i think two months ago i was talking with my mom and we kind of shared our experiences in terms of how our teaching styles and we didn't know this but apparently we have the exact same teaching styles mean her oh [ __ ] yeah you picked them up from the womb bro from you from anybody in your in your by the way uh david not daniel [ __ ] david's not here daniel anybody from your you know from your family does like engineering it's like that i mean not like my whole family's engineering bro your whole family is yeah oh really yeah interesting all of them now it's starting to make sense it's like my dad and my grandson and everybody has been in sales and marketing now it makes everything adds up really for me because i love more marketing than software development it's interesting it's different here it's different here my parents are doctors but i'm not there you go you change that you change the game you change the game be like nope not going you're out not good by the way who knows before the i'm curious for the apple that we have madonna today was it live or was it like uh people in there um no it was i think like it was like a prerecorded because you guys do you guys know how good these prerecorded ones are they're [ __ ] amazing let me show you it's not like a hollywood movie is it really hollywood is it really that good let's watch it yeah and uh too good and there was a scene where that guy went let's just watch it together hold on hold on hold on is there is there any audio here or no i hope there is i mean we cannot see anything clubhouse look at this wow all these animations this is insane what music oh there you go oh that's not that that's that no oh it is that holy moly look at this so they basically wow this is a new campus or what yeah this is a new campus yeah yeah oh my god it's so good first event after the challenges of this past year optimistic that brighter days are just in front of us okay let's see as we move forward we feel it's important that apple continues to make a difference in people's lives through our products and our values yes so we're glad you could join us today for some exciting updates and i love it this week martial i thought they did it outside it's really cool and i couldn't be more proud of the environmental initiatives and commitments at the air tech today yeah apple is global corporate operations with all of our offices stores and data centers running on 100 renewable energy wow and by 2030 apple will be 100 carbon neutral across our entire endtoend footprint including our supply chain and the use of our products that's cool this month i love the little german sounds in partnership with conservation international and goldman sachs this pioneering new investment fund will provide returns that are measured not only financially but by the tons of atmospheric carbon removed by each investment our goal is to remove more than one million tons of carbon every year at apple that was a lot of value they drive us it's like he's trying to read the next line because he probably has a prompter you know and more enjoyable and like no i'd like to turn to something like no editor do the whole thing beginning with apple car i do it with apple card we set out to completely reinvent the credit card i didn't enable so good to live a healthier finance love it what's the difference our customers are like i can really see my monthly like transactions where i spend most of my money like the most successful categories so good i love it one of the things that became apparent to us in the beginning was a lack of fairness in the way the industry calculated credit scores i don't know when there were two holders of a credit card real quick one got the benefit of and then turn up the volume again nathan what we're saying nathan what are you saying oh i said i use the wallet the apple wallet i don't know functionality no no we're talking about the apple cart it's a little bit different so what's the apple wallet that's usually if a wall is just your normal standard apple wallet you can put your credit cards in there your credit card so if i if i double click on this thing see you've got all these apple i have look at this from my apple cart i have got 443 dollars from cashback cash because it's three percent yeah cash back it's three percent cash back three percent cash back on things like you buy from apple and a few other different things like oh but what's like the regular cash back two percent two percent oh [ __ ] that's not bad enough that's really good actually that's right so yeah so like 400 look i got 450 cashback cash back damn bro that's insane anyways let's continue on yeah building a good a really credit history what do you what do you say nathan sorry if you guys want a really good credit card american express blue cash preferred gives you six percent back on groceries oh wow um i've been using that dude it's it's just printing money oh gotcha gotcha gotcha interesting yeah for sure okay for sure for sure money man print that money these credit cards i love it but yeah it's pretty cool i think what they've done so like well i do like really like the air tech and stuff like that i think that's really cool that would be awesome wow wow wow wow listen i'm gonna i'm gonna let me know definitely come back come in come back okay all right awesome cool well i mean i think this has been a uh a fun one we have definitely you know this epi one is really interesting i think we've talked about the m1 chip i think there's a lot of future with that you know that that's gonna go forward um i'm really excited about where the future heads out with all these like uh you know more m1 products i'm on i mean apple's really kind of really kind of gotten really good at what they're doing with other products however i really hope they don't like they make the macbook pro colorful like how they did the imac bro you don't like it no man i just don't like it so is that the only negative review you have right now just the just the colors just the color what do you think i don't know man maybe i'm sad they don't have the pink color bad news they are going to redesign the macbooks later this year no man don't tell me that come on and and they are going to remove the dirty bar that's fine i hate the touch bar yeah i don't use it i don't use it at all but yeah i don't lose at all but anyways yeah i think i think yeah i mean what usually happens is we we usually we say we usually say something about it something bad and then we usually get used to it right away normalize it that's usually what happens so you know you kind of have to something to set the trend sometimes for like for example the usb thunderbolt right that became like a like a trend right pretty much anything else became a trend right so um i think just a matter of you know just a matter of time that's it so that's that's recapping this whole podcast trendsetter yeah what's up companies follow apple so if they are going to bring out this colorful max then every single company would bring the same laptop yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes awesome guys we're going to come back
