what I'm trying to tell you here is more than just a lesson it's a story when I started my path on this journey there was nothing for me but confusion you have to understand that programming wasn't something that came naturally to me it took a long time and it was a lot of pain it was then that I had this idea why does everybody have to go through the same pain that I did why can't learning for them be easy I took it upon myself to build my own educational system for computer programming and teach it to every one of you after all if of all the people I could do it so Q acts clever programmer you don't learn through boring lectures you learn through handson interactive exercises engaging lessons you collaborate with other students in the community to brainstorm ideas because here you're not just another frustrated student who doesn't get help our community cares for you so what are you waiting for go enroll now and see how it can change your life
