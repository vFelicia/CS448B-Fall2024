this can be commandv okay manager we're gonna come and enter oh yeah I didn't check it the last time all right there you go most important part of coding with your girlfriend's is taking kisi breaks that's right the most important part yeah now with that said Kitty rate let's jump to it what's up guys this is Kazi here from clever programmer calm i'm here today with my girlfriend and we're gonna be trying something new i'm here with what's up guys this is sugar siya great thanks so I'm here with sugar Shah so this is gonna be really interesting because gonna be a pro boxer trying to learn how to code alright so we're gonna we're gonna try to code with her let's see how far she gets and then we don't try we do we just do so we tried one time to code before on an airplane yeah but that was about it on a second so today we'll do it for like two seconds okay okay yeah yeah and we're gonna be capturing your live reaction to coding okay this is actually very kind of cool because then you can actually see it you know a week from now a month or a year from now credit code yeah and now my name is Amber Lee turtle that's right oh yeah we'll drop that as a link underneath the video so you guys can actually see that okay okay so let's get started okay now the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start drawing with a turtle you remember the turtle yeah okay so we're gonna learn visually this way you get to learn I get to learn and hopefully somebody who's watching this to learn yeah alright hopefully the turtle has a great time yeah and we're not gonna do it oh yeah and we're not gonna do it in a boring way yeah okay so let's start the first thing we're gonna do is like import the turtle okay what is that that's like basically we didn't have access to him now we have access to play with them yeah that's it alright I like animals baby yeah you do yeah okay I I like most animals every animal except my dog yeah that's true okay just kidding I like him okay okay alright let's continue OOP dodged that one alright so let's create a let's create your turtle okay so let's go ahead and call it my underscore turtle so go ahead yeah type it okay my remember kids variables you don't have to put a space if you can't have spaces in there there you go uh and then you what you want to do is like my turtle yeah and then you want to set this variable to something so we're creating a variable okay this is gonna be like this is where the turtle is gonna be stored so we do this and then we put an equal sign equal a space space and now here we put like turtle turtle so this is like one of those weird ominous lines but this actually goes ahead and creates your turtle I think hopefully hopefully you think yeah but you are the king so let's hit run and see if we get any errors we didn't get any error so it looks like we did a good job great job baby okay now we start doing things with the turtle so remember we could move the turtle forward to the left or backward right so let's try to move the turtle forward okay okay that's fine we'll figure it out right now so type in my underscore turtle so that's like your turtle and then can I just click E yep you can click and then I'll just go and now dot dot and now you can say forward forward yep and put in parenthesis yep and just type in like 100 the word or the number yep and do command enter so I can hit room so basically just hit run that command enter his run on replica this thing that we're using so okay so you just went forward right yeah now what we want to do is you want to make a square so if we want to make it square like let's sectionally just learn how to turn him for a second okay yeah so the two turns to type my turtle again and then dot yeah just hit enter oh really yep dot dot and let's go make him turn right 90 degrees so do right right and then parenthesis uhhuh oops that's not a friend Francie's 90 that's it and then I'm gonna hit command and direct like yep that's it [ __ ] yes oh he turn I saw him now like you breakdance on his head yes that's right it looks like he's doing like yeah yeah I forget what they're all windy papa where they're having a competition are you serious no I think it's just I couldn't think of it actually are you serious windmill dance move let's look it up you know oh wow that's it you're actually right now was it yeah that's actually what the turtle [ __ ] did yeah I did a windmill okay now let's make it okay now so you have this and now I'm gonna challenge you okay baby I like a good challenge just using these two commands this is all you know you don't know anything else right now using those two can you go ahead and make a square can you make him make a square this is tricky you shouldn't get this because we haven't made a square yet I'm just gonna you do it you do it go ahead okay and you can take a few tries you have to get it right now I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that my underscore turtle uhhuh dot I'm gonna go forward again you can see already turning frenzy okay Iran perfect okay great he went forward yeah we have very important this and that yeah that's it and it's very important like all of us test your code incrementally so what she just did is actually something very intelligent she doesn't even know what she did she was practicing it but every line of code she's actually writing she's hitting run intuitive that's really really that's really good this call for a kisi break okay excuse me my way about busy coding here now okay we're gonna make him do a windmill again all right oh no he's messing up okay keep going don't pay attention to me well you're fluffing my hair come to me hard not to pay attention when you're flipping my hair okay now we're gonna do my okay uhhuh we just click on it cuz Jess it okay and now we're gonna go right again okay we're making all right turns and right angles actually to make this turn that's right okay so we're gonna go over that's right okay we're gonna we're gonna run it come on enter uhhuh and we're gonna see he did a windmill beautiful so now we're gonna mentally check that code that's my baby running so now you don't have to keep on typing it over you can copy and paste it okay just like highlight this if you uh huh and then just two lines Nancy the copy I'm gonna command C to copy and then like go somewhere and then command V to paste beautiful I was wondering why did they put V for paste I never understand that's actually stupid well the only thing that I can ever understand is like it's close to C so there's like a man C command B but it should be command P like it really should be command P buy a copy and paste but copying them yeah okay now that's gonna make three sides so we need to do that again okay so it's already copied so we're just going to return and make sure you paste it and hit enter oh yeah I didn't check it the last time all right there you go oh I heard update is weird wow this calls for a kiss here eh that's really really great I did it good job okay that's yeah and Bachman break yeah thanks he teaches me coding and I teach you in boxing know what we should do in between our coding sessions like why we do a kisi break or something like that we can also do like a like holding the myths and like boxing break and then cut back to the training we could be switching back and forth between the two because pivot II inspires brain sexual like that's an appropriate for encoding video yes all right not when it comes to popup that's right it's way too obvious so what I you to you you have to do it like real cool just like no but not not just too much like all I do is I like to be very subtle so I'll display I know and that's so sexy and that's my Nine's okay I always just say the words winkwink nudgenudge alright now that we have made a square these lines of code made the square right yes okay from line 6 to 16 yeah we can actually do is we can give this thing an 8 and then we can just refer back to that name so for example we can call this thing we can call it like turtle Square maker yeah and then whenever we say whatever it doesn't matter but if we create turtle square maker and hit enter it'll make a square every time okay so what do you want to call instead of that I want to call it um we're now entering the world of functions kids I want to call it silly square all right so here's what you're gonna do you're gonna set define d EF not full so just do D yet and the hit space most def so yeah space and then do whatever you set silly square but it has to be one word okay and yeah we like alliteration open closed paren what there that's it okay all the way and at the end of that make sure you put a colon go outside of that how do I do that yep all right now it is that a colon yeah this is a colon that's correct goal from line 6 to 16 drag it off from line 6 to 16 I'm gonna drag from line 6 to 16 and then just hit tab to indent it beautiful now hit command enter come on okay now nothing should happen nothing happened all we've done is they've just given this a name close to the square yeah in other words we've actually created in technical terms and nerdy terms we've created a function okay now whenever we call that function a function is that a song yeah we just got you're trying to function yeah baby come on efore tea and stuff I don't really know those attached the guys you know Drake and stuff all those okay so silly square is a function silly square is a function all right and you can call that function by just saying its name that's it so if you say its name Oh silly square if you say it's the thing with open closed paren ya know call it this sees why do you just say for in it's too much work so yes do you all nerds say prayer no the cool people said friend I think it sounds like parental parental choice okay so let's call the function let's do it let's call the function now how I just said I spoken not you got to type it in silly oh there he goes and to open close all right what do ideas vary there it is and now hit command enter oh my god there he goes the silly square yep and what would happen if you want to make so let's say that we do my turtle dot forward again uhhuh by 100 and let's say that after it travels 100 oh actually that was what I think you want to go let's do that let's not turn him again right yeah you see what I'm what I kind of did or not you you went for it again I was gonna say up but it's just for it again yeah so you see how when I was so voice instead of turning him because he was turning right here yes so then so all I did was remove this line now he doesn't turn right there anymore he doesn't straight we took one windmill in turn so instead he stopped facing north and then we went short 100 so he continued north that's right now we're making a skyscraper okay so we've made one square now can we make another square how would we make another square if we wanted to like if we want to make a square right here yeah we'll just repeat okay so do it okay but I can't just put silly square why not well you already have one guy up there then he's gonna go like all the way back today but okay but would that make a square yeah okay let's do it here we go operation silly squares and dirt openclose openclose oops and hit command okay let's see what's gonna happen guys he goes up oh my god he went way too far because he starts off by for room 100 okay so you made another square yeah but that's there's a space in the square what space well yeah so so okay so what we can do is I can remove this line and then that space won't be there anymore I can just do it like that right and then you can call it again and then yeah okay so every time you say silly square it goes through these lines of code then when you say silly square it goes through this line of code again all of these lines so now he's facing this riccati daily square he's gonna go this would give it a try see what okay let's give it a try guys silly square paren mmhmm okay here we go he makes one silly square and goes up it makes my square and goes over I mean another silly square and what would happen if we did it one more time then here we go forward down and make another silly squared okay and then guys it's gonna be like we're making takes a cube like a window basically oh it's a window yeah so give it a try okay one more silly square and then we do the paren 1 squared done whoop another square done over 1 9 s squared 9 down another square done okay guys we made a full window job great job ok so that's pretty dope you have so you pretty much got this figured out how does this feel so far for you to code this up and does this seem like something that's really really hard no it seems manageable it doesn't like stress me out and you know I get like technological anxiety yeah so it doesn't stress you out that much that's really good that's fun actually because you get this like you make something happen yeah that's kind of cool yeah yeah it's like pretty because if I like suck at art I mean I don't I don't know but like I feel I like drawing and stuff but I don't feel like something actually happens when I do it yeah but when you code even if you're coding for your first time you can actually make something happen yeah well I I think I like it cuz it's like like in boxing you don't get immediate results and nobody's you don't get immediate results so it's like satisfying because you get like you just type something really quick and like 1 second later it's something's happening even like you made it do that right kind of empowering like it's true I [ __ ] did it that's true that's true and like just happens right away yeah and then you can see it if there's a mistake you fix it right away yeah yeah so you don't have to like like in boxing you have to go like review video and see what I did wrong in sparring stuff and then it takes a weeks to fix errors that are ingrained in me because I'm not a computer run so you can fix these things so fast I think that's cool yeah like even when I was when I went to Train ping pong like table tennis with my coach he actually said that it would actually be better if I hadn't been playing yeah because I had formed such poor habit I have it but there's no way to detect them sometimes there's no way to know and and the results are right of your skill developing takes so long yeah and you don't really see and experience anything kind of happening immediately another thing I don't know if you know but you could actually you could actually extend this link this over here to literally your mom and when she'd go sit she clicks the button run it like do that no way right so if you actually put color in there where it like fills up each square with like green color orange color red color or something you could send it to somebody or whoever it right and then hit it and then it'll like fill up those colors dad you know so it's like I feel that you could do a lot of these things really really quickly now that's good that you feel a little bit more confident how do you feel if how what did you feel like coding was and after doing this what does it feel like to you now hmm coding felt like alien language right like it's not real like how can you just make something later where do you even go to make something good like what how do you know like what to type in like how can you just put words and then the computer knows it action like I don't know right I can't I couldn't like grasp the concept yeah and it just seemed like especially for me somebody who doesn't even like I mean you know technology kind of like is overwhelming to me like even setting up like internet or capable or like something like you know like going through process of doing something it's like really stressful for me and but this was now now I like understand it more it's a lot of repetition which I like you guys like boxing training all that stuff is repetition yeah I love that and so I feel like you can learn as you go yeah yes now I see it's not alien language right yeah I you know because I see it in action yes yeah so now it's not so scary yep and now it was like a real thing yeah so still crazy to me it's like no mind boy still really crazy right yeah I'd like to think like this is just okay like all these lines just to make like this little window yeah like people make full like graphics and websites and like apps and like yeah it's like endless opportunities of stuff and like you can never stop learning right yeah crazy you can't you can keep going forever even you know another thing we can even do one time is like create a website together yeah we can create like a simple looking website yeah together but yeah such Illium alienlooking language in the start then you start getting used to it but you're right it's like a pet it's like patterning action once you start seeing it many more times but like all it's a function all I'm just calling a function it's like the same thing like that makes a square but we're here learning visually in teachers in school you know how they actually teach this yeah they teach it with [ __ ] math and numbers and formulas so for example if you are wrong here right and if you make a mistake yeah I don't even have to tell you your Square will loom yeah with a square right it will look like not something else he'll go in a wrong direction he'll go in the wrong direction right and so in that case we'll end up happening is you will instantly know whether that's right or wrong in school when it's some math formula or you're supposed to get some number you're not even gonna know you're wrong like instead of getting seven point eight six six six seven two three as your answer you'll get like five point two five six six as your answer and you'll be like huh why am I wrong I don't understand you see and literally like don't even understand how while you're talking about like using math to do this like I don't write this and itself is crazy then I mean how do you do what I don't know doing like all kinds of physics problems you know it's like if your mom weighs hundred and ten pounds and she falls off the [ __ ] plane how long will it take her to hit the floor yeah they don't actually give you a special price yeah but like similar you're not the idea similar it's like Oh a rock falls from the roof and the gravitational pull is like whatever and I don't know how to figure that out like I would have to look it up and I have to look up or how much gravity is and I would why do you need that for coding well because then what you can do is you can just put in like somebody's body weight and it'll instantly tell you how long it takes them to hit the floor or how long it is it's like so morbid but how long it takes that thing to hit the floor so you'd create this program though automatically like all this calculator you know for example if you want to check your like body mass index yeah or you want to check like what how much percentage body fat do I have well we can actually code up something religions like how would you figure it out normally what's the recipe to figure it out do you would tell me what's your body weight Yeah right never that's not none of that's accurate to test your body I know but like the normal formula it would to be something like you would give me your body weight then maybe you'd give me how much fat you have and then I give you back I'll like calculate it I'll go through these series of steps and I'll be like this is the body fat percentage yeah right well I could just have it caught it up so then as soon as you put in your body fat into it and then you put your weight it instantly just tell you yeah so you have to go through the process over and over again every single time that sounds terrible right but that's the boring way of how a lot easy chip the teaching numbers wouldn't it be cooler if they taught it where you went to like Instagram right and they were like well Instagram is actually made with code yeah when you hover over and the screen turns like that you got my followers good job baby thank you when you hover over like that that's actually somebody coded that in to be like oh when somebody hovers over show the number of likes and show the number of comments how cool right if I click into this somebody's coded it up so then it shows like my three hundred and seventy others right but if it's somebody who's really closely following Kazi then when they like it show their name next you see what I'm saying yeah so that's called a frontend user interface so it's like somebody's coding that up and if they're giving examples like that I soak so much cooler and if we're working on projects where we're building a clone of this you'll be like even I don't even if I don't understand every single line of code I get what we're doing and then you'll keep trying to work towards doing it versus this is a right formula that's not an answer you should get well especially for me because I'm an athlete and stuff like handson is way better like visual handson like learning through errors like this way and you're seeing it like way easier for me like doing a formula I'll quit before you write yeah that's a terrible way to teach I think well maybe not for some people I can't say that but like I don't learn that way I'm guessing most people that are like millennia and what's this new generation Gen X yeah yeah I don't know whatever they are these little [ __ ] um everybody is used to like everything visual and you know screens and all this stuff so like I don't think they're gonna learn that way you do yeah yeah I long as it's more physical and like everybody is a different learning style yeah you know for example for me my learning style is very different than yours yeah I can just sit down and focus for like 20 hours and I have to take it serious after your rings but then that's but then you can also do 20 [ __ ] rounds of boxing and one you know or ten rounds of boxing in one session 18 to 20 right Christ so you can do that and keep going and stay focused on that over the course of months and years so everybody just a different learning style is very kinetic and it has to be respected your learning style has to be respected this [ __ ] system of the academic world where you have to learn the exact same way that like the other person has to learn the exact same way I have to learn like I remember I'd be sitting in a chemistry class and this old ass teacher she was trying to teach us something and she was terrible at her job like nobody ever learned anything from her I'm serious like you know and so I am like okay I can't learn from her so I opened up my laptop to learn on my own and take my own notes and she's like just what are you doing with the laptop she's like put the laptop away and I'm like like just watching porn man yeah I'm like I'm actually learning like I'm looking up the things yeah like supplementing if she's like it's not watching movies I like I'm not watching [ __ ] she stopped then I put it away and then it was like I couldn't learn from her she wouldn't let me learn yeah she just wanted us to all learn the same way and it's just [ __ ] yeah yeah and hey we will try to put you in a box and then and then it's frustrating you just don't want to do it anyway you're a boxer and you barely even watch you didn't even watch the Pacquiao fight don't forget last no but what I'm saying is that's great yeah like everybody is a different way to learn and think like you're not even learning from watching the fights you're just learning on your own in their own way of doing it with your coach and power and you became pro yeah I do watch some fights like to review stuff and like look at different styles but um mostly because I'm like so visual I don't really want somebody else's style stuck in my head in case it doesn't work for me mmhmm which is why I mean that's not why I don't it's some busy which is I miss fight a lot yeah um but I yeah I learned more by tweaking my own style and like going through the motions and repetition yeah like handson repetition which is exactly this right well not this encoding the others um and then yeah like reviewing my own tape so that I'm like digesting and like visually seeing and fixing my own style in my own mistakes and like you do have to like study other fighters so you mean you can get inspiration from other places I do the same thing for acting I study other actors but at the end of the day like I don't want that to be my main source of inspiration or like I just don't want to like write you want to bring it from internal like yeah I don't want the external coming and I want the internal coming out you know I feel like it's much more like authentic way powerful so much more authentic way and then it's like you know that is actually crazy Kazi yeah I have to say something on that okay I was gonna say like then you know like then you can trust yourself because if everything's coming from internal like you know exactly how you're gonna throw this you know exactly how this is gonna feel you know your strengths and your weaknesses because and then you can be more confident in yourself I feel like because you're you know 1,000% like what's in you yeah not like oh I'm try to I'm gonna try to move my head like Mike Tyson but you've never really seen what works for you maybe that head movement doesn't work yeah and all you're doing is trying to be like this person be like this person be like this person you lose your own style maybe my style is cooler than Mike Tyson's damn calling out Mike Tyson but um I don't know you know everybody has so many different variables yeah did we do something with the variables here we did right here that's a very that's a variable then you kept calling that variable yeah calling out all my variables that's right okay yeah what were you I was gonna say that the the most important thing that you just said about the internal coming out rather than the external coming in when it has to come with content creation and everything and even making projects in code what I realize is as soon as I as soon as I list after the number one way for me to not make a video that day is when I get a idea for video to go and research it and see how everybody else has done it when I look at like eight or twelve other people doing the similar thing in videos that day is like I'd never do anything of my own because I'm along so much external to come in and it just bears heavy same thing when I'm doing a coding project I'm like I want to work on this and just get started I'm about to get started and I'm like let me go in like look at some notes some lecture some lessons some inspiration about design around this online and I go to look it up and then I'm like [ __ ] this I don't want to do it at all anymore because they're just too much external coming in instead of the internal to me yeah because also I think it makes you like secondguess yourself it's like oh well they did it this way that was successful yeah that was successful for them yes I do it that way but then you start bringing that in and you're like oh man now I have to switch my way and do it like that but it doesn't feel fun to do it their way because you're not them yeah so when you're not inspired anymore to do it your way because really when you're making your own content it's just you coming across because nobody's made such it like this you know and it just you and I just came up with this we're like let's just do it yeah yeah that's so [ __ ] cool but I see that like I'm I'm guilty do you come guilty people just things our like psychically connected right we so many inside jokes you can never keep up cute baby grandpa what was I saying oh I'm so guilty of this yeah he's always shadowboxing I'm so guilty of like yeah going online like what I'm gonna maybe not just what I'm gonna post something games but like if I'm just like scrolling and I start to see people that are like Fitness people they're doing similar things like I want to make fitness videos and I'm like looking at their stuff I'm like oh I see their exercises I'm like well well maybe my exercises that I was gonna do aren't good enough and then I like yeah I'm like hmm I should wait until I have better ideas so I never put the videos out like I never make it happen so it's just completely like stifles your progress and you creates a video a beautiful sound likes people yeah but it does stifle when you look out for external yeah when I'm about to create content I literally put myself in a [ __ ] cave I don't know is I can't reach you on the phone yeah you can't reach me on the phone or something where I have a lot of trouble that's why I don't even message you back I'll read your message and I won't even message you back because on boyfriend leaves me on read 100% dude and the reason why I'll do it is because even messaging you back [ __ ] me up even messaging you back put [ __ ] in my head weird like now my thoughts are like are you getting a different headspace yeah then I'm like a message you back that I'm waiting on your message because I'm expecting that you're gonna message me back then so really your energy is right and that I can't have that like what I'm creating I just cannot allow any consumption to come in it's almost like the assumption I look at it like poison in my body yeah you know yeah and if I don't feel that like balance of creation and versus consumption my creation is more I like want to actually puke like literally I want to throw up physically and for developers is so important to because they forget to create stuff you know it's like a boxer who never fights a developer who never creates is the same as a [ __ ] tree falling in the forest does it make a sound or not you never know right and if there's nobody to hear it there's nobody here how's with you go yeah you see what I'm saying yeah that's good but yeah you have to like be able to apply the skills that you have and like put them out yes and like spend that time on creating you know spend that time on like actually sparring yeah spend that time on did you literally don't know what you're capable of until you like put your skills into action yeah thank you have to take action right baby that's right yeah um yeah because like when I well I mean even and you never stop learning what you're capable and different things try different angles that's like a boxing thing um but you know it's like because even when I was okay so like say when I started boxing and I was just using bags and mates I didn't know distance of like how to reach a human face you know or people move there's a lot of variables so it's like okay it's not the same at all so when I started sparring I'm like okay now I know what I'm really capable of off the myths but then when you're sparring that's one level because that person is not actually trying to like win something or like you know actually maybe knock you out you're trying to learn during sparring yeah so then you go to the next level I fought amateurs it's like okay now I see you like what I'm made of like when there's pressure added like there's a timeless like you know it's it adds a lot more to see like what you can do with the skills when this is the scenario yeah then on then when you turn the girl there's no head gear ouch that hurts a little bit more to get hit it's like now how do you stay focused now are you testing your mental skills even more yeah when you get hit you know bare face and everything like that how do you stay in the game can your skills still stand up when you're thinking about holy [ __ ] I just got hit in the face like if I get hit again like that I could be on the canvas this could be it this could be the end of my career like there's a lot on the line so it's like the higher levels you go you have to keep like testing what you're capable of but the only way to do that is to do it like literally just do it then afterwards the payoff is so good cuz you're like wow I'm really capable of that so I can only imagine like I'm pretty proud of myself for making like squares a window with the turtle yeah oh and you should be this is awesome thanks baby yeah but I can't imagine like how badass I would feel if I like created something like on a website where like literally like you click and like something happens like or like that hover thing that you showed me on Instagram like but like if you create a like a function like that I can't even like I would feel like damn like I could like take over the world especially because coding is a skill that like you can pretty much run the world with like right so what is it Netflix like all these yeah all these things and I mean all the websites but like you're saying like I specifically with your Python stuff right it's like Python created Netflix right yeah that's
