hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm where you learn to code smarter let's jump right into it today alright we're gonna be building the tictactoe project I am so excited for this one I've been building up to this for so long and now you guys are gonna be on the same page with me and we're going to build a tictactoe game alright so let's just get started so let's come here and before I start talking about any of this let's just start off with what it's going to look like when you're done building it okay and you're going to be able to share this with everybody so it's getting pretty simple and here's what it's going to look like all right not the fanciest thing you've ever seen but hey it's something so you have three choices rockpaperscissors and you're playing against the computer okay so let's say we picked Rock the computer pick paper what just happened well paper beats Rock and so if you look at the computer score he got one and you still have zero you my friend are not a very good Rock Paper Scissors player let's try again alright we have to beat the computer so let's go Rock that's a tie that's pretty good I think that since the computer already picked Rock he's probably going to pick scissors next time so to prepare for scissors I'm gonna pick Rock boom listen okay so that was pretty awesome but that was not planned the game is not rigged at all it's supposed to be random but I'm pretty good at reading random computers let's see he picked scissors so maybe he's gonna pick scissors again let's stick with Rock oh he picked rock paper okay so he picked Rock we put picked paper we want we have a score of two the computer a score of one we can keep on going forever but I'm gonna end it for now okay so now let's talk about the actual project and what you need to do to get it to work as you can see here I have hidden these functions from you so choice two number number two choice random choice number and choice result those are the only four or functions that you need to complete in order to complete this entire project everything else I have done for you so you don't need to touch anything else okay you pretty much just need to complete those four functions and when you're done completing them your entire game will run another thing I've done to help you out is I've added some tasks so if you uncomment line 73 this line right here and run it and if your functions pass the test then most of your functions are correct some of the functions it's hard to write test for for example random computer choice if you're randomly generating choices it's kind of hard for me to test it all right so that one you kind of just have to do it correctly all right further explanation of the project so you have choice to number function what does that want well let's say I give you rock you should give me back one if I give you paper you should give me back two if I give you scissors you should give me back three all right what's the number choice functions job okay well if I give you a number like 1 you should give me back rock if I give you 2 you give me back paper and if I give you 3 you give me back scissors ok so both of those functions complement each other ok they're kind of the inverses of each other now let's talk about random computer choice function what does that do well the computer needs to be able to generate random choices ok so we need to use a random module that I've imported on line 5 I've also added some hints for you guys on how to use the random module so here if I show you guys the problem I have added some hints for you here ok so random computer choice so I want you to look up or random that choice does and how to use it in my solution video I'm gonna go through the whole solution so if you can figure it out you're going to learn anyways but I want you to be able to exercise some researching skills and develop your programs programmers ability of like solving things by researching it on google or Stack Overflow or something like that alright because that's important a lot of the times I'm on Stack Overflow Google trying figure out a problem so figure out how to use random that choice to make the computer randomly choose between rock paper and scissors okay let's go eat so it is just to give you a hint it's gonna be a one line solution like return random that choice and then pass in rock paper scissors computers going to return one of those every time okay now the choice result function is going to be the meat of the project that's going to be every it you know the whole logic of the project is pretty much going to be here so what's going on here well you have a computer score and human score which is up here the global variable maybe I'll explain that I'll explain that to you guys definitely in the solution but for now let's not worry so much about it just focus on not removing these lines when you come down here and you start coding this up well essentially what you're going to be doing in choice result is you're given the human choice and you're given the computer choice so using that you figure out who won so for example if human choice was rock and computer choice was paper well paper beats rock so in this case computer should win so actually I this should actually be this computer score is equal to like that okay so I'm sorry I had it wrong I'll fix it up when you guys get the link you'll have the fixed version so since paper beats rock computer score should be incremental by one whereas computer scores right here human score is also right here okay so then you can check hey if computer choice was I don't know whatever then you can increment based on that but what if it was a tie what if they both had the same thing well in that case you don't have to do any incrementing but you can just print tie or you don't even have to check for that condition okay so that's the simple answer to that how are you going to do choice result entirely up to you I would suggest doing bunch of if else if if type of statements okay so you're going to have bunch of if conditions you're going to check Rock against paper paper against rock what if human picks this and the computer picks that so you get to exercise some of your ifthen statements there is a clever way of doing it which I will explain to you guys in the solution video but for now just use your ifthen type of statements to do this okay choice the number number two choice I've kind of give you you guys an example of how to do it so you guys should be good on that and other than that I think you guys let's see what else I need to explain here test all yep just uncomment this and test some of your functions you know if you give choice number if you give it rock it should return zero if you give it paper it should return one and if I uh you know on the other hand bites first so pretty much number two choice if you give a zero it gives you rock if you give it one it should give you a paper everything else helps you all this stuff at the bottom is it helps make the GUI the graphical user interface of the project and it wraps up your logic in and makes it a part of the game okay so here if your code is not completed and you try to run the game you're gonna get back some stuff that that doesn't make much sense okay so it's not going to make sense but once you complete all of these functions the whole game is going to work perfectly and and you're gonna have essentially the game and it's gonna look like this okay all right guys hopefully that explains the entire project and what you need to do hopefully you have all the tools that you need to put this together and make the game if you make the game please put your links share your links using code sculptor you can click this button here that says save and when you hit save it generates a new link for you at the top okay so if I were to bring this guy down you can see it brought this link for me and you can go to that link and then see the entire code or play out the entire code okay sorry about that let's just bring this guy back at the top alright so that's how that works you generate that link post it in the comments below some of the things I want you guys to watch out for is if you hit command R or refresh it just removes the whole thing you have to be careful because code sculptor is in the browser and it doesn't save your code so if you hit save it'll give you that link and that link will help you but if you don't save and you hit refresh then all of your code just kind of goes away so watch out for refreshing randomly and yeah so safe continuous save a lot okay save constantly and then copy that link constantly so you can you can have that link just in case something bad happens okay and maybe even put this code locally gives you a download button so every few hours you're working on this maybe hit the download button so you can download it locally that way you're not in the risk of losing it okay after this we're going to work on some other really cool projects I have that in mind but for now focus all your energy on rockpaperscissors let's get it done post your codes below post your links below I'll have the notes to this problem below and I'll have the solution to this problem below if you're watching it on youtube okay if you're not watching this on if you don't want to watch this on YouTube and do it directly on my website clever programmer calm go ahead and enroll in that school and there you can keep track of all of your progress and you can go there and all the resources will be there readily available alright guys good luck and I'll see you guys in the next video
