I know this is a insanely bold claim but let me show you why so you want to use Chad GPT and I use Chad GPT for everything so why would I say something as insane as stop using Chad GPT let me share with you I had a problem which was I love using Chad GPT I love using CLA I love using these AI tools but whenever I had to put in a lot of things visually to speak to I'll give you a simple example if I watched a YouTube tutorial and I wanted to speak to that very very quickly I would not be able to do that with just let's say chat GPT it takes a lot of steps or I would need a Chrome extension and I would need to do 10 million things so that got really annoying so I just decided to go with my team and build out our own tool so for example we can do things like this let's say that I want to learn nextjs so let's go nextjs server side uh server actions okay so that's something cool about next year so let's say I go to this and I can find this video so let's say fireship has made a video I'm sure this is going to be a great video so I'm just going to take this fireships video right here um and what I will do is simply just grab the this URL that's it and I'm just going to go here and paste it as soon as I paste it I get that YouTube video right there okay now I'm going to go here and make a new chat this is just like a regular chat GPT chat and I'm just going to connect this video that I got to this so now the chat has access to fires ship's video okay I can play this video here too if I wanted to just yesterday next key value data okay now I'm going to say what are what does he talk about in this video and let's see what it comes up with it discusses new nextjs server action feature okay give me examples so these are the five key things that he talks about in the video and let's just make sure that he actually talks about this form on the form itself we don't use the client's cool so is there okay side on submit event handler we instead pass it in action this is and then submit the form you'll notice that it we don't need to Def in the UI what that means in this case is that it perfect we'll execute the server so now I can say hey give me some example code referenced in the video and boom just like that I even am getting access to the code that he talks about in the video here's a video of my boy sunny right here let's go to this yo what's going on and he's talking about server side stuff learn SSR for next 10 minutes cool I grab this I pop that in and now I can make a new chat if I wanted to or I can even connect it to the same exact chat so let's say I connected here let's say what is he talking about regarding SSR give me key takeaways so let's do this beautiful okay fantastic and now I can combine both of these so now this chat has access to both of these pieces of information so I videos so I can now just go and go hey based on both of these videos give me an example that uses SSR and server actions and so now it's actually starting to combine both of those things okay so it's starting to combine the SSR that slny talks about in this video right here right and then it's starting to combine what fireship talks about in his video and gives you access to that information and now based on this you can code your you know in your own projects so let's say I actually go to my own um Visual Studio code so let's say I go here and I grab let's say one of my files so let's go to one of my components I'll go board. JS and I'll grab this and I'll bring it in here and I'll open up a text node and inside of that text node I'll just paste all this code okay and now I'll connect my code here as well and I'll just say um I just want to make sure that if it sees my code so I'm just going to say give me to two lines of code from my board.jpg update my Bor code so it uses server actions and SSR b um I've already said based on those videos so now it's going to update my code so it's handling server side um so it's doing server side rendering like based on Sunny's video and then it will add also wherever it can ser actions based on Fires ship's video and it's updating my code so things like this traditionally speaking I've not been able to do with just strictly chat GPT I've wanted I've always wanted the tool where I could visually do these things and this platform allows you to do it the easiest way possible now full disclaimer I am a cofounder of this platform it's called poppy Ai and this has been buffed far the best tool that combines because what I always wanted right I always loved using Whimsical or Myro because it has a visual whiteboard kind of thing going on where you could visually do all this stuff and it's so fun and I love that and now that I can combine it with chat GPT I could actually visually talk to chat GPT on a whiteboard so how freaking cool is that so I just thought that that's something cool I wanted to share with you and give you that tool so that you can go and kick other people's ass and um it is a paid tool it's definitely paid because Nas and I are cofounding it so it's basically just the two of us with one developer so we need to basically fund it somehow and we don't have uh you know YC combinator or anything backing us so that's why we have a price point for it for people to use eventually maybe we might have like a completely free trial give it a go I'd love for you to try out this tool and I hope it blows your mind I love your face and I'll talk to you soon peace
