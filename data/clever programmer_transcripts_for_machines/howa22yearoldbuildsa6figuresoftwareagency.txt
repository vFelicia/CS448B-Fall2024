what is up everybody this is nas and i am here with my friend wait this way jacob and jacob who's jacob who are you jacob hey guys jacob here um i'm running my own um software agency together with two other founders it's been crazy last eight almost nine months and i'm not gonna lie i have a lot to share with you i've been also working with nas before in a clever programmer team this is how we know each other i've been a coach uh teaching python also i've been working uh three different companies before so yeah yeah it's been quite experience so he is a very experienced guy so jacob guy just so you know okay okay he's kind of chased himself but jacob right he is currently 22 years old he started coding when did you start coding jacob like four or five years old uh like the first line of code i was yeah so yeah really no no no five years old in high school it was like five years yeah yeah five years ago started coding basically you did not you did you go to college or no yeah yeah yeah i've been first going to college in poland and i dropped out and i was working fulltime uh job as a programmer and now currently i'm also student however i'm focusing most on my company so it's just yeah so so he guys he started off kind of basically like i said he did go to college he then he got us a job at a startup company right after that he actually worked with us as well over here with cleverprogrammer he was part of a lot of you know he was teaching students he was a big part of profit with python right after that he decided to kind of start out his own agency at the age of 22 right and he's been killing it kind of since then right he is of course it has not been easy for him at all we all know that right he's like holy it's hard right we'll talk about kind of his struggles today what got him into it and what made him now is six figure software agency owner right he has his own statistic but the name of self made which i think is really cool and now he just kind of he has a few people that work with him he has well you have three you have two other cofounders correct with you at this point exactly exactly then we have a designer and two programmers but me and my other cofounder we also like both fulltime coders i would say even more than fulltime uh this is how it is when you start your own agency it's not really you quit nine to five to do nine to nine or even more from 99 to nine to ten somebody's like hey have you ever dealt with failure oh i'm sure he's dealt with failure especially as he's going to something like this so guys but biscuit today we'll talk about his his you know his process what got him into it right and how he just kind of became the developer that he is today and of course if you have any questions whatsoever let me know of course let us know in the comments and we'll make sure to ask jacob here with those questions okay so if you have anything that's interesting just for go ahead and you know answer that awesome guys so that's pretty much it so jacob now tell me a little about this okay tell me kind of one is what got you into coding how you got started into coding and so forth okay all right yeah so it's early beginnings right i mean my whole life i've been into computers uh right and i started as a really professional gamer at some point i was considering a career as a gamer in the league of legends then contest strike but at some point it got me thinking that it may not be this thing right you were a gamer as well yeah i was like man i've been grinding games like when there was first season second season in league of legends i've been diamond and the diamond was the highest division so i've been killing it back in the days uh every day like 10 hours so on yeah that was like how i started then at some point i wanted to start to build my own games and man it's been so funny because then i went to a shop and i don't know it was a time when there was like a lot of those nice books and stuff like this uh those small shops so i got my hand on the first book and it was about building games and then i was like wow it's about building games using what uh it is i mean they introduced to some kind of a game builder so it was a lot of like blocks to put in so this is how i started building the it's it was i think rpg maker so you could literally build like a tbr game it's like a very old game um and yeah and then at some point there was like some kind of custom logic and it was all code and i was like wow what is it so you have to code stuff sort of like my first approach why did i have to learn here yeah exactly then that was like my first uh let's say touch and coding then and when i was around 11 or 12 i get myself into html a little bit and php but it was like literally nothing like a little bit of css so i started to know what it takes to build a website right but like to be honest the first time i really started to code like was in my last uh last year in high school because then i had we had a final test to get to university and uh we could choose between math physics uh also i t so i selected math and i t and this is how i started coding because i had to learn that and it's been it's been very fun but it was all just c and c plus plus so i was kind of also scared it wasn't i wasn't really motivated because it was just about pointers and allocating memory and man it it's been tough that is not fun at all not at all so then we went to like i went to uh college first year and we had this uh subject called python and not a lot of people were uh really into that but men jumping from a c to python when so many figures really nicely and nicely obstructed that you don't have to deal with allocating memory and pointers error i mean not really like there are also pointers in python but it's another story man it's been such a nice uh game changer for me because then i just i started to doing uh a lot about python just by myself right so i i checked like udemy courses and so on so and i was building my first software just for myself so i know other people were partying were doing some other stuff and i was just sitting in my room working and just coding i mean i was also a party guy of course oh this guy's a party guy too i know that are you kidding me but of course i mean in life you need need to have balance right like that's what i preach so of course when i go party i go party hard but it's usually after i do a really good accomplishment in my work so right just keeping the balance is very important but this is how i got into coding yeah so jacob so basically again so you went from c plus plus or from c up uh is that correct and your goal was that you kind of got into it because you know you were introduced to it through gaming right so you wanted to put the game and you started to you bought a book right and so forth and there was a lot of coding like holy what is this right at which point did you realize that okay this is interesting like this is something that i might want to do i mean to be honest uh like when i first touched those books with coding games uh i wasn't really interested then because i didn't understand really english and anything so it was very tough for me uh then then the same with html i didn't really know what i can do with it so i kind of put it away for a couple of years and then at high school when the whole coding fig got to me again then like also talking about i.t was very hot topic so i just got into it because at the end of the day i had to decide what will be my career path so at some point i wanted to be a doctor because i got really excited about biology but on the other hand i was always scared of blood so i was like no way i won't deal with that right but also i loved math and i think that i mean definitely c plus plus was always um like when i thought about c plus plus and there's case like and the algorithms which i learned and also like the tasks i solved they were really mathematical and especially in the beginning so this is how i got interested into that i was like okay let's try this more let's see what you can do and you can build with that and yeah again like the first university not really university itself but just the fact that i went to through a different like online courses this gave me actually a whole uh motivation to learn it really that's interesting wait so the online so the online courses which give you the motivation to to go for for what what line course did you take i'm curious was literally like some udemy free courses or some random youtube ones from python also like at some point i built a game in c plus plus uh that was a funny to go back into that because it was like university pro project and that was all about that right but the thing is that they didn't really teach this python university it was like literally like just trying it right but i was really at some like after my first year in university i was really motivated to actually get into the more and get my first job so man like usually no one gets internship after the first year of university but in my case i just i just wanted i just wanted it i i literally wanted it tell me why why did you want to because the thing is a lot of a lot of you know a lot of people what they might want to do is when they start out right they're like okay well i want to go to college i'm going to have some fun right i'm going gonna party it up you know maybe i'll learn a few things and so forth what kind of pushed you to know what to be like well you know what i kind of want to learn something i actually want to get a job in a way what was pushing to get a job were your parents pushing to get a job what was it not at all not my parents it's it's been more most also from my like kind of a goal in the life which was like okay so i'm from like i was born in germany but only i was born there and then i lived my whole life in poland i don't even speak german uh but at some point i always german yeah i mean a little bit a little bit but like literally you live in germany but you don't speak german yeah that's that's actually funny that's another story you don't have to do especially in the in it you should not be allowed to be there yeah yeah i mean i i can i can order a good dinner in german so that's what i need needed for but no like to be honest like at some point uh like i lived my whole life in poland and i will i've been abroad couple of times and it was always very exciting for me how people from all around the world they meet and they just talk in english uh and talk about their uh countries and so on like i've been always hyped for that and the year before starting my university i went for kind of like a a one month uh i don't know how to sell like a summer camp um to learn german and english and man it's been the best time in my life like i'm not gonna swear and i was so motivated that i said to myself okay i need to get internship but it cannot be internship in poland i wanna go abroad so at this point i mean i i was talking english like i was speaking english but it was quite bad but i was so motivated to do it that i applied for like 50 different companies in the germany man i failed to all of them literally i went through interviews i couldn't answer any questions like because my knowledge you apply yeah so you apply to all these companies somebody's saying couldn't talk that's funny good in the comments it's hilarious so i actually use it sometimes i just say good and tag you know but anyway so um you apply to all these different companies right without having any well i mean you had a little bit of knowledge to code it but not much at all yeah yeah exactly and it doesn't it didn't really matter for me which kind of a language was there like man i literally applied for all of the internships and i lied in my cv because at this point i only knew python i had nothing to tell about in my cv my cv looked like like i'm not gonna lie it was like black and white with my picture and i said okay i know python and i went through different courses on udemy and i'm motivated to do everything man that was my cv right so we mentioned this so come with us tell me this okay what did you lie about on what did you lie about on the what's it called on uh on you on your resume so it wasn't really lying in the resume but it was like okay i know how to code in python c plus plus java and javascript right but to be honest i only knew a little bit about python like i mean the c which i learned in the high school right it was just for solving algorithms it wasn't to build any products so i hope that i will learn i'll push myself through through it because when i'm working on the pressure i work better so yeah when i was actually the case by the way just so you guys know yeah i need to work i need to work under pressure yeah under pressure when you work under pressure you know that's why all we always say you know what you know build the project and so and so forth right the projects and what you're doing in in school whatever i might be doing that's just kind of getting you ready for the real thing right that's kind of because the end goal is always going to be to get a job that actually puts under pressure because why when you're in that job that's when you actually learn the most right when you're around people right that's when you learn the most so actually that's that's kind of the best part about that right so um yeah it's something that i think is very important to say to to those to those who are listening because a lot of you guys are thinking well you know you know how do i go ahead and get that first job and so forth right and what's the most important thing where well you know the real most surprising experience is going to be at the job right but what jacob did here very interestingly is you know even though he didn't have much experience he's still right zero experience did you how much c plus parts did you know tell me man i mean literally like i went to pointers and maybe vectors and that was it like i just knew a little bit about algorithms so i couldn't really build any application with it like it was all command line tools right maximum that so that was it but anyway right i applied to all of those companies i failed all of them but still i was like okay i want to learn german and english and work abroad i have i want to have my internship so i was like okay when they also speak in german oh there's austria so i played to austria man also 50 companies yeah like i was like let's do it i failed i felt i failed and there's this one company they i went through interview process uh i i asked like i answered a couple of questions and then uh they said man like they called me after a few days that yeah you in i was like no but then and then i was like i was like super excited and then i asked what we will be doing there on during this internship man the lady was talking to me for like 20 minutes and i couldn't understand anything out of it i was like yeah yeah okay sounds interesting yeah i totally know until again all this you just couldn't you know i totally know i got this i've done this before no problem so ever can you see for you guys in about one week okay no don't have to worry about this whatsoever right so that's funny at this point i was so excited that i was like yeah i'm going there so i went there uh alone actually like it was like 1 000 kilometers from my hometown i didn't know anyone also in this city i would actually it was in the salzburg it's very nice city in austria the company was named skidata actually they are really big in west europe and yeah the internship like the problem with the internship was that i was about to reboot and build extension to the app which was already there and the app was built in uh java and in the framework called spring man when i saw that when i saw it i was literally shooting my pants man i didn't know what to do like i literally i literally so why i i couldn't understand anything out of it again my english wasn't very good but i had my own boss right so literally for seven days i was researching everything about java about this framework and after work so i was doing there i was working there eight hours even more then i was going home i was doing research more and more because at some point i was like wow they would just kick me from the intern internship and after seven days uh i literally gave up and i said hey look um i think like that i won't be able to build that like this java framework spring is just it's too much for me and to be honest i have the most experience with python and i was very lucky because my my boss actually understood that and he said okay look jacob really uh yeah this is like a code base it doesn't have to be coded in this framework i understand that this might be tough especially that is your first job and we want you to bring you like give you as much experience and show you processes as we can so uh he said he suggested that okay use your framework to build that right and i was like okay i was literally googling how to build python application a web application because it was a web application then i discovered django man and i i literally for i was there almost uh three months i literally learned like a very solid uh jungle base i would say and i rebuilt the whole thing for them and in the end they were really uh really happy with that so i accomplished my internship that's crazy so you rebuilt their whole project so basically they initially they give you they give this to you in java and you're like holy i literally can't do this which by the way i just want to say it takes a lot of gusts to come to to come up to someone and say i can't do it right the problem becomes is a lot of people say that oh i can't i can't i can't i can't do right and they get into this mindset of being afraid to say that something they can't and so they lie and they lie and the thing is that people on the other hand they can see you lying so badly sometimes like because i do interviews with a lot of people right and i can see when people lie like i interview people interview developers i can see when you're lying i'll sometimes in my mind i just want to say listen just tell me you don't know or just tell me that you can't and we'll figure this out together you see what i mean and it's a sad part about this right but it's all about communication right it's all about communication exactly what it is very brave you went ahead and you actually basically you told them hey you know what i'm going to go ahead and say i can't do this but here's the solution but we can try in a different manner so we actually came up with a different solution right which was the jingle with python correct and i rebuilded the whole thing from scratch because again he already had a coast base in the spring and i had to extend that i was like there's no way i'll extend that so i'll build whole thing which was already there from scratch and then on top of that i'll bet on other features and yeah through those months it worked out and it was really good because we just had a date daily meetings when he was just talking about those features and i was like brainstorming with him man like it's been the best experience in my life uh regarding like starting a job as a as a developer it really gave me that boost later on in the getting the new job like i've never had a problem to get a new job because after that when i quit uh university because like that's a funny story that right after this internship i remember you quit university is that correct yeah right after this internship i came back to university and man it's been so boring because i had all of this experience being abroad alone meeting those people working the international team uh also like man i i earned in the end almost 6k like i've never earned money before in my life and then it's just 6k like that it was it was just crazy for me of course i had to pay for like a flood and so on but it was all worth it for all those experiences yeah but then being in a university uh on all of those like uh classes and so on i just couldn't stand it anymore because i already started working in the industry and i saw what is necessary to build stuff give value to companies and then they will learn they were teaching us this all and i was like man i can't stand it i was talking to my friend literally i was shaking and i was like man i can't i can't be here i can't stand it i don't know what i will do i i just don't want to be here and at some point i stood up and i just went like sorry what were you learning there like i can't stand it yeah we we were learning java so again java and there was like some old libraries object programming languages uh then like very like we didn't even touch web dev there was like the next year and there was like a lot of those boring uh usual useless subjects with like building some things from like this micro electro like i can i don't know it's the english name for it but you just had to connect a few cables and build some stuff just like man i wasn't interested in this at all i wanted to learn a tools how to program i wanted to new new and the newest frameworks that was another case that they were teaching you all of those old frameworks because they couldn't uh hire professors who are also developers who are working the industry right so this this knowledge i just realized it's all useless of course you will you will get through all of those very tough algorithms and by finishing this university to be honest you will just learn how to learn anything in your freaking life right so once you get the job in the company you'll just survive there because man you just learn the toughest in your college so you will survive of course this is how it works but why don't take a shortcut if you know what to do so i was also passionate about business side always like my whole life and it was never introduced there like at all never zero zero like i always wanted to talk about numbers and stuff like this yeah there was nothing to do like that so i really wanted to get straight into industry so that's why i literally quit then i landed two jobs i picked one and it was like yeah let's go that's awesome i mean look i think that's amazing because like even it just shows that how much what you can do with so little experience right there are jobs that will take you with little experience a lot of you guys and those are in the comments right let us know in the comments if you're somebody who's looking for a job or maybe you want to become a developer right and you're just you're you don't know where to go you're confused right maybe a situation maybe you're stuck in tutorial hell you don't know where to go right whatever it might be let us know in the comments below right but what jacob here can tell you is that even though you might not have much experience there's companies out there that will help you out that will take care of you right the they give you the opportunity let me ask you this question okay why do you think they hired you i think it was uh about my approach they really see that i won it like right now they still they really they really saw that i have the guts to quit university and like work and learn the industry more i also told them and just like the encoding interview because i also had to pass the coding interview so it was a job also related to django because i already know the basics but man it's it's been nothing like the stuff i learned here there in the company it was all i learned so i literally didn't know the difference between get and post requests but i just made the app work at some point man when i check the code base it's also my github man it's it's really messy like i didn't know what to do at all they there was like four and a four into four into four like literally oh yeah that was like that in the beginning so then when i was on the coding interview there was a framework to django which just is responsible for building the api which is django res framework and they were coding mostly into that because they had there was a separate team for front and back end right so you just were about to build backend so they gave me a task and i was like the same i was writing documentation checking the examples and i spent one day with them uh and i solved i solved the whole thing how they wanted but of course it wasn't it wasn't right but they saw this potential how fast i can learn and how good i can communicate with the team because this is also a case that whenever you are freaking good at coding it doesn't mean you are freaking good developer because good developers like when i hire people right now what i really care is not how good you code but how good you can communicate uh especially from the business side when i have when i have a client here's an idea and he wants to talk to developer there's no way they will talk to each other there's no way um they they speak literally at different languages right and it's not just about how good you can code it's also about how good you can smash that like button smash that like button button for the youtube algorithm right that also matters but yeah like it's not just about how well you can i really like the pension that's really cool that was graham stefan type situation you know um yeah yeah yeah so basically you know it's like um it's not just about how good you can cope it's all about your passion and about how good you can learn correct well you show them the fact that you are willing to learn right but what i'm curious that's totally true what's up go ahead uh yeah that's not really true but i also wanted to mention one thing which you brought which is a coding uh tutorial and pro pro like project cell and so on this is why i also really wanted to because at this point i had a gap year right because i quit a university and i wanted to go abroad so i applied to this university where i'm currently but i wanted to work for all time to get the experience and i could choose two ways right i could choose a first way when i just learn technologies i learn and build projects right so i go tutorial of the tutorial but man i don't think it's the case to really get experience you really need to work inside that commercial project because this is where the real users are and they give you the feedback so it's totally different way i i don't recommend you guys like literally don't build project after project my approach is that literally getting to freelancing if you can't land a job and try to build something for someone because this will bring you a lot of experience you will really learn how to uh like build tough stuff and you will be under pressure that's what i would choose right now for about to start yeah now i would just tell to somebody who was like it's wanted to say hey no you go ahead and start out with very simply like just like this it's one thing to say that but it's a whole other thing to actually go ahead and and actually do it that's the hardest thing because a lot of people feel like well you know what i'm not ready they have the imposter syndrome and it makes sense because you really are not ready you don't know the the knowledge behind it right so what kind of a mindset do you have to have to be like no no i'm gonna get started no matter what and i kind of see where it takes me because i interviewed blake connolly as well and he had that same mindset right he started kind of freelancing very much from the getgo without thinking about so much about you know the future instead he just kind of still started to start doing the work and then after that he just kind of learned on the fly exactly i mean there are different kind of people so there are people who just prefer to learn learn learn and just talk about it and there are people who in order to learn they just act they learn through experience and this is my way to do it and i can only say the same regarding the current business which we run right which we go to uh soon again like same story so about coding now it's also about like calisthenics which i'm doing before i was just reading about exercising that but at some point i just sign up for like very experienced group when man like i work with the people who are doing calisthenics for like five seven years i'm the worst there but it's been the best experience ever i mean i'm every day i feel like i i'm literally dying i can't get up from bed but it's the best so really whenever you do in your life i would whenever you want to accomplish something in your life i would literally do it by like accomplish it by doing no matter what does it take of course you will fail and you'll feel very bad in a lot of moment but this is where the all growth comes right yeah that is true that is true i agree i give failure is a big very big part of growth you know we need to do that before we move on so so i understand so you went basically you went to this company correct and this what do you know the name of this company yeah it's kv software company in poznan and i if anyone from the kiwi watches me i greet you guys it's been great time there i mean i got so much experience from it like literally been it's been the best thing that happened to me wow that's amazing this has a lot to say that that's amazing awesome so now in that case that's cool now in that case so after that right you went to this internship and then what kind of happened then right you're working the jingle project how how did you feel now at this point working and like how do you feel like your knowledge was at a point after like a month or two of working in the company i mean it's the first internship so i when i finished internship to be honest yeah i was all shitty still but i had the experience then the company i worked there almost a year and yeah after this year i i was really solid to be honest because it was just djangour's framework all the time um yeah at this point i felt very solid it's still like i i couldn't say i'm the the expert right but it was also a small company that was what was the beautiful thing about that because we just had to get done and most of the times i was literally putting to the huge project and i had to do stuff so it was also a great experience for me and after that like when i moved to germany i also applied uh so then i also like get to the next university and i applied to different companies the funny part is in germany when you're a student you can only work uh 20 hours per week this is a german law really on the contract student on a contract so interesting now it's different because i own my compa own company um so it's different uh so you're a baller now you're like i don't play with the rules now now i mean i just still have to say that i work 20 hours per week because you can't really tell that's a trick in germany i mean right now i have two companies to be honest so one is there's a poland when i'm the cofounder like coowner and then the second single person company in germany when i just do invoices and stuff and so that's how we run it right now but let me tell you about the the funny story about the companies when i applied as a student so i got this university and i already had like a nice experience to get at the company so i applied already to as a mid developer everywhere uh full time and i was going for different uh coding interviews men they were really tough but there was a those these were like positions for like 60 70k euros a year and i passed through different uh coding interviews and there was like the last uh stage when i had to go only through hr thing uh hr interview and man it was all great it was all perfect and in the end i said hey do you have an option to like work 20 hours per week because you see i'm a student and they were shocked they were literally shocked they literally declined me there so at some point i applied also for a different company when they also had their student offer but i got like much more uh salary than a regular student because i applied for also like a different position that was like a tricky hack that i did but again after like seven to eight months i think that was also like a clever programmer uh and then team of clever programmer then i was also like a little bit freelancing at some point as i you remember probably this day i i came up when i called and i said hey guys it's been a great time but i just can't do it anymore because it's like i'm doing almost three jobs i'm studying and it's i just can't i just wanna quit everything yeah restart my whole brain and i already knew that i love business and i want to do something with business yeah so i took vacation yeah yeah and i remember i remember this like uh i remember this very clearly right because you were doing a lot of things you're working with us right you're working with us and you know you're working with us on you know with profit python and of course and just and a lot of different things like challenges and so forth um which was amazing of course and you're a big part of the team um but i know you were doing a lot of different things you had you had an internship that you were working at the same time right plus this also and i think you also did school is that correct or no you're not yeah exactly exactly and also like my own youtube and my own instagram man i've been like it's been like crazy every day like 11 12 hours but but you know what sometimes you gotta do a lot because like you know a lot of people problems is they don't do enough you see what i mean you're doing a lot correct and you can and then you figure out how to slow down is that correct exactly right exactly i just had to reflect on myself because i knew that when you do everything you can't do everything good right so i was like i have so many ideas i wanted to do business i love also like being on a team record videos uh coach other people also i love to code but i just can't do anything there's not enough time and i will just burn out at some point i already had a couple of burnouts uh not like a huge burners but like i just couldn't look at the screen anymore right so yeah i took the decision it's been very tough uh because like i literally quit everything and one day that was very hard what is everything everything what do you mean by everything yeah so i quit working for this one client i quit uh this parttime job in the company i also like i i was like they really liked me i really like it was a really great team so and they're also working with you guys it was also like very uh like nice experience for me i really love that yeah i just show up on every like meeting and i just had to say that yeah this is how it is i i quit and then i had like literally two weeks do enough and just chill and it was great it was really necessary and then of course at some point you just if you do so many things that you take vacation at some point you you are so chill that those ideas are coming again to you right you are so relaxed and men that was a first idea when which was born that i wanna be a freelancer right now i think it's a great thing to do then my cofounder wojtek he had the same idea that he would quit his job he will become a freelancer and then at this point it was so funny because we were like hey man i mean we can freelance together hey isn't it like agency or something maybe we could do something together who knows exactly so we team up and man it that was just the beginning it was it was great that's awesome that's awesome and so hold on so i kind of want to kind of want to even step back a little bit from that right because like you went into this right and you kind of quit everything that you were doing right all these different jobs and so forth and was it really because you want to do something different or was it because you were just tired and needed a break it wasn't really about being tired i could i could do that um definitely it was just something in my inside me talking to myself that i want to build something on my own i just i don't know i just felt this this way that whenever i work on something i just i love that it's it's like mine it's for example right i built my own instagram even though i was doing doing a lot of things for clever programming i was still doing this because it felt like it's literally like my thing it's it's me it's my personal brand and now company same thing right now of course we are doing custom projects for a client so it's like kind of we still have a boss our boss our our bosses are our clients i would say so right it's it's we exchange time for money for them but at the same time we are building a brand selfmade and we are building the crm we are building a client base so whenever we have i don't know in three years let's say 100 clients this is recurring income already right the maintenance the new features this is this is already a thing we are building a developer team uh designer team this is all like a asset for us uh so go ahead yeah this is like a different like my mindset this is why i really enjoy that i really feel that i wanna do something like that that's awesome that's amazing and so okay so then you decide to basically quit everything you and you're like you know what i'm gonna start a software agency okay so let's get into that right what happened there how did you get started what are the first things that you did to go ahead and get started on something like this tell me man it's been a mess so i photo so i i already had like 30 or 40 000 instagram followers like three thousand youtube youtuber right and i was like wow i know a lot about marketing it it would be probably easy to get the first clients and so on man i would be killing it i was so like i know cocky yeah okay yeah maybe also uh but no to be honest man it's been much harder than i thought like it turned out that instagram or other social medias they are usually usually perfect for b2c which is a business to clients so when you have a product and you sell them to typical people those are your clients then it's not customers and customers yeah yeah then it's usually also the product is not that expensive uh but you can scale it easily but when you run your agency then you do bit b2b which is business to business business to business and i did a research i checked the agency so it's like hey man they have no instagrams they know facebook but then they have those big brands working with i was like how do they do that right and then i started re reading about it and i was like wow b2b is totally different game i have no idea about that and also like the thing where we started the agency with wojtek uh we both had savings for like two maybe three months because i also pay for my uni i pay for my flood and stuff like this so yeah i had some savings it was also like why i quit was like okay now i literally have a savings for next two three months so i really i mean i will figure it out because i know myself under the pressure if i have this pressure and yeah at some point i won't have any money i mean man yeah i would go back to different job like i have this safety that i can always come back to the job but now i want to do something more so this is how it was born and yeah we're just starting to asking people literally hey you are freelancers we want to be freelancers or like agency so you start getting go ahead yes yeah as well as to say uh who and uh stuff like this so like that was the first step like reading online articles how to freelance how to the clients and then also literally talking to the people and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna lie uh actually blake connelly was one of my best inspirations because like i knew already uh him from instagram like i knew that you guys were working together i literally asked him for like one quick interview for like 20 30 minutes and he agreed on that which is like crazy like i literally was like willing to pay him for this time because i know how much he works how many important things he has to do and yeah he agreed and then he introduced us the upwork the upwork whole upwork game and he said it will be very hard like he mentioned that a couple of times but we we still didn't really believe that it can be that hard and then we went to our pork man it's been so hard like like literally we actually had like both this nice experience is almost like 2.5 almost three years of experience working the industry right and we went to upwork and man to lend our first client it's been literally like a grinding like 20 days 5 to 10 proposals every single day wow and we couldn't even get to anyone to answer our proposal because on upwork you have a few stages so first you need to find a client you need to send him the proposal he need to text you back then you kind of get on a call and then you have to close him so it's like a long process right to close someone and all and whenever someone um like posts a job offer um like after like one hour i don't think it's even worth to apply applying there because there's like already 20 other people applied right so it's very hard it's very hard to be noticed especially in the beginning where you have no badges no job successes no income earned there's like literally the hardest part on upwork so wow we made it actually we made it after i don't know two or three weeks um i landed the first guy it was something about amazon automation it was the first time first client and it was like okay i have no idea about amazon automation that they have api i was like i'm doing this i'm doing this so we got on a call figure it out he told me yeah yeah i will figure it out man i have to um so he told me about this amazon nws thing there was like a documentation he said what he wants there's also something about gcp which is google out platform and i was like okay let's do it and yeah i was working extremely hard for like two or three weeks and i earned like five hundred dollars which is like literally nothing as a developer for this kind of time but man i mean that's a thing right right sorry 500 in two weeks almost free so it was very tough working like crazy but man i've never was happier like that was literally like this 500 dollars fit like i know 10k right now or something like that it's it's been crazy how happy i was was because then i had a very nice comment on my profile uh 100 job succeed and i also got some batch from upwork so so so so tell me this tell me this okay what do you think allowed you to get this client okay like what was it is it the proposal that you made because of course you've been in proposals for the best to pass two three weeks at this point right but what you what got you that client tell me uh so yeah there are a couple of things tonight this is also how i like learned for to them this is actually after two weeks because we already like even buy those points on upwork that you can actually send more proposals so like we spend like 10 bucks or 20 bucks to even land a client uh so yeah what we learned uh in the beginning is that that your proposal needs to be extremely unique and gives a lot of value in the beginning like literally we kind of figure out this formula that when you send the up upwork proposal in this proposal you kind of need to give the guy solution so once we apply this pattern it really started working out like literally we got like 50 uh answers after that so the guy wanted to do some google amazon nws i sent him the python library link to github that hey this is a pi this library i think we can use that and then i think we can deploy the app on the gcp and i also link this stuff and yeah i just wrote him like that and he was like oh man you look like you have some kind of experience there and there let's talk and then he he got on a talk with me i talked about the experience and situation man because he said yeah i i'm not gonna lie it's like you are new here you don't have any uh stars and anything i'm kind of like i don't know if i should trust you but i mean looks like you you're fine so let's do it so he also i was lucky i was lucky he also wanted to help me right and the same happened to vojtec when we both applied this formula so we kind of get on upward i don't know maybe to 10 000 overall earnings but at some point we didn't really like it and the reason is that from my point because i i didn't really like it because uh i'm really shitty when it comes to texting like writing to people i'm better with talking and on upwork you have to be really good at texting so voider at some point was getting a lot of different clients but i couldn't so i was like okay let's switch the model business model again and then uh our second stage of this but before before you go into that before you go into that okay so you were doing upwork and so forth and you said that you were able to earn around ten thousand dollars on upwork is that what you said um it was in the first month overall overall because we are doing this upper thing also from time so we have like uh me and voitek together i think it might be 10k but probably less but yeah this is we got it after like two or three months so we could literally do it all the time but only the reason why uh i didn't want to do it because i had to text to people and i had it so overall nothing against upwork i think it's a great platform especially for freelancers also if you want to do an agency it's really good like we could be a really good agency there i know that blake earns like crazy on upwork and it works uh but yeah again it depends on the personality uh i prefer to go to people i prefer to meet people in person in order to close them um i feel like also i'm much better in this so that's why we changed that that comes to me to another question because somebody asked for they asked why don't you look for clients locally yeah this is another this is actually stage two of uh selfmade so yeah this is what we did so we asked okay how can we get clients again so i already had couple of nice connections on actually through which i made through instagram in berlin and people were freelancing or they own their own agencies and i was going to them and i was just talking to them uh and there was hendrick from milli and he always talked to me that hey man try to reach out to your network but my problem is that i just moved to berlin right like one year ago or something i was starting then the corona started i didn't have any network at all my parents are not any like i.t technicians or anything my mother is the teacher so they know nothing we don't have any connection poland uh but also like we didn't want to do it in poland at this point we just wanted to be here in germany and work for german clients so yeah we didn't have any network but i was like okay let's do it anyway and then i literally was going online on different slack communities especially like the coworking space which i i'm right now and i was talking to people a lot and then those guys they got to us and we started the first collaboration then there was a second guy who reached out to us uh he was working for some company who is doing a hand handmade letters but they are actually created by a machine so it's very interesting business model yeah so we built they also project for them and then once you actually uh build a great project for someone and also for net like you shouldn't be very expensive in the beginning you should provide as much value as you can this is as you can this is the most important thing when landing your first clients i mean overall like always like the value is the most important that's what what might what do you have what mindset do you have when you go into for example to talk with the client um so they at this point they were all recommended right so we already knew that they want some kind of the project we proposed them the solution for that we say how we can do that and we agreed on some prices and those prices are really low uh because we just wanted to start so those are projects for like 2.5 or 3k uh euros i mean it's not like they are very low but if you run your business you have to pay taxes on your own and taxes in german is like half percent uh like 50 so in the end it's like very shitty like still if we are just doing uh nine to five as developers it's like most more like just profitable no stress nothing right but we just wanted to do that anyway so we built those things for those two guys and this is how it started because at this point like the guy was the ceo of this company and he has a lot of different network connections so he recommended us to other guys and this is how he kind of started there in germany also the second guy he also landed some clients he already had nice experience working with us so he gave us another product and meanwhile we are also searching for other people in other places so this is how we do it uh when you say searching what do you mean by searching like locally around you yes like with the same with the same uh model so we go on those communities we say that hey we are agency uh we looking for a project and so on we are happy to talk about some automation ideas and stuff like this uh even though at some point we uh we wanted to get into the niches so our first niche where we wanted to get in was the marketing niche because we already did like a lot of automations with like shopify amazon ad spent uh we aggregate aggregated the data we displayed in google sheets and we will and then i started literally talking to agency owners i asked them for literally an interview and asked them for their processes and they were getting me a data for free because it wasn't a sales call they just literally were talking okay we are using this software i think in this server this sucks i know literally noting this all down building my own database but at the same time we didn't really know if we want to do it so we are just kind of getting clients i would say randomly because of other connections they were just approaching us so we are really lucky at this point and i would do like a quick um like a time travel to the point where are we right now because literally right now at this point we are launching self pain self made 2.0 which is uh so i have a new cofounder the third guy who joined us and this is uh how we kind of start again but with the whole mindset which we developed over the last eight months so right now we are literally going over the one niche which is the automotive that's like a journey which we want to kind of start right now so it's still software it's still custom software as we do like right as we were doing over the last eight months but it's all around one niche now you're asking why it's yeah perfect question so over the last eight months we are just doing everything for everyone uh we said that we are the auto automation agency but in the end we also were building some kind of websites uh because we just hit the project we just had to take the project so we are learning a lot about different integrations different industries uh and this brought us to the moment where we are right now where we actually finally saved uh some money so the title which you have right sixfigure agency is this is happened like literally like recently when we started doing this right the first two three months has been like 1k 2k 3k 4k right we are we were growing but over the last few months you're talking about like earnings like four keep a month two keep a month earnings right and i just make sure be very clear this but with you guys is this is okay like a lot of you guys think that you know on foreign fortunate a lot of a lot of developers when they go into freelancing like i'm gonna be a millionaire that's it i'm gonna have a lot of money i can travel wherever i want and this could be a great life right and unfortunately right that's not the case right because i myself have been a freelancer as well jacob here he started philanthropy of course as well and you guys can see that it is not the case right not very much the case at all because it's a lot of hours and you start out with shitty money potentially right yeah it's basically no matter how much experience you have right in terms of coding you might ask that with your business set up for the bottom because you have not built your reputation in the freelancer world initially at all right exactly it's a long marathon it's not a sprint exactly exactly and so now you say you're getting one take 1k 2k 3k and so just tell me now that when you guys were going into with focus on the automotive stuff which is when you focus on motor stuff give me some examples like what kind of projects you're building in the automotive industry exactly so we just picked this niche it's not like we are still in the research phase so in two three weeks when we talk to like 100 people we might decide that we actually change change it to different one but the thing is again to the earnings right finally like we had this first month i think it was like january or february when we actually hit 10k that was the next month was 20k and it was like it was it was crazy it was also accumulated because uh when you do agency when you are freelancer it's very hard to get your first projects people don't trust you and usually they don't even agree to pay upfront and they don't agree to pay hourly so we had this one project actually couple of projects that we are building this over four months and in the fourth month we just we just saw the money right so it will all the investment that we didn't even for that we'll see the money so this is how we also accumulated this but that's the best thing that i mean me and wojtek we were we are young and in order to survive for us like 2k for a person is enough um wow that's the the best size and that that's the best thing and now when we have like more money it changes my mindset because it's not like okay now i'm going to i don't know release a porsche right it's not the case i would never do that like i mean maybe somewhere in the future right but now i see the potential of it that wow i have the budget so i can literally focus on the niche do a research if i have the previous clients i can get a developer hire him he will be part of our team i will build a brand we'll actually pay for a marketing will pay for a content and do some run some ads like this is what a whole money will be from for investment in the company so we are finally in the moment that we can do it this is also why we're doing the whole rebranding the new logo which is actually on the thumbnail of it it's not released yet only on youtube uh the new totally new website this is how we will use that right so we just started uh those bigger numbers we are very excited um but yeah we're also very humble about that because it's been very tough eight months to be where are we and to be honest like we're just starting man like it's a long long game like um so yeah this is how it is it's a very long game right it's a it's an interesting game right um i've been this game as well of course um so and you guys started basically now doing this niche right the automotive niche right and you guys seen it you know you guys seen bigger numbers from previous projects of course now at this point now what are you going to do how are you going to reinvest the money back right a lot of money a lot of people they might might get the money they're invested that you might spend it somewhere what's the goal here when you go ahead and make money as a south agency what is the goal now with that money tell me i'm just kidding i'm a christmas tree because i can tell you where we spend it here at our company here yeah so i'm curious so normally whenever we have a project a client i just do everything by myself uh because i didn't even know how i could uh spend that i would want to save as much as i can but now having this mindset i can bring some new developer and just uh spend this money on him right so hire him reinvest the money even though if this can fail we we learn how to work with other people so it's a perfect learning opportunity same with ads same with whole marketing around that also i'll be able to finally not um just work on coding part which just brings money but do actually a research so no one will pay me for meetings like no one paid me for meetings before even with their clients right but now we are talking to potential clients we are talking to the business owners in automotive niche and those are just the meetings 30 minutes but it can be very very time consuming over like a next few few weeks so this is also like just a the safety net for the future for us to pay ourselves in the future because yeah i think that that's the difference between like a startup uh approach when you get the founding grounds and so on but just an agency uh model it's it's completely different how many how many people do you guys have working with you i know you told me on the contractor basis you guys have been working with how many people do you work with on a regular basis tell me yeah so right now we have three people working with plus uh two other founders so it's like we are a team of six but uh sometimes we have like some other people bring you on for like some kind of consultations whenever there's a project that we really uh need an expert but we kind of know how to build that and those experts are too uh expensive to build it we just hire them for consultations to ask uh about those things so this is my way that's a pretty smart so basically instead of hiring the person right the developer you hire them as a consultant and they keep building yourself so you basically get the knowledge from them but you're also not paying for the hours at the same time you just kind of build them by yourself basically yeah we would rather pay them like even 200 uh dollars per hour right wow to validate our current solution which we work on a whole week rather than hire them for a full time because then it's like crazy and at this point we also can't charge clients that the crazy money um how much i miss this question i mean if you want to if you don't want to say that that's fine too how much do you how much do you on regular basis charge per hour for a client like it's still it's still uh it's we can't say uh the average because it really is different on the project uh like there's one client when we can charge him 30 euros per hour then sometimes 50 but it all depends on the situation where are we at and again hourly pricing and fixed pricing is totally different game yeah um there is a lot of negotiating coming to this so it's it's very hard to tell how much we earn actually per hour because taking under consideration how much we work during a week it will be still i'm still we earn less that if we were working fulltime as developers that i can tell you clearly because like when you work as a developer as in the company let's say eight hours a day then you really code for four hours then you have a couple of meetings especially right now remote work yeah that's my experience but when you work for someone else like he's your client then every hour really count because if you don't really focus on this hour then you're burning this time no one will pay you for that especially on the fixed price contract it's different approach so that's true that's true now also we failed so many times sorry i know i mean i've been there too honestly now do you do fixed price projects as well because when i was doing the adjustments what's up it's just fixed price it's very hard to even talk about oh it is just fixed price it's almost impossible to get to the point of hourly contracts like we usually wait two hours projects because all i hear from them is do not do fixed price projects of course but it's also almost impossible to to get hourly clients like talking to ex from my experience is just impossible so we usually have uh maintenance contracts for hourly but then we also talk about kind of like a fix so what does it take to fix this bug this is how it is right now maybe at some point we'll get to the point where blake is but for now it's just yeah we are still too early in this game right it's just eight months and now we are taking some serious moves regarding the niche um so that's how it is tell me what are some biggest things that you had to change within you when starting something like this like internally what did you have to change tell me um so yeah before when i was just doing jobs there was not really a huge responsibly responsibility on my side so whenever there was a feature for example in corporate world um i knew that if i don't do it for tomorrow like they can blame me or something but nothing really happens overall they have tons of money and stuff like this i'm nothing in this corporate leather i knew that right and at some point i was getting very lazy because of that because it was like unfair advantage that i'm really good at people and if i really don't want to do something i won't do it but then i will like force myself to do it so even working in a company 20 hours per week i could easily do my task over like four to five hours and the whole team i was literally asking boss if it's all good they were like super proud and stuff like this right so i was literally getting bored and lazy at the same time which is really bad but here yeah as i told you already there's no way of kind of cheating there's no way because if you don't do stuff then you just don't get paid and yeah it's totally different i'm just more motivated to work than ever also like i love it so much that i always am into that like whenever i don't even work or code i always have some kind of business ideas that we want to develop so it's it's different yeah that's awesome so somebody asked somebody asked here but the rasheed asks what is the niche about right so the automotive niche right go a little bit deeper deeper into that what do you mean by that are you guys building you know dashboards for automotive companies what does that look like so yeah that's the thing that we uh we already have three projects now portfolio and automotive which are totally different so one is about uh scanning cars the vista scanning solutions uh company from us uh this is all about gathering data from different scans uh priests can post kind of um diagnostic scans and stuff like this uh so we are working there and helping them out a lot then that was like one part so it's more about literally a very specific knowledge in the industry of cars like all about the car parts um then the third one is actually uh for dana um they approached us with the scrapers so we had to build a very custom scrapers for them to cover like uh a competitor uh gaskets i'm not i can't say more about it because we have some contracts there and so on but this is what i might have today tell uh so that's the different uh thing so it's all about automation and the third guy uh that was our recent client we just finished the page is uh about he's at car dealership who's exporting cars from switzerland to poland and actually we built uh some kind of also a scrapers and automation tools for them for for them actually yeah and in the end they have a whole car platform when people from poland can bat cars um and they are like responsible just for delivering the cars and handle all of the um like payment and other stuff processes so it's also helping them a lot so those are three different projects but in the automotive niche so currently we are check we are asking other car dealerships if there's any way that we could maybe build for them or like who are they processing the a their company we are not talking the small guys more like to the bigger guys i know that there's a lot of different crm systems for just car dealerships and yeah we just in the research phase so also nas if you know someone for automotive niche like i would be happy to talk to them of course and do their research here on the youtube live if you guys and know anybody from the automotive niche you can find jacob at his instagram jacob wait wait hold on what's your instagram hold on jakobski youtube jakobowsky or just self made of them let me show it to you guys you guys let me show it to you guys so you guys can see it g kubowski so let me see i'll show it to you guys jacob jacob right there right there jakubowski right here there it is i think it's good i think it's just reverted but it's good i think it's mirrored actually that's why actually if i unmirror myself maybe maybe they'll work out look at this on the photo i'll comment in the comments oh now it's good yeah that should be nice perfect so you guys can reach him out on that specific on that instagram i don't know why i wear myself the whole time because i actually think this is better right here i kind of like this when i hear better yeah so but anyways so that's really cool so that's your you're basically on a different automotive industry in and you're trying this nation this niche potentially might work out because you know one thing i realized that when i was starting to do it started a software agency is you get to you kind of have to build everything everything for everybody and it's not fun because you just diverted into so many different places you know this one part like i mean i remember when i was doing this i was doing seo i was doing you know you know wordpress i was doing literally you know jingle and then react js and like there's all these different projects that you have to do and it's just not i don't know it's just not fun when you do when you there's no niche right so like not focused if if there is like a serious big company they just want to work with the best and to get to the best you have to be the best like really so also like this is just start bing automotive agency let's say so right software agency for automotive it's not also uh deep enough in my opinion but this is a great start so the process like i mean this will take like next two three four years but i already have a next steps for it so first like that's the worst thing is that i myself in vojtec which we started like we are developers we have no idea about any industry problems and so on we just knew coding but at the end of the day coding is a tool so you don't really solve any business business cases you don't really provide the value that's why you are a developer which is totally perfect most of the people just want to be developers that's totally perfect um like you are basically also tool right you have managers above you which are just experts in the industry they know where the value comes from but when you start agency and you know nothing about the industry itself it's very tough so that's why we want to niche down do a lot of interviews talk to experts and then see how we can actually use this tool and help them and that would be the step first step so still custom coding for automotive uh industry and then let's say after three or four years when we really really build a lot of projects around that we may come to the we may come to the point where we have really nice team a really nice expert expert knowledge and we will change to the sas company because building the sas company is very very hard people don't earn money for like two three years some people like most of the people who are building sas software they have totally wrong approaches just going to investors uh getting the money and they they usually fail it's it's a very different topic but i have this health i would say mindset to it that we first tackled down a lot of different problems see where's actually see where is the potential to build the perfect sauce uh actually being being there already solve those problems and then maybe come up with something that we already uh have a clients also who are who want to pay for that because a lot of people build this sas pro like they build products then they go out and they ask for feedback no one's really want that right so they spend like eight months one year they do it soon they so don't see any money at all and they just quit because no one wants that so yeah i think this is the nice nice longterm vision for building a sas company where there's a goal because there's a scale for that right you don't have to come up with the whole code base you don't have to find clients all the time right it's kind of like this is you know do it once right it's sell sell it you know many times i think that's the bottle right for a sass business right um and i i haven't told you this but we're actually internally building something sas as well internally here we're building something that will help students a lot a lot of students that kind of learn right and work in a building internally to kind of use it internally within us and who knows they might might go out to multiple people at some points in the future and that's the thing because you already have a lot of experience in the industry that you know what people want right and you have a group of people that you can deliver this to them right and they will give you a feedback and then you can improve the software and maybe go abroad with it that's a perfect approach for this so tell me jake i want to ask you this one question okay what excites you my friend like what excites you about what you're doing what excites me what i'm doing i mean overall that we can really have impact in the world that we can really like help other people and solve their problems like i think by the end of the day seeing how our clients are happy is the best like it's it's just it's yeah it's totally what i really love so when i was just a developer with a team like of course like boss boss could say that yeah great job of course that was really nice but now when i really see that we can save or earn people earn money for our clients it's just the best thing in the world or also that we are building our internal team and the collaboration with us is great that we can pace uh and actually provide jobs to other people man it is crazy and also like building the brand uh i mean it was always my dream starting from personal brand now to more like a broad brand it's another factor which just drives me on daily basis i think the most so that's awesome what do you think what kind of mindset do you think need to have in order to be able to build something like this like what might you to have when you go into like a software you see or you go into freelancing what do you think um yeah so i mean from like my mindset i think that in the end i'm not scared of failing at all i actually love to learn from my own uh mistakes it's it's very hard to to build this because it it it's very painful most of the time like the consult with the negotiations which i had to gone through like it's been really stressful like i had those days where i literally couldn't code at all there was very a lot of stress coming because those snitches they needed to be done but at the same time i had to just handle the negotiation part meeting part so it takes a lot it's hard uh but i don't know by the end of the day i when i zoom out and i see a like a long picture like a big picture i'm happy of my results from back right so you see the chart day by day it looks like a sinus like literally and there's a fail there's a wind there's a there's a win but overall the trend is going like this right so it's going up like but you just really need to think long long term yeah this is actually what gave me the biggest mindset and i think that gary vaynerchuk like he uh taught me this a lot because i was like reading his books listing his podcast and watching his content so i think that he taught me that yeah yeah he's very much about you know long term he's very much about kind of doing you know things and just being persistent with them right you know and not just trying to get the most out of the current situation right um it's very much about you know what just work at it give it some time of course right and so forth learn from your mistakes and because the biggest thing that people have is they give up right like even i partially i want to say i partially gave up i mean i didn't give up like because i had this i mean i still have the software agency right um but i just don't take any clients right now at this point right and nor do i want to um but the reason why i did this because i decided to go someplace else but just try to do something more more of what i love right which is what i'm doing right now which is i get to teach all the students i get to build courses and so forth and i get to be part of an amazing team and of course and um yeah so i kind of did that right but a lot of a lot of people they'll get into this with a lot of high expectations thinking you don't need much work and then and then you know ninety percent is extremely it's extremely hard so if you are like i don't know a quitter you just don't do it at this point it's not worth it uh you just need to know that you'll fail badly feel like a most of the days but overall if you zoom out it'll be nice no it's it it was like that like a lot a lot i had a lot of tough uh also conversation with my founder like we had a lot of different kind of views on the company we still have and overall it's all hard but yeah it excites me at the same time so that's why i'm doing it and also i think that will be a different opinion than blake had because i also heard the previous podcast with him like i know that when he started agency that he already was working somewhere and he could actually do both at the same time for me it wasn't the case if i do something i do it all in so i really need to save some money for those two three months and then quit everything and then the worst scenario is like i fail miserably i can always go back get another job so for me that was the case that i really had to decide be under the pressure and like literally have the survival mindset that if i won't do anything for next to three months i literally won't survive i don't need to move to parents or something so yeah that was my approach to this and i know that there are a lot of people who need to do the same yeah that's interesting but it's not the only way you can also keep your job and start your own yeah there's multiple ways to go about it um tell me this i'm very curious what is the hardest project that you had to do like what is the hardest project where maybe you lost money because you had to hire someone or you know it was a toughest project that you had to go through you know i've had my sheriff projects where literally it was a fixed price project so i thought it would take this amount of time it took a lot more i'm like holy next time no you know i'm losing money like what are some of the toughest parts that you that you that you did yeah so we had a free body experiences hiring people um it wasn't really about losing a lot of money fortunately we are lucky enough to do that but we also don't operate on those like super crazy prices yet right yeah like our biggest project but also over a few months has been like maybe 27k so if more projects but there are lower prices so there's nothing to lose that much and that's why also it's like let's say safe because me and my cofounder we have really good coders so we can always go and code it for ourselves but we had those situation that i hired someone and then i was asking for a fee for feedback and stuff like this i was checking and then after one week i was like hey we need to have it on monday it was like literally sunday morning and then the guy showed me that he literally has nothing i was like wow we had nothing and we had to do that so i literally like worked 24 hours straight and just build the mvp for the guy and showed up and i saved the project and the whole um relation with the client right wow so i had to do those sacrifices then actually it's the upwork thing it's also funny it wasn't about hiring but i hired a friend for design part because like there was a twostep process that we had to first give them designs and then code it so i hired the guy and then uh it was actually um a project with some people from korea i think and then uh they give me like kind of a paper visualization of the project of some dashboard and they said okay do it in a figma in a modern way so my friend is really good he's extremely good in figma he designed it in a really nice modern way and then um they had to have it ready on like tuesday hour morning in germany and i was like sending everything to them monday evening and then their ceo which i never saw again in my life they she called me and she said that this is completely wrong that it cannot be like that so i would say they kind of scammed me uh because she literally sent me a totally new different visions with different things and they say it needs to be ready for tomorrow i'm like what the i i just did what the guy asked me to do in the beginning here's the results and i was like okay i can't do that like let's like close this contract i won't give you any stars and i won't charge you for anything on upwork but please don't give me any bad opinion but unfortunately they didn't give me any bad opinion but unfortunately during upwork you have the success uh job rate right so basically it went down to like 80 or something so we weren't any more hundred percent and it up on upwork also that was the reason why we quit there because i was really pissed with this situation and in the end i had to pay my friend uh who is a designer just for my pocket money uh for that because of course he did what he wanted that he needed to do yeah that was like you think it's it's yeah again it's very hard and tough and most of the time so those are the situation and now the hardest part i think it was like this scraping project for uh dana that we delivered like it was extremely hard to build those scrapers that weren't the scrapers you see normally in the tutorials in the on youtube um they were all dynamic scrapers you to just handle the javascript and there was like literally millions of data uh so we built those scrapers but they were like very old pages and sometimes the javascript didn't really work and we had to literally go a few times over the whole like iterate over this page a few times we had like 40 different machines running on those pages in order to do it about it yeah on the gcp but even then it took like like i don't know 30 hours to even script whole thing and then i sent them the data and then sent they sent me data from like four years before and then it was less data right now it's like what the heck i'm like then i run it again run it again and i had to create another custom script we just combined the data and to delete duplicates and we are good but man it was very stressful also because i i also didn't sleep for like 24 hours just like rating with the guy checking on those computers if they are still running so yeah but it's been fun it's been fun we learned a lot tough times tough times holy that's insane so i mean you guys can see right like you know the reason why you ask this question a lot of times is again they showcase the reality of situations right like this can be hard like i've been in situations where i had this client who wanted this uh project and you know literally you know fixed our fixed price project and i told him hey it's gonna cost you seven thousand dollars right you know for like 60 hours or something but you know as we're doing it he wanted more and more and more and next to you know the project is like 300 that's the hours that's the case which happens to us yeah yeah 300 hours in and you and you cannot charge the client more i could not charge the client more right because i was willing to pretty much do anything to just to get a good review from the client exactly i still had to pay people exactly like dave the clients usually thinks that those things are included in the project but you never talk about before right so we also wanted to finish the project like we thought we literally before we end up finally getting paid for a project we finished it i think like eight times with more and more features which client thought they were in right so there were also situations like that but that's why you are also not putting all of the uh x in one bucket i would say when it comes to clients that's why we overall work for i think 14 different clients um and that's why we went and we are where we are right now that's awesome that's awesome so tell me how does your next five years look like where do you see yourself kind of go in the next five years tell me jacob i think five maybe it's a little bit too much uh definitely i don't want let's say in the next one year yeah definitely one year uh definitely we want to focus down on the one niche i don't know if it will be automotive finish i hope it will be with our approach right now uh i will not definitely double down right now on the whole marketing side and literally create like a b2b marketing part uh go back to youtube videos because in the by the end of the day actually youtube is crazy when it comes to getting clients like i created this one video for amazon mws which was kind of my first project on upwork i gave this solution on a youtube video there's no videos on the whole amazon nws i got literally like 30 or 40 potential emails for clients so i know it works and i have already this nice idea how i can approach the automotive niche i already have a kind of like i think 30 scrapers in 30 days for different marketplaces so man i have a lot of um ideas for it so that's definitely i think we want to grow a team uh that's definitely and at some point i want to uh i i would say not really focus on coding that much so in the whole selfmade um let's say life's a life span there were some moments when in the beginning i was doing a lot of marketing so trying to get a lot of leads and i was coding and then at some point i was just jealous of my cofounder that he always calls he gets a really nice coding experience like man i want to code a lot right now and over five last months i was just coding like 10 day 10 hours a day i would say on average man i can't look at this anymore i mean i have this sometimes really i want to get back to growing actually um a company doing a marketing getting on a client's calls uh meetings uh growing the team but also at the same time also like coding because i just love it right but it was at those stages so yeah yeah that's for sure i think it's so funny because i when i was when you were working with us i remember from you as well you're like man i just can't wait to code again i miss cutting so much you know all the time i hear from you just i miss cody i want to code you know and then here you tell me like i couldn't like i've heard it for five months i'm like i'm done with this yeah yeah yeah it's like something that's not a thing that i think that's why i think i might be a good fit to this that i could be let's say a ceo because i know a little a lot about coding so i know how to talk about the technique technical part but i also am very interested in the business side so that's why i really like this part that's awesome some somebody here asked a really good question amg asked what mindset are you looking for when hiring so like when you when you hire developers on upwork or whatever else might be do you look for specifically something or no tell me um so yeah with hiring you are very um career like i would say it's a very slow process for us uh and because we failed so many times right now we are mostly hiring my recommendations and that's part one and also when it comes to mindset i really want those guys to be part of our team so even though right now we can't afford like a fulltime yet developers right we want to um hire them for those contracts that that one day they will work with us fulltime so that's mostly the mindset that they want to work with the industry they're willing to learn new things uh because at some point i would love uh to build a lot of uh content around the company agency like podcasts videos and stuff like this so if they will also be interested in this thing that would be perfect i don't want to force anyone to do it that's perfectly fine right but if they are also willing to do those things man that's like a dream so wait wait wait wait you're saying you want to build up do a podcast or build a podcast what are you talking about you know like overall when it comes to like marketing part of our company i would love to like create a podcast more youtube content instagram content and so on so if our employees if they would love to show up on those things that i would be the happiest guy in the world so yeah i mean they would really believe in their brand right so they are really part of the brand of this family i would love that brand is so powerful brand is literally everything honestly like jacob like that's the one thing we realized here at a clever program right is like even for example we have a boot camp that we started here at clever program right it's a boot camp that you know that takes people you know towards becoming developers in early six months and because they've had so much brand over all these years we've been able to be been able to start this up really really fast and actually have a lot of demand for from other students right because of that um and we kind of just realized i'm holy because every time i get a call with a person who's who does want to join the boot camp they're like oh i saw this video or i saw you guys here i saw you guys in this video or in this video on this video right or saw you guys on instagram or even a tick tock right and like oh this is so cool like it's crazy how much how much brand has so much pop not power but like there's so much value right you know it's like what kind of like what um garyvee gary always says you know jab jab jab right hook right so jab jab jab give val give out give back and ask right very quickly right very and then not very quickly but then ask after that right and realize that that's such a like keeping that in check is so important keep it then in check and not always asking is such an important ask it's not such an important aspect and instead just always kind of trying to give value put yourself out there right because what you're creating is you create a family like that believes in you you know what i mean that believes in you exactly that's also there's a concept of like let's say um salary uh personally i would feel bad if i have just fixed salary especially in those early stages so whoever joins join us right now like he has a huge impact what are we in the future and i wouldn't just stop on like this fixed salary i would literally go to the bonuses and so on because like if the guy trusts us right now believes in us and he's a part of the team right now then if we grow into like multimillion dollar company right like i would have no problem to sharing devs with those people because they were there first they believed in us so i would feel really bad just paying fixed um yeah do you want to get to the multimillion dollar agency i think it's i mean we'll be there at some point i just don't know when uh but this will happen i mean if we keep up what we do that's what i believe uh the long term game and that's why i don't want to quit at all it's that if you really do it like especially okay right now in the automotive industry what we see is like there's a huge barrier it's extremely hard to get in like there are those people who are building this software there are those companies who are getting this offer from them so it's literally those are close man but if they will be open just a little we get in man and we are there um that's what i believe so at some point of course uh i think i mean i know we will get there it will be very tough it will be very hard yeah harder than ever but i'm excited for it because also why i'm in this is that this is like you cannot predict what will happen even you won't there are some patterns you don't know who you will meet um that's why i'm also excited so you never know and i just and i kind of remember you remember you kind of when you first kind of left uh clever programmer right and you want to start your short separate agency like you were such a more of a beginner on the aspect of like a software agency right or like a business type aspect right and now like a few months later like you're you're this grownup guy i'm not saying i mean you you were grown up before as well right but like more growing up in the knowledge base and and in your focus probably in terms of what you want to do a 22 year old right it's still pretty crazy you want to build your own software agency you got clients at 22 years old i don't know what i was doing 22 year olds but i was not building software ages that's for sure you know granted i was still working hard of course right that was still me always always but i wasn't doing that so from my point of view you know you're doing you're doing an amazing job and you know i'm really excited for where you're gonna go kind of the next few years you know i'm really excited appreciate it we this other pot this podcast in the next year or so again and we're going to call it man i'm housing for it it's going to be a million dollars now at that point seven figures one figure mode but man what's funny is like when you do this uh when you let's say go back and you look at yourself for example one a year ago two years ago and man every time i do this i i'm like what a jerk like who the i thought i am man so literally future myself are you watching this i'm sorry but man i'm excited so yeah i mean look you know it's the best part when you get to grow like even for example for me you know i get to look at myself you know when i've done i i watched recently the the the first video i did for clever programmer right i was like this innocent guy i was like hey guys you know how are you guys doing hope homeball is great you know you know and i just like i'm like i'm looking myself i'm like holy who is this guy you know and i remember the first time that they kazzy and the team they took me out to what's it called to um santa monica here and they put me on the spot and just said hey we'll film you it's called the the video is called seven years and seven minutes and i remember that was so yeah i saw it i was so scared i was my pants like you know i was so scared to be talking in front of so many people but now i get to do this every day now if i go to santa monica and i have to shoot a video it's like a piece of cake i'm like let's roll you know i'm gonna tell you even the video you recorded the seven years in seven minutes i watched that and at this point i was literally watching it and back in poland because i discovered a clever programmer like literally like i know three years ago i was watching kazzyman then i saw you as like man those those guys are so cool they know so much i wanna work with them one day and then i grew the instagram at some point i texted qazi man it just happened right it just happened you think about it every single day and you really want it but i believe that it will happen but you really need to work on that you just need to work on it you just need to work on it those of you who think you know i tell i tell this to a lot of students because i get to speak to a lot of students now at this point right it's very simple is that there's two types of people in this world there's the types of people who talk about what they want to be they talk about the goals i want to do this i want to do this i want to do that but they do nothing about it because you know how the human brain works it's like whenever you talk about something your brain feels like you're like you already feel good your brain kind of feels like you already accomplished that so you don't do anything about that so i really usually i don't even talk about stuff that's why i'm not also like on instagram anymore because it's like i really focus on the work right now we really focus on taking the action not really sharing about that that it's totally different when i was sharing a lot of stuff on instagram at some point i was literally automating this that i was resharing the same post i just felt good i felt productive but it was like all fake productivity it was it wasn't bringing any results in the end so also be careful when talking but also i hate myself when i talk about something and i won't do it that's another thing right i talk about something then people are telling me about something like what i said and i just need to do it so it can works in different ways depends on your personality again it's so funny for the for day he's like how do i join the team like domain is mechanic and software dev what's too much to enjoy trying to join the selfmade team we're trying to join the clever programmer team but yeah for those of you guys who do who are interested for example and you know getting
