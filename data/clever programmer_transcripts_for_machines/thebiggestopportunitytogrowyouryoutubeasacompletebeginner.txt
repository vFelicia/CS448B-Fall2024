really weird things like i didn't even know what a notebook was i didn't know how to write essays and i would write them in like size 72 font green colored uh comic sans i didn't know oh you have to write it in 12 size fonts so how does that kid go and grow a coding channel to this much and you know it doesn't mean it has to be coding you can really grow a channel or uh youtube around whatever your passion truly is so who am i this is a little bit about me um i was making 104 000 a year at 21 as a freelance developer i've taught hundreds of thousands students to like learn programming and coding that was my passion teaching people coding has been my passion and clever programmers all about teaching people how to code and i became a millionaire at the age of 25 and now i want to share all of those insights with you guys are you guys excited about this by the way does this pump you guys up because it gets me going and uh here we are with our youtube stats beautiful and now guys there's tons of youtube channels out there and especially if you guys are here and maybe you're you know some of you guys i know one of you have talked to your professional comedian some of the people

awesome sejo lam in the house yo sejo it's about time you start learning youtube too now my friend sayuri is here beautiful logan shivang let's says let's do this all right let's do this so now there's tons of channels right there's traversing media for coding uh you have this other channel deved for coding you have this channel aaron jack joe mctech he grew his youtube channel so like these are examples of channels that are coding related i'm also growing my personal channel on youtube where i'm just talking about things that really matter to me and what i'm about and a lot of the things that are on my mind is business related marketing related and i am running a real business with between 15 to 20 employees so those are the things i want to talk about and share and so i'm growing and i'm about to break my first thousand subscribers on this new brand as well all right so i'm pretty excited about that and now here is how like youtube really works right so i want to actually just go here and let me ask you guys a question would you guys like to see my like real behind the scenes stats on my youtube channel can i share with you my actual youtube analytics from clevver programmer gabby says i am pumped this is real gold thank you for this opportunity thank you guys for being here so let me share something with you guys right let's go to uh my i'm gonna take you guys literally behind the scenes and show you guys how my like literally all the analytics on my youtube so here we go so this is a clever programmer that you guys are actually looking at all right this is what's happening in the last 28 days i can switch the last 90 days but check this out right this youtube channel right now it's getting about 56 000 views 62 000 views a day 76 000 views a day 57 000 views a day um 62 000 on november 14th and you guys can also see how much youtube is paying me so youtube here is paying me 4 665 so far this month i can switch over here and you can see how much youtube is paying me on the daily revenue all right so here's 176 175 413 168 in november third november 14th now i don't want to make it seem like it's easy it's a lot of hard work and it's a long process a long journey but i just want to ask you guys how many of you guys would be excited if you woke up and you just were paid 157 dollars for like something you were already passionate about and just sharing with the world and you woke up another day and you had a check come in 471 and then the other day 218 would that be exciting for you guys and again i'm not trying to make it sound like some easy thing that you can do overnight i'll also show you the hard work that's required but i just want to get a sense of like does it actually excite you because if it doesn't you're not gonna like want to do a lot of things so joey's excited about it raul charity cooper awesome so let me show you guys like what it actually looks like in reality okay so you guys are seeing all the wins but if i go lifetime i'm showing you guys my highlights of what's happening here that's what you guys were looking at all right here's what nobody [ __ ] looks at or knows about this right here that what was happening here guys can somebody tell me in the chat what was going on at that point and by the way guys this is day one of the youtube challenge if you want to participate in this youtube challenge make sure that you have signed up for the facebook group and make sure that you have like sent a text where it asks you all right so make sure you're in the facebook group it's in the description below if you're watching this on youtube right now so here nothing is happening right joey just said nothing is happening there's nothing going on right here all right this is what you have to get through to actually make it about something that where people will start viewing you where people will actually start following you where people will actually start believing in you it's actually like a really long journey to get to here the problem with most people that happens is they have the expectation of this so they literally start with this in mind you're never gonna make it through this right if you're um if your eyesights are set on this thing it's kind of like going to work out and every day just being angry like why do i not have a [ __ ] six pack like every single day you get done working out you look in the mirror and you're like you suck you don't have a six pack so it's just as crazy as that you gotta actually set your sights on this and how many of you guys would like that you get to share something you're passionate about and you get to make a living out of it show of hands drop it in the comments how many right and also i want to ask you you don't need to make millions of dollars right how much would you want to be able to make to be able to like would you be happy if just step one you could make a living out of it like make a living out of sharing what you know on youtube so whether you are into cooking and you're sharing tips about cooking whether you're into professional comedy and you're sharing comedy or you're into being a developer and you want to just share things about coding or whatever journey that you're on would it be cool to be able to make a living out of it or some side income out of it right so that's something else i want you to think about and i also want you to think about is this something you want to just pursue as a hobby or is this something like if you were getting results you would really seriously commit to because i think like if you want to go on this journey those things are good to think about ahead of time so you kind of know what you're getting into uh joey says all of them for me jeannette says yes olivia says yes yes yes ricardo says even as a side job i would be happy that is awesome let me see where the comments are because i used to be able to pop up comments all right here we go nice so we have stephen and steven is like yes beautiful all right um and guys if you try to do the texting and it doesn't work that's okay don't worry about it too much but like make sure you actually at least give it a try all right cool now let me actually zoom in on this period where nothing was happening okay so let me go here and let me talk to you about so let's go to i'll i'll uh go to 2016 is where i got started right take a look at this march through november okay or let's just say march through october alright do you guys see how march through october look at the amount of views i'm getting i'll click first of all i made 10 and look at my views march through october think about this i got no more than ten dollars and i was getting maybe two views four views eight views 16 views 12 views march october is almost 10 months i got my first breakthrough in december so that's actually like 10 months long right now in reality i also wasn't producing much content so if you guys see here i only made two videos here right and then i only made like one video here in 2016. you guys see that but then like this is where i actually took it seriously in august and once i took it seriously and started making videos it started actually taking off faster yep joey says that's basically means that's the thing joey like everybody goes through that part of the journey so don't feel alone in that um that is like completely and totally part of the journey to actually getting to where you want to get to because it feels completely stagnant but then if i fast forward that to let's just say i'll fast forward this to 2017 and we'll just go to the month of like january right and watch what happens boom you guys see that i get my big breakthrough in like around december right and this is where it starts to like take off and we get 11 000 subscribers boom and now it's like taking off um i don't even have the option for monetization yep match sources what happened in august lots more video production yes so a lot of video production happened around august and october because that's when i decided to just go okay now i'm gonna take it seriously and i was i found a way to start producing a lot of videos and where i built my channel right like this that you guys see this this this hustle right here this was built in a one hour window okay so i used to go to um i would go to work i would go to my college and i had fulltime call like i would go to college i'd come back and then i would go and do bunch of parttime jobs so whether i was teaching coding to people or i was teaching like chess to people and i would drive and i would do a lot of freelancing work i would come home i would leave home at 6 00 a.m and i would come home at 9 00 p.m okay so i had like really long days and um i would take the train in chicago and it would be like freezing cold and within that i would when i would come back home but i only had a window of one hour between 9 00 p.m to 10 p.m that was like my one hour window in that one hour window i would i essentially grew my channel that's where i would make the videos so every time i got home i had one hour and then i would just get to work and a lot of people are like so what does that mean like were you coming up with the idea in that one hour two no for me i was using the chemistry class at college and in that chemistry class i would actually come up with the video ideas so in that chemistry class i'd be sitting there and i'd be like you know if i go to youtube and we switch to your channel and let's go here videos and let me sort by oldest right and this is where i would come with my video ideas i would be like oh i'll make tutorial part two and then i'm like all right i'll make a fibonacci video because i learned fibonacci i'll make tutorial part three and as i was learning coding this is the important part i want you guys to understand as i was learning coding i wasn't that good at coding yet as i was learning it i was teaching it on youtube does that make sense as i was learning it like even this like look at this video i never thought for it to get 50 000 views it's literally [ __ ] called coursera r programming week two assignment one look at the name of this nonusable values r programming week two assignment one pollutant mean walk through part one you guys think that i made this video for it to blow up on youtube like just honestly like answer this question i made this video for just one student who i was working with at the time and i wanted to help him like there's really basic stuff here right i'm like writing a for loop but it helped a lot of people even a phd student andrew jones is like yo i'm a phd student trying to get my head around r this is a great resource i learned something and then boom shared it so for you guys it doesn't matter whether it's for coding or it's for complete something completely different if you learn something you can just share it uh and here's a really crazy thing that's happening right i actually helped my brother jump on youtube and i just helped start like start uh start the channel with him and look at this he started if i go to oldest he started literally one year ago right and he started talking about he's like nobody's gonna listen to me talk about colors and color grading and all that stuff started talking about a year ago and boom look at that he's made 132 000 subscribers and with a lot of hard work and effort and energy he cleared over 1 million dollars in the last 12 months so those are some crazy results but this is kind of just to share with you like what is possible and if you actually follow these steps it's really really possible i think for everyone who's gonna put in that effort right uh with that said the disclaimer i will make is kind of like lebron james right like and gary vee talks about this and i love it he goes everybody who touches the basketball like but doesn't mean you you you're gonna be lebron james so there's definitely some talent at play but even with that said there's nothing that you can't learn my brother had a background in doing video me i had a background in doing nothing all my brother taught me is like this is how you open final cut pro and that was as far as my training went and i was like got it and then i just got to work and made like 490 videos with that so it's really like up to you how far you want to take it i don't have any professional education i'm a college dropout i didn't go to film school so yeah um and you can grow your channel about many many different things right here is another one of the people who's actually one of my clients and he works with us and i'll show you this right so take a look at this he is making videos on just communication skills and take a look at this right he broke 11 000 subscribers and now he's getting close to a point where he can actually make a living from his channel and some of the other things i'm going to share with you guys is ad revenue on youtube is not the only way to make an income on youtube by the way guys most people think it's just ad revenue no like from my ad revenue i've only made 97 000 but by selling my products i've made over 2.6 million dollars under the age of 26. so that's to just show you uh that the real game is actually like understanding how youtube you can use it to then actually even sell something if you really wanted to like scale it up but if you're not worried about scaling it up and just living your passion you can just like go with ad revenue and be fine okay so right this is such a he sits there and he just talks about like listening skills and explaining irvin goffman's expressive order like what the right and look at the viewership that it has here's another video presentation of self and impression man everybody it's bruce lambert right this is a pretty good video because he has really good like content in there but if you look at the video it's pretty simple right he shot it with the webcam it's like fairly straightforward there's no fancy editing right so do you guys feel the people who are here do you feel like you could sit in front of the camera and talk for a few minutes and then just like hit the button to stop can you guys do that is there something that you can share with people that might help them that you can just speak for you don't need to be able to speak to it for more than just a few minutes right like some of my videos i'll show you that are actually uh really really popular and like really really blew up the channel if i actually sort by most popular videos they're just like few videos that really blew up the entire channel and some of them like are pretty simple some of them are pretty complicated and there's a lot of editing that happened and so that's where like you'll you know if you can do that that'll like help you blow up even faster so that was one of my things i want to make sure my videos are good right but here this video if you look at it most of the time i'm sitting there and talking language because once you learn the concept of language as a human being it's a way to express your emotions and ideas to other people once you learn that at its very core you can transfer over to any other language things why you might want like look at that i didn't even edit my gulps like i'm literally gulping [ __ ] in the video like and like it's just there so you can even have videos where it's fairly unedited and you can sit there and talk do any of you guys think you can sit in front of a camera and talk devin says that's all i do now uh matt shark says nope that's what's holding me back so bluntly how do you get the balls to do that oh okay i love that so that's a great question um i like when we get into like questions and answers guys i think that's where i can provide you the most value so if you can think of questions and ask me i would love to answer them and if like nas or anybody frankie or aaron if you guys see really good questions you can just like give them to me like good ones you know not just like generic but something like i would love to answer them um so when it comes to speaking in front of the camera for me it was pretty scary so like i'll give you something um here's the secret you don't need to so watch this video values and what i'm going do you guys see my face anywhere in this video by the way nowhere right so um you can like i don't have my face anywhere in this video i don't have my face anywhere i'll tell you this like if you're truly scared of sitting in front of the camera and talking you don't need to actually even show your face i mean i think it'd be better if you did because people want to follow people and people love like personalities and things like that but you could like there are many channels i'll show you there are many channels that have grown that never ever show their face and some of the coding channels i gave an example of earlier like corey schaefer or traversing media they barely have their face in any of the videos and they get millions and millions of views so um if you're talking about something valuable i don't actually think that that's a requirement if you're like just too scared but i'll show you like in the start i was pretty shy like if you you can hear from my voice i simply did not know where to go even the forums didn't help me so that's pretty much my main point to help everybody else out there so we're going to be taking the codecademy course here and we're going to be taking in in the language called python and there are tons of students in the world here two points older millions it's a fairly different long course and put a loud mouth on me nervous beginner so all right let's pause this before the older me files a copyright infringement lawsuit against myself all right let's get out of here so um i see your face drinking in the branding on the corner yeah exactly um any advice on how to increase your odds and chances in making your video going viral that's a pretty good question too really hey um so to answer the first question guys at first you're gonna suck so worst case scenario hide your face but if you care about bringing your face in um if you care about bringing your face in and learning like just going through the suck like i knew i sucked right about here but like i just did it and then just through sheer practice right sheer practice sheer practice of just making tons and tons of tons and tons of videos then like i transformed as a human being and had like you know just became a very different person and how i spoke and how i talk and how it carried myself and it took a really long time to be able to do that right so you guys can actually go through and actually see the journey so hopefully that answers that question hopefully um okay another one by i'm gonna also take one by julio is there any equipment you recommend for an entrepreneurial livestock channel um frankie can you please like save these questions somewhere maybe just send them to me in slack or or nas can if you guys can just drop them somewhere so i can then have an order and i can just go through them no no i just want to go to nas okay okay all right i'll go to the five thing all right one second guys i'm gonna go to i can't find it youtube does challenge youtube challenge okay here we go nice thank you thank you thank you all right guys so i'm getting all your questions so if you're asking good questions they're going to be here i have a devin's one as well and i'm going to answer in a second so the question about you uh you guys got julio's question saved okay please somebody go ahead and save that and drop that in slack so uh when it comes to making your video go viral i'll share with you guys some secrets on that so what i recommend when it comes to a video going viral is there are there are certain like hacks to it so first step is go and look at the most popular videos of somebody else so if you guys are making your own thing and maybe you're making it on coding or something slightly different you can model this channel and you can see oh this video is the most popular okay can i make a video in coding for top five programming languages to learn if i can then i try to make it as close to this one as possible but then improve in certain areas that's the hack you can either put your ego above everything else or you can put results above everything else guys and let me ask you a question egos or results do you want to feed your ego or do you want to feed your results let me know what do you think if you want to feed results more well then uniqueness is not a great idea let me ask you guys another question if you had an option to open up a physical store do you want to open that physical store up in a desert in the middle of a desert where there's nobody there or would you rather open up your store in a mall where there are other plenty of stores there which one if you picked desert that's that's that's the wrong answer if you picked the mall that's a great answer because there's already foot traffic there right so uniqueness right makes you be you may is like opening up a store in a desert where nobody's ever going to come to your store so people get they want to get too unique what i recommend is like find channels that are similar to your niche look at their most popular videos and then try to make them and if you can make it really closely and then make it better in terms of like the content that you deliver then you're just gone you're gone like you're just gonna fly as a channel and this hack works everywhere um so you know i'm not stealing anybody's content like this is all my content all the ideas are mine but i made it extremely similar but the the title is like the same because i know that that's going to get the most amount of attention and then once i get the attention then i'm gonna deliver and pack it with information does that make sense all right hopefully that answers the question i still don't see julia's question i couldn't see the comments okay all right so uh julia if you can ask that question again um i don't know but we missed it sorry so i think you were asking for recommendations for like equipment julio so what i would say is i have a really amazing setup with my vlogging so if you go to my rafikaze channel right if you go to and by the way guys subscribe to the channel i want to i want to break uh 1000 subscribers here you know so that would really help so um let me click videos hey we broke 900 damn that's sick all of the content here is shot with this like vlogging camera that i got and it's like it's the best thing i've ever invested in it makes my life so freaking easy so like i'll show you some of the content so for example here thousand subscribers let's talk about it guys i've grown my own youtube channel to over 830 000 subscribers called clever way this part is pretty currently time for a coffee break oh hmm yeah it's good it's real good so that my friends is uh this camera julio is i shot it with sony zv1 all right it's right here if i go to my orders oh nice matt short says subbed i love that subscribed already all right cool so let me show you guys here where my where this camera is so i think right here so anyways it's a sony zv1 right here camera for content creators vlogging and youtube with flip screen and microphone so this is the one that i used and then here's the vlogger accessory kit and battery so if you just ordered these whoops the [ __ ] if you ordered these three things you're perfect to start shooting with that but honestly if you want to just shoot the videos that helped me grow to like millions of subscribers or wait not yet what the hell am i talking about pretty soon though uh stuff that's getting helped me get over like 30 million views guys i only i shot most of my content with a logitech like a webcam a cheap ass webcam that's 70 bucks and then i use screenflow to make all my videos all right so that's like a really cheap setup that i would recommend for most of you so here's like logitech whoops let's go logitech uh all right and uh c920 i believe is the webcam you want to use so this is about 70 bucks and then uh the other one that you have is screenflow which will cost you like 100 bucks and for windows it's going to be like camtasia or something crappier so you can use that too but for for ios like screenflow is the way to go and honestly guys if money is an issue you can even use your freaking iphones i'm telling you like i'm not trying to i'm not exaggerating with this i am i for some of my vlogs i've used iphone so like let me and you can use your iphone to actually edit so i edited this one with my iphone to check this one out right so 109k right now it was the top i had was 100 i had 150 i'm getting dropped off at the airport and i'm here's my uber driver fivestar service random [ __ ] happened yesterday and i was taking care of that so with that said holy crap i just checked our sales and check it out yesterday apparently we did five thousand eight hundred eighty seven dollars almost six thousand thank you so this one so you guys see that right that is shot with sony zv1 and i use my iphone to edit it and i use an app called video leap so like you guys in that in in the in software sense i honestly think that video leap is one of the best apps yo guys um video leaps is like the one of the best apps that you guys can use so this i really really recommend for editing on your phone i think it's like one of the best ways to do it like you don't even have to get fancy with editing on final cut pro or screenflow sometimes you can use this and it is amazing cool uh devin says obs is amazing yes obs is really really cool ecamm is even better so if you right now the stream is happening on ecamm all this stuff that i'm doing is happening on ecamm and between the two i'm i'm using i've used both and uh we've gotten over like millions of views using both obs and ecam i am a crazy fan of ecam it's just so much easier like million times easier and gives you everything you could need the difference between like why you would actually need obs versus ecam like you can use ecam for the next four to five years and maybe then you might need um like just obs or streamlabs for some particular reason but i mean obs is free you know so that's that's one thing uh somebody says dinner download video leap okay cool all right so i'm gonna answer some of the questions you guys have asked um how did you schedule so devin asks how did you that's cool i can just share the screen devin asks how do you schedule your content when you have a lot of ideas i honestly like everybody has a different way of going about it i don't schedule really anything i just kind of like randomly i'm sitting there and i feel an idea and i'm like oh [ __ ] it'd be so cool to just make a video on this and then i make it and then that's it and then i just repeat that process forever very few times we had stuff truly planned out on a content calendar um so honestly even with a big team we our content calendar is just like it's very creative you know so i feel like sometimes you know again and my personality might be really different than yours i just once i feel inspired i just do it and um you know i just usually just go one idea at a time just one i try not to look too far ahead because it gets really complicated you know i'm a professional chess player i'm like top one percent in the world and even with chess like i you know they say the best chess players they ask them like hey how many moves you look ahead and they asked alexander alakine and he's like just one so even in chess i'm usually just looking one move ahead i think simple there's something beautiful about simplicity uh logan blom asks you look shy at your first videos how did you change your mindset or just need to practice oh i can't help emphasize the word practice in there i cannot emphasize the word practice in there so let me go like this all right if you could only do practice or you could only do mindset to improve your skill which one would you guys choose let me put another way if you could only use mindset to grow your muscles or you could only use practice aka exercise to grow your muscles which one would you choose if you could choose only one guys you could choose only one that is the [ __ ] difference i as gary v would say i'm a practitioner um i don't live in fury land la la land there are a lot of people that are way way way smarter than me they sound way smarter they're brilliant minds but what are their results what are what are their channels like problem is they live too much in here so the practicality is where really everything happens i cannot emphasize that enough i believe that mindset will help you but like i think your focus should be 99 on practice you will just improve so fast if you focus on practice there we go practice it's a muscle memory guys if you have to pick between the one practice right you can't just choose mindset and just think about working out but never work out you gotta go so if you have to pick between the one you would pick practice and i would say that i would emphasize the practice part a lot more mindset is of course part of the game and i used to watch a lot of content on how to improve yourself your communication skills i would go and like meet strangers and that would help me i would go and like interview strangers there was a lot of hardship that i've put myself through to develop these communication skills that i have today um so yeah yeah um it you can develop it i promise you can develop it if you put in a lot of practice if you make the [ __ ] amount of videos i've made you will get there i've made over 1 000 plus videos plus lives like maybe close to 2 000 right and this is not including the amount of instagram stories i've made oh my god where i'm speaking i mean if you added it all up i probably have over like 10 to 30 000 of hours of like video footage and content where i was speaking and saying words you get really really damn good at it and just becomes second nature all right cool um but great great great great great great question uh nikhil asks how did you decide on what content and what videos you want to create it was very simple i saw everybody in my computer programming courses quit college and they're like [ __ ] this they started hating computer science because of how i was taught they started hating programming how i was taught luckily for me i learned programming on my own and so i learned it in a way that was a lot more fun entertaining at my own pace and so i'm like i'm gonna just teach it in a fun way and i want like i just need here's another thing right this is another important thing guys you don't need that many people to be happy or to get the results that you want right guys how many jobs do you need to you need to have to feel secure just one right how many viewers need to watch my video for me to feel happy just one how many people need to watch my content and have their lives changed as a result of it for me to feel fulfilled just one so when i think about this how did you decide to on what content what videos you want to create for me it was all about like i am learning programming i'm just gonna share everything i know it'll help one person it'll help the older me or sorry the younger me right as long as i can help the younger me or the me in the past that would be amazing that is all i could ask for and dream about so that is how i decided to go and i didn't let any insecurities get in the way even though they did you know for a while i just went so that's on that end all right let's see what other questions we have um is it good idea to have two channels with the same content in english and spanish here's the truth most people don't even have the bandwidth to produce on one channel so i think it makes your life very tough if you think you can do it then do it okay all right uh pulkit says did you advertise your channels in your videos automatically or this automatically start getting traction they got traction by themselves i recommend you guys never spend a dollar on something that hasn't made you a dollar yet all right it's a recipe for absolute disaster catastrophe okay if you cannot make one dollar with zero dollars all right if you cannot make one dollar with zero dollars you should not spend one dollar but if with zero dollars you can make one dollar then you can spend that one dollar and now make two dollars does that make sense so eventually we learned how to do paid like first i learned organic marketing through youtube and then we learned paid advertising and now when we spend money we make a lot of money back because we understand principles of content marketing youtube messaging um how to sell a product how to pitch a lot of skills a lot of principles you got to learn along the way as you're getting there right but the important thing is in the start keep it very very simple so you can actually enjoy the journey along the way of like wherever you're getting quani says what mistakes would you correct that you made in the past to speed up your growth and getting to 800 000 subscribers faster i think that uh that's a great question and i think i would be very religious to making really really big heavy hitting content on a regular basis which something i'm just thought about right now and i'm like holy [ __ ] like we should actually make top five a priority for this week like number one like the only one priority for youtube this week because we need to shoot that video and like we should actually have a deliverable date so what's a good deliverable date um nas what do you feel like no absolutely not bro i'll shoot it if i need to oh okay so 23. cool so we'll we're going to drop a video so you guys see you guys saw the process november 20 what no cool so you guys saw the process november 23rd we'll drop top five programming languages to learn in 2021 that's going to be the next biggest banger and it's going to get a lot of views because you guys saw the one we dropped in 2020 got so many views and so if we actually make sure that we're dropping home run titles every week some some not home runs right some like hey like something just to help people out and give value like we're going to talk about how to build apps and we're going to talk about how to build your resume and portfolio and all of that but then there are home run titles that we're gonna do and that gets us that big big big reach all right cool people said you dropped should be still here um cool all right cool cool cool all right so that's what i would fix i would be very religious about making sure i'm dropping consistent content like banger i call it banger titles like the i'm dropping the bangers on a consistent basis that would be really important um who inspired you to go on youtube did you remember that so for me i was inspired in a weird way it was out of the hate for the college education system and how much it sucked and how they killed your soul and any ounce of joy or curiosity you had to pursue really anything because it would go hey make the hello world week one all right week two make a complicated pizza application that has modular la la la and everybody's like oh my god i'm quitting college programming is not for me so that inspired me and then some other stuff that inspired me was i saw how many crappy other youtube channels there were that were making this content and getting so many viewership and so many subscribers from the start it was a lot out of like anger and like um what are these people doing like i i wanted to just help in any way i can and i wanted to make the education system better um and then as time progressed i went from having like these like negative type of uh drivers like like for example like having jealousy or envy be my driver or having uh you know ah [ __ ] this other person's like youtube channel like i want to make a better one than them there is so bad like those were like my low level like motivators and start but then as time progressed i you know 2017 2018 i got really unhappy with that because i i had like ran away and beat everybody that i could and then it was like what do i do now and i like was go surpassing all my mentors and everybody that like i had set a goal and i was like this is a really weird [ __ ] moment like what do i do now who do i compete with or try to be like i just ran out and so i had to really reverse engineer how i thought about everything and that was extremely hard but now my motivation is very different and my north stars are very different and now you know like for example now one of our biggest driving goal is to help 5 000 developers get jobs in 2021 and if 5 000 developers got jobs that paid them 50 000 a year or more well here's a cool thing that happens that adds 250 million dollars to the global economy so now it's actually really exciting to help the global economy improve by helping developers get jobs so that is a much more interesting and fascinating and exciting goal than i want to beat this other youtube channel but hey if it gets you going in the start it's still good all right um so let's see if there are more questions we have uh okay is it okay to use the same video title how to make a distinguishable title yeah it's okay to use the same title thumbnail and title is the name of the game so yes you can make the same video title um and you don't really need it to be distinguishable you can have it be distinguishable like literally at the end it could just say stacy like for rafa cosby i could literally have get somebody else's exact title and add the word rafi in there or add rafikaze in there i could um so yeah it's not too hard to be able to do that and you don't really need it to be that much distinguishable you can but like if it's popular i would stay very close to it then like thumbnail i would make it a little bit different than like video i would just like pack it with my truth and my content my values um okay cool how much earned from uploading videos to be honest youtube for us doesn't pay us that much like it's because we're a coding channel and our cpms are really low so you know right now you guys saw we're getting between 150 200 a day from just youtube what's up oh somebody asked that oh yeah see uh it's just like how cost per thousand impressions so it's like how much youtube pays you per like the ads they run on your videos and so um that's the automatic money you get paid for making content that's another way of thinking about it and it's very little for a channel like ours the coding channel because the market the watch is a coding channel they don't have a lot of money so our channel because of that won't make a lot of money it's going to be like lower on the cpms but that's okay like we're not worried about the money we just want to help them get jobs with our growth right now and where we're at we're making between three to five thousand dollars a month so i'll say that okay uh that's how much it's paying us uh okay koch says what was the hardest and easiest things you did to get where you are hardest things i've done uh to to get where i'm at are man hardest things is like letting team members go from the team i think that's one of the hardest things to do um and then when it comes to the easiest things is to grow is like just literally the also similar thing like hiring the people who are like really good fits and so hiring the right people is the best way to grow my business like it's has been the best uh way to grow business historically and the other one is the hardest uh other things that were really hard i think is um trying to grow my business alone and having this attitude of like [ __ ] it i'll do it myself it got me far but it could only get me so far and you know what got you here won't get you there and so i was like stuck at small levels and so right now we're growing fast we're expanding fast because that mentality has changed and like learning leadership was one of the hardest things and leadership is a lot about like actually being a servant leader like actually listening to people being really humble truly truly putting some of the team like team members actually like above you serving to their needs uh and so that's like a really hard part like most of the team gets paid as much as me or more uh anytime somebody's salary is about to increase everybody's salary increases before mine increases um i'm i'm not actually paying myself that much and i do everything out of my personal for all my personal stuff and i don't even go clothes shopping i don't do fancy [ __ ] everything is reinvested back into the business back into this back into the people so that's where my intentions are and that's what my actions show i think that has made me a way better leader over time i think that's 2017 and got me the respect of my team i think earlier in 2017 2018 success got to my head really really quickly and i became an [ __ ] and i was mean to people and i didn't really care that much about what was happening i got into fame into money into success into just everything really really really quick and for me i didn't know how to handle i was just like living in the fanciest places in la i was like traveling everywhere around the world i dated whoever i wanted like it was just it was crazy and so it was a lot it was a different type of lifestyle and then end of 2018 i kind of was at the brink of losing everything and then 2019 was where i had a rebirth and 2020 is just oh my [ __ ] lord like we're just getting started though so that's the cool thing we're growing faster than we've ever had before but i really truly believe that this is just the complete beginning and i cannot like i i'm just so excited about working with everybody here i'm so thankful that you are here watching this like seriously everybody who's here watching this right now i'm like so extremely thankful and grateful for that and now what i'm extremely excited about is the impact that we can create together so for example i'll tell you something right when i make a video what i look at is how much did it help the world move forward so i'll tell you what that means so let's just go to the last seven days all right i'll click on watch time now i have this watch time over here and it says 30 000 hours this month okay so now i'm going to take 30 000 hours and divide it by 24 because there are 24 hours in day that gives me 1250 days and i'm going to divide that by 365 to get years it gives me 3.4 years so let me show you let me tell you what i'm talk gonna get to here okay in the last seven days okay in just the last seven days here we have produced enough value and we help the world move forward by three and a half years so think about that literally in the last week we helped the entire world move forward by three and a half years so this is the metric i look at that's the metric i look at this is how much value we've provided so if in one week we can help the world move forward by three years well let's take a look at how much we helped the world move forward this year so let's just click 2020. 1.5 million hours so let's take a look at what that accounts to so we'll do 1.5 million hours divided by 24 divided by 365. we have helped the world move forward by whoops by 171 years just this year right so that is like everything that is the most exciting thing to us and so what i think about is how much impact we can have if i could be even like a little sherpa or just like a little stepping stone for you that could inspire you to start your own youtube channel so you can actually make an impact and together maybe we can move this number up to 200 years or 250 years and maybe there's just one person that i can help inspire here that goes on and helps change lives of other people helps get other people get jobs helps share what they know so then other people watching your stuff get inspired and move faster and move forward that is the most unbelievably exciting thing to me i've never felt more in my purpose i've never felt more in my calling i literally have never felt happier than i have had in the recent like last few days because this i feel like is you know like if we actually work on this together and you guys actually jump in and actually start your youtube channels and start making content and start providing value to the world i think that it's gonna be pretty unbelievable what we would be able to actually achieve and the change we will be able to create in the world and i would love to document that i would love to document that i would love to just have all of our wins combined together all of our youtube channels like i would love to have it somewhere where if you guys like were producing content i'd love to be able to sh like put it in an air table and talk about it like yo together all of us just like made this much impact in the world and if you can even help the world move forward by one minute or one day that is huge that's what i used to look at when i was in college like when i decided to drop out i was just seeing these tiny things and i was like oh my god my one days of effort has produced two days of like moving forward of the world oh my god my two days of effort has helped the world move forward by four it is that is insane if i can keep doing that well then of course i can for money i can make four times the amount of money because i'm helping the world move forward by four times i can make four times the amount of impact because i'm helping the world move forward four times so that was like just one of the most exciting things for me that became my drivers that became the reason i do what i do and i did what i did and i continue to do what i continue to do so would you guys want to join me on this journey like i'm starting my own youtube channel that's like completely from scratch the rafikaze one and building it up would you guys want to join me as we start to head into 2021 would you want to start your youtube channels right now in 2020 and we can finish it off and maybe you have one [ __ ] view one view but we can add it to the list we can document it this can be the start of you sharing what you value with the world would you want to do that with me drop it below let me know is that a yes for you or a hell yes for you let me know because i would love to build this out and document everybody's and grow together and as we start to head into december 2020 i like i i'm getting goosebumps right now thinking about it but if we all had youtube channels that were popping up that would be amazing and i think that that is can be your calling too because you get to share with people what you love we got nishal says i'll join you nigina radeon carl surfaces subscribe to share the journey eduan says yes give long says yes joey says hell yes justin says love the value you're providing nissan says

to a 90 would you guys like to take your commitment of starting your youtube channel making your first video from a 30 to a 90 well then let me share something with you there's something called implementation intention all right scientists have found that motivation can get you 30 of the way there but if you set an implementation intention it gets you there 90 plus percent of the times so

practical real fast you can even make a living from it pretty soon but just please like right now don't even think about making money from it just do it i love it plasma cheyenne says november 25th 11 p.m yo no no no sham december 17 that's too far reduce it reduce it guys the more you can reduce it the more likely it's going to happen the farther it is the more unlikely it's gonna happen especially if you haven't already been posting videos if you guys set the shooting and the other day too far it's not gonna happen i know how this stuff works guys if you want to do it and actually put in your channel i would recommend shoot it right after this and as a homework have it ready for tomorrow and keep it simple keep your first video simple so you don't make it over complicated second video you can get fancier justin oh justin you were also on the freaking thing yesterday man this is exciting bro you were you were on the you're going to be creating a game development channel i [ __ ] love this awesome justin i'm pumped bro i'm pumped ready i'm dropping a dmbot video on sunday 8pm awesome started a while back already ricardo awesome two videos already let's get it quani hey oh [ __ ] frank just got his smb7 that is so cool this guy's is an smb7 um shore mic and so you guys don't need this but you can get it and frank if you got the money which i know you do you should get the road caster pro as well it's just fantastic you can do stuff like hey you know you got some music going it's absolutely amazing for controlling the audio if i want to have some clapping going on here so i would recommend investing in that julio says i will shoot on sunday december 6 and post within the week awesome if you can shorten the cycle julio please do it i'll tell you guys this for my new vlog guys i shoot every day and i publish a video i was publishing a video every day while running a huge company so i'm telling you guys you don't need that much time uh i shot like a little bit here and there and then i would spend between two to four hours to edit and then the whole thing would be edited if you guys want to make your life simple just point the camera yourself or your phone just talk and that's it you don't even need to edit it you don't even need to do anything to it okay so you can keep it pretty simple joey says i already texted you bro this was amazing amazing amazing amazing uh justin says could i post my video i did last friday for feedback absolutely justin you can do that if you guys already have videos you can post them for feedback uh post it under this post i think that's one place i might we might make a homework post no where's not okay cool uh yes if we can make a homework post if maybe aaron is here you guys can like make a homework post yeah okay cool all right so theo says i got a video right now beautiful quantity says appreciate the value brian says started tick tock because if you dude amazing you take a look at what i'm doing on my tick tock shit's blowing up feedback would be dope luke says great it's 2 a.m here i will do my first video i'm going for a weekly friday video so i can post my video from last friday for feedback yes you guys can uh got 30 views on the video i uploaded today arpan amazing congratulations that is awesome great job julia says i'll shoot an intro video today then just tell the camera um my plans for youtube and upload it yes that's brilliant so guys what julio just said is absolute money and i want you to pay attention to this all right this is money this is money okay there is a layer of private accountability but it's when you're doing something that's new that you haven't done before that doesn't mean [ __ ] because a week later you're not gonna do it he is going to do public accountability so this is a beautiful tactic that julio is going to use make your first video with your iphone that talks about your commitment to make another video on your youtube channel and literally talks about your plan of how you're gonna make the video what you're gonna make it about what camera you're gonna use what time you're gonna shoot it literally make your first video on you planning to make your first video does that make sense so do that that is money right there all right uh frank ramos says getting the go xlr next amazing uh cesar dev87 says i publish video after one month that's super cool do you have a dev channel uh let me actually go and see if you have a deaf channel nice brother beautiful guys this looks like an amazing channel i'm gonna subscribe to it great job man great job five hours ago hey let's go guys okay so here's the tip i'll give you okay this is gonna help improve your videos first 50 seconds to 60 seconds are extremely important don't leave the screen in one area i want you to visually like look for your first 40 50 seconds you literally don't even move the screen so don't do that bro move like it's the most important so give snippet of what's gonna happen all right like literally i would start the video off like really really quick okay i'll give you an example so let me go to my slideshow right here's the mistake most people make i'll show you the mistake most people make right uh guys here's the video today we're going to talk about your opportunity to grow your youtube even if you're a complete beginner now it's important because there are many things that are important in life and um you know you you got it so let's um you know so yeah youtube is a very important thing and you want to grow your youtube channel and it's important you see like how [ __ ] boring that is because it's one screen and especially if you clicked on my video you're like [ __ ] this i don't have time for this so here's the hack you want to do visually every five seconds especially in the start i want the thing to keep moving the first second is going to start off like this in the first second i want to make it extremely relevant so i want to be like literally with the the second the video starts i would do this i'd be like guys what is up this is your opportunity to grow your youtube even if you're a complete beginner now turn off your phones now tag me here and who am i i'm rafikaze i made a hundred forty thousand four thousand dollars 21 as a freelance developer taught hundred thousand students to code became a millionaire at 25. here's my youtube channel now let's get into the training so you guys saw how in the first 10 or 20 seconds you're already hooked i've given you the lowdown we're already into the training and moving fast all right um so what i would recommend for this video is i would have a few slides all right out of a few slides that go before this that just talk about what the entire video is going to contain so here i see that you're going to talk about six skills so you can actually in the start just give some kind of preface to the six skills that you're gonna talk about and just move through those slides and then go to talk about them and i think that could be another good way to do it but in the start keep the pacing good keep it relevant and you'll do great all righty where did the facebook go this is my latest video okay dope i'd love to take a look at it on the next um when we do the next live stream i would love to take a look at it henry says i've tried to shoot a video several times but i have anxiety disorder so i can't record my face it gives me so much shame i'll try it without recording myself hope it works okay so if it's like very bad then do it but if you feel like you can work on the skill and improve it by practicing then do that too because i want you guys to improve your selfesteems as you do the video process okay i'll tell you one thing for me video was always just a way to get better at public speaking all right so yes i want to make great videos but i cared more about improving my public speaking skills so what i wanted to do was make sure that i make videos in one take i show myself then i can like actually work on myself how i come across the camera and then do that again and again and again and again and again and again and again like busta rhymes so for you i would recommend a similar thing henry but if again if you're just truly like just [ __ ] you up then okay do it with that with you not showing the face okay all right so yuri says let's go what's the software you just mentioned for music and sound effects just now um i didn't mention the software for music and sound effects but you guys can use epidemic sounds that's what i use for all my music and sounds i actually use epidemic sounds alright so basically what i'll do is i'll hit search sometimes and i'll like type in lofi music and then i'll link below okay here's a good one yeah this one is like probably really cool for like cinematic shots you know so like in my most recent vlog for example uh if i can go to it switch account i'll show you guys like i added like loafy drop that comes in at a pretty cool time here we go boom boom it's because i'm taking no it's not tulip it's a bird of paradise it's like crying hey right so you guys felt that like drop happened right there that's like low loaf lofi music here i have like sentimental music playing uh it hurts but it's gonna help you so if you feel like you're at that moment let this video right um and then here i have like fun music playing where it's like then here i have like a meme song playing which is like kind of funny my favorite if you ride with me you can slide all right all right i'll get out of here man this is kind of cool like you guys would you guys be cool with just us getting on these lives and just watching youtube videos let's go frankie's feeling it in the back oh man a [ __ ] this is the best group on the planet man uh wow people are like loving it olivia love it century city mall is awesome um it's almost like my phone but i'm using the the sony zv1 and what i love about it is you don't even need a mic on top of it it's pretty good without it the song at the end was fire yeah so um i really enjoy music and i really enjoy playing with music and a new thing i'm picking up is sound design a lot and i'm having so much fun with it so that's like another cool thing i would love to have your feedback kazzy on my coding channel code like crazy okay so let's go take a look at this channel uh 524 subscribers nice good job that's actually like are you sure no i mentioned it this is no this is not owen student the onus owen student is different oh by the way can you contact ibrahim right now and say hey can you put us in touch with the student who want to do the javascript thing just just send them that to send them there was a student that wanted to work with qazi to do programming content because he's local to la and he can actually come in and make programming content and i would love to have him on our clever programmer channel that would be [ __ ] sick all right so what's going on here all right so let's take a look now let me sort what i like to do is i just start off by sorting with the most popular videos and seeing like what's your most popular content because that's what you should be making a lot of so have you made more videos like this one um okay i would be careful about cute titles react to folio like i would avoid them unless the videos are just god level which most of the times you know like they might not be so i would try to avoid uh cute titles like that i would keep it like yeah just react portfolio you can say that thumbnails i would work on the thumbnails i think there's too much happening in the thumbnails so like here's what i would recommend right go on youtube and just type in react portfolio and see what kind of stuff comes up so let's type this in this guys did well so i would copy this thumbnail all right i would stick very close to this thumbnail uh here's another there are a few other thumbnails that worked well i would stick also maybe with that one this one worked well create react app portfolio website so here's another one that worked well uh this one worked i mean this is a hard one to make but you know that one so i would try to make ones that are there out there what i see with yours is it's uh there's it's too much it's there's it's really noisy you like it's a lot like season episode one [ __ ] on attacks text more text logos it's too much so simplify it and it'll do better so if i show you on if i go to clever programmer and we click here and we go to videos let me sort by the most popular so you'll see like the ones that are more simplified they do really well like here's an example of like a really simple one that one did really really well here's another one that i really like here's one that's pretty simple so i would do more like ones that are simple clean and those perform well uh on what i would recommend is you just having a picture from the side of you coding on a computer or like actually the portfolio is open so like you're sitting like this and you're right and the camera shot is from the side and like literally just a shot of you coding looking at the computer and the portfolio is open i think that would do the best and then just like white text in the middle that says like react portfolio make it [ __ ] clean and it'll bang and just of course make the video good uh beautiful so guys what i want to tell you is uh we're gonna keep going but tomorrow is gonna be day two of the challenge all right day two of the challenge we're gonna go to five days so i'm gonna i want you to make sure that you guys show up for day two of the challenge okay today we talked mainly about the opportunity and we're gonna keep going for today but mainly we talked about the opportunity that exists to actually have uh your own channel so let's actually get into a few different things all right um let me see all right so we got some great slides and i'm gonna go through some of these with you guys right now right so what are three things for you that are more important to you guys than money all right so write those down below what are three things for you guys that are actually more important to you than money i think that's going to be something important and what can making money as a youtuber actually help you achieve in your life so what is your goal with all this youtube stuff that you guys are doing let me know is it financial freedom is it you want to support your family is it you want to have more time to spend with your loved ones like what is it um i'll tell you for me for me i have a very weird goal of working with a team of a thousand people doing really hard [ __ ] every day and like working 50 to 60 hours a week that's my goal it's a really weird goal but that's just like i've come to terms with it and it drives me and i love it and uh that's me maybe for you just want to sit on a beach forever you know that's cool too so pick what it what it is for you you know for me it does give me the financial freedom now i i personally support my parents i'm able to support my parents now and help them i am able to support even if like my friends needed it so that feels great i'm able to support my girlfriend um and uh you know she can just focus on what she truly loves and stops doing the jobs she hates i love that so i'm gonna go and take a look at what you guys are saying all right so justin says justin says financial freedom support my family make popular games with game mechanics and subtly teach selfhelp concepts and and positively influence people who play them nice carl says time family legacy jose my goal is able to support my family doing what i love getting more clients uh freedom more time my family and a healthier lifestyle julio says i want others to learn and embrace what i know in lifestyle business and doing what you do best beautiful more time for trying new

money basically financial freedom to keep my family together so i can stay with my threeyearold son and keep my wife happy wow that's i love that okay a new identity from something i love doing is my goal motivate others and show what's possible living life on my own terms making a difference in the lives of others financial time place freedom okay level up youtube revenue stream getting giant clients is a long sales cycle yes yes yes yes it does have a longer sales cycle and let me actually see if this has happened yet um i'll be pretty excited if it did um okay cool anyways i'll tell you guys about it later so these are amazing goals guys trying new things awesome we all have different goals for it i really love creating and telling video stories i love like oh man i love making videos and i love putting them out and i love when the beat drops at the right time and the music and the story and the journey and the humor and like i love when i share it with people and how they feel when they watch it and i love like i can ensure that experience with hundreds and thousands and millions of people and make them experience that same emotion and and of course i love building a business out of it and then being able to get more team members and like growing bigger businesses so that to me is just so freaking exciting and then just like reinvest it all back reinvest every single dollar back every dollar like to this day i just don't save i just like reinvested all back into building it um which is you know which is just awesome for me amazing goals so guys love this now here is another thing right i want to go through this and if these slides are any good we'll talk about them if they're not i'm gonna throw them away all right so why youtube second most visited website after google right so obviously we know it's like really really popular the massive youtube ecosystem and uh it keeps growing and getting better okay you can produce on whatever you're passionate about so there are different types of channels right here's my girlfriend she's starting a channel on working out so she talks about working out she talks about fitness she's gonna start talking about boxing on there and uh here's an example right and if she keeps producing at this level and she keeps going she's gonna like break through but the magic formula that i say that i'm gonna go more into later for day two of the challenge that's how to get your first 1000 subscribers one of the magic formulas that i'm going to give tomorrow is 70 videos okay don't complain until 70 videos and 10 months whichever comes first okay so know that you're gonna [ __ ] eat [ __ ] and this is more channeling gary vee it's not gonna work it's not meant like why do we think that like i never understand why we just have this weird expectation i don't know if it's like our parents just [ __ ] us up as a generation or what is it that like we just need to win right this second how like why do you expect you're just gonna jump into the ring with mike tyson and now you're going to knock him out you've never [ __ ] boxed it's not going to happen so people do that with business right right people people do that [ __ ] with business they're like i'm just going to go into it i'm just going to knock it out of the park and if i don't i'm a failure i suck i should just quit what is wrong with you like you're sup who gave you the audacity to think you're gonna win in the first place i'll tell you a little bit of my background right from ages of 9 to 12 i went to this religious school where i was beaten the [ __ ] out of every day i was a nineyearold kid it would start at 8 a.m to school and it would go all the way up until 10 p.m for 14 to 15 hours a day okay i would have my hands freezing in the chicago winter negative 10 degrees come downstairs and the teacher would take take the plunger take the plunger part out of it take that thick wooden stick and smash my hands uh he would lift up our like jeans so our shins were showing they would like smash us on our shins if we went home and we're like oh we got bruises or you know they're beating us up then they would beat us up even more it was like crazy right four years of this and so i went through all this crazy [ __ ] it sucked it was like hell every day most people who went there got [ __ ] up kind of permanently for me i got [ __ ] up in a really good way i learned gratitude i learned humility i learned happiness out of it those were the lessons i learned out of it because every single day i woke up and i didn't get beat up every single day i wake up and it's 9 a.m and i get out of bed and i haven't gotten the living [ __ ] beat out of me oh my god is that a win like whoa this is another day let's go guys how are you doing like yo what's up frankie how you doing amberley baby what's going on so for me every day i wake up feels like i have won like the biggest lottery so then when i get one view i am like ecstatic the first time i got two subscribers i ran around my entire house in my underwear just running around screaming at the top of my lungs my parents were like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you but they were even like happy and they were like yeah let's go my friends at the same time who also started a youtube channel i'm not going to name any names they quit why they always just had an expectation that they were meant to blow up that they were meant to get millions of views they had really high standard of excellence their parents [ __ ] them up by just setting expectations and standards like trillion times higher so every day when they got 50 views do you think they saw it as a win or a loss then the next day when they would drop a video and they get 150 views do you think decided winner lost when they got their first subscribe five subscribers do you think they saw that as a win or a loss everything was just lost lose lose losing streak everything and it just got worse and worse so even when they were hitting days where they're getting 100 subscribers in their minds they were meant to be getting 5000 subscribers a day so the reality and their expectation was totally out of alignment which led to unhappiness just depression anxiety complete mental breakdown and they would just quit i've seen this happen it sucks it [ __ ] sucks and so if there's one thing i can push it's just mindset going there you're meant to [ __ ] lose lose every [ __ ] day you're not meant to get views you're just starting you can't go in and beat mike tyson my guy you can't like you need to work no you're gonna lose expect to lose the days you win is a huge win the days you break even and you get one view or five views is a huge win those types of expectations and how like here's what people do this is their life right they they make the rules of their life that they're going to be happy half a percent of the time and they're going to be unhappy 99.9 percent of the time so i'll give you an example one of my friends wanted to start a business and he's like i'm going gonna open up a business this month i said okay that's so cool bro i love it i'm like what are your goals for it he goes minimum that business needs to make twenty thousand dollars i said okay i didn't say much to him but first of all do you know how hard it is to open a [ __ ] business just in the first place just opening a business then second do you know how hard it [ __ ] is to actually make money from your business it's ridiculously hard and twenty thousand first it's like an it's uh unless you're a pro at doing business it's it's like a almost impossible task it's a ridiculously difficult task to be able to hit that role what do you think he's done when he has set up the rules for his happiness what do you think he's done to his happiness what percentage has he left to being truly happy right it's like in almost invisible right it's like the tiniest percentage of being happy and there's 99 or room for him to be unhappy so for example let's say on day 10 of his business he made a first hundred dollars which he should have been celebrating like crazy what do you think he was doing sad depressed feeling defeated feeling like underachiever feeling like he could never be good enough do you think that that's gonna inspire him to work harder now to go towards the 20 000 goal that he had set so expectations my friend are everything mindset is every goddamn thing when it comes to all of it youtube what like you want to grow your tick tock you want to grow your business whatever it is expectations have to be in reality expect to just [ __ ] suck go through the sunk and then you will eventually win just be aware of that when you're a new coder or a new developer most of the times your code is throwing errors when you are new to doing video production most of the times your battery is running out and you didn't even know you [ __ ] forgot to hit the record button expect to lose everything that's not a loss is a gift please see it like that please see it like that everything that's not a loss is a gift is a [ __ ] gift all right so please expectations mindset i can't emphasize that enough that's everything um okay let me see what what's going on here celebrate small wins yes half practical goals that's what made you what you're what you are today there's so much and learn we're all in this together beautiful comfort is the enemy of success our generation is too comfortable uh how long should each video qazi needs a hug that story is rough uh yeah man i love hugs bro carl so great question he says how long should let me see this how long should each uh each video be i say as long as it needs to be okay so if you want to say something that's longer go for it say it in a longer format all right howell ferreira says my fears to leave my job to focus fully on youtube videos with bills to pay it's hard to take that step can you give any tips on this don't leave your job make [ __ ] youtube videos i don't i don't know why people think they just need to leave their jobs right this second to make their content um you can make your content while you're while you're at your job and i think that's a very practical way to do it right i grew my entire channel in a one hour window every day so uh you can do that okay so make your video on your lunch break that's brilliant what frankie just said literally make it on your lunch break make it when you get home you need more no more than 30 minutes put the camera on your face put your phone on your face and just say your truth say something that is truly happening in your life uh and you will have a video my friend uh is there any sort of engagement algorithm on youtube the way there is with instagram melanie great question honestly the best algorithm the number one most important algorithm on youtube is watch time all right so the only thing i want you to focus on is title thumbnail and the video if you just focus on that you will win you don't need to go to other peop 50 other youtube pages and leave comments there you can do that but i don't recommend it i don't like it i don't do it so i'll recommend you guys what i like i like making good [ __ ] content i like focusing on title and thumbnail and then i just like letting the universe go from there and 99.99 of the times it works um so how to get content ideas and keyword research for them i keep it very very simple i here's my research process okay you guys want to see my research process i'll show you guys so let's say i want to make a video on um give me a topic sure so let's say i want to make a video on like how to make money online right i will literally type how to make money online and i'll hit enter and then i'll just go through this okay so how to make 150 a day earn 500 best way to make money online as a beginner 21 hours ago how to make money online in 2020 the three best side hustles all right cool so now i've got my ideas uh well another thing i want to look at is are these videos recent and they're gaining viewership then that's a great sign so this is a recent video not that one um this one right 21 hours ago got 10 000 views best way to make money online is a bro as a broke beginner okay so i might keep it pretty similar to this title and i might just go with that so that's honestly that's all the research i do right when even when i'm doing like best when i want to make a video best programming languages click it and just see all right top programming language of 2020 the best programming language to learn in 2020 top five programming language okay and i'll pick one style and then i'll just go from there that's as fancy as my research ever gets you can get fancier than this but like i don't i mean i never needed to but and i don't really think you really need to um all right uh eric hodges how do you handle the feeling of being defeated i think i answered that question i went pretty deep into that is by defeating is by making that your default expecting defeat all the time but working like you're 50 points down and just working your ass off then everything is upside uh here's the hack for that so right if if i have my expectations set to like um you know i don't know like let's say that there's a you know you guys saw my youtube growth it looks like nothing is happening nothing is happening nothing is happening and then like [ __ ] boom if i have my expectations set to here then what happens day one when i'm here does it feel like a win or a loss it's a loss i'll put an l what happens day two when i'm here does it feel like a win or a loss feels like a loss what happens day three does it feel like a winner or a loss it's a loss loss loss so do you think i'm gonna make it to this part no i'm gonna quit on probably day seven because every day was a loss now i'll tell you how it [ __ ] works in my head and i'm almost not kidding i'm kind of like psychotic with this [ __ ] um make the best possible video i can on day one expect here's my expectation expect negative views it's [ __ ] crazy i know it doesn't even sound like a real thing literally accept like negative because if i suck i should really get negative views or something okay expect negative views and like 20 down votes that's my expectation negative let's just say negative 20 down votes that's my expectation right so this right here is my expectation so what happens on day one when i get zero views and let me drop a video day one is it a win or a loss so when what happens day two is this a winner or a loss i got one view let's say this day so [ __ ] massive one you kidding me i didn't get 20 down votes didn't make fun of me for my you know like everything that they used to make fun of me for my teeth and my [ __ ] accent that i had and um what happens day three it's a win what happens when i get two subscribers today when when when do you think i'm gonna make it to day whatever day a day um you know three months in day 100 do you think i'm gonna make it to day hundred you better [ __ ] believe i'm making it to day hundred because i'm winning baby i'm on a [ __ ] winning streak why would i quit you never quit a winning streak you want to keep going so um that's uh that's some ninja [ __ ] you know there's some brain that's some like brain black belt [ __ ] nice teddy says teddy hernandez says i did it i created my channel today i will upload the first video beautiful that gets me so excited you must commit to it first yes creating content each day is a win yes exactly yes people often think i'm not ambitious because i set low goals get the [ __ ] out of here i don't set low goals i set low expectations i set no or negative expectations and then i work like i'm playing to make a billion dollars this year so then i just win every day i'm low not everybody left the company today yes we're winning you know so that's why it becomes easier um let me go we got more questions so i'm gonna keep going through the questions beautiful we still have 75 people on damn wow that's really cool of you guys how many we got on youtube thank you guys i love the huh nice okay all right so every day i say i want to make a video if something is holding me back today bro let these voices be here for you and just go and do it like nike okay um okay can you point me to a nice mic i have a very sharp voice and i need something to smooth it use a yeti you can use a yeti mic and you'll be good just yeti mic it's between 70 to 100 bucks and yeti mic will be really good i forgot to mention you guys should get uh invest in a mic it's really helpful to invest in a mic all right how to get a partner like nas i made content for four years and nas then thought hey this is a cool guy he hit me up and we became partners so uh create content and you can find all types of people my girlfriend is my girlfriend um because i created content and she found my content and became my girlfriend like it's kind of crazy like everybody in my life that's like connected to me right now it's because i was like making videos and just saw it and then we got connected right like frankie who's here like almost everybody that's here connected to me through because they've seen my videos um when talking to the camera at the beginning of our journey do you recommend scripting free flowing or guidelining with keywords so i love guidelining with keywords meaning like having just some bullet points so for example if i'm about to make a video and let's say julio that you're about to make a video um oh [ __ ] what did i do uh okay so if you're about to make a video i would literally i would just be like oh wait this is gonna vanish all right there we go all right so you can you can just say uh you know last night dinner story so now this is one story that you could mention uh you could have hook which is in the first 30 secs 30 seconds whatever you're gonna say uh up to you you're gonna have you know then call to action at the end subscribe to the channel whatever so like this can be an example just like two or three bullet points that guide you i feel like for me that's the best way to do it i don't like scripting out every word i like so between you can go between free flowing and guidelining if guidelining helps you do it i'm just telling you this because in the start of my video sometimes i would guideline my videos where i'm just talking about those trainings and tutorials that just free flowed so both work really well i rarely ever do complete scripting i rarely ever do that but i've seen people do that and it works really well when it works what would you say was one of your best moments when you starting your business slash youtube channel the day that i got two subscribers the day that i got a hundred thousand subscribers the day that we cleared our first one million dollars um yeah i think those were like some of the greatest moments and like we were screaming and yelling and just laughing and uh those were some of the great moments other great moments were like going to a pretty awesome airbnb with the team and being in the hot tub outdoors talking about the vision of the business from like 12 a.m to 7 00 am it was freezing [ __ ] cold in the winter that was another amazing like there are just a lot of amazing moments and memories that we created along the way quality over quantity what are your thoughts most of the times the [ __ ] that you're gonna make is gonna suck so the way to get better at quality is through quantity and so the secret that i say i use the word quality that's what you gotta do so produce more it'll help you get better a lot faster what is better working out seven days a week or one day a week seven days a week what is what will make you a better martial artist we're uh doing martial arts for seven days a week or one day a week what will make you a better dancer dancing seven days a week or one day a week right like brian you're a dancer if i wanted to learn dance i'm going to be like quality over quantity like what do you think like i'm thinking i dance half a day out of a month but like really plan it out you know what i'm saying like plan it out like map it out like really think about it watch videos because let's be honest i got to be you know how i do with quality so you better believe that it's gonna be a quality dance i've never danced before but it's gonna be quality and you [ __ ] know it so let me think about it right i'm gonna map it out i'm gonna plan it out and spend a few weeks and then i'll dance for half an hour and then because quality that's the essential thing that happens here for people they just think that they'll magically create quality content if they just procrastinate for like ungodly amounts of time in between so the secret is remove that time produce on almost a daily basis you through the sheer quantity you will develop quality and stop asking questions over and over again it's the fastest way to get blocked um delete comment and remove author delete everything okay peace so keep it clean guys otherwise you're not gonna be a part of this community thank you um all right so olivia says yes you don't want to be robotic be yourself or it's going to get tiring and you'll lose interest i mean you can script pretty natural language type of stuff too but it's just it's tricky all right when i shoot hundred days of code like a log should i post on youtube daily or weekly um yeah you can shoot either or honestly you'll be fine brian says good point i love it we have to celebrate our winning yup 40 to 80 videos up would love to get your feedback on my channel arp on codes but not getting many views nice okay cool all right let's go i would work a little bit more on the thumbnails just a little bit so let's think about this there's a lot going on in your thumbnail so try to avoid this this is a common mistake people make get a okay hold on get a free tshirt hacktoberfest two easy pull requests what the [ __ ] is going on like there's a lot going on in here so it's just like tomb all about open source contribution and like there's like 10 different thoughts happening here so it's really hard this is way better of a thumbnail it's just very clean and like this is what's happening okay i'm gonna go to this video hey guys so welcome to the second episode of getting started with where we take new technologies in every video and try to you know get started with it so in this video we'll be looking at a reactbased framework next js okay so it's built upon react okay so a few things get started so i am at the that was cool how you did that the and it cut nice i think that because your camera quality is a little like i mean you literally are shooting with your phone or something because i can see all this so it looks a little funny i think that your intro is kind of it's to the point but what i would do is literally like one second in and i would switch to the screen until you get a really good camera and audio like one second and i'll switch to this the official website of framework next now it should have two right if it didn't work make sure you restart the development server when you add so energy needs to be up dude you're like losing me because you're getting tired so you won't be able okay yeah like you haven't prepared properly for this and you're like going through it and so like you're losing me because you're you're doing this so this is uh this is really a lot about energy okay so for example right now into the we are like two hours in right but you guys see and hear and feel my energy drop in the comments below if you do so why is this energy happening you have to work on it and you have to [ __ ] pull the entire way if you're gonna be making long streams all right so this is two hours and 20 minutes long we've made really long streams on clever programmers so if i go um all videos like you'll see that we have like long streams but you see even from clever pro messages like you guys are doing right so make sure how about we do a challenge and we can just so keep your energy high throughout the video so that's one big tip i will recommend to you because your watch time is gonna drop and youtube is gonna stop recommending this video because i'm losing you're like let's check out this page so like and also on your own prep you haven't prepped for this before that's why you're not moving through it's [ __ ] fast and confidently should be like guys we're on next.js like literally if you are talking about next.js like guys we're going to learn about next.js and here's the few main important tell you one image optimization two internalization three nextgs analytics so let's click into analytics now you got a score of 95 here and move through it fast and prep for it beforehand until you have a lot of practice to be able to just completely do it live so the one big tip i would give is like a lot about energy and keeping really high energy or edit the [ __ ] out of the video those are your two ways to do it i like to just work on my energy because then it saves me a lot of time so i can be lazy on the editing all right so i would have way higher energy because i think the content you're sharing is good i just think that like because of under preparation and lack of energy one you're wasting my time two you are not keeping me entertained you gotta be a [ __ ] entertainer so you gotta entertain me through the way and you gotta use your energy to push through if you don't have energy then edit the [ __ ] out of your videos and you will blow up i'll give you an example fireship has a great channel on coding he has no energy he speaks like the most monotonous speaking i've ever seen on the planet but he [ __ ] keeps his video tight so like it has 81 000 views so if you click on it user authentication there are two main ways to get the job done sessions and tokens the traditional approach on the web is cookie based server side sessions the process begins with a user filling out their username and password and then submitting it to a server which then validates it creates a session in the database then responds with a session id the session id will be saved in the browser's cookie jar which is a place in the browser to say see what i'm saying so like here it's blowing up his face is not even in here but he's edited it really well he worked on a script and he edited it really well and then he got a video that just banged and it's crushing so that's what i would say um and then of course like work on some titles that are like truly really popular because there's only about a few videos that really make your channel blow up so work on those all right cool um eric thread says i also hear you're swearing a lot i don't think that is too good i know some people are more picky about stuff like that yes but those aren't my people so that's another thing i want to share with you guys that not everyone is your people so don't try to just fit and mold yourself into that if that is not for you then that is not for you but on my channel where i'm gonna be talking for [ __ ] years not gonna be talking like how i don't actually talk in real life that's the number one way to make my life hard and miserable and make me not want to produce content right because i'm like oh [ __ ] can't cur like literally i'll be like oh [ __ ] i said [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] up so like it doesn't matter guys what's important is how's your intent if my intent is i'm demeaning to somebody or i'm demoralizing somebody that's the real problem that's the culprit but if that's your way of speaking that's how you speak and you talk and you're just passionate that's okay right it's just where is your intention coming from christian said yokazi would love you give me some feedback okay dope fine line games topnotch programmer thanks a lot raf rafi we'll be back with more energy scripting can help with the scripting and editing can make it really tight and dialed in all right it can make it like really like a video really really tight if you can script it um if you guys don't have naturally amazing energy follow people like farmership and follow people like uh parker walbeck on youtube he's also very very low energy but he just has everything really tight and scripted and so it just goes really well uh any tips for dealing with the feeling of credibility have to talk about this that's just internal fears man and there's really not much i can say to change that for you i started my youtube channel when i was a complete beginner in coding and i actually didn't know that much about coding and i just started sharing every day i learned something i just shared it so every day you share something you look you learn something you share it you're winning uh all right cool so i'm loving that you guys are about to post your videos let's go and take a look at this one as well nice so these are like really popular titles i like it two years ago okay what
