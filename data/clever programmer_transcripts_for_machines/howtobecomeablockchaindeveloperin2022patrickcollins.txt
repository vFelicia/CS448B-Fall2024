let's talk about the money dude if ethereum developer solidity developer they're coding for half a year one year how much money are they making high end is is nuts dude like 150 170 but dude dude i've seen i've seen [ __ ] for like 500 plus tokens would it do what it does but you being where you was but it ain't what it is facing the merger i really be hating in the mud said i can't pick it up but i did y'all know what's up guys how's it going this is qazi today we got the man in the house the man the myth the legend uh the solidity god oh solidity god that's my title i'm with it what's up quasi how are you man i'm here how are we doing let's go so i'm super excited to have patrick on today patrick if you don't know he just how i found him is he dropped this tutorial on youtube it hit 2 million views on free code camp yes sir and he's also a content creator he's a beast a super grounded guy as well and just really fun to talk to and uh today i pretty much want to talk with patrick about um web 3 crypto defy and um probably everything in between so patrick welcome on board brother hey kazia great to be here and and like we were chatting a little bit before we started filming but yeah your channel is fantastic i was telling them when we started filming i was like yo like when you go live you keep the energy up like that's what i'm about i'm about and yeah we uh we we had a what a zoom call maybe during like eat denver or something and it was so funny because uh there's there's a lot of people that i talked to very very serious very but like we just started ripping right away which was uh which was cool like yo what the [ __ ] okay how's it going yeah yeah you know we'll be [ __ ] crazy yeah we'll be crazy because even when i look at your channel it's fun to look at and most computers keep [ __ ] so boring um i mean not content creators let me not say content creators because they're going to come and shoot me yeah yeah but i think with a lot of developers i meet in the ecosystem they want to be like really professional and really serious yeah and um and i don't know like i'm just i'm very i'm very anticorporate you know we're we're like the peter mckinnons of the coding world i feel like dude i have i have empirical evidence that this style of education this style of like edutainment almost is is better so when i was first making videos i got a ton of people dming me i'm saying yo dude you need to like stop all that silly [ __ ] like just just just just get on the screen like code and like shut the hell up and i was like i was like i know for a fact like when i'm learning i'm like if that [ __ ] is like i'm falling asleep if that's just if that's how it is so so what i ended up doing is i i released two videos back to back exact same content it was about like um asynchronous programming in python um didn't it blast them out didn't do anything the one one of them i'm like crazy zany like over the top and the other one i'm like shut the [ __ ] up like all right here this is 20 times 20 times the views on the more animated one it's a factor of 20. it's 20 times more impactful to like do the style of content that you do um and that's the empirical level so yeah dude same page the higher and it's more fun yeah i mean i agree it's like p people want to be entertained right why are they on youtube like they can just be reading like an encyclopedia book on the technology you know like right they're they're here because most people want to be entertained like joe attack who's one of the creators i really i really love um he's doing some really unique [ __ ] now and i actually bought two of his uh oh the nfts that he dropped yeah yeah yeah this is not a condoning of buying that [ __ ] not financial advice yeah yeah yeah yeah go ahead i was gonna say jomatech is uh he's he's super entertaining right superintendent he's a little bit different than what like you and i do like you're like more like yo here's how you code this stuff with that higher energy he's he's a lot more or he's a lot more like entertaining stuff although i think he has done he's done a lot in the past he has okay he was selling like his own courses around algorithms um and now he launches nft and uh his main purpose banned at nft so the community essentially it's like crowd funding for him so the community can fund him so he can like keep creating videos and content um but yeah i think i think that's that's what it is you know i think i think that's like a million dude in like 10 minutes dude yeah he was like yeah we sold out right away which i i mean i'm pumped for him i think that that's fantastic right like i i think his style of content is really cool and um yeah however however he can monetize that great like that's a great use case for blockchain there you go right sliding right into the blockchain conversation that too yeah yeah yeah i mean it's pretty great i mean honestly though one thing i have been thinking about is i've been watching a lot of mr beast's [ __ ] dude content yeah i every single video he drops i watch are you serious okay so let me tell you dude i'm getting so [ __ ] excited like i'm actually thinking about dude i should be talking to you outside of this podcast dude [ __ ] brainstorming we need to be sinking because because i'm on the same like any time it's so like so uh so i work at chain like labs right and we have a bunch of da's right so we make we make content um we kind of change it it's a little bit different though but any single anytime someone's like yo what should i do for a video or for like presentation i always say like this is something mr b said once he was like don't give the audience time to ask am i bored right now yeah like don't let them don't let them be bored right because if they're bored that's when they that's when they bounce off and uh and like it it's it does a disservice to them like if you're being so boring that they leave like you're not getting them like especially for what we're doing we're not able to teach them as effectively dude so like every single every single mr beast video i'm like yo this is a this is a workshop on how to like make good content and i'm always trying we're on the same page although you've done a lot better than me i'm i'm always trying to tweak my [ __ ] to be more mr beastly but uh but basically yeah man so i think like mr b stuff uh so i'll tell you this i'm like actually studying at hardcore now like i'm okay studying it so what i mean by that is like his last video was like i built um uh it was um world's most dangerous escape room uh he he dropped one two days ago you're behind the scenes with sharks i don't know i watched that one too would you say okay okay i'm like i'm like that is genius i saw a title i'm like that's [ __ ] genius um and um yeah and then even like when i ran into him um and i asked him and he like looked at my phone and he told me my thumbnails were [ __ ] and i was like i was like all right keep working on it but like yeah his so the would you swim and then the world's most dangerous escape room so i started studying like the hook lasts from zero to seven seconds dude i oh like so the the the one um the one before he did the i'm getting chased by the military or something like that his hook was nine seconds and i was like oh my god he's making you shorter i literally same dude same page holy [ __ ] yep sorry keep going that's what i'm saying like [Laughter] like this year i'm really excited about working on some really big videos that get viral like they go viral in the tech space but people don't even need to understand it so like one of the ideas that i was having and i guess i'll just brainstorm some of it with you here because i was like one of the things i thought about is like turning it into a game show um like a game show for developers so no not many people like joe attack is doing the fictional side right like he's doing the side where um he has like these fictional videos or not fiction i don't know what the term is but it's like he's making up these short films and stories right i would want to do like um so i thought of the hook and my hook was like um i built the world's hardest javascript challenge and if this developer can solve it in one hour he wins ten thousand dollars oh wait that's super sick because when you s dude when you said game show i actually like a part of me was like like game show like there's somebody like hey welcome and they're like they're super boring but that but that hook right there that was sick that got me amp that got me excited oh that's sick that's that's me so i'm thinking about doing something like that where like we can get developers like so same on the next one you know what i'm saying so like hardest blockchain challenge and if this dude we have you fly in we have the challenges set up for you right and then once you do these 10 challenges yeah you win x prize but it's like they're obstacles in the way i don't know i just thought they got to like run laptop to laptop like solving like dude because that was the other thing i was like how do you make how do you make like the coding stuff entertaining like like so so we've done we've done um we've done speed coding for like chain link hackathons right where developer shows up they they like we we give them some random tasks and then whoever finishes it first wins those are exciting for me because i'm like you know i i see like all the different solidity techniques they're using and stuff and i'm like oh nice yeah but like but somebody who's maybe a little bit newer isn't going to really know what's or i i i like to think about like uh like league of legends for example if you don't play league of legends if you try to watch a league of legends it just looks like a cluster f bro it's it's so fun to watch even though i'm not i don't really really and i'm not good at all but i watched that [ __ ] bro i was on the twitch uh thing watching it yesterday i watched all the time i love chess i play competitive chess but like but it has nothing to do with league so i like sometimes watch chess streams but league i have no idea right and i'm watching league i went on twitch started watching league and it is so entertaining they'll be like oh my god oh my god he's patrick's in the middle lane and he's about to gank him and the dragon calls over all like oh [ __ ] look it's so i get hyped and i kind of get what's happening so i feel like league of legends gets a lot of viewership but i'll tell you why i think even if people don't really know it they can still watch it because they get people get killing they're like two people right right right they get money people are getting coins yep um people get the concept of like one person outsmarting the other so when you involve commentary i think the energy of the commentary makes it exciting but if you didn't have the commentary you'd be like what the hell am i watching yeah yeah oh that's so interesting because so i i played i have played way too much league of legends so when i watched league of legends the whole time i'm like oh [ __ ] like oh my god like i don't i don't need the commentary because i like see what's going on i mean i do appreciate the commentary but that's crazy i i never thought that people like who didn't know the game because like dude i i played a a way too much league i i've quit i i only play for one week i was gonna say this i don't really play league but some people from our team play league like programmer and so like tonight i told them guys let's link up and let's play oh my god no dude i i quit dude i was uh i i was bad that's like all i would do i would like i would finish work i would play league so i i've i've been quit i've been sober for quite some time um but but one week out of the year i'll play like i'll wake up gambler when you like play league dude turn into an awful human being i don't uh in the beginning i was an awful human being i'm a lot uh i like to think i'm a pretty nice player now even when people are being toxic but naughty no like there's um i one week out of the year i play i wake up at 8 a.m i go to bed at 8 a.m the next day i sleep for 16 hours and like when i'm awake all i'm doing is playing playing league and that's like that's like a vacation for me and then my girlfriend my girlfriend like looks at me sideways and goes really like this is what you want to do and i'm like yes yes yes dude i i come from like a gaming background so i i oh really yeah like so i used to do competitive gaming ever since i was like 11 or 12 years old like even younger than that i played rts games like command and conquer general zero hour warcraft frozen throne uh what years of war i was ranked number three in the world for a whole month what what mirror's edge i was ranked number one holy [ __ ] um oh yeah i played games like all the [ __ ] time dude it was like i was playing 17 hours a day 18 hours a day when i was younger apparently sleeping my best best best summer ever was me and my best friend he would just come over all the time and we would play borderlands just grind berlin really yeah so you're kind of like the same thing that i did except for you're doing a lot better you took all that that energy that like oh yo i'm gonna play until like i can't like keep my eyes open anymore and then just put it into like youtube and coding and all that stuff that's yeah that's what i did coding became like the thing coding like literally felt like it was a video game and then people paid me and i was like this is [ __ ] stupid like don't be painful dude i feel that that's how that's how it feels my brother just started coding he's like uh he has like an exercise science background and he just started coding he was like yo this is like lowkey kind of fun and i was like that's what i'm saying just like getting over that like hump to like figure it out and then you have like all this creativity and you do all this crazy crazy [ __ ] and then you can do yeah weird tutorials like what like i'm gonna create uber on the blockchain or or whatever your last video was yeah dude like agreed same page same exact page yeah now we're now we're definitely doing now where it's like okay let's start building crazy [ __ ] that people like yeah um but but definitely the side that i want to explore so i'm like kind of giving myself a goal and this is a crazy goal like there's probably three percent chance of me succeeding in it but the goal is so it took us five years to get to one million subs but this year my goal is to get to 2 million subs you're uh you're preaching that goal out in public huh yeah okay only nine months left um so there's not much time left and so basically i have to be hitting like 100 000 subs per month or more you're at 1.1 right now though oh and you started doing more shorts too yeah i did mix it in i'm with it a little i did the garyvee one people liked it oh [ __ ] you got garyvee in here too i got no no fake i i i did a garyvee pair oh oh yeah tick tock yeah yeah i was like my apple is slow as [ __ ] i want my users to be patient oh man oh i love garyvee oh that's too funny like people i got tons of positive feedback on that so like i'm like trying to so what i'm trying to do is uh i'm gonna start doing lots of shorts and reels just because it it's very quick to produce something yeah yeah yeah i'm getting lots of positive feedback then i think i'm gonna turn it into longer form that's like imagine a youtube just like if gary v uh tried coding for one day and it's just a parody you know right but like then the question that becomes does that style does that if you like using the shorter ones it's like a signal it's like an indicator right maybe that style of content only works for the shorts yeah it's possible but like there's a captain sinbad who did like uh watches grant cardone once or watches garyvee once and then he like turns into grant cardone or whatever and that's like almost 2 million views yeah joe attacks because like what i realize is stuff with parodies and things that are funny or interesting really entertaining people watch it and so it has high watch time and then youtube just keeps recommending the [ __ ] out of it like crazy you know like mr b says shoot for on your okay let me ask you this on your youtube do you know what's your average retention like average percentage watched on like some of your recent videos uh i haven't been uh i'm i haven't been grinding the youtube stats that's nearly as much as you all have yeah i have no idea no idea i'll tell you with tutorials and [ __ ] it's like 10 or lower is what i've realized um it's pretty low uh my long tutorials are one percent two percent um and some of my best my best videos like with two million views are 35 percent watched yeah like top five programming languages to learn in 2021 or whatever or 2020 that got like 2 million views 38 watched uh mr beast he's like uh he his he says he tries to never drop anything that will hit below 70 retention what and we're we're hitting like between i'm probably hitting between one and ten you're hitting between 10 and 35. it's [ __ ] crazy dude that's that's that sounds like mr beast so the hard thing that i i have like trying to figure out though is because most of the stuff that i'm trying to do i'm trying to like okay and then maybe this yeah like because because my my whole thing like everything that i'm like doing in my life right now is like all right how do i get how do i figure out how to like share this amazing technology and like get coders as excited as me uh and like and like teach it right because there's so like few good really solid like people who like really understand solidity really understand smart contracts and so i'm like i'm like always feeling like okay i gotta like i gotta i gotta show them how to do this new code thing but like maybe the strat is what you're saying like mix in more like which i have been um but it's like it's not my focus as much i don't know what are your thoughts there i i'm torn i'm i'm in i've been torn for the last half a decade five years i've been doing this and i've been like do i go more entertainment and like mass and viral do i focus more on like niching down and staying focused on this and i'm like if i don't teach this then who am i like weird [ __ ] like that but then i was like thinking about it and i'm like it's like a youtube existential crisis almost yeah yeah yeah who am i yeah who am i [Laughter] i'm nobody i thought about it i'm like okay yeah that's true that if i don't do this you know it changes kind of my niche and it can be scary for the youtube algorithm things like that but then i thought about like what's my goal my goal is to get as many people into the world of coding as possible like whether it's web 3 or web 2 i don't care like as long as people can get into coding and so i feel like if if i have videos that get massive like millions of viewers entered that's like yeah thinking like you're okay let me tell it to you like this when you were young and you had you had that like cool [ __ ] professor just because a professor was cool and you [ __ ] with a professor you wanted to become what whatever he or she did yeah you make a good point yeah um rappers move entire industries and like create new genres just because like they are like what they're dropping lots of people [ __ ] with it and then they want to like be what they are or follow their path or their journey and so i'm like if i go mass appeal people will still come and watch my tutorials i think that makes a lot of sense bro i need more time in the day [ __ ] me um plus it's just interesting like creatively challenging like it's uh more than yeah yeah yeah above anything it's just like when i look at your content and you're doing you're pushing yourself creatively more than anything for me it's just like a really interesting creative challenge that's a really interesting way to look at it like how do i oh that's really interesting right could the how do i how do i get people excited about this thing um while also making sure to deliver like the impactful content and then how creative can i be to hit both of those goals yeah um yeah dude no that makes a lot of sense yeah so yeah i mean those were just a couple of things that i thought about um but yeah other than that i think overall our focus is how you know let's let's teach people about blockchain let's teach people about yeah um crypto more let's teach people about web three more so that's what we've been focusing on now which is which is phenomenal right the more people who can understand this technology the better um we are like people keep saying like we're early but like the thing is i feel like they don't really realize like how early we are like like because if you if you think about it like they're still like what what is the market cap of like hedge funds like several 100 trillion dollars right like or or something like that we could probably google it it's like it's some insane number right encrypt all of crypto combined is like what like 2 trillion or something like that like we're this tiny fragment of like like this whole old centralized way of doing things and we there's just like so so so like any and what i'm trying to say is see what you're saying thank you for your blockchain work and uh excited to keep bringing people in because yeah like we have this this um this issue of like okay like do we trust all these institutions that have like just continued to [ __ ] people in the past yeah i mean we can but we have a technology that makes it so we don't have to so why don't we just use that like one of the things that i thought about and and tell me kind of where your thoughts are on this but i think i spoke about this a little bit over the phone but we can go more on this so like one of the times you know people there are a lot of hot buzzwords in the blockchain we're like decentralized and a bunch of other things which if you don't really know what it means it just sounds like buzzwords but kind of one of the times it hit me is um when i saw kind of what was happening in russia recently where the ruble was dropping like crazy and these people were going and they're like yo the ruble values dropping like crazy we need to go and exchange this for something else and when they went to exchange it like they had just blocked off the exchanges basically just told them like no you can't exchange it and so basically i kind of realized like oh [ __ ] that's the dangerous part about having centralized exchanges and centralized control whereas if they had their money in crypto like let's just say it was like crypto rubles you know the usdc equivalent of rubles um they could just like liquidate and go into any other token or any other thing and do that instantly and nobody could stop them in the world yeah it's it's like one of these just crazy superpowers that crypto gives us right it's this thing where it says hey like there are people who want to screw you over and um it's it's it's so tricky because right like the winners write history right so like who is right is usually by you know but there's a good chance that you know there have the the people who should have won were on the losing side and they got screwed over and uh technology like this would have would have saved that so but yeah no you're spot on man like uh decentralized exchanges i feel like are one of these things that like we've solved and it's it's crazy to me like that um that well it's not craziness there's this learning gap that we need to get over but it's crazy to me that we're not all like holy [ __ ] how do we get this like faster and i know there's a ton of people excited about it and i know there's a ton of incumbents who are less excited about it but um yeah now we're now we're like you you're going to get me ranting here quasi if you don't cut me off it's perfect it's it's great i i do i think ranting on this is great because it's something important for people to hear right so like for example um something else that i've been super excited about is recently i started working with like web 3 companies and they have been paying in like crypto and uh and it's like three minutes or two minutes and you you get paid and i'm like what is this this is so weird this is so crazy and so it kind of hit me i'm like it's like now the money is not this like traditional ancient bank money where like your money's sleeping on a saturday and a sunday like what the [ __ ] like how does that make any sense first of all like if money is the most important thing just have somebody on the saturday and sunday shift so they're running the money stuff like i don't get it right but then like with crypto you could send it 24 7. you get everybody gets within a couple of minutes which is huge um some examples even some of my own team members are like when they get paid because if sometimes if it takes five days or seven days for them to get paid they have to they pay their they end up paying their rent late which means they start getting all these fees but if my team was getting paid in crypto they would get their money right away right and there's no stopping it but one fear i will tell you is love it was [ __ ] weird for me to get paid encrypted dude i was like scared i was like they're gonna be just paying me in this like metamask wallet that i have and it's like it's just a it's a chrome [ __ ] extension that i'm depending my whole life on you know what i mean and i'm like yeah it's so shaky and flaky and it could just die what if i forget the mnemonic password like how would i log into my phone to get this money um you know and then i had to learn about noncustodial wallets and they're like it's if it's a noncustodial wallet no wait wait wait let me let me jump in there like [ __ ] that like take that term out of your dictionary okay that is that is some marketing [ __ ] to like say like oh like noncustodial wallets are like worse or like no there's there's it's not noncustodial wallets it's just your [ __ ] wallets you got the private key it's your it's your token right like because what are they saying like custodial wallets are like [ __ ] that's kyc'd [ __ ] that like that is some marketing [ __ ] uh don't let don't don't uh this this is my like this is me speaking from within now don't [ __ ] say that [ __ ] anymore not custodial wallets that it's it's like the the reason the reason that the reason i think that that terminology came about was there was this huge push you know from governments they wanted kyc all that [ __ ] so they started saying like noncustodial wallets as if like that's the worst one is if custodial is like the norm so which is which is a bunch of [ __ ] totally antithesis of what blockchain is yeah um but yeah and and then there's stuff like that happen so this is the perfect there's stuff like that happening where it's like oh like i gotta learn about noncustodial versus custodial like [ __ ] that [ __ ] like but but agree there's there's a lot of like user experience stuff that needs to improve right like the fact that you're like if i forget my private key i'm screwed yeah i do think there are a lot of people where like a service like some type of managed service even though again that's the antithesis of blockchain might be helpful for um yeah i think i think multisigs are a good approach there because uh if you forget and you have like two really close people to you who are on the multisig then great like it's okay um but yeah i agree there's definitely still like a curve um to make it easier for the masses what i could do is like i could have two of my brothers put in their passwords right and then like if i ever need to access it worst case scenario and everything both of my brothers can put it in and yeah or like or like a recovery wallet basically yeah you say hey like i i can do keys these are like the cool thing about smart contracts is you can code it to do whatever you want to do so um yeah you can do stuff like that but but agreed it's like there is this like um kind of like you know even i've done it a ton now sometimes when i send crypto i'm still like okay like hopefully i sent it to the right address yeah that's what i did like that that whole thing would like hopefully send it to the right address like i really wish that better solutions around that because that's like a really weird one it's like because currently with the way that i send money like going into the web 2 world i feel really secure i know 99 of the times like you know uh when i'm sending it it's gonna get sent there when i pop in my brother like let's say if it's paypal um i'm sending it to his email address it auto completes his email address his photo shows up like i'm sure it's the same dude well so the thing is like stuff like that like can be built and it's like yeah i mean like one of the uh the steps in that direction is we have e s now ethereum name service and like if i'm if i want someone to send me eth i say hey like patrick alpha c dot eth right and so boom you can just send it to like my domain almost which i think is like it's a much easier like much more friendly approach uh to sending stuff so i i think we're getting there yeah um but we'll we'll need more and again like the crazy thing is like what ethereum came out in 2015 2014 2016 one of those days and yeah in the grand scheme of things it's like this is new this is really yeah i mean bitcoin was um wow i'm forgetting on my dates now 2009 something yeah i think so 2011 to the 2009 was bitcoin 2009. okay all right i got it all right we're we're good um yeah created let's see 2015 i think they announced 2014 or something but i mean dates or whatever um uhhuh but yeah we're getting there we're getting the kazi there there's a lot of stuff to do and uh and that's why i'm so early we're early and i'm so on the [ __ ] train of like teaching people how to build this crazy [ __ ] because yeah like we can move towards this world where you can kind of like do [ __ ] you can like just have access to the markets to me that's like like wherever you are it doesn't matter like you can you can be a part of like financing be like an accredited investor to invest oh my god dude yeah like right yep you have to be yeah it just means like we're gonna allow rich people to get richer most of the time yep when a company is ipo'ing or whatever yeah they they get to get in at the best pricing the credit investor is like all right if you're already filthy rich and you want to get richer if you're filthy rich get in for cheaper and if you don't have money you have to pay 50 times that [ __ ] it's i i understand what the idea is it's like oh well if you if you're not a credit investor maybe you're this is gonna sound crazy maybe you're you don't have the experience uh that's a better way of saying it maybe you don't have the experience to do that but to me like pardon me is like it's like oh like they're they're thinking i'm too [ __ ] stupid to like to invest in this thing come on like it's like let me yeah like the government shouldn't i feel like a government shouldn't be allowed to make that decision for you like they allow gambling you know whatever dude allow all this [ __ ] like how are you deciding this is the thing that like i don't get to invest into a company but i can go and gamble yes dude i i think about this all the time because i'm like yo like so i worked at a hedge fund for a couple years and i was like what's yeah dude i worked at hedge fund for a couple years crazy excuse me an asset manager asset manager okay but like this is the same thing because yeah you i feel like you know so much about like crypto or like just the money stuff yeah yeah well it was crazy because i like uh i joined the the company because i wanted to learn it you know more about coding i was new in my career and i was fascinated about like how big money works and i was like well i want to learn how that how how does the world work basically in like another in another sense and then i'm like all right what's the secret sauce and like you know it the my takeaway from like and i read a ton of books and like i worked here and i talked to all these people who worked at like different groups my takeaway was that they're basically like running a ton a ton of software to guess what is going to go up and guess what is going to go down and that's it and i'm like that's the same thing if i go to [ __ ] casino and i go roll a roulette ball and i'm guessing it's going to be black or white and like i'm like it's it's like gambling with like way more steps and now that isn't totally fair that isn't totally fair um it's definitely not totally fair and um i think there are a lot of financial institutions that do do right and that do do good things so i i don't wanna i wanna just do i knew this was a good good uh good call to get on room temperature iq's over here excellent dude i'm back i'm back in fifth grade this is great um talking about like big money hedge funds and [ __ ] um but uh but yeah so so some of them like do do what [ __ ] um they do they do like uh actually like help the investors and and and help them like get into uh places to save their money to save their value right because in my mind that's what investing is it's like save your value um but there's there's a lot of them that what their goal is is it's you know it's a zerosum game if you're winning somebody else is losing figure out any little way to like screw somebody else over and it's it's just guessing right and it's yeah that's one thing that's that's really frustrating is that there's um there's yeah like you said there's a lot of people who are allowed to play this guessing game to play this gambling game and there's a lot of people that aren't and it's it's it's really frustrating so but but i again i want to make it perfectly clear that i'm not [ __ ] on the entire uh financial industry but i am [ __ ] on some of them to be to be quite frank because yeah it's it's um a ton of them they're just like they're they're get they get paid a [ __ ] ton of money to guess with a ton with a ton of charts and [ __ ] and they're just guessing i feel like i mean another thing as you were talking i started thinking about and i'm like what another thing that web 3 and this blockchain world is allowing us to do is um you know first of all you don't need you know so just in layman's terms if we could just bring it down so yeah what this basically means is let's say a company like tesla if it was in the traditional world you can't you weren't as a normal person you the viewers watching it who's probably not an accredited investor if you are that's [ __ ] great but like if you're not um probably what happened is when when tesla like you know was private company or whatever you couldn't invest in it but the cofounder of like twit uh or not twitch but like companies like twitter or whatever probably could yeah don't don't [ __ ] on him like that you just had him on your uh he's a great he's a great dude like he's getting i don't know he's companies because he's rich as [ __ ] and i'm not yeah but like but yeah it's uh yeah just like they could all get in early but like you can't get in early but if it was in the web 3 or blockchain world it's very likely that if like tesla launched they would have a tesla token that goes alongside it and from day one you could have been like an investor if you believed in it yeah no quasi to me the the biggest thing here like like because even in crypto like those guessing excuse me those guessing games are going to happen those groups that are just playing you know which which is fine because again i think there are a lot of them that do um do well do do right by investors they're really trying to get a return and like save people's value and i and i do think a lot of these financial products are really important yeah however to me the bigger thing the crazy thing is um information asymmetry and to me that is like one of these things that blockchain really just like nails in like elaine what do you mean by that yeah yeah so um so have you heard of flash boys before nope okay cool so back in the early 2000s right there was kind of the or maybe late 90s i forget the actual date but uh there were a lot of these high frequency trading firms popping up right and um they made a movie about this i think it's called like butterfly or something like that um where basically they like uh what was happening was whoever's server was closer to like the nasdaq or like the different exchanges could like send trades quicker and screw other people over so they would like see somebody somebody's about to make a trade right and basically front run them right so okay you're about to buy a bunch of bunch of this thing okay i'm gonna buy it first sell it back to you um and just like all this this kind of again because it's a zerosum game everyone's looking for like the edge the thing to like [ __ ] over the other person and um what it ended up doing was it just like everyone's getting wrecked by these people who are just have this new technology because they have this information they serve industry they're closer to the to the servers they have uh they're faster whatever and it kind of it it doesn't really make for like a fair market like how is it fair that because your computer is like a foot closer to where they run the transactions that you're getting better deals like that's not fair at all that's ridiculous right yeah um and there's there's stuff like this that happens all the time and um and even more so uh like when people make deals or when people i would okay so i will i would kind of play the devil's advocate and also go please yeah yeah go for it i would also go nothing is fair like that's how people find their edge in business and things because they find the unfair thing or whatever that gives them that edge not an unethical way but maybe that's so it's like why don't you just find a way to get closer to the data center maybe that's the thing to thought about you know that maybe a lot of people didn't think about but we keep going i'm listening no it's that that's a great point i mean uh the counter argument then it's like okay well not everybody can be closest there can only be one closest um but that's true but then the but then the other thing to think about is okay well imagine this imagine two systems one where there's a one in one million chance of you being the closest one to the server versus a system where there's perfect information and everyone can see everything that's true which which one are you gonna pick well there's a one in one million chance of you like being in the close of one so why the [ __ ] would you not pick this one in this one's blockchain yeah um so so there's uh although like there there is still front running and all this crazy an mev and all the [ __ ] that happened to blockchain but the thing i like is that all the information is perfect right there's you you know immediately who screwed you you know what's going on and it's much easier to say okay cool well i'm just gonna do what you just did right versus like in in the traditional world that everything happens behind closed doors or like if a company is going to do um some crazy thing or they're they're they're leeching money or they're you know the protocol is you know they're going bankrupt or something everything all of that is available on chain there's no like there's no like oh like this person knows like how much money the protocol has made you can see on chain how much money the protocol or excuse me the company right you can see all this information and i think that that's crazy the transparency is crazy crazy it's dude it's like it's crazy powerful and then additionally the biggest thing the thing that i usually rants about is this uh this trust minimization there's just fewer entities you have to trust because the code just does its thing right you say hey like jump it it jumps right it uh you say hey like send money it sends money there's no where does trust minimization come into play yeah so uh all over the place um uh one of my favorite examples that i give because it's like it's pretty easy for people to understand it uh have you heard of the mcmillion scandal uh this is the mcdonald's one that i think you've told me about right yes oh did i tell you about this yeah yeah yeah so i'll add it on here okay yeah so mcdonald's they ran this promotion where they were basically like yo buyer mcnuggets and we'll you know play our like monopoly game will give you a chance to win a million dollars that sounds great so a ton of people they said okay cool i'm gonna go buy mcdonald's because i want to win this lottery right yeah in doing so who were they trusting mcdonald's they were trusting mcdonald's they were trusting to mcdonald's to actually give them a fair chance of winning and for years between like 13 and 24 million dollars uh went to like some crime syndicate and you had a zero percent chance of winning right so you were trusting this entity where there was all this like you know behind closed doors like the lottery winners are getting picked behind closed doors so you were just assuming you were trusting they wouldn't do the right thing now you have this system where you're trusting mcdonald's to do the right thing versus on the blockchain you have a system where you can see everything that happens yeah and you can see exactly how the random candidates are chosen yeah like why would you why would you why would you ever use this world why would you ever use so there's this trust minimization or yeah and and i think like just so to to put like a little asterisk it might not have been mcdonald's fault they hired like you know but they were still they were still the one saying hey trust us we promise we'll give you a fair chance yeah right so like we trusted them but they kept picking like one group instead of giving people an equal chance but if it was done with a smart contract on the blockchain there would literally for developers on here it would literally be like an array and it would be like your array of the people which is everybody that's in the competition so it could be a thousand people or a hundred thousand million people and it'd be like random or whatever right in python you have the i forget but there's like you can import and select from the range and so it's like you just select random person you could see that code and that's the code that would pick and choose so the trust minimization that patrick is talking about i think here is like that you're talking about is you don't have to trust mcdonald's you you just see the code dude you got it i mean if you can see the code then you know and and that code would be publicly available to everybody that's participating in this challenge yeah in in solidity or viper whatever um because blockchains are deterministic there's actually no like dot random you can do pseudorandom which obviously isn't great um but you can use a chain like vrf which is a verifiably random function and that'll give you like a provably random number which is kind of mindblowing that you can have a number that's like provably random um it's a cryptographically random yeah it's it's a little too big brain for me yeah i don't even think i understand how random works like i don't even understand how random works and like there are certain things that like really blow my [ __ ] mind right it's like how do you write an equation that goes one way and not the other like that always just like hurts so hard it's like you can go one like usually the formula to reverse engineer backwards is like if you wrote the equation how can it be that hard dude math is math is great and then or basically maybe the idea is you know what the equation is but in order to like go through the steps of that equation it's just so computationally challenging that we don't solve it in time that's idea right and then uh for for viewers watching uh he's he's referring to like hashes or private public key uh cryptography which what he just said is literally like the basis of all of cryptography like oh these algorithms are one way you can't go you can yeah yeah they're they're one way so basically you can go the other way but it just takes really long that's the idea right i i mean it's like is it impossible to go the other way well so think of it this way if you if you have um like a number that's 10 to the if i'm thinking of a number between 0 and 2 raised to the 220 256th value which is like an insanely huge number um guess which number i'm thinking of that's kind of the uh that's kind of how it works like or or bigger or what so is it impossible it's like really just it's just it's like it's trial and error it's just trial and error like you just keep guessing until you get it which technically isn't impossible but like what super it takes super computers we were like hundreds of thousands future we might have computers that could probably brute force it or or if you waited or if you had one computer today then ran it for like a million years maybe it would get one so that you know if you want us if you want to steal someone's crypto that's the advice like imagine i was doing a short or like a video on this like like a parody like one minute thing like the crypt the the guy who hacked crypto or like broke the algorithm and it's like he like survives the [ __ ] ice age the he survives all of that and it like breaks into a wallet and it only has one dollar in it and then [Laughter] well he he should have checked either scan that was that was his first mistake yeah so okay but i i do want to give a quick second example uh because now you got me got me going uh because the the mcdonald's one is kind of like fun or whatever um but a a better a more impactful example that i'd like to give is transition or what trust minimization yeah a ton of people got screwed by robin hood right robin hood said nope can't buy these anymore what's up like where they're like you can't buy game stop stocks anymore can't buy gamestop stuff anymore or the other example i like to give is the 2008 financial crisis but that might be a longer story um but with gamestop they said you can't buy these anymore um you know and they even sold some for some people and whether or not it was their fault it doesn't really matter they had the ability they centralized ability to say nope we're flipping the switch you can't do this anymore even though they made this promise hey come use our platform we are democratizing finance like that was the promise that they made the end that they ultimately broke so and the uh the joke that was going around the crypto community was um there was somebody they posted like a picture of like a transaction on ether scan saying oh sorry um we've we've rejected your transaction because we have the power to do so and like the joke was like you can't because the code is immutable so uh yeah i mean that's yeah so that's a powerful example of it you know where like if you're on um if you're doing something on uniswap for example you can never get stopped it's it's in as long as computers exist and networks exist and like literally it can't be stopped there's no one entity that can like cops or the fed can't come in and be like hey shut this down it's that's like another interesting thing because there was um i was listening to a podcast on bankless banquets is a really sick podcast oh yeah i listened to a little bit of it oh yeah kevin rose did the one with bankless and i listened to that oh yeah oh hell yeah yeah they're they're great they're like um they're like the bro yes finance people um no they're they're good though they're they're they're good um yeah but uh they were talking with one of these guys who was down like in washington and they were talking about like yeah like some guy was like well if we really wanted to we would go around and we would track all the nodes down and take them down and i was like could you do that or or something along those lines and i was like like how would you track down kind of like how they caught the the people who stole 50 billion worth of bitcoin or something right the couple they like tracked all the nodes oh yeah well no that was that was different they just uh they did a poor job hiding their transactions uh like because again everything is transparent you know if you make transactions on chat you think if they came to you and you somebody who has all this knowledge and like you could like do you think you could help them get away with it because you're setting me up to get some pretty shady dms here to be honest maybe um but i mean there's there's also you know there's so much in this like i like to think i know a lot of stuff there's so many people who know way more than me right so maybe there's some weird back door i didn't think about that you know it would destroy me but i would definitely probably be able to to help but i wouldn't um that's the thing i'm too busy i'm i'm i'm trying to release the next free code camp video dude i don't have time to [ __ ] help your shady [ __ ] yeah not not you kazee whoever whoever's yeah yeah damn yeah i mean it's it's so well i'm sorry what were you saying though because i think you were talking about like reverse engineering nodes or something and i had oh yeah yeah they were i forgot what it was and and uh i feel like i'm just gonna say something stupid because i don't remember it somebody they were saying like oh like we would hunt down whoever deployed the contract or like we would hunt down like then yeah i'm back now i got to rewatch that episode to remember but i was like i was like that sounds ridiculous i don't know if that would be and by i don't know i mean like there's no way like like they haven't even cracked the onion network like how are you gonna what's on your network or excuse me like tour um excuse me like uh like like tour like the encrypted um encrypted torrent or something no so tor is like uh i forget what it stands for like the onion router or something like that um it's like a it's basically like an anonymous uh way to surf the internet like when you make a request to a website it kind of like scrambles it with other like computers so it's hard to see like where you're coming from oh i think i think it does i think it does some other stuff too i'm i'm definitely like not painting in its best light incognito i forget uh i know i know a lot about blockchain the networking stuff kind of yeah okay word perfect yeah get get him on the next podcast and we'll talk to her got it so like yeah yeah we'll bring him on hey break it break down the tour part he just comes in [Laughter] so so i think like okay so i understand there there's some parts about decentralization there's part about some trust minimization but like okay let's talk about like the uh i guess maybe a couple of things we can touch on and if you ever have to go just let me know i don't know dude i'm in i'm enjoying the conversation causing yeah my uh i blocked off the rest of the today to code so it's all good for me that is nice great way to do it dude because like otherwise you just like i miss coding and i don't get to code oh that's exciting it kind of makes me want to do well i was thinking of like like streaming my coding but then i'm like like i've done it before and i'm like just so much less productive because i'm like talking mom cody yeah yeah it's kind of like chess and i'm streaming chess like i play much worse man yeah there yep yeah exactly so but yeah dude if you get a chance to block off some time for coding it's like it's great it's like my favorite part of the day dude that is cool that is exciting um if i did blockchain coding i would jump in like if i did like full on maybe your skill level blockchain coding skills i would jump in with you but i'll i'll help you dude you need full stack in the same we could be in the same visual studio code on collab dude bro wait how sick if i'm like if i'm like writing all the back end [ __ ] and you're doing yo that would be sick actually that might be hella fun that would be a lot of fun how quickly can we build like a like a simple like nft marketplace or some [ __ ] you haven't i think you've already done that it's like some some weird [ __ ] like i'm like yeah that would be pretty cool our video would be a lot of fun because we could have like i could have somebody edit it and they could it would be more based on storytelling rather than like a tutorial um um one other thing is like yeah so if we did something like that or like we did uh i don't know simple blockchain challenges against each other and then see like and time each other you know yeah i did a video like that with a friend and we we battled each other with css so we got css challenge and then yeah we did it and then um i ended up winning so it's like entertaining video but now if i did it i have a lot of mr beast ideas in my head so i'm like it's like instead of one challenge taking 27 minutes his challenges each take like 50 seconds 40 seconds right in one video i would just like we you and i would just do 10 blockchain challenges you know or better yet i have somebody who i can pit against you oh [ __ ] so like you guys do the [ __ ] blockchain challenge i become the game show host and whoever wins gets like ten thousand dollars yo all right i'm in i'm in wait wait i know i know some coders too like uh yeah i know some people who could do it like this is my brother he's you know he's been coding for a week him and i we're great competition uh i'll blow him away and win the ten thousand dollars every single time so that sounds good to me yeah there you go okay but actually yeah no i and uh yeah i i know some people who would be who probably would would destroy me too um dude that sounds like a ton of fun yeah experience you have with blockchain i've been coding uh like solidity stuff for like the past two and a half years at this point wow which what the thing is like senior senior little dude because like people are starting a month ago dude which is so funny to think about yeah because like uh we you talk to like like a react developer right or like a uh or maybe not react it's the best example because they're kind of a javascript developer and i say like oh two and a half years they're like yeah i've been coding javascript for [ __ ] 20. right it's uh totally different yeah like i mean because the max you can be is like five years really six years let's talk about the money dude if ethereum developer solidity developer they're coding for half a year one year how much money are they making on like if they're if they're like um let's say they're in us let's just start there they're in u.s they know what they're doing they've been doing it for half a year a year like what type of salary range are we talking yeah it's it definitely ranges um if you're like super noob stuff it can still be kind of like a normal like developer like it could be like 80 90k like if you're we're talking about like pretty much junior level people yeah we're talking about junior level people i mean and the the thing is most projects aren't looking for junior level people um because senior well because it's just um like most products like need to move quick and they're like building quick uh but the good thing is like the i think the startups that are like a little bit more openminded realize that okay like if we get a bunch of junior developers they probably can still build something really sick right like most junior solidity developers are learning crazy [ __ ] fast yeah and are gonna be learning on the fly and building really cool [ __ ] so yeah like like low end i'm gonna say it's like 80 to 90. high end is is is nuts dude high end high ends i wouldn't be surprised if the average is like like 150 170. uh i think i think crypto jobs list quoted it a lot lower though i think like a couple of like here's what people are making quoted at like 120 130. but dude dude i've seen i've seen [ __ ] for like 500 plus tokens yeah like um i don't i don't know how legit those are yeah um and i don't i don't personally know anybody who's doing that i've seen [ __ ] like that but yeah i do know people who are doing 180 plus tokens 200 plus tokens you know um so that's that's pretty like within the realm of doable okay i don't know what 100 200 tokens means what what sorry like like how like i thought we were talking about usd like people make hundred fifty thousand oh no no sorry like like 200k 200k plus tokens like 200k plus like the equivalent of the stock options and got i got it okay yeah which which and i say like plus tokens because if the the project sucks like it tanks and it's like all right well i got nothing for these tokens these tokens project is good like um i don't know if you know alex becker and the crypto community is huge oh well now i feel silly i don't know alex becker alex how do you spell his last name um alex becker so alex and then becker okay so he's more like uh influencer slash somebody who talks a lot about crypto uh oh [ __ ] 800 000 followers okay yeah on youtube he's he should be past a million subs now really yeah and like each video he was dropping on crypto dude was doing like half a million views and you could do those styles really yeah um but like yeah he just talks about crypto stuff and he launched his own nft project have you ever heard of neo tokyo i'm not so anyways like his developer that got on it it now makes like has made over seven figures like in less than a year wow yeah so i feel like some some projects if you get on that are like good projects i mean it's kind of [ __ ] nuts you know my friend just like minted uh neo tokyo and it's uh and if he sells it today it's worth quarter million and he got it for free that's that's one of the things that like is really exciting and it's good about this space that there's like so much there's a lot of economic opportunity here and people like it hyped and like yo i'm trying to make bank yeah it also is like it also has a downside where you have all these you you you get a ton of people who come in and they go yo i'm gonna join this project early because and i want to be like you know what this alex becker guy did and they just get [ __ ] wrecked and that that always breaks my heart or like the thing that happens all the time is like a new protocol launches and somebody goes oh my god like i'm gonna be the first one on this protocol like i'm gonna get all these rewards it's gonna be great and they just get [ __ ] rugged yeah um so it comes with a downside and the other downside is that likes a lot of people view the industry as like this stupid cash grab yeah which to a lot of people it is and and and if that's if that's what gets you into the space you know so be it um i mean i'm not going to lie dude we talked about this right i get it when i'm like monkeys and making this much money i'm like let me start paying attention to this but then like i came for the monkeys and i stayed for the decentralization bro dude for for me it was the uh it was a combination of the memes the promise and the money it was like all three like like to me like the the memes in the space are hilarious the fact that like like a super super [ __ ] serious event the the mascot is a half buffalo half [ __ ] unicorn half like pigeon right to me that is phenom and that's that's eat denver one to me that's phenomenal like you have this ridiculous yeah which you should have came dude next time next time i was too late yeah next next year next year next year yeah eat denver's super sick but uh yeah like we like it's it's this crazy weird i forget where i was going with this crazy weird community but yeah like it's i got into it for the money for the for the uh for the decentrality and for the memes and yeah now that i'm here i'm like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] uh yeah there's well actually that's not even true because uh it was it was even more for the um the future because i was like i was researching smart contracts and i was like holy [ __ ] like all these [ __ ] issues in finance that i saw i'm like holy [ __ ] like this is the answer this is the [ __ ] answer so yeah so i i i i it caught my attention because of all that [ __ ] but yeah i was like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] because of all like the cool stuff that this technology enables so i mean yeah i i totally agree with that like it enables so many cool things i think like you know one of the things that i'm thinking about is how do you see average users getting into this space right so for example some thoughts at the top of my head are like you know um things like solana pay that just releases pay you can actually go to a real store flip out your phone and like just pay what's a lot of pay right so that makes it look kind of real world how do you see it becoming a more no not just for in people looking to make a quick buck on nfts but more people switching into it yeah i i think one of the biggest steps i i think the first big pillar to fall is gonna be well it's already falling it's gonna be defy right like all these um investing asymmetries and this unfairness like all there's so many advantages that d5 gives like the common person that i think like that is the the entry point that's going to be the first thing i think that's going to be the first thing to go mainstream some could argue that nfts have gone mainstream but i i don't i i think nfts are great but like the val the real value i feel like is um for like for like making people's wellbeing better is more in defy um i think nfcs are really cool i think they're fantastic um but yeah i think like the the normal person who wants to have a better life it's d5 right because they can invest in all these these really cool uh financial products they can invest much easier yeah um and they can kind of they can have access to this financial world they weren't able to have access before um one of the things i really did like about robinhood was they were originally their mission was that as well and i i think it still is but they [ __ ] up a little bit um so like give people access to to easily like be a part of markets and i think crypto is really the fulfillment of that vision uh with like a provably fair done in approvally fair way so i think d5 i think like a lot of the investing um like moving away from kind of traditional stocks to to crypto stuff i think that's kind of the first foray um and that's one of the first things for for i mean once money moves there pretty much everything that's gonna then fall like a domino effect right that's that's actually kind of a big big thing i think so yeah why what do you think um i man i don't know like honestly it's definitely a tough one to kind of predict like i i get certain ideas around nfts and i'm like oh just like for example uh if you get nnft to gary v's fly fish club or whatever he launched you could then now they're launching the service where you could lease it out to other people so you could own it but you could lease it out to other people or let them rent and i'm like that's such a cool concept because imagine if for three months i'm like you know what i'm really not using my netflix subscription but instead of canceling it what if i could let somebody borrow it for three months i don't know like that would be pretty cool um the thing that i do causey is anytime like one of my buddies is like yo like how do i how do i crypto i go okay get a mask wallet i'll send you i'll send you 10 20 will will stick you uh uh we'll stick some money into ave on polygon we'll let you [ __ ] around the fees are super cheap there you can start playing with d5 on polygon and then boom like everyone i've done that with it's like holy [ __ ] this is so sick this is so easy it's like yeah the the thing that you talk about like oh my god i can i can like literally like move all like a [ __ ] ton of money in like a second like are you are you kidding me like so that's what i say i say go play on ave on polygon network have fun yeah come back to me when you have more questions yeah i think yeah like for for me what i see is i think the the user experience needs to just be really simplified so i think of like a little bit more yeah it's like think apple versus like um i don't know like a google computer or like a regular microsoft computer uh or a phone they they simplified things and they kept taking things away and the more they took things away it just made the user experience so easy and i feel like that's why a lot of people you know go after apple products because they're just simple you even kind of forget that there's so much technology behind it i feel like with the crypto space it's it's like there's too many options available like i i go to send money and then it asks me for my slippage i'm like what the [ __ ] like i just want to buy something i have no idea what this is right i know come and and it's almost like right now it feels like in order to drive a car you also have to be a [ __ ] car engineer like no i just want to drive the car like just give me a gas pedal and whatever so i feel like when things like meta masks become a lot easier to sign up for and use because i i can't tell my dad to sign up for this he there's no way you know he won't get it or like somebody like if i even tell my girlfriend she's on instagram all day she's all this she's a pro boxer but like this is too involved in the tech world where she won't she will be like super confused setting up a metamask wallet so i feel like when those things become really easy i feel like a lot more people in my opinion would start jumping in because then there would be even a lot less fear yeah no i i think you're right i think user experience is probably going to be one of the biggest things and uh i i forced my uh my girlfriend to get a meta mask so that's maybe that's the i was like yo you need to do this well although she doesn't she like got it and like she hasn't touched it since i you know yeah um but uh yeah no i i agree i think user once as user experience gets better it'll just get better and better and that's another reason why i'm doing what i'm doing teaching the engineers how to like code because right it's that they're going to be the ones that are going to build it right they're going to be they want to build the user experience and make it easier and friendlier um and then i imagine at some points lots of companies will start making it where like i could go to amazon and buy in usdt like i think like once these big [ __ ] companies that we all know and love like once that starts happening or youtube starts sending me adsense in usdc like i feel like when the big player starts moving i think that might lead to mass adoption yeah i think you're right yeah so uh those are kind of my thoughts there uh and i think we touch base on solidity and okay if a developer goes into the space how much money can they realistically make um but also like how much experience does somebody need before they can start applying for jobs so like for example say i'm a developer with one or two years of experience with the traditional full stack development i'm pretty decent i have a couple of projects on my portfolio and i want to now join the blockchain world do i have to wait a couple of years before i can start applying for blockchain jobs or what's the process there no so here's what here's what i usually tell people and then it could be i think years isn't a great indicator because it's whatever time frame you can do this in here's what i usually think step one take a tutorial a course doesn't matter which one you can take my free code camp one it's great dappy university's got some great ones uh eat the blocks got some great ones you know you can watch all of all of qazi's videos uh what whatever i don't care right like do some type of tutorial get into it that's step one get the basics get like that basic solidity viper if you're using solana rust i don't care what's fun mentioning that i don't know what that is oh it's it's a it's a pythonic uh smart contract language so it's it's basically the if solidity is to javascript python or viper is to python so you you can write evm you can write ethereum smart contracts and viper it's a super sick language too uh it's used a lot less though like curve iron.finance those are some of the big ones that use it uh but yeah pick a language doesn't matter which one and go and learn something once you do that the next thing to absolutely do especially right now is join a hackathon and force yourself to like take what you've learned and like build something else because you're gonna meet a ton of people you're gonna get a ton of skills from going to a hackathon and you're going to force yourself to kind of leave what i call tutorial hell so join a hackathon right because that's where you're going to push yourself you're going to take all the tutorial stuff and you're going to run into real problems you're going to run into more problems that are outside the tutorial right tutorials are great and i make a ton of them but usually when you take those learnings and you go to the real world there's like oh but i want to tweak this like this or do this and that might be harder so force yourself to run into those problems and build something submit something the other thing that's really cool about these hackathons is there's a ton of money in them right now so that's also good you can have the chance to win but don't really think about like the winnings really just focus on okay i'm here to learn and build something and then also network i've seen tons of projects come out of hackathons and then become like protocols right so if you're into that you could leave a hackathon and become a protocol so one of the uh projects from the last chainlink hackathon this product struck finance this was like maybe four months ago they just did they i i think they met at the hackathon i could be wrong i don't actually i'd have to double check but yeah four months ago they did the challenging hackathon they just raised 3.9 million dollars so yeah so like this [ __ ] moves quick so if you do well at a hackathon go on make the protocol the other thing is they're headhunters at these hackathons so if you do really well maybe you don't even need to apply because someone's going to reach out and be like yo i want to hire you they're headhunters at these hackathons um but after that uh even you know if no headhunter reaches out to you then that's when you can start applying right after you start building some protocols uh and start feeling really competent so maybe that takes you four months maybe that takes you a year and a half maybe that takes you three years right yeah however long it takes you but yeah just start applying along the way um the other question i get a lot is internships can i go to an internship where can i internship blockchain and smart contracts are kind of these this wild world where like your internships are like everywhere yeah but but they're not traditional internships to me you're going to get a lot lot better um experience going to like maybe someone's github and trying to work on an issue or something right or going to some open source project and say oh hey like i really like this feature you know can i work on this or can i do that there's all these protocols have grants where they'll give out money for you to work on something and you're going to get way better experience doing that than like getting someone's coffee is like an intern or whatever right so so like go out like use the the fact that blockchain is so ridiculously open source is like your advantage it's like holy [ __ ] there's so many places that i can learn and work with people uh and learn from other people so it's like every company almost every company on the blockchain is open source in that way so like yeah wow yeah learn learn from all and like the other cool thing is like all of the tutorials that i do are like based off of these like insane protocols because all their code is open source so if you want to see okay what does ave do what does synthetics do what does compound do yeah the code's right there link or we'll pop up the link to the channel in the description and then also we'll show something on the screen right now and i think patrick collins if we just type that in on youtube your tutorials and videos should come up right and um even the one that i started actually learning solidity with is patrick's video that's how i know him it was i was in dubai and i went to free code camp not i didn't go to free code camp actually i typed in solidity tutorial and then patrick's popped up with two million views and it's just a [ __ ] banger yeah i like played it me and my team watched like so many hours worth of it and like learned a ton so um yeah and then you saw it was python and then you're like three hours in but like i watched the two three hours bro and i was hooked so i would highly recommend you guys watch that to learn solidity definitely and we got a javascript one with hard hat coming out soonish very soonish so definitely be sure to check that out it's gonna be sick like anybody who like oh my god like i'm i'm filming it right now dude oh my god it's so [ __ ] sick that's sick i'm excited for that one i'm excited if you get in this space and you're like yo like i'm trying to learn this [ __ ] dude like watch one of those two videos because at the end you're gonna be golden you're gonna be good to go like that all right like i said watch whatever tutorial and watch whatever tutorial but if you watch mine and you like actually go through it you are going to come out the other side [ __ ] swinging ready [ __ ] swinging right and so it'll be like 20 hours or something like that the first one was 16. yeah it's gonna take you a couple months to actually like watch it and digest but like dude it's like sick it's so good worth it all right awesome i feel like we covered a lot of the road map of how do you actually become a blockchain engineer or a solidity developer or whatever are there any other parts you want to add to it or you feel like it's pretty good what we have for it so far i think that's pretty good i mean the rest of it's kind of like the traditional you know keep learning keep grinding right like if nobody's hiring you keep learning keep grinding keep keep your github repo is your um is your resume your github repo and then also you know your your regular resume is also your resume but these are the products that i've worked on this is what i know how to do um something else i usually recommend to people is um if you are looking for a job like start writing some articles right start making a little bit of content do some tutorials did you work on something really cool great make it write an article about it there's great places like dev.2 you can just rip an article and now that's kind of like part of your resume as well like this is here this is what i know how to do uh and maybe that's a good way to get your name out there i know that us devs are usually a little bit more shy but it's still a great way to get out there and um and then maybe you just do it you get the job and then you stop writing and that's fine too yeah yeah 100 i mean yeah there are a lot of um i feel like there's a huge demand and the supply is a lot smaller like even for us we were looking for blockchain engineers and we're looking to bring some on you can even hire them and it's like it's [ __ ] hard and all the people were interviewing are like yeah i have two months of experience you know i started coding like solidity you know those are some of the best candidates we have we're like like we recently came across a couple that have like one or two years of experience and stuff and we're like yo this is this is great um one person yeah i'm really excited about but he's uh you're currently a senior blockchain engineer at meta and was ex google oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] watkins is 2013. oh my god and he wants to work with us and i was like what the [ __ ] i'm like why do you want to work we're just youtubers dude [Laughter] and uh and uh i think yeah so like he wants to also be in some of the videos so he's excited about that oh hell yeah okay um i would just say why does he that i mean i mean that's [ __ ] sick right is it because of the videos and stuff uh yeah i mean it's like of course we're gonna have him on a team he's gonna get paid oh yeah and so that's nice um but then on top of that there's gonna be some videos we're gonna have them in and i'm thinking to have been like some really cool like epic videos um i got a couple of ideas dude like even off this podcast i would love to brainstorm some video ideas with you just like create one creator to another creator um yeah because i was i was actually recently feeling like [ __ ] man i to brainstorm with somebody and i come up with ideas but most people aren't creators you know and like you are so um i will hit you up i will hit you up i'm excited about that actually seriously um i love to do this walk marina and like i just go on this long walks and then i just whoa dude a walking meeting oh yeah i'm game yeah i have i have to walk 7000 steps a day because i'm like trying to be less fat so hell yeah that sounds good ah you don't look fat you look like jacked i'm i'm bigger than i want to be uh i told people i was bulking so however i mean yeah like i feel like you're a fit dude you have the [ __ ] thanksgiving water next to you it's yeah the 64 ounce uh 64. i gotta i gotta [Laughter] just walks around with it everywhere dude dude i want to be one of those gym guys who who has like the milk carton yeah that's his water bottle i think those are fantastic so this is like a little bit less but yeah still like bigger than my [ __ ] head like we should just get jacked and have tank tops gallon of milk and writing smart contracts under time crunch dude dude one of my uh one of the one of the videos that i have planned i want to do some weird [ __ ] at the gym and then like have like a laptop where i'm like uh because so there's this new framework that just came out foundry it's it's rust based it's super fast it's really powerful and like the joke god what's gonna say you write in rust uh no so it's it's rust based it's command land base so you just do on the command line you don't have to actually do any rust i mean i have written rust stuff but yeah the joke that i was gonna make was like oh it's so powerful and i'm like [ __ ] dead lifting or some [ __ ] but then i was like that's i don't i don't know if that's that's too [ __ ] corny this framework is too good the striker is too powerful what this happens with creators right like you'll think of an idea and then you go i don't know if it's too corny and like when you execute it sometimes it's like way shittier than you had imagined and it's like really yeah what the [ __ ] like i really thought it was gonna go but like now i don't even get it like what's the joke um i have it's me all the time but i'm sure it does yeah one thing i thought about is like you can't ever give up on that part of yourself because that's the true creator and like that [ __ ] will breed so much lack of confidence in yourself when you keep having ideas and you know you keep not doing them and then like you just keep getting less and less confident as a creator so i feel like it's like even if you think it's the dumbest [ __ ] or whatever it's like just go [ __ ] do the deadlift with the laptop in your hand like this is [ __ ] powerful uh like make it a 20 second short and drop it you know but like that way you just keep increasing your confidence and like what you set what you thought you were going to do you actually do it all right cozy i'm taking those words to heart next video i drop i'm going to be [ __ ] dead lifting and doing some weird [ __ ] dude i thought tutorial that broke 2 million views i had this random idea that i'm gonna be by the ocean and i'm just gonna be waving the laptop in one arm like with one hand and i'm just like talking and i'm like doing pushups and [ __ ] when i'm teaching for loops i'm like here's what range of ten and then i did ten pushups and then i got up with a laptop and i'm just like coding and it goes back to the coding screen it's like [ __ ] crazy what that's phenomenal yeah oh my goodness um now i want to do i want to do a random pushup soon i'm coding that sounds [ __ ] sick yeah just like i'm imagining like um like doing [ __ ] bench presses and then like sitting up like from the bench press and like a table sliding over to like and then you just say all right now it's time to code for my [ __ ] rest that [ __ ] is funny dude it's like octopus when i was watching your tutorial i'm like oh like another [ __ ] professor person teaching [ __ ] you know with green screens and i was like oh this is gonna be cringy and i like watching it but then like you were dropping some references and also the way you speak i'm like this guy sounds like a savage i'm like i like this guy and i'm like this is [ __ ] cool i want to learn this so it was weird like it made me want to learn as i like bought into more of who you were you know and so i feel like if you just like interdisperse like random [ __ ] that you like in the tutorials like whether it's chess or league of legend references or like gym references i think it will it'll just make people like you and connect with you a lot more quasi we gotta so when we get on these brainstorming calls like we'll i'll i'll give you all the solidity knowledge and then you just keep feeding me the youtube [ __ ] i'm with it sounds great you keep giving me the tricks of the trade man i'm down yeah that's that's where we're headed um all right bro i think this was phenomenal if we ever do one in the future i think like we'll just do a live one because it'll be i think we'll uh we'll take questions and stuff um yeah yeah yeah because yeah i thought we riffed here really well so i'm yeah i'm game i think i think there was no like uh performance issues like yeah i think this would be a lot of fun to just rip live too performances we're about to jump into a bluetooth sponsored ad or something um uh what is it what did uh ray kroc now [ __ ] i forget it yeah yeah no i i hear what you're saying you have performance issues drink this creatine sponsored by g fuel yeah we should get sponsors on these videos man get get g fuel a red bull on the two of us just like go [ __ ] nuts for a solid 60's you want to talk smart contracts i got you what have the best [ __ ] code of your life dude i'm gay i did one video on like tic tac it like blew up and it's like and it starts and i'm just like i stand up and i'm going all crazy and i'm like she yes and then the in the caption we wrote like when a javascript developer like uh discovers react for the first time and he's like rolling this up and he goes like this and it's just react logo and he like injects it into his [ __ ] arm and like i want like blew up and like got like almost a million views and i'm like yo let's we gotta do more of these hell yeah man so so wait so do you edit this too or it's just like all right you just rip it um i yeah we will edit it i have a team of editors all right cool all right so that that's why we're like all right we're gonna make the audio and everything really good so yeah yeah yeah that's why we did it like this so we'll have editor that'll like find the thing that'll be like the most like they'll hook the most yeah yeah yeah um and then like we'll start it off with that the video punch in and punch out it'll be like super entertaining um yeah so normally ask people what their biggest regret is or something crazy and then like we make that that's what i did with the cofounder of twitch like we made the hook oh [ __ ] what was his what was his biggest regret um i forget what his was but one of the things that he had like these l's on is he's like he he started this company atrium took 75 million dollars and like lost all the money you know so like we hooked the video with that ryan carson when i interviewed him i asked him is one of his and like he passed up on 100 million dollar deal and he said no he turned it down and then he's like [ __ ] i should have said yes you know so like we started that one off like that um so in this one we didn't have any drama so we won't have like a crazy hook this one is more positive entertaining you know positive is good yeah we were pretty positive talk about krypto and stuff crypto's the future that's that's not a great hook it's also not it's also kind of a boring hook crypto's the future oh yeah should you start off with me going like patrick um why do all the crypto people dislike you and then answering it get get the get the controversy for the hook right there i'm with it why does the crypto community hate you yeah there you go [Laughter] yeah because if we say why does the crypto community love you that's not a fun that's something we should have a stream uh we should do a stream next time that's like um we're gonna keep streaming until patrick laughs at a blockchain meme and then it's just like we just keep it rolling and we just keep showing you random memes and then when you finally laugh we just end the stream oh i'm dude i'm game that's a that's a ridic all right yeah i can i can be stone face don't you're gonna be testing my stone face it's like nothing cracks you um all right we'll do something like that dude i'm excited i feel like a lot that we could [ __ ] do i love you bro so i'm gonna stop the recording guys thank you for watching i love your beautiful face um patrick should this subscribe what should they do right now yeah uh 100 go to my youtube channel subscribe uh patrick collins no just kidding like go learn blockchain go learn blockchain that's what you all should do y'all should go take a tutorial i'll give a [ __ ] what tutorial go do tutorial and then like exit tutorial hell go to a hackathon like make it make the commitment right now watching the stream with me and kazi like you're gonna go learn this [ __ ] dude qazi is doing a ton of videos like this is this is like if you're like oh like i wonder if this is your call to action like this is the [ __ ] universe saying hey like this is web three is what's up so so go learn blockchain free coke camp like uh causey uh eat the blocks that who cares like golem web 3 go to a hackathon come join us it's a ton of fun here yes sir there you go and smash the [ __ ] like button yeah more people match the [ __ ] yo subscribe to cleverprogrammer if you haven't already what the [ __ ] you doing here if you haven't subscribed already all right with that said guys we love your beautiful face if you watch it up until this point just comment like whatever comment you leave just add in the word blue frog in there that's how i uh you and you watch this [ __ ] there you go repping the blue frog um that's how we'll know so thank you guys we love your support and uh we'll see you in the next video what it do what it does but you being where you was when it ain't what it is facing the merge i really be hating in the put mud
