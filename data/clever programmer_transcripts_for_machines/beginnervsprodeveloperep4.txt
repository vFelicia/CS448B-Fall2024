what is up everybody i hope you guys are doing amazing this is nas and we are live we're live we're alive hope you guys are doing great hope all is well happy happy sunday we are live right now with episode four of the clever programmer audio experience and i have someone very special with me here i have a guest i have my girlfriend here victoria and we're gonna have some fun so victoria can you sell here for a second hello hello right so she is she is not even a developer so she's not developer of course right and we're not developer right no no what are you a video editor video editor slash yes correct correct right so she does drawing and then some video video editing as well and then today we're gonna have some fun guys so we're gonna test out the skills of somebody basically who well let's just say it does not know coding right right yeah yeah yeah okay okay there's not no cutting versus somebody of course who does not quit it which is me right we'll test them out hello hello everybody we got we see we have web dev here we go hello shout out to from philippines let's go let's go let's go awesome sweet sweet sweet hope you guys are doing amazing of course as always as always now so how is this going to work well very very simply we basically have a game okay it's a game okay you're right for this game oh yeah right so it's a game it's a very simple game so it's like you're going to tease them that's funny oh yeah for sure so if we basically can just have like a really fun game i'll ask her a few questions and then we'll see you'll be trivia and actually you guys will get to play as well if you guys want to you guys want to play with us as well yeah yeah yeah why not let's yeah play let's have them play too yeah we'll have to play as well so oh yeah yeah okay that'd be fun too so let's go ahead and get into really fast let me go i'm getting my microphone i want to be more there we go and i'm louder great great great great so all right so let's go ahead and do this i will go ahead and bring you guys up to speed here for a second all right let's see so what we've got right now is we're gonna play a goal a game called kahoot anybody anybody played kahoot here if you have not let me know before you if you play the kahoot game that's a lot a lot of fun uh all right cool cool cool what do we have what do we have let me see let's see oh let's go we got 82 viewers right all right beautiful beautiful everybody say hello everybody say hi hi hi beautiful all right that's what i am talking about yes yes yes love from kansas shout out from pakistan beautiful all right so what we're going to do today is go through programming basis and i want you guys go ahead and take this out as well again it'll just be a fun one right with me as well because let me say nami beginner all right let's go so what we're going to do is i'm going to go play a game called classical it's probably basics so what i want you guys to do is it will go ahead and it will tell you to go to kahoot you guys see that kahoot so you go ahead and put that id and input this game pin nine one 915067 zero i'm going to do this two right now i'm going to this two let's see let's see let's see nine one five kahoot that is there we see yeah come on all right victoria you're there okay you guys can actually go there as well there we go i'm gonna be here so let's see all right let's see nine one five nine one five oh so look at siddharth let's go smp all right nine one five zero zero six seven beautiful i'm gonna enter as well i'm gonna put in my name it's nas okay go all right nice who else we're going to give you guys two more minutes you guys to log in okay so go ahead and take two minutes guys two minutes if you guys want to jean who's jean kale let's go beautiful oh this is gonna be fun it'll be so fun i know got nine people now 101 people live with us ali pratik all right who else guys i'll give you guys two beginners some you said ali all right beautiful beautiful 12 people now that's what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about sod all right awesome sweet sweet sweet ariel wait ariel not the real do we know right [Laughter] absolute uni i'm not sure who that is but that's pretty funny all right let me see who else who else who else all right we'll go go ahead and get started right away in that case right now okay juan marielle who else ali beginner critique okay so bean man i think that's funny marine vlad vlad that sounds like a very uh you know european name i feel like oh okay all right i wish that can i remove some person wait there we go if you guys don't like it i will remove you there we go all right cool so program basic guys three two one so here's the question here okay how many bits are equal to one byte what do you guys think how many bits are equal to one but you guys have three seconds to answer all right let's go eight how many bits are equal to one bite wait i know this one what do you think you got it maybe maybe let's see all right let's see let's see let's see let's see 23 answers all right what do we have what do we have and we have a b it's equal to one but which one did you get yeah i was wrong all right so eight bits is equal to one byte guys that is what it is okay awesome let's go ahead again let's let me see who's the leader board here beginner wait did i not get it right oh cuz i took time so beginner is winning all right next one let's go next one what is the output of this what do you think wait wait don't look all right let's see ten answers eleven you guys have ten seconds ten nine eight seven six five four three two one oh it's lamb somebody's sad wait something you said right there do you know why you know why so the reason why is because let me go first show media so let's check this out the reason why that's the case is because in programming ooh that's interesting that was your drawing yeah that was interesting so the reason why guys is actually because in this is an array right here right this is the race as you guys potentially know right now to access an array what's going on here is we're console logging we're outputting something right and we're outputting you know the instructors at position two you see this two there's two right so now what did you think this actually means tell me this two means what do you think this two means uh the second one the second one so that's all that's a lot of people think right you'll be it'll be jess is that what you picked so the reason why it's actually not just is because in um in programming everything starts from zero yeah that's why i thought after i saw that the answer was uh lim uhhuh that's what i thought you thought it was yeah it was zero one two yeah yeah because right now the first the first index this is called index always starts from zero then we have one and then we have two right there exactly and that's kind of how it always kind of starts out in programming guys so just so you know okay somebody now i get it there we go beautiful beautiful yeah so that's really fun one right zero one two always remember this in programming everything starts from exactly z zero exactly all right let's go and continue on so that's the reason why we have this beautiful all right next one let's see uh okay all right you guys ready let's see who got the next chord oh is okay next one are you guys ready yes or no all right nas but something you said yes that's funny all right next one next all right i got this really quickly what is the output of the first and second answer okay quickly wait what okay okay i got it that's it yeah picked i don't know why i picked it picked such a long time 90 seconds huh i don't know i don't know why it's ah all right 12 answers guys who can do more don't give the answers out in the comments guys don't look you're trying to help me huh they're trying to help me no guys don't help her let's go come on come on what do you guys think what you guys think what you guys think huh have 156 people live holy moly let's go all right let's go all right and what do we have uh yeah i think so i'm gonna go ahead click uh can i if i click skip will they actually count oh no i don't know i think if they click skip it will actually count let me see skip oh which one did you pick that one that's the one you picked yeah really yep yeah look at that did you guys help her out no they did not okay they helped me out after okay all right so again the reason why let's go through this why this is happening right why is this happening guys well very simply okay i'll go stop this one i need to remove this portion right here from my side okay so the reason why this is happening is very simple right if you think about this right let's think about this right well we have console log z that's the output right so that means that's kind of what well it gets outputted right well let's think about this we have z is the variable and we have x is also variable here you see that now this variable the value of this variable is 10. yeah the value of this variable is basically x plus 5 which is 15. yeah so that's 15 is the first answer and then we have next one we have x equals 20 right and then z is equal to x plus five same thing 25 25. so it's pretty simple did you guys get that you guys understood that yes yes yes yes yes somebody said minha said there would be an error there yes there will be an error there i'm not sure where's the ear but the error i don't think there's an error here is there an error i don't think so anyway so that is the answer let's see who's the winner of this one and we have nasa's still on the running let's go let's go let's go now they're still in the running let's go okay but andy is coming up really quick look at this andy beginner pratik okay that's up where are you at i don't see you on there yeah i know all right next one what do you create well how do you create a function in javascript how do you create a function in javascript what do you guys think oh i gotta answer hold on otherwise i'll lose wait wait no come on we're connecting um okay i got it don't look i'm not yeah you are no i'm not yeah you are i'm not she's looking guys no yeah she is no okay let's see let's see let's see nope nope i put the comments up just look at the comments guys do not help other people well they just showed me that i'm wrong that's all i did all right let's see what you guys think what are you guessing all right let's see all right 21 you guys have 10 seconds left 10 seconds 10 nine eight seven six five four three two one and the answer is i was wrong that is the way they beat gohan and create a function is you call the first first you call at first you call function right first you call function and then after that you say the function name and then you put parentheses around it to give it that can biscuit to start a function and then you actually use brackets for that as well so that's how you do that awesome let's go and continue on beautiful all right next one is wait who's going to know oh i'm still not i'm still black dynamite is coming up though black diamond is almost there black diamond is almost there let's go black dynamite whoo beautiful all right next one you ready are you sure as ready as i'll ever be are you harmless already as ready as i'll ever be let's go all right next one and what does it mean if if true is returned what does it mean what does it mean if true is returned guys what do you guys think if true is returned okay i know this one oh i got this one i got this one are you looking at me don't look that's the wrong answer did you already pick it no good well thank you for that so this by the way just so you guys know the module is here this month so this module is right here okay guys if you're spamming i'm gonna cut you out right now all right let me see where's this guy if you're spamming oh i enjoy i enjoy this right here so much there we go beautiful so guys so just so you know right what does this module mean this right here this modulus means that a number can be divided by two equal like if a number could be divided by two what does that mean what does it mean if a number can always be divided by two even exactly so it's this one right hand that's what i chose really yeah let's go hey let's go that's not an easy one yeah well i just figured because of math all right let's go somebody said 15 25. that does not that's not the answer guys all right there we go next one wow a lot of you guys did that holy moly i'm surprised so like i said guys the reason why this is the answer is very simply because why i modules 2 right here means that a number can be divided by 2 evenly right modulus means modulus actually is an operator that means basically how much something is left that's what that means so basically like if i do five modulus two the answer for that will be one because the remainder from that is one because four divided by two is even right so it'll be two times two and then the remainder of that will be one understand yeah awesome sweet so let's continue on let's go all right wait all right okay next one and we have oh nas is still in the winding let's go i need to get myself all right oh come on you know you gotta have some fun sometimes you know i know how else are you very far behind wait you just told us the answer i did not tell you guys the answer i never told you guys the answer did i tell you guys the answer no no i didn't tell you no all right next one next up what is and and end wait i actually don't know this one hold on wait no i got it what is it guys what do you guys think is it i might have gotten this one wrong actually hold on because i forgot the name actually do you remember from like code academy really yeah your mom with this one because i forgot to recognize it i know i mean i know what it is i know i know what it does but i think i got it wrong oh man yeah i got it wrong damn it hmm don't tell the answer valeria says don't tell the answer guys all right guys and how do we have 26 answers 27 answers since one day more people come into here logic go let's go oh let's go all right and we're done and ten nine eight seven six five quattro uno oh it's a logical operator i put down conditional operator for some reason i don't know the comparison the comparison operator that's that's a pretty good choice too dang it i don't know i thought it was because it's inside a conditional see even a pro developer sometimes we'll get we'll get messed up yeah that's okay all right mistakes happen yeah why this guy be so annoying i don't know if i'm annoyed then just you know then move away from this youtube channel from this youtube video oh no oh no but again i'm coming for you my friend i am coming for you my friend he's not a beginner he's not a beginner no he's a beginner just you know but i'm worried i come i got you i got you don't worry i got you i got you all right next one i got this one what kind of a loop is this and what is the maximum number of candies i got it okay oh got it all right not so sure got it what do you think not so sure but why not i'm trying what is what do you think it is like i recognize that from like from kota candy right yeah but at the same time i'm not sure i just remember it's like seeing it yeah yeah so like what do you think is happening here i'm curious uh well it's greater than or equal to but it says what kind of loop is this and then the maximum number of candies okay so it has to be more than 15 but um well it's less than this is less than there's actually x is less than equal to you see that right there so so what happens here is this x actually less than or equal to 15 right so this variable has to be smaller see this right here this bracket means smaller than 15 right here because if it's otherwise if i want to be greater that means i have to do x greater than 15 right here right there that's kind of how that would be yeah yeah yeah it's hard sometimes you can mess up sometimes that's yeah it's hard to do that once though sometimes yeah no i don't know actually do you know i don't know i don't know actually okay awesome so let's go and continue on awesome so we got that one that's fun so we got ten nine six five four three two one which one is it one is it i got it i got this one i got this one right i got this one right this one right oh let's go hold on make that face again which one did you pick the blue one the blue water what'd you put i mean you're not far it's a while loop you know yeah [Laughter] so the reason guys why we have that it's a do while loop right and if you think about this it's not a while loop so while loop will actually have the while on this right here will actually be on the top so when if you do that then that's called a while loop okay hi everyone hi everyone good good so that's called the while loop so that's on the top right here you see that yeah but because we started with do we do say do and then while something's happening so while something is true so basically do this functionality while something right here is true well what can i say well something is true and the reason why it's 15 and not 16 is what do you think guys the reason why it's 15 not 16 is because it's very simple here think about this so it starts off with zero so x usually starts off with zero so we're going to start out with zero initially kind of like this right and then what's going to happen is we're going to what is it what do you think is x plus plus means i don't know so this means increment right this must increment so for example if we have if x is equal to one right now right is equal to one right now right if i do x plus plus it's gonna be equal to you tell me so so if i do x plus plus it's going to increment by one okay so three well one plus one [Laughter] so it's going to be two right here okay okay i know so i said you've done the value of x but you kind of have to assume that the value backs at this point is kind of zero basically that's pretty much it so that's going to be that so x plus plus and what's going to happen every single time we're going to income at that basically one you know that's going to be two then it's gonna be three then four and five and six and then we're going to what we're going to print it out you see that right there this x right here in the console log that's going to be printed out okay so basically it will say the number of candies is zero then the number of candies is one then two and then it's going to go all the way till 15 because when it's 15 it's going to say 15 here right and then it will increment to 16. okay you see but is 16 less than 15 no no so we'll actually exit this loop out of this loop it will say stop and i will i will not do this anymore that's it okay understand beautiful do you guys understand yes no it's actually it's 15 guys it was 15. all right so kennedy's is 15 not 16. okay trust me i know that bill i know i don't know i think i partially built this one anyways guys so okay let's see the scoreboard who we got here a lot of you guys pick 16 that's interesting alright next one oh come on i got you beginner i got you i got you all right next one all right hold on hold on i'm gonna get ready which student is a point to nasa today according to console log i got this okay let's see on duty sorry instructors now sorry okay i see it okay got it done i have no clue whatsoever what's going on yeah yeah so this one is a hard one you kind of have to follow you kind of have to follow this thing about this so what is structure is a pointer to to nas right so you can see we have instructors this is variable instructors is an object see this object and the variable on duty here is not sorry so it's going to go to here right and then see the appointed instructor the student for this is going to be march cohort which is also a variable which is this one yeah yeah you see that and then it's going to go to students which is this one okay go back to the answer so i can answer okay hold on go all right let's see go go go go what do you think remember how you had to remember how we had that zero one two thing i know did you pick it yep yeah the right answer all right you think you picked the right answer yes do you guys think she picked the right answer what do you guys think give me a thumbs up if you think she picked the right answer give me a thumbs down if you think she picked the wrong answer [Laughter] yeah i think be funny what i don't know all right you guys have 10 seconds left because i'm going to give you 10 seconds not i give i give you way too much time here all right it's going to be 10 9 8 7 6 4 3 2 1 and we're done and we are i'm playing i'm pressing skip right now skip skip skip skip skip skip skip boom nice hey let's go you got it right that's what i'm talking about beautiful and i got a ride too actually so i'm gonna do this next come on beginner's still there i'm watching you beginner don't worry i see you i see you very closely all right correct correct right but with the way who's beginner in the comments guys who is beginner here in the comments i'm very curious i'm very curious who is here who is the beginner one here i'm very curious with the beginner person here all right all right next one we have let's go quiz good what language will be logged got it word kunichiwa got it got it what do you guys think what do you guys think you picked it yes yeah yeah all right you guys i will give you guys about 20 seconds ready 20 19 18 17 16 fifteen fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten nine eight seven six hold on i'm gonna zoom in just for you guys so you can see it six five four three two one and i'm pressing on pressing on pressing i'm pressing i'm pressing pressing skip dawn it is japan oh damn she got it right dang it so let's let's talk about why that's the case right because i'm almost interested in explaining a little bit here right so let's think about why here again why because we're logging out something and we're calling the function say hello okay so guys so we'll have this function called say hello and this takes a parametrical greeting a parameter is like something you basically take a parameter you put into a function and so you can use that later on right basically i can pass in anything i want into this parameter you see what i mean a string a number whatever i want okay and then what's going to happen here is that this parameter then will look at this will be called another function of another call called get translation with that same parameter and so this is the function called cat translation and now this parameter biscuit just goes down the tree and is passed into here you see that okay and so now biscuit we have an if statement with an else if statement so if a word is hello return english if it's hollow dutch it is japanese said penis and what did we say that's funny actually when you said konichiwa you know how i know basic japanese oh yeah well that's how i figured it was japanese oh there you go so it's not program related language my knowledge of languages all right sure sure okay next one dammit this beginner guy is so good all right i'm coming up to you don't worry my friend alright so nas is right there but we have black dynamites coming up ariel's coming out i still don't see you on there yeah i'm like far behind because of the beginning yeah yeah yeah okay we have a well i think we have one more left guys do we one more left okay ready what answer makes victoria recursive function okay i got this uh got it done beginner coming from you i hope again everyone gets this one wrong you guys will have 20 seconds what do you think now do you know what do you know the recursive function no way a function a recursive function is a function that calls itself so it's like imagine like me putting a bottle inside another bottle yeah i was kind of looking at that or in the comments yeah so it's like it calls a function inside its own function basically and hopefully you guys can see that by the way right there go back to the answers there you go not lucky no [Laughter] i almost dropped the phone no you should pick something yes what'd you pick i'm not telling you right now since i have an answer dutch konichiwa konichiwa somebody said that's already in my mind beautiful well now let's put it to practice good good good good good good good good nice okay let's see let's see who won here let's see who won let's see let's see let's see let's see you know laugh at if beginner is kazi no cause this might not this should not be you he would do something like that he would do he would put himself uh he would do something like that i know it i i know it alright 10 seconds guys 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and skip you got it right holy damn she had an answer streak of three what something [Laughter] that's funny so look so let's think about this guys the reason why it's factorial right because what is factorial factorial is basically five times four times three times three times one right so you're multiplying the number below it okay now in coding if we want to basically call a recursive function we have to call ourselves right and so let's say i do something like this if i do something like this let's just say that i do something like n uh n times basically let me see get factorial toward real of n minus one right what's going to happen here is very simple basically we're gonna have five here let's just say we initially start up with five then we're gonna call ourselves again right which is gonna call n times get factorial you see that and so this is gonna be now four you see that so now this five this guy factor gets replaced by four times itself get it and then this gets replaced and then by three because we're also always subtracting one until basically uh zero and then when zero then we start just stop understand so that's really cool guys you guys understand yes or no nice beautiful beautiful beautiful yeah i know something something to add an exit case i think it's the beginning bd is a beginner it helps i feel like that's that's the beginner yeah i feel as a beginner yeah anyways that's kind of it that's pretty much it from from from that point of view so let's see let's see who won this round guys ready are you ready yeah you ready i really hope we can did not win let's see podium all right let's go third place comes from snp let's go smp second place comes so i think i won i think i won watches someone else oh yeah ariel's fifth black diamond is fourth let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful that's what i am talking about somebody said please do quit do the quiz again we'll do that next time guys that was fun did you like it yeah i did like it that was fun right i thought was fun yeah these quiz are pretty cool i mean i have another bigger quiz but we can do that another time guys that's pretty much it guys from us that's from me um so yeah let me know what you guys think how was it how was it yeah i liked it yeah you liked it you had a lot of fun yeah yeah yeah that's all that's a cool way to learn i feel i feel like yeah definitely yeah yeah so guys let me see what are some of the accounts you guys we have on here got three minus three it was all planned i mean beginner was always be second from the beginning let's go let's go let's see what else there's a yellow awesome guys you have any questions for me do you have any questions for me i think we're all good questions on here that's pretty much it guys um well this was fun this was me nas and victoria victoria it was a lot of fun with you guys we had a lot of fun with just you know playing some games and so forth like that we'll definitely be back with some more at some point and uh we'll test you out and make sure you guys are learning learning some good stuff okay um always guys we're doing this podcast just so you know always doing this podcast every single we're going to try to do everything every single day um here on clever programmer right if you have any topics you want us to go over let us know definitely we'll go over those topics okay just so you know and there's some specific you want us to cover let me know as well uh go ahead and tag me on instagram at nas dominsky and cleverkazy if you want to let us know about those topics as well other than that guys that's cute other than that guys it has been fun it's been really fun hope you guys had uh have a great day hope you guys have a have an amazing uh weekend weekend no this is sunday it's a sunday it's a sunday hope you guys have a great sunday i will see you guys in the next video let's go ready yeah let's go all right guys i'll see you later
