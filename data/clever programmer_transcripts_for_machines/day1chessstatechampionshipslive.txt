hey guys what's up so nobody's here in the live stream right now so uh this is my second live stream which is really cool but yesterday remember we got to the tournament the chess tournament but we didn't actually get to the actual location we just got here for the tournament I mean so we stayed at a hotel and today we're actually going to be going in hi tamle hi Angel hi Darth Vader Raj how you you doing sarth right and then Jinx yeah hi hi Shand deep hi am meet so wow you guys are coming in fairly quickly so today I'm actually at the event this is going to be the chess state championships I am again coaching the high school chess team and that's what I'm here for so um I'm going to start walking around a a little bit ooh we have a lot of people here today so you can see what's going on I'm going to take you guys actually inside and give you a sneak peek hi T hi hello from Dubai hi nice to see you I'm going to actually take you guys inside and show you what the room looks like there are a ton of people in there there are hi divish yeah I didn't want to miss next live video Perfect there are going to be about a thousand over thousands of people in that room that I'm I'm going to show you they're all high school students playing at the state chess championships but it is dead quiet there's not a single sound it's very quiet so when I go in there I won't be able to comment it okay and I apologize about that I won't be able to talk I'm not allowed to talk I actually um oops you know I am the coach of the Nils North High School chess team so I actually I definitely can't talk because then they're gonna actually penalized the team so how it works is that eight of our students from NES North are versing against eight other students so it's like our team versus another team and there are 149 teams in there playing and then if there are five total rounds and if they win um then we go on to the next round okay so I'm going to show you guys inside but I cannot talk right now we are going upstairs I'm taking you guys upstairs with me we're going to be actually going into the event check it out it's a pretty cool place I think it's just a random car in here which is kind of weird I used to play here I used to be actually I so we're taking a break from coding right this is a coding Channel this is about programming but um I I can't be doing that right now so I decided I should still make a video for you guys okay oops so lots of stuff going on here we're getting closer to the room okay we're getting closer to the room we're almost there okay well then I will call her and she she said right all right thank you yeah so am I for for that's our team for should pushing okay that was a little too much silence so we're going to get out of there we're going to go back downstairs so basically uh that was the the team that I was recording was actually my team the NS North High School team and they were they were all the ones in the purple jackets and so far everybody's game looked pretty even to me it looked like nobody was losing on our team team but again I have to you guys have to know like these games are crazy long for example um in chess you can win by Checkmate or running out of time or making somebody else run out of time so their time on each side is like 2 hours so that's a 4H hour long game for each kid and then I think they get an extra hour on top of that so these games can get very long but they're pretty smart so yeah they'll they'll play through it and then figure it out I'm going to go get some dipping dot ice cream okay what happened oo bad connection bad connection hi okay so for me it says bad connection oh um the name of this place I don't really know but I'm in Poria so if you look up ihsa Poria chess championships that's where I am at it keeps saying bad connection so I'm worried if it will disconnect I really hope it doesn't like last time um for some reason on my phone I can't see your guys' like messages I wish I could see that that would be cool Kaz you never thought to work in Google other big companies or have you tried no never really thought about okay so I wanted to do it right when I was studying and becoming really good and coding every day like 20 hours and then I would study all these algorithms data structures so I could actually apply but then in the end I ended up changing my mind I decided not to pursue the route of uh working for somebody I never really worked for somebody I always worked with clients that I would find on my my own did independent Consulting um generally was a lot of like independent contractor work that I've always uh been interested in doing and then I started building my own businesses off of that so I decided you know to go kind of entrepreneurial route and um you know I started my chess company called chess tastic so I was also doing some software development web development for that as well building things on my own so yeah um I had a dream of working in Google I thought that would have been cool then changed my mind but definitely if you guys want to do it definitely those are good places to join but always remember you know people always bring it down to Google or Dropbox those are not the only two places to work those are not the only places that will give you the most money so just remember that um really go somewhere where you enjoy um and it works out for you they're not only a few companies there are a bajillion people that need your help with software development and web development and whatever else right app development don't live telecast just leave ouch yeah well I kind of enjoy it but um I'll I'll be around today I'm going to be doing some chest stuff but later on it's going to get into more coding we might even build some stuff together but yeah I wanted to kind of check in and talk with you guys now there are a lot of people looking at me like I'm crazy so I'm actually going to get going in a second and then I'm probably going to do this again hi PE nice to meet you okay yeah I'm going to do that that's a good idea so I'm I am vlogging the event if you're on my Snapchat you'll see a lot of it and I will put it on uh for you guys afterwards okay I'll edit it and I'll put it on okay guys I got to go I'm the coach I got to help out the team so I'm going to cut it off here and I'll talk to you guys later okay guys thanks for coming in I'll catch you later bye
