yo what's up guys how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com and this is daniel i hope you guys are having a wonderful night morning whatever time it is whenever you are watching this whether you are live or watching a replay of this all right guys so we're going to be going over quite a lot of things we have a lot of stuff prepared for you so we're going to be reviewing some amazing react apps we're also going to be going over some hot projects on reddit regarding react which are super dope and then i want to share with you guys a few tips on how this one guy got 100 customers with a react app along with how to ace your interviews so we have a lot of things coming up for you guys but before we jump into that we do want to let you know something amazing and what is that daniel we have a special special project we've been working on and it's going to be dropping on friday yup and uh we're gonna be going on friday then rollman actually closes for this so this thing has currently dropped this is something that nas and i we the whole team we were like thinking about it and pretty randomly we decided to just turn it around make it happen so we don't know if we're going to do this again but we're definitely doing this right now so i want to show you guys this uh and we're running a threeday live react workshop the link is below if you guys want to click it and check it out but basically this react workshop is going to be three days long it's gonna be on zoom so we'll get to see each other and you'll get to ask any questions you have and on this zoom call over three days it's gonna be six to eight hours each day so it's gonna be super super intense and it's gonna be about 60 about 20 to 24 hours of training it doesn't get any better than that at all you're gonna be there with us with other people and that is really the type of environment that you need to be able to take your skill set with developing to the next level that's right so yeah we're going to be going pretty hard on this guys so um we're like i was talking with nas and i'm like dude we're going to lose our minds this has been one of my dreams to just wake up and start doing training from 9 00 a.m or to 6 p.m i've always wanted to run boot camp style training sessions and now that we get a chance to do that is honestly dude looks super super exciting for me and it says this is as intense as it gets for us for you for everyone that is going to be involved with this process that's why they call it a boot camp right this is oh sorry about that this is when you just take a short amount of time and you just go hard as yeah you know whatever it is we're developing a skill physical training whatever that may be in this case we're going to teach you react js and we're going to dive deep into that that's right yeah so this is um this is gonna be pretty intense so like make sure you know like bring water bring some type of food it's gonna be full day trainings back to back to back and we wanted to make it for you in a way where if you wanted to join the event and this is something really cool we're doing you can literally join the event for zero dollars all right and only if you love the training and you're blown away by it then do nothing and you'll automatically be charged okay if you didn't love the training and you're going to be charged in seven days so it's basically a seven day free trial all right if you didn't love the training then just send us an email and just will cancel it right away okay so if you came to the training didn't blow your mind cool just cancel it you're not gonna get charged anything but if you enjoyed it then it's just gonna send a charge okay and we're doing this just because like nowhere else are you gonna see this type of offer we just know for a fact the value you're gonna get from this workshop you're gonna be blown away it's gonna be 10 times more worth to you than whatever price point we've set up for it already but we just want to give you the extra encouragement to get in get started and get going which is why we created that offer just for you guys hey zacky taleb says hey bro i just joined the workshop but i can't get inside the group i got the order email but not the email verification one first of all zaki welcome and don't worry bro as long as you text me on that community message all right i'm gonna reach out to you and i will let you know how to get it okay so just make sure you send me a message on community you might have already done that actually so let's see i don't see you here yet so send me a message and you know we have already a bunch of students that are in here so these are a bunch of the students that are let me see oh can i focus yo let's go so we already got a bunch of students in so make sure send me shoot me a message and then we'll take care of it um hello hello everybody welcome this is live yes this is live love your headset color pumped for the boot camp awesome scissors says how much is the workshop yo the workshop is if you want to pay up front for it and prepay because we know we're going to blow your mind and this is going to be absolutely amazing it's 147 so it's like cheap as hell and if you do the free trial then it's zero and then it'll charge you 197 okay that's it so click the link below and it'll explain it to you how it works all right so with that said let's kind of jump into today and let's just bring you guys value while we're here so one thing i do want to say is we're going to be building an amazon clone in this workshop and we're going to be building out your we're going to be building it in a way where you can add it to your portfolio and we'll build your portfolio as well and we'll just give it to you straight up so so even for that the value of what you get out of this along with how much you learn is the portfolio with an amazing project for the portfolio which is probably enough to land you a job so let me ask you that 150 you pay up front or 200 if you wait for after is that worth landing your first job as a freelancer your first contractor or your first job as a software developer yeah so i mean that's that's a huge prop right like if you get these skills and you build these projects on your portfolio i know a lot of students have landed jobs because of this um so a few fun things that i want to go over with you guys so so dude check this out okay i saw this earlier today and uh this guy i mean somebody's like don't really i don't even know why people do this like this guy built um there's something cool you guys can do too you just go to reddit and go like pop in react.js and sort by like top this month so this guy apparently built a website in into a desktop environment so like this is his website and this is what it looks like oh snaps so basically just fold oh damn bro i don't i don't understand the point of it is but you know what i mean like what the hell's the point of this but it's cool so you can do random stuff like this with react dude old school games bro this is like doing dumb okay this is pretty cool i thought so you know those like lingo apps you probably use some of those apps right yeah duolingo or do you use duolingo i used to i have for i was trying to learn german man oh yeah and then that was tough and i was like oh i couldn't be consistent with it to be honest you got out of the dirt i got i went back to the clouds imagined learning it so yeah like look at this did this guy build would react i mean isn't that cool like this bubble how this just dude just something that always fascinated me when i was growing up personally yeah me personally when i was growing up yeah was just the animations and also when they came to like video games right like whenever you're going through some levels or whatever that was how did you interact with people and if they're part of whatever journey your character was going through like how did they know the script and how all that was just programmed and then when you got to like grand theft auto how the random people just did random stuff you know like that's all code you know yeah so when i see any kind of animation 3d 2d whatever it is i'm always impressed because i never really dug deep into that right but i did more of the coding of you know like the press this button do that not like actual animations moving in this direction because all that is is manipulation of pixels yeah and when you dig into it it gets pretty intense and it gets pretty crazy like there's it's a bunch of like um in college you don't have to take like a linear linear algebra like 3d matrixes that's what that really is when it comes to animations geez but just so many people have built on top of that yeah that they've made it easy yeah it's abs abstracted like even um alex becker recently is like building on coding games now it's kind of crazy yeah yeah like all his youtube content right now is like him building coding games it's insane that's crazy um somebody said the creative said cause you have registered but i can't seem to find the link to join your slack community also no link in my email um so don't worry we will fix that uh the creative if you've joined just make sure you shoot a text message to the community app and we will take care of you there okay um just let me know what your name is in community just shoot me a text once you shoot me a text i will personally send you the slack link so it works yeah i know i know um i built the amazon clone and got hella interviews yo that's what i'm talking about bro like if you build those clones you're gonna get so many opportunities is kind of insane if you uh tons and tons of students that came and built out those projects that we showed still to this day message me and they're like hey we got a job offer we got a job offer for this so definitely keep building those and keep putting them on your portfolio and this is why we're doing this workshop too so you can build it and put it put on your portfolio yeah and by the way out of curiosity man if you could let us know where you're able to get interviews whether that was just like freelancing projects that you got from upwork or whatever that is we'd be really interested man just because it's awesome hearing what projects like these are able to help people achieve sometimes wow aman says yokazi i've made my own application by putting together all the things i learned from your clones gonna host it today and test it with my dev team i hope it works well gonna send you the hosted link we are looking forward to seeing that link yo that is absolutely amazing bro proud of you that's awesome good work for sure man um so okay so let's check some out some of this stuff out sweat bubbles i mean if it sucks or we don't like it we can just move past it you know we don't have to talk about it we have to make sure we like it yeah this is cool right yeah for sure and i mean something this reminds me of was when i was in university yeah and i was developing ios applications very often you wanted to find these cool interactive things like for example something that i remember that was big was freaking nice in spotify i don't know if you remember but it was like a gallery view where you had the thing you swiped right and you saw like the the whole thing and what you like in what app uh spotify okay you see the album picture swipe right and then you see like this carousel carousel yeah just rotating that's what they called it and it was just some random dude who developed this thirdparty library like i ended up getting his library from get github to like use it in my app oh wow but then later i don't know like if um the swift or whatever the apple team ended up doing that same library or just made their own yeah but that became like a standard feature like they brought it into the ui kit and i was like dude like this guy created his own thing again doing the animation stuff and then it became my thing yeah dude they just blew up dude like everyone's like oh my god the carousel thing that's freaking sick man are you using that that's sick so i didn't know you were doing frontend stuff too at some point or playing i i played a lot front end when i was doing mobile development so i did a lot for ios and android stuff got it yeah that was that was fun that's pretty dope uh this one i thought was kind of funny this guy says i made a ridiculous react app to create corporate culture and indoctrinate your employees and he basically says your employees aren't gonna brainwash themselves and um basically you just put in like a random word right so like you put in success and then it says get cultured and then like it creates like a thing out of success standing is a wreck sitting you saw that yeah yeah it creates it's uh culture yeah what are those things called like the principles that it just says random at the top bottom i love that what principles of what um like a business like you know how amazon has their like for example blue origin had their 12 leadership principles right yeah which was like damn i'm really forgetting them bro um delivering excellence um damn bro i'm liking that but like for amazon it was like prioritizing customers yeah being frugal yeah and specifically yeah yeah i know those values yeah the values that's what yeah i know yeah whatever that was oh only setups dude so guys check this out this is like only fans but for pictures of desk setup so don't tell anybody that you're on here it's definitely an sfw but check it out dude i'm pretty sure people would pay for this bro yeah imagine like i have a five dollar a month subscription and it's like under uh under like an anonymous name oh that one's cool dude just like corporate llc it's like hey what is this for don't worry about it babe this one actually seems pretty cool like uh this actually i'm i wanted to look into it because sometimes when you're doing transformations and a lot of things with react you want to see visually what is happening so like for example when you're doing stuff like this right you're taking an input and you're mapping and filtering and reducing it whatever the you get to actually see a visual playground that is sick man see what i'm saying yeah so like those functions you can actually see what they're doing and you're like oh map is mapping it and filter is i mean you know filter so like i mean what i'm imagining it's doing here is like getting the even numbers right yeah mapping is probably just like here just taking the number and adding one to it and then this is filtering it and reduce is always a complicated one but if you learn how to write reduced you can write these really sophisticated oneliners which allow you to have those you know those like for loops we're doing incremental value and then like so it's like it just lets you write that in one line it's super simple i know exactly what i mean dan bro this is just throwing back to a bunch of projects this reminds me of a cool project that i worked on with a couple friends we had to create a context flow diagram or cfg i forgot what that means exactly yeah but what that looks like is thursday there's traps for the devs oh this is already said we keep going unless then yeah and if you look at any piece of code yeah it always has a specific flow yeah so what i mean by that is you know the first block is just setting up all your variables or whatever that is it has to go through all of those lines but then let's say it hits line 10 that hits an if statement yeah sometimes it's going to go into the if other times it's going to go into the else yeah so what this does is this creates a graph where you say like all right lines one through nine or have to get hit but the minute hits line 10 it could go to 10 through 13 which could be like the if statement or it could go through 14 through 16 which is the else statement so it starts to create this graph right the code it shows you these are all the different paths you can take for example if you have a for loop there's going to be some place where you could go back to a certain specific line right or if it's like uh if else what's the point of this so this basically maps out your code like all the different possible paths that your code can take okay so what application yeah that's what i was going to ask like what's the actual application of your use case of this are you trying to like reduce the complexity by reducing the number of pads or like if you see a certain number of pads you're like whoa this is way too complex we need to so you could create a visual similar similar to this where you see the graph but i think more importantly a good thing for this could be when you're testing right yeah when you're testing your software you want to make sure you get all the branches oh my gosh all those if statements right yeah so if you run a test that covers the entire graph you know that you have a hundred percent coverage uh if it doesn't cover the entire graph you could really start this so you can kind of visually see what yours exactly got it exactly sick but it's cool because you just give it what we have to do is he we gave it like a code that was just thousands of lines if you guys have any questions by the way keep dropping them in chat we'll definitely take your questions and we'll try to answer them while we're on here as well for sure and it was just crazy man like you just threw a thousand line like project of code and had to map out this big ass thing with just all these circles and all these graphs of what it would look like damn exactly says sounds like a debugging tool yeah yeah it could definitely be leveraged for that or for fun you know if you're weird you just want the challenge you're like let's do it yeah um awesome so let's go here boom my okay my first big react project that's a pretty cool project by the way to work on if you guys have a project like this on your portfolio this is definitely something that can land you a job so what i recommend is if you're finding hot trends on reddit it's a good sign because people it shows you that people are caring about this and this looks good and has a lot of user functionality you can actually use this to build out a project hey thank you so much for the twenty 20 donation whoa yo that's sick hey oh thank you so much really really really appreciate you josh paul he says thanks for the videos i'm a professional developer feeling motivated to share my knowledge online after watching your videos to start a youtube channel hopefully i will stop procrastinating and start acting keep motivating let me correct that right now hopefully or will you actually do it um i'll tell you this today i felt like absolute okay that's what i'll tell you today was a extremely tough day my brain was running at all 97 processing power capacity by 12 p.m or 1 p.m i was working from 7 00 am to like 1 p.m just exhausted nauseous hungry didn't eat there were a lot of tough problems that we had to tackle and i just didn't feel good then i took a little walk went on a break hung out with nas and then came back three or four p.m and uh i sat down to talk with daniel uh right here and uh nas and i didn't want to do anything bro all i wanted to do was just go to sleep or relax take a break i promise you the last thing i wanted to do was work my ass off for the rest of the day and jump on this youtube live stream and do a live stream um this was the opposite of what i had wanted to do but now that we're actually doing it this feels so much better than the alternative of just not doing anything and i know that once today is over i'm gonna be even more proud of the fact that like i did this and that we did this so what i'll say is look you donated to me and you donated to this channel i appreciate that but what i will appreciate a lot more is you actually taking action okay so no hopefully brother i want you to do it and i want you to make a commitment while you're here on this youtube what you're gonna do if you can do something today take a 15 minutes out today and shoot a video with your phone horizontally like sideways right like you have 10 or 15 minutes so what can you do today that anchors that commitment and that would be the best way you can thank me i'll tell you that right now and what's crazy is maybe hearing quasi see that right now you're going to feel that spark motivation and there's something in the head in your head that's gonna tell you oh like tomorrow or another day but just trust me dude that motivation is gonna be gone tomorrow that motivation is gonna be gone in the week in two weeks whenever you think it's gonna happen so right now man just pull out your phone start filming whatever it is it doesn't have to be perfect it just has to get done that's right bro just get it done all right so that is that now another thing that i found super um another thing i found amazing is this okay so this guy goes i seriously love react plus jam stack approach went from knowing zero programming to launching my own web business in less than a year just got my first 100 paying customers and really proud and happy that i did this i just wanted to share i spent 10 years in a career of branding slash advertising and went from knowing no programming to launching my first product in a year i know a lot of folks here probably experienced this but for me this was quite a huge undertaking so i went to it and here is a stack that he used okay so i'll show you the app first so here's the app focus and structure to get work done a task manager like no other this is i like this part over here so it's you see how it says give me focus yeah and when i hover over it that's good right that is good um and basically it's like a task list but just you know looks better and has some uh some fun functionality to it can't spell functionality a tough one uh here's a stack that he used so this is i think something valuable for you guys where you can check out his website and then also see the stack that he used so he's using javascript and react for the ui he's using custom css with a little bit of bootstrap i mean i recommend you can use material ui for most of what you're doing he's using animate css for his animation so let's see if he has where are his animation so let's go to his page so i'm not sure what he's using it for animate that css maybe maybe these gifs are animated it could also just be the animation of when you hover over the button that's true okay i don't know how deep his animations are so dude like this is so sick man like he did this probably he's like oh man like i'd probably use this you know yeah he's like i'm gonna develop this and then i'm just gonna put it out there and like you got customers that's crazy yeah dude like even that bro like if you got 100 customers at four dollars 400 a month you know it's just like that extra it's like dude you're able to create an amazing product from nothing from just an idea and hard work and blood and sweat and tears sometimes that's kind of insane dude that was one of the things that took me to programming it was just the you're limited by your imagination at some point you know it's like how far do you want to take something what do you want to build how do you want to do that yo we just got a bunch of new students in the program so we got bmu we got jubble we got tesla developer we got zaki talib um andy we got uh wise mickey thai santos sky dialia and rdev i just want to say thank you guys oops i just want to say thank you guys so much for joining the program and joining the live workshop that we've put together if you guys are joining the workshop just drop a comment and then just say like something like react is lit all right react if you have already joined the workshop and jumped in then say react is lit so we can actually see that you're in i'm gonna give you a shout out dude can we oh brian kim what's up brother he's in uh youtube masters academy right let's go brian we're out here grinding over here brian what you see is the youtube analytics all right this is what you're looking at right over here where my finger is pointing when that drops that mean on this live stream people are losing attention and not not watching the stream anymore when it goes up is a great sign so for example i'm going to move this screen so you can see that we had a little dip and then we made it go up all right i watched this constantly to see what type of retention we have if we're losing the people boom we're gonna get it lit so zaki says react is lit that means jackie joined vishnu says um another one another thing i want you guys to say so just as clear for everybody else is just be like yo um i joined the workshop okay i joined the react workshop because that helps everybody else know what you did but thank you so much vishnu for joining startup for joining tech comparison for joining rohit for joining irish for joining it's crazy right ashley alex thank you for joining suresh i appreciate you for joining smith i appreciate you for joining tomorrow the enrollment for this threeday workshop that we're doing closes all right tomorrow midnight it closes and then that's it i don't know when we're gonna do this again it's 24 hours of training it's absolutely stupid for me and us to do this but we just thought it would be so much fun so we decided to just make it so it's like pretty much free the cost of it is next to nothing i mean really people charge four to five thousand dollars for these workshops so we wanted to make it so price is no barrier but it allows us to see you're serious you're willing to put your money where your mouth is and then boom we can just get the money out of the way so we can focus on what's important actually helping you build your career all right and we want to make sure the community is high quality muhammad says i joined awesome syrup says i have completed amazon clone airbnb clone spotify youtube clone slack clone netflix clone from your channel and got an internship thank you so much let's go gang bro dude these projects are real man no one else is doing this kind of stuff out there you're gonna learn so much you're gonna build amazing things it's gonna attract a lot of eyeballs but you gotta put in the work link is in description so somebody just asked me what's his name somebody just asked me hey how do i join this link is in description if you guys want to join and the page looks like this all right so this is the page you go to this page and um you can watch this video if you want and then click there to get the ticket all right and then you can get the ticket december 18th guys this friday at 10 a.m pacific time it's a live workshop and that's when it starts and it goes through sunday yo gabriel what's up bro thank you so much for the five dollar donation dude we gotta be doing this every day what are we doing oh just taking donations i'm curious cozy gabriel drop your phone number somehow oh snaps hold on gabriel shoot me a text at maybe we can give him my number the community number yes sir sir so gabriel text me at uh this number okay yes sir text me at this number and let me know it's you bro and i'm gonna give you a call and then we're gonna go on youtube live okay so some of you guys i want to take you on youtube live and have a chat with daniel and i let's go is there anything that we could do right now to sweeten up the offer for those who are ready to commit and pay the 150 upfront for the workshop mathias says i'll give you five thousand dollars if you teach me the program in three weeks mathias you don't have to pay me five thousand dollars if you come to this workshop you'll learn how to learn to program in three days bro days we're just going eight hours so everybody that's there is gonna be on a zoom call i'm gonna be talking to every single person there's not a single person that won't interact with me i'm psychotic with this like i'm gonna be there i might be there till 10 p.m i love this so that's why i'm like so excited i really really want you guys to join you know i want to interact with you and work with you yes it's com even if you're a complete beginner this is phenomenal for you this is yeah this live is real amazing sometimes it just it's too good to be true man it looks like a recording were we able to get uh who we looking for again oh i lost it it's all good lost what i was looking for was it ben benjamin i forgot who are you trying to get but yeah guys this workshop we've never done this before in the history of clever programmer nas and qazi we're just brainstorming we had already thought about it before but they were able to just kind of solidify this and put this together and it's going to be absolutely insane i really can't even talk about like the value that they're going to get a weekend workshop like this it's going to be fun man i'm so excited fun it's going to be insane it's just going to be robert miller says just found out about your channel a few weeks ago confused if i should go to college or do something else leaving the army in a few weeks robert i would love to get on a call with you if you want to chat i popped in my phone number up top so let me see if i can find it again uh shoot me a message here robert and let's get on a call or if you're not scared just drop your number in here robert and i'll call you right now bluetooth yeah let's see here oh snaps trying to reach out to people yeah so i would love to get on a call with you but what i will say is this workshop it i i think would be your best bet for jumping into and learning how to code you're gonna leave with skill like you're gonna learn the beginner stuff you're gonna build an actual project you can use you will be fully immersed in it for three days straight and you will have your answer if coding is for you or not you're gonna be kind of blown away by it so this is we're gonna be going all in it's going to be the best workshop on react that anybody's ever hosted because we don't hold back so it's going to be a ton of fun and i think something huge that qazi said there is in this weekend you're going to see if programming is cut out for you or if you're cut out for programming because to be honest it just might not be for you if you haven't you know gotten really deep into it so it probably wouldn't be worth getting a whole degree if it's not for you so you dive in this weekend go hard learn as much as possible we're going to tailor it for people who have never programmed before to go and get all literally as technically deep as you need to to learn these things you're going to know exactly what the next steps are going to be for you after that yep that's right i just tuned in preston haley says just this workshop is meant for true beginner programmers absolutely yes what exactly is new in this from last fiveday amazon challenge so rxbo a few things that are new one is it's going to be on a zoom call so we're going to be building this live together and you're going to be working with other people in those facebook lives you can interact with me nas and the whole community you'll be able to interact with everybody two on day three we're going to be announcing the opening of our clever programmer coding boot camp this will be a 12 month coding boot camp with four immersive retreats this is going to be the first place we're gonna be announcing it and so you'll be the first one to find out about that as well on day three we're excited for that dude i'm excited as well bro uh workshop link guys is i just popped up the screen you can read it at the top all right top right there and also it's in the description below in uh linked in this youtube video here are some other projects now one thing i want to go into is would you guys like to learn how you can ace your interviews as a react.js developer or just a web developer in general hell yeah you guys want to know hell yeah all right so this is something really valuable that i found that i wanted to share with you guys um advice on how to ace your react.js interview all right and this is with from a hiring manager so i'm a frontend manager at a large bank here in new york city and i thought i'd share some advice on how to ace front end react interviews i am putting in react i'm putting react.js in quotes because we all know the most competitive jobs don't just look at your react.js skills for some reason i'm not allowed to tell hr to give you a study list i personally don't care that you specifically study the areas that i list out because if you can come from nothing and study these topics to the point of passing the interview then yeah you're probably darn well good enough to work here without further ado let's go one never just react js love it or hate it knowing react itself is never enough so what he says is sharpen your vanilla javascript skills so this is something that i actually agree quite a bit on where he says everyone is looking for framework agnostic candidates that can actually be successful in multiple paradigms and can code across different frameworks do you find this to be true like as a as a good skill for developers to be framework agnostic and why is that i totally agree with that 100 and the reason is because great developers just understand the just they're really good developers and what i mean by that is they understand that a computer is just a machine that reads line by line by line like unless you're doing async or multithreading uh programming but for front end that's mostly what it is unless you throw in some async but you can then now manipulate the computer to do whatever you want it to do doesn't matter whether it's you know react angular because the thing is those things are gonna get outdated at some point in life yeah you know five years ten years i don't know how long long it's gonna be but there's gonna be the new ui framework who knows it might be like some vr slash ui web i don't know what that's going to look like but it's going to be replaced so if you're just a great programmer in general you understand programming principles programming fundamentals and how things work then you could easily adapt and that is what is a huge key here that's it so that's i agree with that bro like i actually think that it's really important for people who are good at being a developer i think they should just be good at problem solving in general i've found myself constantly picking up any new language or any new framework and i get really good at it really fast because i just have really solid problem solving skills and i feel that i can go over to anything and kind of get good at it you know so i agree that that's probably not the most important thing for sure and i think in terms of the problem solving skills for some people sometimes when it comes to programming that's just not natural it feels like they really have to work at that but the thing is it's a skill it's something you can work on it's something you could develop you just have to put in the time you have to put into practice you have to keep challenging yourself and as you develop these problemsolving skills things are going to come a lot quicker things are going to come a lot easier you're going to have a lot of reference experience from your back or from your past yeah so that you could just do it again just without even skills yeah so what was super cool i just saw right now we got five more students that actually just joined that is so sick i'm so excited this workshop is going to be amazing guys i by the way there are no replays i just want to say there are no replays for this workshop so it's three days if you get to join you get to join and watch it live if you miss it you missed it okay so just want to let you guys know that so show up get as much value as you can please come yes yes if you can figure it out please please please please jump in and it's going to be better because if you're there live you're going to get that interaction right if you just try to watch the replays it's just going to be like watching a tutorial building a cool clone i mean you get to build it but you miss out on being able to network with people you miss out on being there and being able to ask your specific questions so top up dev asks is it free it's not free it's a paid workshop it does have a free trial just to protect you if you do that free trial and you sign up by paying zero dollars up front seven days later if you took the workshop and you didn't like it in between those seven days you can cancel any time and not get charged anything at all okay we'll just give you an email you send an email there that's it done if you loved it and you're like this was freaking awesome and it changed my life and i have a portfolio and a project i then just do nothing and it'll automatically charge you okay so we have a free trial but it is a paid workshop and top of dev you know like how i already said earlier in the slide i don't know if you missed it but for the payment of either 150 or 400 200 if you're able to get a portfolio from that if you're able to get an amazing clone from that if you're able to learn all the skills and you get a job from this yeah is it worth 200 to you the answer is obviously hell yeah bro like without a doubt yeah so enjoy it yup free trial um ishaan says i'm going to just join your course to watch you nice welcome we would love to have you and once you're in then definitely come and comment below i just joined the react.js workshop make sure you comment that below right here all right and if you join from here i would be happy to do a oneonone call dude i think i think that'd be freaking sick dude yeah so if you if you join on this call and you let us know that you came from here from this youtube live stream um we can actually set up a oneonone call like a strategy session for 30 minutes and we can plan out your next 12 months as a developer and exactly what you need to do to get to 100 000 a year mark it might take you six months or 12 months to accomplish this roadmap but i can get on this call and give you the roadmap so like personally designed for you whether you're your i.t job you currently have no job and you're unemployed maybe you currently have a job where you're making 40 or 50 000 trying to figure out how to get past a sixfigure mark so we can get on that call and we can come up with that strategy i would love to do that with you is it for either option the free trial or the pay or is it just for a specific like if they pay up front then i think let's do a few prepay okay i like that right if you if you uh if you prepay i think it's better for you because you're going to love the workshop anyway so you'll save 50 bucks uh if you so if you pay up front and then i would be happy to schedule a call with you guys and and again the reason why this workshop is a paid one is because those who pay pay attention guys if you just show up and you think it's free you're not gonna take it serious but if you put some skin in the game you invest into yourself whether it's a course a workshop hey chirok says trunk just joined let's go let's go that's sick call times are 10 a.m all right 10 a.m pacific every day friday saturday sunday ishaan says i'm literally shaking that my inspiration said my name that's awesome i love it um okay dope so yes the the call will be live yup yup yup yup live all right so let's go through more of this because i think it's really helpful so second he says know your html so he says if you don't know basic things like you're not using before or after then those are like common red flags so know how html works because jsx even with the rea right when you're writing react you're writing html just like jsx it's still html under the hood it just lets you write it in a way you know where it's like kind of nicer so make sure you know that really really well for sure yeah that'd be like if you didn't that'd be like if you were a basketball player that didn't know how to dribble and get up and down the court like you could shoot but like you can't move unless someone passes it to you and you're basically you don't have those fundamentals right right so get those fundamentals right uh number three he says know your css he goes even if you suck at coding challenges or you suck at hacker rank or lead code and you fail the algorithm round he goes i will still fight for your hire if you really shine through in your css and he goes those css things like absolute positioning or flexbox or basic transformations box models z indexes they are really important for you to know and how they behave in context with each other so if you know those things and you know those subtleties he will pick you even over somebody who knows algorithms inside out and that's huge man the reason being in this world in this day and age ux the user experience is literally above almost i mean obviously there's got to be some functionality but it's up there in the top because no one's going to show up to your website if it's like some crummy old 1990s lots of flashing lights type of website you know what i mean yeah it's got to be something that's nice that's attractive you know like think robin hood i think this awesome llama focus app that we just opened up oh yeah that's just like very clean very nice you know like if this was the thing like the 90s early 2000s website no one would use this man this website is beautiful it's got emojis i'm proud of this guy man oh he's got 100 100 customers how long ago was that post you think he's probably got more now i mean because of that post i went up and i signed up the free account free account so it's pretty dope yo preston preston just said preston just joined let's go what's up preston preston i would love to bring you on this youtube live stream i'd love to bring on we're trying to bring on people who just joined and no one's responding back what's going on here guys yeah

and that'd be sick as dude we need to shake how about this after this live let's just write some lines and like drop like a short short 15 second thing do you guys want to see some raps on some react reaction hooks yeah components yeah like what what uh let us know like what type of technology you want in there like you want firebase in their app api react choose the technology and then we can actually like rap it out we can even do like a battle like you can be react and i can be angular you know and then we can do like a rap battle dude ah that's come on this guy says my aunt auntie got a job because of you that's i don't believe that dude you're both gen z says qazi there's something wrong with the workshop page there's no css robert miller says i come from a technical background but not a coding background used to be a signal intelligence analyst would coding fit me robert well it depends like have you ever coded before at all does it interest you at all one thing i can tell you is there are there's a wide range of people that i have taught and worked in code like to teach them coding i'm not here to convince you that coding is for you okay but i've seen a wide range of people do coding and get into coding from somebody who's a truck driver from somebody who's really good at chess from somebody who's an electrical engineer wants to learn more coding there are people from all walks of life from doctors trying to learn coding so they can solve health problems from scientists trying to learn coding so they can figure out what's happening on different planets and understand how to take data from mars and calculate with it from people who want to become developers and make apps like facebook or instagram um so yeah there's like many many different ways people come about it and people enjoy coding so all i can tell you is if those people have found have been able to enjoy coding i think that if you give it a chance i think you would really really enjoy it and one thing i just want to let you know is most people think that they won't be able to understand coding or somehow get it that's not true that's mostly just because like the people who taught it to you didn't know how to teach it properly or just over complicated the hell out of it if somebody explains it to you in the right way you can like start picking it up and start doing things in as little as one day and it's crazy robert you're really not gonna know whether it's for you or not until you get in there you get dirty with it you start to code i mean like how cos you just said i remember the first time i came across coding was in high school and my teacher sucked like my teacher would just show up and be like hey yeah read the lessons go do your little coding project and turn it in and it was so not enjoyable that i literally hated coding with the passion i was like screw this like i left after just one semester i didn't finish the whole year but later in college i was originally an electrical engineering path and i finished like all my lower courses and i took one programming class and that kind of reignited the interest i'm calling preston hopefully he picks up hello how are you doing yo what's up preston how you doing man i'm so glad right before bed i just hopped on youtube randomly and your video was the first one to pop up on my feed yeah it's just i guess the stars just kind of aligned because i can kind of talk to you about what i'm literally doing right now in my job and this fits perfectly i mean i couldn't ask for something better dude that is amazing we just want to say i have bo i have a daniel with me on here i just want to say congratulations for jumping into the react.js workshop and thanks so much for being on this live brother no problem man not a problem yeah man so like it just kind of worked out perfect because uh i'm off for 18 days starting on the 18th nice i have all three days free and just you know i've been in it now for about 13 14 years i work at a oil major company and i'm actually a lead on a project for service now nice for operations management and so while i'm not a developer on the team i'm actually what's called a track lead what's the company called by the way excellent oh excel mobile exxonmobil let's go preston and so i'm a product owner you're familiar with like agile terminologies i'm a product owner for something called itsm which is like their ticketing system got it and so um we're switching the service now and um learning javascript learning react that would i'm on a project right now that's going to wrap in a year and the more technical i can get i it almost guarantees me that i'll be a valuable employee literally for the next three or four years just having that skill in and of itself and so what skill is that like technical react skills specifically react skills and javascript skills overall honestly just having the ability to communicate effectively and be like a leader and also be technical that's the most valued person that you can be so what is that worth to you right so for example if you say you can stay if you learn that skill this year and then you can actually have that job for the next three to four years what's the monetary gain that you're potentially looking at over the next three to four years um salary i'd probably say an extra 35 to 55 000. wow extra which would to your total company yeah over at and so i mean at that point because how you're paid it's it's comp it looks like a whole formula but i mean basically you're looking at if you're making say a hundred thousand you're going from 100 to 150 or if you're already making 150 you're going from 150 to 200. and do you mind me asking you how much are you making currently at this job uh north of 115. there you go so so with learning a huge thing so learning these skills might be able to take you from making 115k or 120k a year to potentially 150k or more or more and as a matter of fact i'm inclined to say more because if you have those communication skills yeah now i'll be able to talk to an entire different audience of architects and process owners and have those indepth conversations where right now i may shy away from that because i can't have that kind of conversation and so it's not just the monetary gain it's like literally you can be in a role that i wouldn't have qualified for before that is massive and i think something huge that you talked about their preston is you're starting to think long term right sometimes people just think like in talking in terms of monetary sometimes people just think like oh i have to pay i don't know maybe twenty thousand dollars for this boot camp and i get a job that's like i don't know maybe eighty thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars for the year but they don't think like you like three years five years those things add up if you have a sixfigure job for five years that adds up beyond if you're able to get a 30 on that 50 increase on that for the next three to five years those things add up and that's just the monetary like you said even more the skill that you get from that the teams are gonna get to collaborate with the opportunities that you're gonna get just snowball effect into allowing you to be in an amazing position in five years exactly and and i will say to you that most people in my position right because i'm 41 i don't even count anymore 41 42. yeah so most people that are my age right they would not they would think about trying to get this knowledge a completely different way they would be shelling out two three four thousand dollars probably going to a camp for a week having the company reimburse them and a lot of people just don't even realize that these kind of resources are available and basically you're offering this value at a fraction of that cost um it'll show me like you said it's going to show me whether this is something that i should pursue further which i already know that it is yeah um and it's something that i can start literally like in two days i mean it's a nobrainer that's amazing dude i'm so excited to see you on the call on friday and work with you friday saturday sunday i know nas would be so pumped as well just tell me how long have you been following uh clever programmer i think i first subscribed and noticed you guys or gotten you know uh saw you guys were about four months ago yeah i think i have some i feel like i remember your name in our live streams i used to see you pop up unless i'm mistaken no you're not mistaken i wasn't super active yeah because i will say like youtube is my primary media consumption so i subscribe to somewhere in the north of like 800 to a thousand channels wow so like my youtube feed is insane but i do it on purpose so that it's kind of surprising but your channel has won for the last few months where i i kind of make it a point to check in weekly or every other week why is that and so because the way that my career has kind of been going i know i need to change and just the way you guys talk it and focus on execution there's no fluff yeah so i you know what i mean you have to promote yourself which i understand but you're really just about learning and being able to execute on the knowledge you have as quickly as possible yeah and you just because no thrill that you just get right to it and you're relatable and so when i see those kind of things i just jump awesome thank you man i appreciate that and last question preston for somebody who's on the fence thinking about joining this workshop but maybe they're just like on the fence would you recommend to them or like what would you say to them to join this workshop what i should say is that something i struggled with when i was early like a lot of people on the call may be a teen maybe in their 20s 30s i mean i've been there and a lot of times learning something like this learning a new skill it may be intimidating right and that that intimidation will hold you back and let me just put it to you guys that are younger as a person that's kind of midcareer i regret every single time i let something that might be somewhat intimidating hold me back and it is always better to take the leap and learn than to regret wow and if you have someone like you guys that are that are offering something that's it's so valuable for such a small price it's it's not worth taking the risk of not doing it yeah you might as well it's only upside wow dude that is deep and powerful man then preston we really appreciate you opening up man like being that vulnerable but if that's your truth that you're speaking man i applaud you for like going on live and speaking at you that is so amazing you're such an amazing human being brother thank you man thank you you guys are the amazing ones thank you for offering this service and uh i'll be there man i have to look i got that email the followup email i'm going to take the following actions see everything i need to do to get prepped for the session and i'm super excited awesome so yeah in there now that you're in the workshop make sure you make a short video doesn't have to be more than like 30 seconds to one minute long and like why you joined this workshop so some of the things you even told us today here you can say some of those things but yeah drop that in the slack channel so that other people can get to meet you and know who you are so me and nas can see who you are and then on friday we're just going to get rocking and rolling okay brother awesome man and anyone wants to follow me i'm on linkedin preston haley prestonhaley for anyone that's you know trying to get into a technical career or just you know wants to kind of expand their network i'd be happy to chat with anybody awesome feel free to drop that in youtube chat as well so people can see it okay certainly thank you guys take care bye bye guys you're going to be networking with people like preston you're going to be networking and getting to work with people that are just as awesome as preston you know he already works at exxon mobil like he said you know if you want to get into technical career hit them up that's the type of people you're going to meet in this workshop so if you're like still thinking about whether it's worth the value or not i'm going to ask you again 200 is that worth getting in front of the right person that can help you to land a job in the technical field is that worth getting not getting noticed by a recruiter who can hire you into a sixfigure developer job that's right dude that was fun dude that was so depressing hell yeah dude that was really cool i want to talk with more people on these calls um she won oh okay never mind i'm gonna read somebody's message but uh how many more how many more have joined since um i want to see so i think this thing takes a second to update okay but i know that a couple of people joined oh yes so we'll see this thing update or maybe nobody joined maybe i'm just making it maybe nobody likes us man we'll see something uh but yeah that was really fun to be able to talk to somebody i want to definitely do a lot more of that if you guys like that and if you guys enjoyed the conversation with preston drop some love in the comments below and let us know because we want to see that you enjoyed it if you enjoyed it then we want to keep doing more of those things if you don't like it then we want to pivot and do something else so let us know did you enjoy it and if you did smash that like button so this video goes out there don't just sit here and do nothing smash that like button subscribe to the channel if you haven't already so this video can go out and this channel can grow all right i call this conditional love once you do that you get my love oh i already did it that's what i get cause he's love awesome definitely react yes is good for any back end um i mean react.js is not that much back end it's mostly front end but yeah you can use react.js and firebase and things like that and then make it work there's some other couple of cool projects here as well that i want to go over and guys tomorrow just want to let you guys know tomorrow the enrollment closes so take advantage jump in the program the link is in the description below and you guys heard preston take the chance jump in and let's keep going over some of this stuff and i want to see if something catches my eye and i want to share it with you guys uh i made it reactive it's like twitter but with your own handwriting okay oh dude what the what the bro dude which one together with my brother how cool would be like if your brother coded you guys both coded a problem why don't we code something dude we should code something bro just for fun like just for shits and giggles like the llama application dude like he did it for his phone probably some sort of productivity thing you know yeah that'd be really cool nas is down for sure yeah like just some fun project right like imagine that we get kyle to record us and we just spend eight hours and let's just see what we do whole little hackathon yeah like a hackathon all right dude i'm down for that that'd be sick right let's go nas sneeze if you could hear us we just thought about it nas and we're like [Laughter] we just came up with a random idea and we said how about if we do you know i was like yo let's just sit together one day just code for like seven eight hours and he's like oh dope and he's like now nas would be down for that and then we thought yo what if we just got together and he came up with the idea of like hackathon which is in a hackathon kyle recorded it and then he vlogged it and we put it up on youtube would you be down yeah all right in the back grinding away at the workshop training so he's going to be up today until 2 or 3 a.m tomorrow is probably also going to be up until 2 or 3 a.m and uh i'm gonna work with him right after this live on the actual training material he's right here what's up guys so what are you working on right now now i'm working actually on the amazon clone i'm making making sure that it looks amazing and that you guys have a project where you will learn so much and not only that that will also attract a lot both of you need to be a lot closer to the mic what a lot more potential though a project that will attract a lot of potential jobs how does that sound really good good good all right and making sure that you guys have homework and that everything is prepared making sure that you guys have homework and that everything's prepared for you to completely complete this project guys i'm so pumped you have no idea there you go there you go guys so that's what we're working on he's going crazy at it and i'm going to join him i have a lot of monsters so after this live stream i'm gonna be working with him on this as well we might even give sneak peeks what if we like start learning like react live and coding up you know what i mean dude i think it'd be dope if we look stupid in front of people so they realize that's not and they don't have that like fear of looking stupid that's what i'm saying yeah let's dude we got two hours let's that would be fun right yeah that'd be dope i don't know would you guys like to see that you guys like to see us struggle yeah mega cars for us uh siddhar says how high are you guys i was going to come up with something clever but that didn't happen clever programmer clever node.js and firebase are the same thing no is the workshop free no hey gosh yo that emoji is funny dude a little dab i love that hey we just got 25 php yo php the programming language yeah we got 25 of it let's go thank you so much let's see if anybody else messaged us yo if you guys joined hit us up on the community we want to do a live call with you guys right now because it would be awesome to talk to you guys get to know you guys see why it is that you guys want to do this workshop because it's going to be absolutely lifechanging if you do it for the weekend three days guys it's gonna be awesome i didn't know christina was on our community platform i do she's like is it for web developers what if she joins some dancers now as well oh my god yeah that'd be cool we're closing everybody bro we got you know it's just like i don't know like how dope would it be i was thinking today and like i was talking with students today uh from pwj how is this you just turned it down no i turned my off because you're sometimes too loud okay yeah just wonder like how dope is it that you can put so much so many hours of work in like in three days and have a fully complete crazy project this was normally like literally i was thinking of second students this would normally take you days weeks months sometimes to do right but the cool thing of like sitting down and just focusing nonstop for three days to complete something epic that could potentially change your life like that to me is so exciting guys like because in the day if you do focus and just challenge yourself it's like think of this as this it's literally like a challenge to you it's like a challenge for yourself can you do it in three days i know you can and you will because we're gonna be there to support you but the best part is literally just finishing something in three days and then you can you will have it for a lifetime that to me is dope anyways guys i'm gonna get back have a great day i'll see you guys later love you byebye that was nice that was nice i agree um with the statement of if you like for example right what do most of us do on a saturday friday saturday sunday some of us watch netflix and chill and relax and before you know it the weekend is over now what if on that same weekend like one of the things that i would pitch to my clients uh they would pay me like you know one of the clients paid between 10 to 25 000 for three days because i told them look these three days you're gonna do nothing but in these three days we could just build a full product for you and launch it and he was like okay let's do it the same thing i feel here most of us on friday saturday sunday they just pass nothing happens on this friday saturday sunday you get to completely change your career as a developer and launch your career and just kick start the hell out of it and potentially get a job with it so that's kind of the crazy thing about it and why do we say you could literally kicks your career that's because what you're doing this weekend is you're gonna build a bunch of assets right an asset is something that you could leverage to help you make money to help you move forward in life whatever that is so what are these assets you're going to build an amazing amazon clone here with that you're also going to learn how to do react.js you're going to develop those skills that are basically an asset you're going to develop a portfolio which you could show to potential people that might hire you that's another asset you're going to build a network of likeminded individuals people who are just trying to level up the game people who aren't spending their weekends watching netflix but on this workshop these are types of assets that you're gonna have by being part of this workshop and going up showing up and playing all out in this workshop with those things that is how you get to jumpstart your career yep this app is pretty cool project home dot app uh let's see if it's actually live project home it's like a dope airbnb oh dude project home is the only housing group you need we build project home out of assuming the current products on the market simply want to solve a rental property search and roommate search should not be isolated oh wow so roommate search with apartment renting type searching dude this again just creating software to solve a pain point right like someone probably was like okay oh seattle nice someone hold on let's go to let's just figure out what's going on here uh what options ready to move in maybe it's not so hold on let's this is working okay so what am i doing so 105 that's a pretty big range available from shut picket okay sure right is that fine yeah oh lovely studio in soma what's oma uh i know soto i don't know where the hell someone was it's probably south of that in seattle oh probably all right how about how about let's change it to los angeles so we know maybe some of the stuff wait it still says soma uh it's a trick it was it's just there's no real functionality to it uh san francisco california i see yeah oh they're just they're just showing us how awesome this ui looks which i think it looks pretty freaking clean it's actually pretty good yeah um let's see i was excited man i was like yo i'm moving to l.a let's find a place for me that's a good project i mean if you have it you kind of you might be able to land a job with this for sure dude it's a pretty yeah yeah there's a lot of ui interaction here it looks super clean super awesome definitely would stand out in the portfolio man this is cool uh let's go back so project home this is good oh yeah you guys can definitely model this build it out as one of your projects i want to see if there's something else that's also fun i wrote a massive list of common react interview questions with eloquent examples in this fight epic 5000 i list a plug my god yeah oh scrimba scrimba is awesome you get to learn react like live oh it's actually pretty dope like you have a coding area or what what do you mean you get to learn react live you get to learn react um so when you're watching videos right oh you've never learned seen scrimba i haven't seen scramble oh it's freaking ridiculous dude let me show you some stuff so let's go to skrimba dot com right watch this so let's just start your journey and let's pick um all right let me just sign in i'll sign in with github it's successfully logged in why is it logging in with nas all right whatever it said successfully log in yeah all right so here we go so now i'm in so this is what i wanted to show you okay so let's say that we go to working with uh apis right and let's just pick uh any lesson and let's go to responses what the so let's just find i'm i'm just trying to find like uh there's a free one they have a bunch of free ones so hey everyone and welcome to uh because we are going to build a react movie search app obviously basically oh god just so you build out a project they have the tutorial videos for you it's like it's like almost the clones we have no but here's the cool part about it this is you can actually run the code here set up the console hey this is so he's screen recording here right i just paused his video and i can actually now code right there that's what the i'm saying bro so like look i can just code right there video is paused as soon as i start playing his videos search movies so like i can go search movies and write that and the and i can run the code too and see what happens that's nuts dude this is mindblowing bro that's what i'm saying so you can actually pick up so much uh from doing this because the live i'm just trying to think of how the hell that's programmed like they literally like they literally have to match whatever is in the video at the typing speed that they have because at any moment you could press on it and then switch over to the the what do we call this the code area yeah code editor the code the code editor damn bro it's been a while shloka says just join right now let's go yo if you just joined right now let's try to get someone else on the call let's see what let's see what happens yeah if they join they'll message me my money they know how to message my money hey bro i want to know where your motivation comes from yo you want to answer that one uh where does my motivation come from um budgie so it's a tough question i mean i just like doing like i i enjoy doing and um yeah like the whole world feels kind of like a playground to me so it's it's fun and it's exciting and uh i always just want to be exploring new opportunities new things that are happening now as i'm growing older my motivation is also coming from my team that i have my friends that i have my girlfriend um my motivation comes from making sure that my team is taken care of that's kind of like sometimes external motivation and other a lot of other times just my main source of motivation honestly is i'll pick things that i don't know if they're possible or are extremely challenging and then i just think and i'm like holy can i do this can we do this can we pull this off i don't know if we can do this or not i'm going to wake up tomorrow and i'm going to check it out and see if we can do this or not so a lot of my motivation actually comes from not knowing if something is possible and then putting in the work to do it which is why a lot of times i even like coding because i'll pick a project that i'm not sure if i can do or like we can put together a complete and then we get to work and the whole time i'm just thinking are we gonna get this done or not you know and then from there figure it out and then when you figure it out just like amazing it's the best thing yeah but it's like the the journey of figuring it out is what's absolutely incredible that's the part that i actually really enjoy um all right guys so a few things we are about to go um we're about to go work more on the workshop so we make sure that when you guys get into the react.js workshop that is in the description below we can actually help you out and just put together an amazing training so we're going to go

beginner this is for you and in these three days here's what's going to happen on day one you're going to work on building an amazon clone all right uh we're also going to give you the web developer roadmap for 2021. so that includes all of the technologies you need to know how much time it takes to learn each of them what's the salary expectation of a react.js developer all of those things we're gonna tell you about on day two we're gonna go further into the amazon clone and we're gonna complete it we're going to give you a full on portfolio on day two we're gonna have you take your amazon project and put it in that portfolio so your portfolio is ready to go and then we're gonna do an intense q a session with nas and i then day three we're going to be announcing and opening up our coding boot camp all right this coding bootcamp is going to be something uh incredible it's going to be a 12 month online coding bootcamp with four retreats we're gonna announce the opening of that on day three and we're gonna share everything together with you so that's what's in store i hope that we see you on board i hope that you sign up for the training in the description below and jump in i
