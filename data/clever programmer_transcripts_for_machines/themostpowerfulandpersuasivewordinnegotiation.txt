what is up how is it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm from a hostage situation to getting a $15,000 raise to telling your kid to go sleep at 9 p.m. everything at the end of the day comes down to negotiation to getting to that yes today's video is inspired by a book I've been reading recently called never split the difference by Chris Voss and in that book he shares the most powerful and persuasive word that will increase your chances significantly getting to that yes okay how's everybody doing I'm heading to work heading to my office but I thought while I'm doing that and while I'm heading there I make this little video for you so you could have this video and if you actually apply what you learn from this you could actually change the trajectory of your life hello everybody so what is that one really powerful word what is that one persuasive word that can change the trajectory of your life and almost every single negotiation let me preface this with a story okay a lot of people think that the magic thing to get people to say are a lot of yeses in a row and once everybody's another person says a lot of yeses you can then sell them on something so for example imagine somebody calling you like a telemarketer and you pick up the phone and they go well do you like drinking water and here like yeah I think so I do enjoy water and then they're like do you also like being able to live and you're like I guess yeah sure well why don't you buy our new product XYZ because it has these features now what are you gonna say there you're gonna say yes just because you said two yeses before hell no you would just say no and you would cut it off see another example I'll give you right when I was younger I realized that my parents were pretty unreasonable not all the time but sometimes and if they wanted me to do something they would just like keep talking about it keep talking about it and if I ever said no they just wouldn't even listen to me to just keep going so over time what I learned to do is I learned to just listen to them the entire time say yes the whole way through and then actually just ignore them right or afterward after listening to them I just would not do what they had said to give you an example they were like you should become a doctor or you should become a lawyer and they were so hellbent on it then when I said no they would just like keep going like you're wrong why would you said no look at other kids did it uh so then what I started doing is I simply started saying yes I do want to become a doctor I will do it and then at the end I had no urge and I actually ended up not doing it so I just lied to their face that is exactly also what happens if somebody tried to come to convert you to their religion right what would happen or if somebody comes to recruit you you just kind of say yes just so they can stop harassing you and then you just don't do it so to bring this full circle and tell you what is the actual most important thing and the most persuasive word that actually starts any reasonable negotiation and that's the word no okay and oh no most people think that this is actually where a negotiation ends Christina you're the best hi guys thank you guys I am seeing what you guys are saying in chat but I'm just like so focused on this video that sometimes I miss it but I will respond at the end of this video but back to the back to the point most people think that no is actually where the negotiation or the conversation ends that is actually where the negotiation starts that's where the negotiation actually begins so if you're on the end where you're trying to negotiate with somebody get to the know as fast as possible because if they're saying no to you that means they are telling you the truth and that means you actually have a chance okay so the dudes who are watching if a girl is saying no to you and you're like hey or maybe we should go on a date well that doesn't mean a yes and don't jump in to start harassing her because I feel like that's what some people do but if you're a little bit intelligent you would know that that's actually just the beginning of a negotiation that's actually just a start when it comes to you asking for a raise and the other person saying no that's actually the start of the negotiation when you ask for like okay I want you know I want I want to do this software developer job they're giving you the job instead of just being like okay I'll accept it for $50,000 thank you so much oh my god if you say you counter offer them an $80,000 and then they're like that's actually way too high this ridiculous what are you doing and then they're like this sends you a counteroffer and they say we can we can do 65 now are you gonna sit in a corner and cry because you didn't get your 80 or are you gonna sit in the middle of the street happy smiling enjoying yourself because instead of getting 50 you now have 65 from just getting one no okay so this is what opens up a dialog all right and back in the day when I would tell my parents no when they would tell me to be a doctor or a lawyer those were the days I was open to listening to them and hearing them out on why I should become a lawyer or a doctor when I grew up but when they could not explain it to me and when I was convinced that that is not the right path and these two my parents are not the people who ever be able to convince me of this and when I gave up all hope on that that's when I actually just told them yes without ever saying no that's when I became the perfect son that they enjoyed because I learned that I could just lie to them not do what they want but still make them feel happy for it and then go on and do my own thing okay so until if somebody just stopped saying no it's you completely watch out there's some kind of agenda or something going on that you don't know about and you're not gonna one get your desired result and it means the other person is not being honest with you you or they're not listening to you okay so when somebody's agreeing with you all the way that's actually not the right thing no is a beautiful beautiful word look for it look for objections look for obstacles and once they come up embrace them enjoy them relax breathe in deeply and then go from there that's what opens up the dialogue this is what I wanted to share with you guys and I hope that you found this valuable I hope that you enjoyed this video that I'm making in this weird little parking lot for you but I'm gonna start heading to work now the content of the video is over but I'll answer some questions at this point as well as start engaging with you guys so Eric bus hi Lilia how are you doing lots of heart eyes let me try to make hard eyes right here my horse are the worst hi Elvira she says excellent point thank you where are you right now I'm in LA if you're such a good program why don't you code I run a company now called clever programmer our goal is to reach millions of people which we are doing and our goal is to get the entire world to code so that's the mission I'm on and that's the mission my team is on and it's a powerful mission and it's a type of mission that doesn't allow me to actually just sit there and code all the time because that would be a little selfish though that's what I would love to do actually Christina you're very welcome how can I switch how can I switch to software developing from web developing just one google it you can switch yeah just literally google it because you're going to be doing more computer science e stuff smooth answer how to get into hybrid apps I wish I knew I have no idea to get into hybrid apps I've never done it hi I'm butch Kumar he says call my name why do I love programming it lets me take whatever it is in here turn it into reality and so if I turn it into an application and you download that application you start using it it literally feels like you're entering in my cerebral cortex and now you're actually in my universe playing around which is which is kind of cool well that was fast card or bike I'm almost at my work place so I'm gonna take a few more questions and I'm going to end this if you guys have any questions drop them down below and I'll take the time now to answer them denne asked about see I'm a Python guy so I can't really help you would see my friend what about costs crossplatform apps flutter no idea about flutter do I need to learn JavaScript before Django or Flass no you can just go and start learning Django and flask and pick up JavaScript along the way but don't go down the rabbit hole of like spending years learning JavaScript and then going don't do that I think scratch is a fantastic way to start I think adults should actually start with scratch as well what coding boot camps do I suggest full sack Academy is really good which a library do I like I want to work with machine learning having done much Thank You Vicky that's it guys I'm gonna bounce my light is about to turn green thank you guys so much for coming as always I love your face and I'll see you in the next video you
