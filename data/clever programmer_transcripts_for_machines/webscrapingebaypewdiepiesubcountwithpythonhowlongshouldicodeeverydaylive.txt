are we live hey guys what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm here today with my boy all right Aaron Aaron burneth we are gonna be doing an official reveal of him in an upcoming video today he is just a guest welcome welcome Aaron on your first live stream on this channel so what we're gonna be talking about on this live stream is how long should I code every day this is something that is a commonly asked that's a very common question that I get all the time so I want to talk about that but I want to talk about this through the lens of accumulating and aggregating lots of marginal gains I want to talk about what was that book that I read today yes so I'm gonna be talking about atomic habits and the power of atomic habits and how you can actually leverage those to power through your coding improve your coding skills and move forward in the direction of landing your first job or freelancing opportunity or whatever the case may be for you hello everyone hello flying arm bar nice flying arm bar I am practicing jujitsu so I am actually trying to learn flying arm bar yes Dempsey Aaron actually does look high I agree with that Heiko shake hello Lawrence hi Aditya hi programming with project welcome welcome guys we have lots of people on in 79 people which is super dope I'm excited we're gonna take on your questions as well later in the livestream but let's jump into this video so how long should you code every single day first of all when I when I read the book I was reading atomic habits today and in that book he talks about aggregating tiny little marginal gains in your life and once you make progress right in any area so let's say that over the course if you improved one percent every single day do you know how much of an impact that would have on your life one percent every day and if you did that for one whole year you would actually be thirty seven times better than you are right now so I want you to just imagine that and let that sink in you don't have to do a hundred percent more you don't have to do twenty X more or 10x more or thirty X more though if you did that you'd get better faster but if you just consistently with consistency and discipline applied yourself in any venture that you were on in your life and you improved one percent every single day which is very possible to do you would have improved thirty seven times by the end of the year so that is really massive you're a growth kind of compounds exponentially and we just don't realize it as it's happening and in the book James clear I believe is his name in atomic habits he also talks about how so so first of all before I continue you know I want to bring it back to programming so if you are trying to become a better programmer and trying to answer this question of how long should I code every day well build a discipline in your daytoday life that even if your goal is to code five minutes a day or ten minutes a day as long as you are improving by one percent every day which is what will happen if you just showed up every day over the course of 365 days you will be a 37 times better programmer so a very powerful concept to actually just let that sink into your brain and go that's massive who finds this valuable before I continue further hi Muhammad hello Aditya coding everyday Sam is here huh hey Sam how's it going my man Sam Studios is here thank you thank you I love you guys back what about doing a tutorial flutter maybe one day yep so if you were to do this every single day you would find massive growth in everything that you do okay you can apply this to any other area of your life whether it's fitness or whether it's relationships right if you decide to just show up 1% more every day and you just showed up consistently even what you're just showing up consistently your relationship will improve your health will improve and your programming skills would improve okay that's all you essentially have to do now in the book atomic habits you also talks about when we are having these incremental increases in our life we don't really recognize them as they're happening so let's say that I had ice and it was 26 degrees if I raise the temperature up to 27 degrees there would be no noticeable difference of ice if I raised up the temperature to 28 degrees or 29 degrees or 30 degrees or even 31 degrees there would be no noticeable difference to the ice but now if I take it from 31 degrees to 32 degrees all of a sudden what takes place if you know the answer pop it in the chat below if I go from 31 degrees to 32 degrees what happens to the ice it melts but all the other changes that took place preceding that moment where it melted those were invisible you did not get to see them nobody got to see those changes from 26 to 31 degrees another example if you had to kill a frog by boiling it very aggressive and violent an example but if you had to do that if you took the Frog and you just threw it in boiling water super hot the Frog would just immediately jump up and great job guys you guessed it that it does melt it indeed if the Frog if you throw the Frog in in boiling water it'll just jump out he'll just jump out but if you throw a frog in lukewarm water and then you start raising it one degree at a time eventually it will get to a point where it's boiling but it won't even recognize the difference and then it'll just boil and die because of the heat all right so the gradual increase can kill you and crush you in life and just [ __ ] you up massively and the gradual increase on the other side and the flippetyflip can also massively exponentially increase your results improve your relationships and give you breakthroughs encoding and becoming a programmer that you had never thought existed before so you want to take those principles of that gradual increase and apply them to your life as a programmer to becoming a better developer so what does that look like a lot of people want to do too many things at one time want the results right away which is me I am like that I am pretty impatient so if you are impatient then [ __ ] put in 18 hours a day right 20 hours a day 15 hours a day and then just get really impatient Lee didn't go crazy but most people generally one don't have that much time to put in into it is a lot of time and effort so if we take a more systematic approach that is very hard to fail with and it's very possible to succeed with if you just gradually increase every day you know sometimes I guess disappointing and you want to quit and you kept going and you coded even ten minutes a day or five minutes a day you would notice or actually should I say you would not notice a particular difference in your coding skill it will not be visible to you because it will essentially be you going from 26 degrees to 27 degrees if you kept coding it would be you going from 27 degrees to 28 degrees and then 29 degrees and 30 and 31 and you would not notice any particular difference but when you get that 32 degree meaning you land that internship or for example you finally get to the coding interview and you can actually solve the whiteboarding problem to give you that's you going from 31 degrees to 32 degrees but 95% of the human population quit between that journey from 26 degrees to 32 degrees it's very depressing sometimes they'll quit when they're at 31 degree mark there's this saying that goes quitting three feet before gold and it's the story of this man who was digging and digging and digging and had a hunch that there was gold in this one area so he calls his people with him and he spends like I think weeks and months digging this place up and after months of trial of every day just coming in and putting in like 15 hours a day and constantly digging with his shovel he got he was like I'm getting really close to the gold but eventually what ended up happening was he didn't know whether there was gold or not and he ended up quitting another person came instead of him and was like oh somebody looks like they were digging here maybe I'll just dig and let's see what happens and that person started digging and literally 3 feet of digging later they actually found an insane amount of gold and became stupidly wealthy so the first person it's a pretty depressing story for him because he ended up quitting three feet before gold and that's oftentimes what take takes place in most people's lives they quit three feet before gold so if you are finding yourself coding and you're trying to put in ten to fifteen minutes or an hour every single day and you are finding yourself even if you're not putting that kind of time in and you're finding yourself being discouraged just know that you're making improvements that are invisible to the world around you hell they're even invisible to you but you are still moving in the right direction and you possibly could be three feet from gold or one degree away from that melting point so you want to keep going and you don't want to quit because often times how long should I code everyday there's a hidden question behind it right and sometimes that question is like should I even keep coding should I even continue in this journey and the answer to that is yes my friend most of these breakthrough changes you're looking for there's a tipping point where they happen they don't just happen right away and tipping point is another book by Malcolm Gladwell which we can talk about in another day but this was just so we could kind of get deep into the problem of how long should you code every day and that's one of the things I would give you now with that framework out of the way of thinking about it there's another framework of thinking about it too how long should you code every day so Steve Pavlina has written this great article called plotters versus bursters and this article addresses the issue of the different personality types that exist and he simplified it into two distinct different personality types and what's funny is that Aaron is sitting here and he's actually a perfect example of he's kind of a burst or two but he's very good plotter and I would be a burster so there are two different personality types so for example if you're a plotter or a bursar none of them are bad they both have pros and cons so for example you're very good at creating systems and making sure that you are going by them and you can you you have not that much problem like consistently sticking with them that's something I have a problem with so Aaron was how skinny did you used to be 110 pounds when you Jesus Christ 8 inches 5 10 and 110 pounds or some 115 pounds baby that is ridiculously skinny that is really skinny so you were 110 pounds how much do you weigh now okay so right now he weighs about 155 pounds and you put on a lot of this weight pretty quickly yeah actually 172 pounds in six months but 172 pounds 140 I went from 115 to 140 over the course of four years okay so yeah he put on a lot of so he put on a crap ton of weight he even went up 272 pounds Dempsey says he's hundred and ten is all he put on a crap ton of pounds in six months in a short amount of time and he went all the way up 272 pounds from a hundred and ten pound guy but he is very good at systematically just he was following his caloric diet he had a step by step system in place he would hit his caloric goals he had a trail mix that he would eat every day and he just did it over and over and over and over again and eventually he got this massive success okay or in his case he ended up even getting a little bit on the fatter side but it was a huge win and now he's much better now for me that is really hard because I've been trying to gain weight for the last six years and it doesn't happen because I'm much better at bursting and just going allin for short periods of time almost think of it like sprinting versus a marathon like he if if we could just look at it from life like he's a marathoner and I'm a sprinter so for me it's a very hard thing to actually improve in weight because it just requires me to be so disciplined and consistent I need to do things fast so for example when it comes to coding how long should I code every day because I'm a burster for me it's much easier for me to just go in a two to three month long massively obsessive cycle of coding and spend 15 hours a day coding or 10 hours a day coding and then after three months just like [ __ ] not even think about coding for another few months I can do that that I'm really good at for example for him maybe it might be better for him but for somebody with Aaron's personality type to just code systematically have it in your calendar for 30 minutes a day or an hour a day and just consistently hit that 30 minutes or one hour time and just do it day in and day out day in and day out you don't even have to have attached any emotions to it it's just something you do and then over the course of a year you see massive results in your success so what personality type are you are you a plotter or a burster are you more of aaron or are you more of Kazi and just drop it in the chat below I'd love to see what personality types we have in this chat right now so we can get a sense of what's going on what are successful people willing to do that unsuccessful people aren't do you work david says do you work better with an open space or a space where things can be a little more inspirational and regards to creativity that's a very good question and I'm actually gonna address that right away so we got some answers and people are like I'm a plotter plotter so some say that they're more like bursters or Causey in this case sam says he's more like a burster Messiah says he's a plotter so it's actually plotter with two DS not a plotter not somebody who sits theirs and plots evil schemes alright so that's good gives me some sense of where you guys are at and I don't know what the other 75 people in this livestream are doing like guys come on type they're like [ __ ] sleeping all right so let's move on to this next question of do you work better with an open space or a space where things can be a little bit more inspirational in regards to creativity David my answer to that is absolutely I in different environments I work completely differently cuz when I'm at home I generally don't my brain doesn't function that well when it comes to productivity and working I work much better outside of home so if I'm at a Starbucks I work really well if I am at some kind of cool coffee shop where I can just eat my food drank my coffee and just zone in and and there's just a ambience of people around me doing stuff that's really helpful another spot that's really helpful is a coworking spot such as we work that's another one that's really helpful these guys were laughing at the plotter yeah I'm more of a bursar Josh says I'm with Aaron he's a plotter to his motivation required for coding that's a good question yes you're gonna need to be motivated but motivation won't last you right which is why you need to then eventually put a system in place so motivation is almost always gonna be temporary because it's tied to your willpower and willpower is limited there's a book on this concept to I can't recall the book name but your willpower is limited it's like a gas tank it will eventually run out so you want to set systems into place and in which case then you don't have to constantly keep relying on your willpower so what I would recommend for you is first be motivated right just like watch youtube videos on coding and while you're eating or while you're about to sleep just kind of immerse yourself in the world of coding and then what you should focus on is once that motivation is developed then try to build systems that get you to code every day and make it a daily habit make it a daily routine that you do every single day so yeah there's a abdullah yes there is a book called the power of habit and that's a really good book except the narrator's voice is annoying [ __ ] so I can't pay I couldn't pay attention to it after a while but the book is great so if you can get the non audible version or at least if I could give myself that advice in the end the non audible version that'd be better Yosh says what's your ultimate goal this year great question Yosh my goals are very process based rather than outcome based so for example if she asked me last year I would say like make million dollars get a purple belt in jujitsu squat 225 pounds deadlift 315 pounds being a relationship I would have like these really outcomefocused goals this year my goals are very processed based because what I realized is it's hard to control your outcomes it's not that hard to control your process and if you can focus on the process more than the outcomes you will stay on the right track for the rest of your life whereas if you just focus on the outcomes once you get that thing you kind of stop the goal is over Eckhart Tolle says there's two ways to be miserable one is to get you get what you want and the second way or sorry one way is to not get what you want and the second way is to get what you want so kind of like a brain [ __ ] but it is true and the more miserable way is honestly it once you get what you want and you realize you're still miserable that's a lot scarier cuz you're just then you don't even have anything to look forward to so that's why I am really going away from goal focused outcome focused goals because I lost a lot of motivation last year for that reason and I was like yo I hit every goal I could dream of I'm making way more money than I could dream of then I thought that could be possible at least in mind little imagination I'm like I helped a lot of people around me that I could and in my family as well and then it was just I kind of ran out of things to do and then I just [ __ ] around a lot and just wasted a lot of time I mean wasted but just just had a lot of fun and almost fault as if I lost my way in 2018 like I kind of lost my way that's why in 2018 if you look back there weren't even that many videos I made I was kind of off the map from clever programmer I didn't want to do clever programmer anymore I was just gonna stop and not do this anymore just do something else I was like I don't even want to be a programmer anymore you know I don't want to just box myself into this one area there's so much more to life than just coding and then I woke up and I was like [ __ ] no there isn't coding his life now I'm kidding no for me it was I just realized I was like I was so focused on outcomes that it just once I got them it just blinded me and I don't want to do anything else and then I realized if I focus on the hunt the game if I focus on losing if I focus on the pain the journey and I start finding joy out of all of those things if I [ __ ] start finding joy out of pain if I start finding joy out of losses if I start finding joy in the craziness that takes place for you to get these goals if I start finding joy in the process in the systems I will never go wrong that's where I get my if I can start getting my dopamine rushes and my brain from that instead of the one second I can get them from an outcome now we're on the right track so to answer your question instead of outcome focus goals and the goals that I told you about you know make a mill or diss down or the other thing my goals this year are get to the gym 200 times this year make 300 videos for clever programmer create news six new products for clever programmer create we'll see how I go with this but create 100 videos for my personal brand for Rafa Kazi because I want to get into more like I love coding I love programming don't get me wrong but there like a lot of the audience for coding there are very like there are few people who have that entrepreneurial mindset and are like there's more life than just like a $40,000 a year job that's like where most people most people's heads at and I realize I can't really fight that and I can't really change that yes there are some people who can start to see beyond and go okay I see I can run a business I see I can start to freelance and they learn how to dream bigger and do that but there's too much resistance and fighting there so with the personal brand I really want to share different types of concepts that I really really enjoy personally like I love business I want to talk about business I want to talk about how you can earn an income that's more than a you know fifty thousand dollars a year like I want to talk about how you can earn an income that's 200,000 300,000 or 400,000 dollars a year or more how can you have a team of people that you lead how do you become an actual leader how do you make impact in different people's lives I do want to also talk about fitness and things like relationships on that so that's what I would be really interested in and that's one of the things I want to do so that's why that's one of my goals to make a hundred videos from a personal brand but keep in mind my goals are very processed focus this year you know going back to answering your question so hopefully that answers your question gives you guys some fodder for your goals so drop in the comments below right now what are some processed focus goals that you could concentrate on this year it could be one two or three things for example for me it's 200 times at the gym 300 videos for one brand 100 videos for another brand for you it could be 100 days of coding you know or this that or the other thing so what are some process focus goals that you can do Sam good question Sam asks how do you manage to post videos consistently being consistent is sometimes hard to execute on my part Sam that's a really good question and the answer is you just got to do a lot of them then you'll start becoming better and also I have a team of people working with me at this point and it's not just me so you need to learn how to become a leader and have a team of people but don't focus on the team part right now just focus on even if you're producing one video a week just then focus on just staying consistent with one a week for now and then eventually you can ramp it up and you can even bring other people to work with you okay so I would like to focus on data science this year that's a weird goal because you would like to focus like are you gonna do it or not first of all all right that's not a goal Avinash so you need to be like and and I would like to focus on like all of those words don't mean anything they're very vague so you can say I'm gonna take one data science course this year I would like to focus on is like a whole lot of [ __ ] and you're saying this because you get to write a goal and feel good that you wrote a goal but you're never gonna do this because it's so vague and it doesn't even have any meaning to it that's what a lot of people do when it comes to goalsetting they will say something that allows them to get out of that goal because nobody can quantify that nobody can measure that nobody can hold you accountable to that and you also feel like you hit that goal so you want to make your goal very specific I'm gonna go on to the next person completing whole Python that is also a very weird goal under pump because there's no such thing as completing entire Python it's like if I said completing entire English or some other insert some other language it's the goal is not achievable so you want to get very specific with it complete a beginner course or complete this specific udemy course or does that or the other thing write or code X amount of days and renew Ginn says programming coach so that's the outcome focused goal not a processoriented goal Andrew but good goal to have so I'm glad that you have that goal that's but it's a specific goal so I like that ROM gem says this you're not going to be a badass freelancer again a vague outcome focus goal probably not gonna even achieve it if you have if you have such vague goals you're not gonna achieve them that's kind of just a sad truth so it's a situation get better at understanding programming languages Syed says you're said you're more of a bursar but how can you stay consistent I it's it's hard for me to stay consistent I don't stay consistent I prefer I work in obsessive cycles so I'll work in obsessive like right now we're creating one video every single day every single day but probably then I'll just get sick of making videos and I want to do something [ __ ] else I'm just gonna stop doing everything and I'll go live in like Sweden for a few weeks or a few months and then I'll come back to things so that's just me but I know myself but then having a team of people allows me to be consistent but for that period I'm like very relentless one hour of coding every day for this year gaffar that's a very great goal to have I like that goal a lot Norbit says you already helped change my mindset on success now it's just the doing remember you can only lead us to the door that has changed we have to walk through it thanks bro yes so you do have to take them you have the power to walk through the door and then if and thank you for even giving me the privilege to be able to do that but yeah like if I am in that position to be able to help you guys with that that's great but I'm sure you guys can lead yourself to the door and go through it but definitely you have to do the walking through a part okay whether it you're taking something from me or listening to me or you're listening to somebody else it doesn't really matter but what matters is like fast rapid brutal execution like a relentless execution which language should I learn first Python my goal is to be done coding at least startup level mmm don't really know what that means bro okay I want to finish my Python course that I bought from color programmer start finished and start first project in the Python programming like dn good still vague goals still get clearer on them so I want to or you will okay so I will finish my Python course that I bought from clever programmer boom that's one two I will complete my first project with Python all right not start like you're giving yourself like you see what I'm saying or are you so Jesus that's actually a solidgold McHale I like that goal doing at least 20 commits a day that's a solid go I love that Priyanka says one I'm going to do workouts three times a week great I love that too I'll improve my communication skills that's a vague goal but so get more specific with it maybe you'll go to an ESL class for 20 times in a year or if it's not ESL and it's some other communication then you should specify I'll take like two courses on this to be specific three she says learn 50 books about UI and UX that's a lot of [ __ ] books but okay and also UI development so that'd be great if you could do that and for get my job in a startup ok Priyanka so far you are the winner you are the one who like really gets how to set processoriented goals and thank you for putting it in like numbering it as well like number one number two I love that golden honey I seriously answered your question like Lauren Python you can also watch my video call what programming language to learn first where I'm much nicer and kind to much more detail about it so check that one out too but you know I would answer you and like a lot of detail but that topic I love it and then I'll just I go down that rabbit hole and then it'll take like 30 minutes me explaining it so it would be just much better if you just check out what programming language to learn first look it up and you will love that video that video is awesome but in short you should do Python okay okay what happened which one okay so under pump says how do I find people having the same mindset as I have well it's you what does your mindset tell you to do and then look up those things so for example my mindset tells me I should go [ __ ] lift then what I need to do is find gyms where I can find the strongest most bad ass power lifters and then go there if my mind set is telling me that I need to become a coder then I need to look up meetups where developers are there and if I can't find meetups and I should go to coworking spaces because at coworking spaces there are a lot of developers there as well so yeah that is very important okay so that's how I would think about it golden honey you are very welcome okay Dave Locke says his goals are and hello Dave Locke he's one of our students in our program profitable shortcut so he says learn the basics of Python in the next two weeks build and monetize phase one of the SAS project by midmay develop a team to build the project into full tool suite by September so these are now again I'm gonna do a little golf clap here because I like when there's like three people who wrote down like very specific process based goals so I love that so yeah I learned the basics of Python like if you so somebody earlier said learn Python that's not gonna happen but learning the basics of Python and then also wrapping a time frame around it of the next two weeks that's very smart so that's good and then he has the same you know other thing with building and monetizing phase one of the SAS project what made me there's also a time duration there what he's gonna be building and like specifically what he's gonna be building so that's all the way throughout all of his goals that makes these goals very specific he's able to be held accountable by these goals and he's gonna also hold himself accountable by these goals that's why you want to set very specific goals because most people just set vague ass goals so they never have to feel like they're being held accountable by them alright Jitendra says one I should I should go to gym everyday know take out the [ __ ] word either you're gonna go or you're not gonna go so either right not gonna go to the gym everyday or you're gonna say go to the gym everyday but don't write should to analyze a data set every day okay three start practicing data sets in cattle four read 10 pages of a book and 5 play Skyrim mission daily nice ok good goals alright I'm liking these now ok guys so just if you guys are here so far what I wanted to do for you guys right is questions like how long should I call it everyday and also other things as in I know some people even on this livestream asked how did I become a developer or freelancer and what we did for you guys is we wanted to put together a gift and epic training cuz this is just a surprise livestream we did for you guys and so we're like ok how can we even give you guys more so we put together this epic training that where I want us to basically show you like how did I become a developer what are the exact steps that I took to be able to become a developer to get my freelancing job opportunities and then eventually other thing such as how did I hire other developers to work for me as well how did I manage to earn a sixfigure income while I was going to college you know Oakton Community College so some of you guys know my backstory some of you guys probably don't but either way I put something together for you guys and we put something together for you guys a training to give you guys all those things ok if you guys look in the description in this live stream where it says I'll reveal to you my stepbystep system of how I became a developer and how you can use that to become a badass freelancer yourself we have the link there it's some it's a crowdcast link go to that and it's the training you can sign up for it it's completely free to sign up for this training so there's no [ __ ] reason you shouldn't if you're still here and you're interested in this ok if you're not interested this don't sign up because yeah if you don't want to become like a Python freelancer or a developer then probably don't sign up ok then you can just go through my free courses and everything which are just as awesome which are super cool but if you want to do those things that I just mentioned then definitely sign up because we want to give you a stepbystep system that you could follow and make your journey just a lot easier and simpler and more streamlined alright I will also try to screencast this thing maybe and that will look probably show you guys at least what this page looks like you should do it here like that alright here we go so what I'm gonna do is hit clear layer now hopefully you guys are seeing this screen let's see or the scene the screen or the scene this yeah they are so you're gonna go to this page the link is at the top right there and the link is also in the YouTube description you're gonna see this title you're gonna look at my beautiful face you're gonna make my contact would mean the picture for a few seconds and then you're gonna click save my spot just pop in your email and I think it also tells me how many people have signed up and stuff so I'll show you guys that too because I think that'll be cool but I'm gonna stop the I'm gonna start the video again oh wait did that work oh it wasn't showing my bad guys okay now it should be showing I'm sorry I'm sorry now it should show okay so you're gonna go here you're gonna make eye contact with me on this picture for a few seconds once you're done doing that you see where it says save my spot it's looking nice and juicy click that I'm gonna pop in your email right here the link is at the top click the link put in your email and then once this training goes live which it's gonna do in three days Dubey that doesn't sound like three days fridays in three days away hold on Tuesday Oh three days in eighteen hours 12 hours okay whatever I guess it makes sense yeah so just go ahead and sign up and then I think it'll tell me how many people have signed up and I'll count you I'll shout you guys out and I think it lets me chat with you guys or something too so I think that would be pretty dope but this is the epic free training you could sign up for and we'll blow your mind and just give you massive stupid stupid amounts of value in there so let's let's go back and pop my face back in in errands errands and fizzing oh [ __ ] was a too zoomed in damnit now they couldn't see anything they're like we're not seeing it God freakin technical difficulties man all right let's see golden honeys whoa Lebogang says I've been coding for 10 years I feel I've reached a ceiling on everything I've been exposed to so far how do I get to know what I don't know you need to focus on learning how to sell you should read books like 10x by Grant Cardone and you need to learn negotiation and all those things because at this point your problem is not gonna be a skill set your problem is like how do you get yourself to make a lot more [ __ ] money okay that's it make more money fall in love with money alright because money is what will help you make an impact in people's lives money is what will allow you to support yourself and other people around you money is very very important and it's just something that is not taught to us and it's told to us to look down upon and make fun of like this guy but it's very important okay so that's what I would focus on because we have some developers I recently got this email by this guy and he's making 133 euros an hour right now as a developer and he's getting a job when he making 200 euros an hour so his yearly salary is gonna be three hundred fortyeight thousand euros per year which is pretty intense right but it's doable you guys just need to get better at that my brother is making about over 315 grand a year at his job so there are jobs with a lot of money but it's just if you're gonna stay in this little like programming community with these little like Oh $40,000 a year I'm just happy for the rest of my life is so great Oh like I just don't resonate with that and up until last few years like I just feel like I was trying to please everyone but I just realized that I don't want to be around those people they don't want to be around me and just not a good match ultimately so for me it's like I really want to be around highperforming entrepreneurial thinking people who want to become developers either to grow their business hire their developers or take or get a job that pays like stupid amounts and and then be able to live the lifestyle that they actually dream of you know not just $40,000 a year some job security and I'm set you know that doesn't excite me and I hope it doesn't excite you either okay moving on golden honey says I'm going to start learning the bit way hold on let's see how many people signed up I mean whoa wow this is sick sorry we're gonna take the question in a second this is way too fun all right so we're gonna go here Sam says what's going on hi Avinash says I just subscribed Jitender eyes in here Sam as in your retinas excited vishal is writing in full caps to make sure I see everything 31 registered attendees that is sick boys and girls yeah I'm gonna quickly dammit is it showing well hold on why is it doing that okay guys sorry we're having like a technical difficulty thing here we're trying to figure this [ __ ] out for you guys is it showing now it's too fast I can't see why doesn't it allow me to just oh my god this is getting way too complicated I'm getting I okay for this I really need a college degree should have gotten my degree when I had the chance okay I think I figured it out hold on guys just hold on yo is this making it smaller or what is it doing that's what she said [Laughter] I don't think it's making it smaller at all it's this dry I'm just dragging it right yeah wow this is depressing all that programming for nothing huh no cut one this is so bad whoa everything showed okay I think it's showing I think it's showing why did you guys saying whoa like that okay guys so if you come to this page which you can come to by clicking in the link description below and it says step by step system to become a Python freelancer click that and then you can sign up and then you can be one of these cool kids and talk with us so we have 32 people registered so far which is awesome so Sam registered Gabriel monk Avinash a beak romchan vishal Jitendra ratash Aaron McHale salud a big arrow you guys should just sign up with his name that's it there are 14 live now and there's 32 registers hola Yosh Krishna Ravi Tala show beats saying let's see who Lorenzo Williams and my ankh this is pretty cool it's pretty cool we're also using this new tool and seeing if it works nobody's typing in the chat anymore no it's kind of lame can they hear us they can hear us hi guys all right I'm leaving this place now oh they can't even okay you guys can ask a question to just don't ask it in all caps I'll delete it oh it's probably a good question but it's just it's in caps so I have to delete it I'm sorry just ask it calmly and with proper grammar and no spelling mistakes if you ask it intelligently I promise I don't miss anything I see everything but just do it in a beautiful way where then it makes me want to answer you know otherwise it looks like you're desperate and then I don't want to answer you and that girl that you've been trying to reach doesn't want to answer you it's a [ __ ] mess so just do it do it right okay she's gonna be lit oh thank you Sam for dropping the link in the chat [ __ ] yeah put should we put him on a timeout put user on a timeout should we

ask a perfect question delete up now I'm kidding don't delete them in that case um okay let's see what else we got we had so many technical difficulties there guys I'm sorry Aaron got ear pods Dempsey says yes he has black ear pods but wanna says you both are looking amazing thank you we try McNish says everyone dislike very fast what a distasteful comment McNish it's okay we love you guys anyway is PyCharm good for Python coding okay let's see golden honey says been done it awesome golden honey I hope you've signed up for our sing thingamajigger that we linked you guys to Devon says Oh everybody who signed up drop the word what work should we give them something random Steudle big if you signed up drop the word drop it like it's hot drop the word Steudle Bank in the chat this is how it is spelled this is the official spelling drop that word if you signed up for the six steps to freelance training that we put together for you Abdullah says kasi do you believe that our brains will wear of if we focus too much on productive time twelve plus our coding reading books Jim and ignore other times like hanging out with friends watching movies no your brains will not wear off and you should not ignore hanging out with friends so for example find friends who you can go to the gym with find friends who you could code with that would be fantastic right I go with this guy we go box yeah beats the crap so basically yeah just find friends to do those same things with also you can put a timer at 7 p.m. call your day quits right start your day at 5 a.m. be hyper productive and then at 6 or 7 p.m. call the work day quits and then go hang out with your friends and do fun stuff and there you go that's your secret ok Dempsey says I will register tomorrow because I'm on my phone right now I'm gonna tie right now god damn it Dempsey but we're gonna hold you accountable we're gonna be looking at freaking livestream we're gonna be looking at the email list and if we don't see her name and then we're gonna come after you buddy we're gonna be looking for your name every every 10 minutes we're gonna refresh we're gonna write a Python script to do that hey guys who's down for some live coding right now what if we just did some live coding like created something random would you guys be down for that like if we just worked on a random web scraping project and I linked you that thing at the end and you could use it for whatever it sounds like a terrible idea say no guys say no please I beg you I don't want to do it right Devin says cause II help I got a question I failed my intro to CS degree a Java class I failed and I'm taking it again any tips to learn Java man give me some tips to pass the damn class Devin first of all I want to say that's very depressing you feel the class our condolences Devin at this point what should Evan do should he quit I say no [Laughter] yes I I say yes he should quit okay Devin look man classes don't mean [ __ ] I failed so many classes I couldn't even count them on my fingers hmm yeah don't worry about it just build real stuff okay build real projects most classes that are taught are [ __ ] anyway also college is a [ __ ] scam I've been saying this for as long as I remember you guys all whine like all these people whine over a 50 dollar course from the internet 97 of course oh my god cause use course is 97 whole dollars but people will not flinch paying thousands of dollars for a college class that doesn't teach you any practical skills doesn't teach you business skills the professor hasn't ever worked in a real job and because he cannot find a real job is the reason why he's there as a professor teaching you like you understand that right is pretty [ __ ] up now if dad's not [ __ ] up enough USC it was USC right that the scandal happened with or was it just like all big colleges to Stanford and all that right the scandal yeah you guys know about the college scandal like what Stanford I never yeah there's a huge scandal that just took place so if you guys look up like Stanford scandal or whatever all these people are essentially turns out a lot of the people like the rich parents or paying colleges to enroll their kids into schools these kids aren't even coming in because of grades or skill or talent they're just coming in because of money again now people are gonna be like oh my god money is bad no money's not bad it's just how you use it right that's just the only thing but yeah like that's dad like guys hierarchy is like built into the college system take a look at standardized testing it's the dumbest [ __ ] on the planet like a CT tests and SAT tests which take place in United States are so stupid to get a good result on these tests you have to just practice the test like you understand how useless that is and people spend their time to do that don't play the game opt out you have the chance to opt out and instead use that time to build a lifelong skill that will last these numbers like this clever programmer brand I spent time building instead of spending time practicing a CT test and my same friends who would say to my face that even a monkey I scored like a 19 on my CT which is super terrible I just never studied for a CT my friends who all got a 36 out of a 36 they're super intelligent they would say to my face that even a monkey would score higher than a 19 straight up friends who cared for me would genuinely look into my eyes and would say my friend they would like hold my face and say even a monkey would score a higher than a 19 so apparently my intelligence level is dumber than a monkey's okay but a lot of those friends are now doing a job where they're not as happy making $10 or $14 an hour and it's not even in the field that they wanted the degree that they got doesn't but all to the career that they have and never actually will as depressing as that is and they're stuck in that nine to five grind that soul crush of doing something that they never dreamed of and are gonna become a person that they never wanted to become and eventually what does that do that builds resentment and ultimately it builds resentment towards yourself and ultimately leads to a very dark in very sad life a life filled with regrets so don't worry about the little f you got man there the life that life is much bigger like that one class is just one little tiny blip it has zero impact on your life so I hope Devon that that helps clear your mind okay let's see did anybody writes doodle pink oh oh my god that is hilarious I totally overlooked that oh my god wow these people are like dropping the links and [ __ ] to the crowdcast I love you guys you guys are [ __ ] so sexy I swear to god I'm gonna make golden honey opera moderate as long what if golden honey just goes and deletes all our videos okay how much money do you get from Google for having 331 thousand subscribers you get money based on views that you accumulate so on average I get thousand to two thousand dollars a month from YouTube it's not much YouTube ad revenue is like nothing if you ever want to start a business don't focus on YouTube ad revenue it wouldn't matter until you get you get bajillion views you should focus on like building things and then selling those things so offer like for example we offer courses at clever programmer that help people turn into developers no this is a very real business problem we solved and we have students who are who went to our courses and started making one hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year and saved up 20k and got jobs for ninety thousand dollars a year or more so it works that's why people pay us work with us and then will pay us even more to be in our premium programs so if you are creating a channel or a personal brand you want to make sure that it is something where you are not just doing it for subscribers and ad revenue but you have a service that you can offer or a product that you can offer that actually helps real people get real results otherwise it's gonna get real tricky Steudle banks doodle pink this is so funny dude Devin says while you forgot about my question Devin [ __ ] you I literally spent like an hour on your question I'm blocking Devin or maybe like he maybe it was maybe there was lag okay we still love you Devan just kidding all right let's see will smoking weed make me a worse programmer probably not I don't think so you you think so this smoking pot will make you a worse programmer no might actually make you a better programmer you might have syntax errors but you might also be working on really cool projects yeah so I don't know like you got to really figure it out there I personally don't smoke I personally don't drink I like to be very clearheaded always and I'm always the designated driver but I have nothing against people who smoke mmm I just never will do it but yeah this good stew you should try it out and see where you perform better and log it okay and then see where your ear better all right so it's doodle Bank oops strudel Bank oops make video on projects are you 120 a.m. here yep it's 1130 p.m. here all right let's see yes live coding will be lit oh my god so many people are saying yes yes yes let's go to live coding totally a terrible idea to say yes to tones say yes say no this guy says bloody damn well said about colleges you just poured out the feeling from my heart khazi good very good and you guys you guys got to ask better questions I'm like skimming through and not finding lots of good questions so that's why I'm skipping them but if you guys ask good questions we will address them like four examples one you just keeps asking about like if we can help him set up IDE and add him like like new what when do you expect us to do like we're gonna just jump off this livestream and be like yo bro like let's go but okay otherwise the same question you asked me just YouTube it okay we're Google it but ask me something I can answer you here not so that I'd have to jump off and then go on a oneonone you know Skype session with you because that's not gonna happen right now yeah okay Devin now you've set something else that triggers me okay I'm gonna [ __ ] go hard on this so let's read Devin's question everybody together and let's all get triggered Devin says I got a teacher right now that I got a super easy teacher and I will pass but then I have to take Java which then I'll be screwed lawl I am 100 agree with 100 percent agree with you that uni or university is bad but it's what my parents want now here's what I'm gonna say that a lot of you are gonna love okay [ __ ] your parents and I mean that with a lot of respect okay I love my parents I deeply appreciate them I deeply respect them mmm 60 to 70 percent of what drives me to do it at what I do drives me to do what I do in life is because of my parents and the goals I want to achieve or for my parents I want to be able to just get them a house and go boom here you go they're going right now to Saudi Arabia for a few days so I am I want to handle all of their expenses so I'm gonna be doing that too but what what I mean by [ __ ] your parents is in a very respectful way actually which means that you they're not living your life you have to go on to live your life for the next 60 70 80 years you can choose to do something that makes them happy makes you miserable which in the long run is gonna lead you to resent them because they helped you make the wrong choice for your future and then you're gonna lead a shitty life and then you're gonna blame it on your parents and that resentment is gonna show in which case ultimately your parents don't want you to have a bad life ultimately their goal but you have to understand at a deeper level what their goal is their goal they don't care about university they care about you having a good great incredible life University is the only way that they can think of that might be helpful and beneficial to you they can't think of something else because maybe in their paradigm shift and in their lifestyle they never figure it out those opportunities so if look at your parents objectively and tell me are they where you want to be are they the person you want to be and again I'm not talking about like if your parents are very emotional creatures and very emotional beings and they're very empathetic and they're super like amazing and happy going I'm not talking about that I'm talking about like are your parents of the financial level where you want to be or your parents at you know in different things in life where they want to be and if those things you want a model then for sure just do everything that they say but if you believe that there's a better way there's a way for you to achieve more then you have to listen to the people who have those results so for example my parents are incredible at being respectful my parents have an incredible amount of they have incredible amount of determination for what they do and drive and fire so all those things I go to my parents to learn just whatever they say I just listen so I can get those attributes and qualities in my life but my parents aren't at the financial level where I want to be at so I'm not gonna take their advice on those things I still can love them I'm now gonna take my mom's advice on running a marathon or being healthy because she doesn't have those things so you need to at some point understand what are the great things you can take from your parents still respect them love them but then what are the things you need to model from other people who have the results you want to have in life okay so don't be a lazy idiot who is just gonna do something because their parents want and you're also being lazy because you don't want to figure it out I mean that's a real answer and this is about your life so if you want to have a life that's just determine by other people and you just want to be a leaf in the wind and just like let either your parents or your external environment or this person or that person determine what you do for the rest of your life go on but if you want to take your life in your control and live a life where you can help then make an impact in other people's lives and you have that positive impact in the world then you have to take control of your life all right then you can't be just leaf in the wind just be like oh just because my parents wanted this or my teacher told me I should do this you need to take responsibility okay and with responsibility the decisions you make you have to take the punishment or whatever it is that comes with that too so when I came from a family which is also very cultured so when I decided to drop out of college you guys have no [ __ ] idea how hard it was to deal with my family and deal with my parents and get through that but I did it because at that point that was a right decision that I made for myself with my thoughts and that I thought that was the best okay again I'm not encouraging you to drop out of college I'm just encouraging you to think independently not be [ __ ] lazy and let other people think for you because ultimately you have to understand that their goal is with your happiness and your success their goal is not so you go to college but they just don't trust you enough to make the right decision because up until this point in your life you probably haven't done that much to make them trust you but for me when I was already making a sixfigure income or close to a sixfigure income and then I started wanting to focus on my own business and I dropped out of college my parents were able to quickly then support me in whatever I was doing cuz they're like okay now he's not an idiot he's not gonna be famished and hungry and starving and jobless and homeless he actually knows what he's doing so with little steps right they ended up believing in me and then I ultimately want over their support and then it changed the trajectory of my life even though that was very difficult right now Devin you are taking the path of what's called the least resistance all right that's all you're trying to do you're just trying to flow through life like a leaf in the wind the wind goes this way or like oh this is what my parents want and I don't want to take Java but I'm just gonna take it again and maybe I'll just fail it again and I'll just take it with the same teacher again and just [ __ ] just a leaf in the wind and it's brutal hearing this because I just see this so many times like you're just gonna have this over the course of years it's just gonna be a life that you don't want so if you want to change something you need to change a [ __ ] now all right and it means you need to start thinking independently you need to start making decisions independently you need to look up to mentors that have the results that you want and you still need to be respectful and you still need to be grateful and you still need to show up for your family every single day I swear to God if you say that I haven't answered your question I will [ __ ] come after you now all right let's move on lots of students this is one hour plus live it is lit is it first time this is amazing guys Thank You Yosh for your support I love that thank you Sam for jumping and supporting thank you golden honey for supporting I love all you guys for being here and supporting it because it makes us want to go and we you guys asked us awesome questions it just makes us also want to be there with you guys golden honey says I'm alcoholfree which is pretty cool wow you had a lot of questions in that time frame so I'm gonna go down pretty fast dodododododo what model microphone are you using I'm using a Yeti regular Yeti Yeti Pro I believe okay let's see Devin says law help him set up the IDE Thank You Aaron for making videos on clever program good job Aaron what are your thoughts on podcasting any advice and starting out a podcast on Python or AI Sam I know you start a YouTube channel stick with that [ __ ] focus on one thing and just go and then next year we can talk about podcasts cs50 sandbox doesn't work or is it just me it's probably just you just kidding I don't know look it up no don't blog Devin golden honey no good Devin is great cold and honey songs off with your head Jesus your old buddy moderators want gone wild we should have a channel called moderators gone oh yeah good okay you got a rise above aim high that's right make it short because you have many questions [ __ ] you entropy start your own livestream I'm kidding entropy I love you say it says very bloody well said cause II think you appreciate it I'm trying to get to some more questions

your mind and jump in alright Aaron and I are both gonna put this training together for you guys and also we're gonna get some guy one day not on this training but pretty soon aaron has a developer a developer who works at Google and we're gonna get him on our YouTube platform and talk about how to get a job at Google so if you guys are interested in that you know drops of love for that in the YouTube chat so we know that's something that might interest you but cool so we got some questions coming in all right how about whoa what excites you waking up in the morning and keep hustling how do you get that dopamine rush I love the dopamine rush okay that's my favorite phrase hey man don't tell on my secret all right guys yeah let's go come on oh man I should do like a deadlifting okay hold

guys I'm trying to see if we can like put up a video for you guys or something and that could be pretty cool do you think it'll work you know this is gonna be lit alright let's give it a try let's talk about the job opportunity for software developers and how this market is growing and what your future can be looking like so right now python is the number one language of 2017 and by 2020 it's actually going even higher Instagram YouTube Spotify reddit Hipmunk events break off of Python so think about all the things that are built with Python you guys know what Google is built with Python and what your future can be looking like so right now python is the number one hey guys they're like somebody's wait why is this still playing that's kind of crazy where is this playing but it's Oh on YouTube all on YouTube on YouTube okay okay all right all right sorry I think we blew up some people's ears probably but um but yeah as you guys saw that video I've been repping Python since 2017 all right since 2017 so Python all day this 2017 baby so you guys better stop sleeping on it the trend is on the up buddy up all right so you wanna you wanna and Python is hotter than ever right now so that's why you want to make sure that you take advantage of learning Python and especially now the world is moving with Python there's a lot of data stuff happening all right so when you learn things like reading writing data CSV files becoming a data analyst becoming a Data Miner data scientists are really powerful things you can do with Python but not just that it could become a web development with Python and learn things like Django or flask and web development frameworks or learn skills like web scraping and do tons of freelancing gigs so there's a lot of opportunity for you okay this is it's pretty awesome what's available golden honey says can I be a permanent operator sure if you come on yeah live streams yeah why not 56 registered people at this event so if you haven't signed up

you how to become a freelancer with Python in six steps and I'm gonna show you how I became a developer and how you can become a badass Python freelancer as well so if you want to do that make sure you sign up on the link that we provide it to you and that's gonna be really cool thank you golden honey to always drop that link right on cue and Sam I really appreciate you as well and if you have signed up just drop one more time Steudle doodle and after that we are gonna continue and we're gonna try to do something with coding and let's just see what we do okay if it's like something crapped and that's what you guys get if it's something cool we'll do something cool but just go and register if we get let's say 70 people to register then I'm gonna work on like an OK project if we get 80 people to register I'll work on like a kind of a cooler project and if we get hundred people in register we'll work on an app live and then I'll link you guys the app to at the end so there you go that's your gift that's your gift we're making them some deals here Steudle Banks doodle doodle Stu G imagine this is like how I imagine if this is how like all our comments look like from now on bang calm no I said Steudle bank it your mind out of the gutter Drupal Bank it is happening here okay let's see how much people faces 67 people rich alright we will continue let's go let's do some thing with the Python training all right can't what should we call it let's call it man whoa doodle Bank you know you know what would be a terrace you know I'll be a terrible idea if I shared the link to this coding thing with everybody and let them code into it what it would that be a terrible idea yo what a feeling created like the next leg called Tron or something okay I'm just gonna do that this sounds like a stupidass idea but I'm gonna I'm gonna start a session and then on language of mm or the session by honey honey er it's actually not already even like this higher Instagram you to art session modify so you get it come anymore and bright ovals built on if you're civil you're gonna think about in ball the guys know what granny has right will it so it's really up to you hi thon but I would search that sounds like a disastrous idea but let's do it now if this market is growing and what your future say invite there's now a breath on copy this link the amber one humming get ready mm to the live stream and by bottling bunny it's actually going even higher than Instagram YouTube will break ah defy Reddit Hipmunk Eventbrite is built off of Python so I think about all the things that are built with Python do you guys know what Google is built with the right way Python let's talk about the job opportunity for side sleepers and how this market is growing and what so right now Python here comes this RV number one language of 2017 and by tuning lis what actually God's even bowed higher Instagram YouTube Spotify has led Italy Hipmunk Eventbrite here is built on the stuff from coding think about all the things that are built in Python know what Google is built with inception Python wait what let's talk about the job opportunity folks off for developers and playing stupid video deleted it sorry guys okay we're gonna go we're gonna stay in screen capture pretty much the whole time so there we go check your sound to voices okay now the sound should be fixed I'm sorry guys some difficulties we were having sound should be fixed so let's go how many people there's another video playing it should be fixed now okay so let's code up something okay let's do this well first of all I have to get beautiful soup I think beautiful soup I need beautiful soup version for hold on I'm gonna stop sharing my screen for just one second and I just got to get that one file from um Jim Assad that he emailed me and then we should be good to go so let me just copped at cuz there's a specific there something with beautiful soup for that we want to make sure we get right beautiful soup for actually let me just right I'm Jed all right so here we go all right Sandra plet I want to write this for my requirements that txt and then what does he have here we'll copy this I'll bring it back all right I'm gonna go to my file and paste hit run all right we're good so let me go back to the thing and then turn this off okay now you guys should be able to see my screen all right so hopefully you guys see all this code that I've added over here can you guys hear me is there still something wrong with the audio hello they say you have another video playing realtime should be fine now right can you guys hear me clearly oh yeah words don't have lag so if I chat they can probably hear me a lot clearly all right so this is audio is fine now great I have to zoom out actually on this so then they can see it let's see how that looks give me one second guys I'm just trying to see how to zoom out looks all right that looks a little bit better all right great so everything looks good now everything is fine all right so we got all this goddamn it yo don't got you beat there buddy don't do not ko it in here man did not do not do not code in here I knew this was a terrible idea I can spectate him but I cannot kick him out all right guys working out to s yeah it just takes one bad apple man one bad apple that's really all it takes so your your your guys's privileges have been taken all right so let's focus now all right sorry so we have we have beautiful soup here and what can we do a beautiful soup you might be asking well you can do a lot and what we're focusing on is web scraping all right so we're gonna start taking down websites and just beautiful souping them so let's go to Sam's studios.com studios.com like that so that's his website let's just have some fun with it and let's see what we can do so I'll go back and I will say I will also use a request library so requests requests what does that mean that it you have to say HTTP requests requests library Python yeah this is what it should really be so let's go back in packages type in request ah there we go requests HTTP for humans and hit plus sign on that and that should install it okay perfect so there we go and let's go do a beautiful soup and request tutorial I just have to make sure that the first few lines of code are right because sometimes I forget them so you just literally can look them up it's not a big deal so import requests is what I need let's go back to work let's go here so I need to import requests let's pop that above that and what I want to do is I want to do something like this except I'm gonna do it with same ohms website so it the HTTP part here I'm gonna say bought a BAM bought a boom like that and then let's see what does it say here beautiful soup okay all right so some the guy just did C is equal to result dot contents and then two beautiful soup he just feeds C so let's give that a try ok cool it looks like we're accessing Sam's website now yes we are pretty cool is everybody getting litter what the [ __ ] is going on sounds good it's fine now this [ __ ] healthcare all right cool good good good good man so we got we so we can see Sam's website rightly if I go to Sims thing right here and I go like view page source then I all this code that I see here is essentially the code I'm seeing here which is what we want now these are all links right like intro hobbies Tech contact if I click it it takes me somewhere so intro takes me to this thing if I hit hobbies it takes me to another these are like all anchor tags or whatnot and those are all the links right I don't see any at least with my mouse I don't see any other links and with my eyes I don't see so I just imagine there's four links so there's essentially four a tags in here so what I can do is I can just look for all of the a tags okay so let's go back to this thing and let's just get the a tag so it's kind of like this essentially all a tags so I'm gonna copy this line go here and paste it so you guys can see how you can even use other people's tutorials and scripts to build things together you don't always have to remember because I certainly don't but I just build it as I go the whole thing would like build the plane as you fly it so I'm gonna I'm gonna do this I'm just gonna say you'll find all the a tags okay so all links let's call it that I'm gonna hit run and oh yeah I got a print all links so all set print all links I got a turn on BIM this is too weak for me and then you know I'll go here comment this up what happened oh so now what you see let me just make sure everything is going it's fine now thank you for putting the crowdcast link guys appreciate it this guy says was a joke but it's a medication I think only took it a couple of times for anxiety alright hopefully you're okay potato chips okay yeah we can take entity cube says can you take PewDiePie sub count from social delayed yes I can so let's try that that sounds pretty cool just go to social let's go to social blade look at what you've done I don't understand why our subscribers are going down we're making more videos literally makes zero sense but whatever actually I'm happy but let's go to PewDiePie pewdie diet what did I do pew die pie pew die pie okay so let's take this page and let's scrape this page by the way with Sam exempt Sam's example you can see that all the link tags we have in a list here all right and I can even print them out so let's just go like a little bit further with this example and we'll just say like for for a link in all links print link and let's comment this out so we'll just print link so you can see on each line it gives us so he has this link which is anchor tag so he has an anchor tag for intro hobbies Tech contact which is what we expected and then his entire website actually has a lot of other links as well so which we can I assume see if we go back to his website and so you can see he has other links like full stack developer link so this is a medium link he has a Vimeo link he has a youtube link and that's why you see a Vimeo link here you see a youtube link here you see his resume and all that good stuff right so there's that now you guys excited about this you guys getting the heebiejeebies or what you guys can clone this too like I can give this to you guys right now and you can actually clone it so I'll share this with you in the link in the chat just click that and that should take you to where you want to go that that'll give you like the access to this code and I'll give you access this code at the end too so don't worry now let's do that social blade thing that we wanted to do so we can look up PewDiePie's sub count or whatnot so let's go back yeah let's do result okay something stupid like that we're gonna reuse a request library to get this okay so C 2 is equal to result that content and these are terrible names by the way should never name anything like this what but I'm making my videos a terrible name yeah never ever okay no parser was specified so it gave me it yelled at me so you will specify an HTML parser so you can stop yelling at me you little [ __ ] sprint okay now we will do print soup too and let's just see what soup is this should be like the socialblade stuff on the PewDiePie's page alright too many things going on here now let's go to this thing and we will go inspect like that do two hundred and sixtyfive thousand subscribers every day 20 billion views we're coming after you PewDiePie get ready 165 thousand subscribers every day bro 90 million humans that's insane what's crazy okay so let's click here and we're gonna go on to his subscriber account right actually there's a live subscriber count thing that we can actually get to so where does that live right here realtime so let's go back to this let's change this link with this link slash realtime hit that thing and let's hit inspect elements I will click this button and then I'll hover over this div so this is a div and the class is containment and text Center so I will try to find this particular div essentially so let's do that I'll just do for now all div soup dot find all divs prints all divs and unprinted this I can see what's going on wait that's not I want it div there we go alright that should get me all the divs in here I should see what was it called containment contain oh I can't I control F on this okay hold on why is it still saying Sam studios ah soup too hence the beautiful act naming conventions that I've been using alright so this is giving me all of the divs and I wonder if it allows me to pass a class like that oh I think it does man I'm so smart I love this containment yep so this is what we're looking for a containment and does it allow me to dig a level deeper and go well let's go containment and share like that man I'm now we're getting somewhere it's just so good it's [ __ ] riveting we're gonna do containment and then we're gonna do Tech Center instead so let's try the text all right so now we're getting close ok we can see the sub count right here 90 million sixty nine thousand two hundred and seven right so now okay how many items is that div have so let's just do order this list cuz it's just a list at the end of the day so let's do Len it just has one item oh [ __ ] I didn't mean to do that I hope that's not what I meant to do there let's run that again okay so since there's only one item I just need to dig into that item and let's see what I get I obviously get that item and now I just need to dig deep enough to get this guy so trying to think with beautifulsoup how would I I can do like all divs that find something like all divs dots find I can do class okay let's see what it's saying you're probably treating a list of items like a single item but we only have one item oh wait oh oh I gotta index that by zero and now gotta do text probably something like text I think [ __ ] hell yeah baby whoo I don't know how realtime it is though no it's not well it caches it I think it doesn't keep making our requests every time we fix that how to not cache beautiful so requests I don't know got control okay sure hmm okay let's try that it doesn't sound like that should work but can't hurt no that doesn't work either hmm wait what's going on did anybody lose their [ __ ] in the chat yet oh [ __ ] they can't see there you go my bad Wow all our genius was lost by the way guys sign up for the class that we have this is the class boom poppin it in right there well should be able to see now right yep so there you go we got the live subscriber count' from his channel I think what if I because what's happening is that request is only really requesting it one time I want able to keep requesting it maybe maybe a realtime data with requests library in Python hmm none of this is bringing up the stuff that we want well while we look that up just know that most of your problem is solved which was essentially getting that 90,000 number or whatever and if you are using if you're using Django then you can even make an app and then just display this on the front end and make this look nice right so that would essentially that could be the next step and then it just essentially turns into an app and then every time you refresh it or every time somebody comes to it it runs and then it displays the number of subscribers that you have and you can use this to display any number of things or pull information but generally what people use requests and beautifulsoup for is oftentimes to scrape websites so for example people want to scrape like say ebay.com and they want to be able to go to like the page where their deals and they want to be able to scrape like all these deals here right so so basically they want to scrape all these deals here and I mean this could be a cool thing to make a video on right yeah like imagine that it's creepy yeah like scraping Craigslist for a Python oh yeah what do you guys think about that if you guys think it's good idea drop it in the chat so like scraping yes scraping best deals for like a scraping eBay with Python scraping eBay with Craigslist in 2019 without a college degree to get a job that would be a great title yeah I think that would be pretty good so I don't know you guys let me know what you guys think but essentially you want to be able to scrape this type of data and then write it to a CSV file so we can actually show you guys how you can scrape this and then write this to a CSV file if that would tickle your pickle then drop in a comment below tickle and either either you can drop in the comment below tickle or you can drop pickle but only one thing in the comments yo this guy knows how to do live stream he's like go to OBS and hit ctrl F to stream fullscreen I'm in Wirecast but let me try that anyway ctrl F what if there's like a feature that just says like go fullscreen idiot oh that could be pretty useful whoa overlays clock image causal scoreboard text damn discovering new features wait hold on I want my screen cast back whoa everything is gone hold on guys technical difficulties man I knew I shouldn't have chased a shiny object wait is it screen capture no right there we go we're back that was weird um okay we're back so thinking that in the middle I dragon that little over stuff but doesn't it look like it's full screen now somehow that makes no sense where did everything go there we go that was simple yeah we finally figured it out guys it just showed this part okay so quickly when I flip the screen look for this they can write we still can't see is so painful who said tickle somebody said tickle somebody said pickle fixed just offset just do it boy somebody said does it update when you loop it no it doesn't have it doesn't update it's just not updating scraping eBay good video practical use okay thank you scraping LinkedIn jobs yep scraping eBay data for prices video live code with explanations is the best I think tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle wait why did we ask them to say tickle Oracle there was a reason because I said I said if if it tickles your pickle yeah yeah why why did we say take a your pickle yeah which one of you guys this guy goes this is hilarious this guy another guy goes how many hours should we cut every day and then potato chips goes you should code at least 25 hours at all for the eBay idea okay okay for the eBay idea I said if the EBI idea sounds like a good idea then say if it tickles your pickle then either said tickle or pickle but it was for the EB idea thank you mangia nation thank you thank you it was very important for us to know that okay so should we do the eBay example so we just did the scraping we scraped scrape scrape be scrapped okay so I'm gonna drop this in the chat this is the link for the code you guys can get access to the code that I just wrote to get PewDiePie's PewDiePie's subscriber count' so you guys can do that right now now we're gonna do we're gonna do a new rep lit and I'm gonna say Python and let's do this thing let's go Jango you know this one's gonna be called tickle your pickle eBay guide eBay guide alright uh I hope you're excited let's [ __ ] do this thing can zoom in a little bit more if you guys can see the full screen say full screen I can see I mean just so I can see full screen that's better why did we give them like tickle for web scraping for a job alright so let's focus now guys this is gonna be rough oh yeah yeah so first of all we're gonna go into packages and do requests and hit plus sign right here and then we're gonna do a beautiful soup just like that we're gonna hit enter so we got beautiful soup we got requests and what's cool is you guys can actually go to this website right now this is gonna go screen full see I can yes thank you Sam for hiding and deleting stupid messages full screen I can see okay we're on rappelled iit so these guys are actually going to the app right now by the way this is the app this app is live so how [ __ ] crazy is that first of all can we just discuss that repli'd is so awesome that we just launched the app live in literally two seconds it's live like you guys can go to it you guys don't understand how sick that is um alright moving on Ripley oh yeah rep rep lit yeah that's true fire oh that's true we should do that you should do that why does it say no module ps4 wasn't that's how the other one was kind of lost here wait the other one was ps4 and put a beautiful soup right wait hold on why can't let me let me why can't we put our face in here to like so they can see us like that why haven't my god alright II was so low but what if they miss out on something should we put ourselves on the bottom left or keep it on bottom right right yeah okay like that and keep it small right it doesn't get in their way okay so let's go here and I'm just trying to find that's what we had beautiful soup I'm just gonna copy this code for a second and paste it who was holy [ __ ] yeah you're right so funny why isn't it doing it okay I'm just gonna blame it on repli'd so I'm gonna start another one guys I was gonna be called no it's gonna be called tickle your pickle but this one is gonna be non Django so this is gonna be the right version we're just gonna ignore the last one that was a mistake because I think with Django request library has some runs into some errors there so those requests not request library but the beautifulsoup library so first let's just put all this code here and let's make sure it runs request is not defined so we're gonna do import requests okay so that worked and we got my boys number that's good wait hold on if it's pulling it from here if i refresh this that sounds like a really stupid thing oh because like you see how when i refresh it it does this ah okay so no it will automatically do it the right way if once they updated on their end yeah I think this is probably like probably like a rate of subscriber count' average and they're just faking this that's not actually right no that's right that's it is right it is right it is right but you see how it isn't the start when i refresh the page that's the number we're getting so social blade updates that number every like a few hours I think so once they update that we will so like it the code is fine the code is fine I can sleep at night now we're gonna grab ebay and we're gonna delete this guy let's just keep that here and for this we're gonna pop in Mary Poppins eBay deals instead let's actually clean up everything so this everything looks clean here like that like this that did to put a Bambaataa boom alright and now we're gonna say eBay page is equal to result dot content I'm gonna say eBay page do a parser there alright we're gonna just run this for now and then I'm gonna say prints soup holy crap so we got lots of stuff back we got lots of stuff but what's cool is you can see that we're getting back pricing back prices and stuff too which is kind of what we wanted it says something was $5.99 is there anything $5.99 here and let's look $5.99 there's only one $5.99 right there it's crossed off Rockwood Rockville RBG some crap so see that it's a style strikethrough right so that's it looks correct so we are getting the right yeah we're getting the right things right and for now let's just have it print out all the item names how about that seven print out all the item names let's also manually count up all the items that are showing up here so 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so 8 times 3 so 24 feature deals better right up front Oh actually there's too many to [ __ ] count nevermind so I'm not gonna count it like that but let's just have it print out item names let's go and inspect and we will hit this and it will just hit here so he bait you i ellipsis to Ebay you i ellipsis to i bet there's some kind of container these are a part of so zoom out here a little bit and we will head inspect hmm okay so that's the whole page that's the div we want the thing that contains all of this that's the one we want right that's the one we want yep so we want and how much does it highlight does it even keep going down nope that's perfect that's what we want these 20 what is it 24 items that's it so let's say we want these 24 items so this is the class name that we're going after so what I'm gonna say is I'm gonna say like soup dot find all and then I will say divs so find all divs and then within that find this class okay great so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna say I'm gonna say featured items and then paste that code there and here I'll say featured items featured items like that print damn man didn't really need to install it every single time around the code so these are all the featured items can we prettify this [ __ ] because it doesn't looks ugly oh my bad wait hold on I think it's supposed to be like dot prettify no that doesn't make sense either soupedup prettify so it was a soup object you can predefine it whatever it's not showing it to me that's okay so prettified or not I can see that there's a lot of items let's do what is this is this a list or what is it I think it's a list but let's do type results set what does that mean so let's do element 0 does it give me element 0 yes it does ok battery tender Junior 12 volt is that in the right direction 12 volt 12 volt you see anything with battery right there ha so the list is in not any particular order it seems like but this is the image alt description the title that's what we want right where it says title is equal to ass I think it means class alright so we essentially want this where it says title what is the title is it part of that mmm div image are you following okay yeah h3 okay so h3 and with nh3 there's titles so I can do dot find h3 title maybe like that all right so now nh3 we are getting ourselves oh you're probably but didn't I tell it to get me oh this actually selects that oh okay you're right yeah yeah so that makes sense that that makes that's pretty good then right because we do on battlefield we are you trying to figure out everything on the future deals are just one thing everything right I mean I was in this featured card that's what I wanted oh I think I chose the wrong one yes what I wanted like I just wanted everything within this box like from here yeah yeah to here that's it yeah okay so I just I just chose the wrong thing I meant to choose this class you know so now it should be a little bit better well hold on it is a div what if I just did not find and then did it like that would it find it what is sin nun getting before the battlefield one which did was it down here at this list it was that one there I know I I did this so you need to do that one and see how this there is nested you have to like go one div with it you have to go within that div and then down to the future do but it shouldn't be like that it should just be able to let me because then otherwise why didn't I have to go to this div you know what I mean fair enough or the div above that I put the other did you had before and see if find it works with it the Devi had before the battlefield one it was this future card maybe there's that work we only find wait now even this is saying the same thing this is doing the same error to know what that makes no sense is it something like we're scraping it and now eBay is stopping us or something is there something we're unable to fetch data from eBay and beautifulsoup let's see I think I don't know almost feel like eat go back because we're literally have the same lines of code consistent bugs are there's a very inconsistent bug now it could it could have to do with repli'd or it could have to do with but I don't think it's a repli'd bug I think it's just a bug that we've because I can try with pycharm refreshing the eBay page okay so eBay scraping new Python file eBay training training okay hold on let's just go one step at a time before freaking out because I'm what's her freaking out let's check the YouTube chat maybe somebody figured it out somebody I highly doubt it I laugh like six people figured it out like highly doubt it you're screaming at us right now used to it is that'll be fun okay fine let's see what did I do is there a distinction what I know is I keep what what are you serious Wow wait hold on did we just make like a dumb mistake like it's that these guys talking about do these guys know something I don't know he just posted a link to no that's regex no this this is not reading guys no not even cheating we're not doing regex right now like son of python no bit of cleverness our army what tax other person is doing they're fine dolls you're know it it's Finers for all i guys i've been typing and find all the whole time this is how the real life of a programmer looks like I think the main thing to retain here is the steps to figure out a problem by searching and trying so thanks a lot for this kind of videos yes you are welcome this is what programming looks like guys it's not find all one word what are you guys talking about like that's regex and we're not doing regex right now look I even did it and it gives you an error I hate walnuts okay let's go one step at a time you have anything better Aaron oh thank you yes oh my god Oh hold on hold on hmm okay okay all right hold on let me go to beautiful soup and just read their freaking documentation for a second okay find all a going down hmm okay so so if I did a class name it just it wouldn't work hmm right that's what that's why I'm so confused like wasn't it was working before you spam undo like they're like yes some are with Kazi hello there guys maybe I should just do this on like twitch all day eBay logo seriously what went wrong did you have the featured items at zero the whole time no no I doesn't I didn't even have done anything bro I had as empty in this class oh [ __ ] for some reason that liked that one yeah oh wait what if i refresh this page the name of these things change that can't be possible right there's no way there's no [ __ ] right no it's the same we're hold on wait wait wait wait why did I have you see ad says eBay UID any item featured card why does here where I'm highlighting it says it twice just go back if this works somebody also stupid we weren't stupid that was a dumbest [ __ ] ever what was that what is that why yeah this guy's like I was working earlier it was working earlier yeah it was working oral yeah oh wow seventy six signups for the six steps to freelancing wait that's not what I meant to copy/paste I meant to copy/paste this I'm sorry yes mark you can go do it alright so now with that stupid problem out of the way Oh Lenovo mmhmm but where's the title wait why am i doing it like a juvenile why don't I you know what I mean like I need to look inside of this thing so I can do fine so within that I can do find all of these guys you see what I'm saying so within this container I can say find all of these just this and this and this you get it right like that and that and they have the same name so I can say within this giant container find all of these little containers yes I'm gonna get a list of those exactly mmhmm it's all about drilling deeper and deeper that's not even tasteful let's keep it tasteful drilling for data bro with other dibs right obviously yes I think shouldn't it be like okay let me just do this for now find all instant wait oh wait no no okay I see what the problem is what's happening I don't want to [ __ ] call it at zero so that's what I want to do instead because I don't have to drill like why am i drilling like why am i drilling into here and then into here why don't I just drill here directly and you get all of these because there won't be more in other in other areas oh oh oh right right that was that's why I wasn't doing that yeah you're right hold on let's see I mean oh you're right you're right you're right okay you're right you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah yeah no no no no no you're right you're right dude when you're right just [ __ ] on it all right [Laughter] okay so fine fine fine that right like that this guy just gave us all the code let's try what entity Huber said um I don't want to cheat I do all that smacking on my bed my bed I'm known to smack like sorry sorry alright one focus let me focus so wait what happened here didn't I oh wait hold on something went wrong just gonna give me an error so I just gotta do because um I had this twice again this twice again somehow alright now we're getting somewhere for not the length of item seal meter there should be 24 yeah right let's print out the length of items you're right yes we're getting close it should be 24 yeah hmm no scraping is always like this it just makes you feel stupid it's it's like just weird stuff it's so addictive it's like a game dude we should just do these live streams and then like work on our own fun project hey guys I need help with their homework that's a great reason to build the YouTube channel just a store YouTube classes it's your classes but YouTube all right so what what are we doing I'm lost okay okay so now we just need to print out titles right for loop all right so let's see here we got this box and now within this we got the span eBay UI ellipsis we're doing just for consistency sake okay now I'm gonna do print items of 0 let's see what I get so that should give me the first one right that should give me that essentially give me Lenovo that's what she said 23 inches you can also use black light oh yeah we're making progress all that's macking cause you're right look at this because I keep saying you're right because the cause of your rest is 6 good job Stream Python yes Ilana's because have I been speaking that quietly have I been speaking that quietly tonight we going on ASM all your brains yes mr your brains alright guys now I hate that voice hold on aa title right here hmm let me try that title and I hope I get empty string back empty list back wait doesn't help at all none it's like when you're not educated on the documentation and you just like keep trying or so god yeah it's much more fun that way much more satisfying alright that makes much more sense that it's that's this is much smaller yeah do you see title anywhere not at all description that's not was idle h3 right in the h3 and the h3 tag format yeah because that's what I was trying to do earlier trying to format it alright so now we're gonna do dot find h3 h3 h3 and then we'll do title I think that should work should I do all oh wait should I do all because I'm getting oh no I have to type in the oh no that title won't does title won't work because you can't type in title you can type in like this and then but then that would defeat the purpose yeah what if instead of h3 I wrote title not that won't work either that doesn't work either or what if I did a ch3 and then I'd said dot get title on that oh [ __ ] yes the reveal yeah what's up guys reveal what if like five hours later we have like oh my god this videos against their communities Stander's alright so we got the title whoa Zack you went crazy on that h3 the class of district title yeah that's kind of what we did but we have to do not get title otherwise it didn't work wait dot title should work here uh what am i oh no not like that but like this the title should work here hmm interesting no I wonder why dad okay fine whatever I'm just not gonna question it so much let's just [ __ ] move on all right so we got the title okay so basically what we need to do is I'm gonna write these notes down now so step one get container with all featured items step two loop through each item step three get each items h3 tag and the title from it right that essentially covers the steps so we get the container which is you know so this is like featured items container or something let's name it that featured items container container like that okay so featured items container this was like we said this is step one then now what we're gonna do is we're going to loop through each oh wait get container with all featured items or two yeah yeah yeah I got you I got you get all featured items in a list right like or put them in a list yeah yeah put all featured make sure items in a list given to us as a list right I know we kind of put them in right like we did items I mean we I would just jump at that second line I would just chunk it under number one it's kind of the same logical idea alright whatever programmers don't agree never yeah okay so this is really this step which is boom yeah so we're really just getting all wait we're just getting all featured items within the container right actually that's what we're doing yeah get all featured items in a container yeah okay okay that's better yeah that's much better that's accurate all right and Frankie you'll just edit this video idea that's all we should just do it which is just livestream you just edit them at the end and then we just have full projects that just just supplied by the people for the people how many that's what she said joke so we said in the completely edited videos they don't get any of the jokes all right so now we're gonna loop through each item okay so let's do that yeah with a while loop for item and items print and I'm gonna follow the instructions on this now get each items h3 tag so I'll say item dot find h3 dot get or weight this still has to be 0 right yet so now what we'll do so now we got Lenovo Lenovo adidas ultimate 2.0 tees read the tease we got the rifka Freedman that's pretty cool alright for item in let's do for item for index comma index comma item in enumerate item you know about this you know how this works yeah damn fancy print what is it humor I remember how it works you try and do the formatting that format yeah how does it work again oh I think it's you have the string that you want to do and then dot format and then every parameter within format goes into the brackets in order so I know well where does this this sting go industry right so like that right I think so but then what about the whole you can the string and the string and then you have plus right format okay oh we got we got two oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah good good call good call I remember I'm completely wrong alright so basically we wanted to look like it's say something like one lenovo to Reba to adidas you know what I'm saying that's essentially what I'm trying to do here yeah I think this should work yeah let's try it let's try it and numerate runs from one [ __ ] it alright so because we wanted to start from that will do index plus one does that work alright so starts from one dude programming so cool bro I see try to drag it all it to the left so it looks nice and sexy it should if you go all the way to the left cheating's in one line this is pretty good it's pretty good we can add new lines you want to add new lines like okay we'll add [ __ ] new lines bro you want to get literally will get you lit when I get it thank you Wow we didn't even read zacky's thing but we did it success f does your item crowd dude yeah three hours and she would unlock somebody said the biggest reveal in the shoe hahaha who's the back end persist when it was him when he came in alright now we got to get pricing to right pricing oh my goodness there's more to this that's right yeah let's make go let's stick it in a dictionary so can I do print items let's do the 0th item dot find h3 dot get and what should we do oh uh let's uh well let's just first find it and let's see what it says exactly price would be well it's probably not gonna be an h3 so what we'll do is we'll make a CSV file with like on the Left column like all the products and on the right column their pricing oh yeah we'll make a dictionary and then we'll all right so where's the pricing there's a strikethrough pricing as well this is the real price yeah itemprop price dot get itemprop or we can say get price easily we can probably do like you know US dollars what tag is this in like where's div price item tile yeah div price okay okay dot find div D&E item top price Oh dot prompt to probably dot text after that dot text if I get in one try that'd be crazy but I don't think I will [ __ ] yeah [Laughter] is this actually text or is this a number who cares it's probably text it's a string yes of course it's the strength dollar sign okay so alright so now we have this as well yeah now we can actually put this in our dictionary yeah pandas allows you to make it really easily it allows you to pandas lists to data frame and then take multiple listen to data frame so it makes it really easy it does something like yeah you just give it list one list two just like that that's that easy I love pandas it's [ __ ] awesome so we're gonna go hand us powerful data structures yeah this is the one all right so now we got pandas let's go back and I'm gonna do like import pandas as PD then this line should work data frame and so we can just like use of like list comprehension and create so let's just say like titles so this is essentially gonna be like titles and then this is gonna be like price and there's gonna be title you see what I'm saying or no Sam what is this again when was that midnight all right so let's get this bread now so titles well we just have to use a simple list comprehension to construct essentially guys what we're trying to do is construct a list of all of the titles you see what I'm saying so like a list with like this title and that title and all that so we're gonna say item dot find h3 dot get title for title in offer I don't know I like you from item in items and this will create all the titles and watch us get it all right in one try is this like we can just quit the live stream and just never do anything clover programmer again but if we come over the another project hold on hold on we're almost done guys hold your horses so that will construct that list oh then we need price yeah yeah prices item dot fine div d any item tile price dot text for item in items that's good alright and now there's a line of code we're gonna run it all together we're not gonna test any of this Pano's let's you like using a data frame you can create a dictionary from two lists we just created a data frame yes and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna do or not percentile list this is gonna be like a result final or something and then we're gonna do result final dot to csv and we'll call it like eBay eBay deals dot CSV okay we're gonna try it and hopefully it will all run yeah and we'll just pop up our requirements that text right yes that's what should happen on type object has no attribute text let's see this text here Oh dot find where did you call text before over here at zero you got to put item at zero no but that was cuz I was just trying to get the zero yeah what if some of that what if some of them didn't have this price I mean that's I don't think it's really possible but now cuz we got all the prices what are they saying Wow line 27 is so elegant I do yeah this guy goes this guy says don't ever scream again okay guys by the way thank you for keep on posting that guys the deal is that we have a live training that we're gonna be doing it's called my six step system to becoming a Python freelancer so if you want to join this epic training that we're gonna be putting together for you on Friday then make sure to go in the description and click that link it in ink and sign up don't worry it'll go much better than tonight it's been going yeah awesome yeah which line he said he said line 27 elegant yeah so elegant which line is that line yeah it really is elegant that's why I love list comprehensions but what happened here this became entirely aunt came elephant yeah what is it complaining about D and E item title alright so file first of all we're gonna do print titles and just make sure everything there is correct oh we broke up let you guys Wow are you serious freakin broke oh my god refresh the page Wow so that worked that list comprehension worked by the way I mean obviously should have worked for I okay print item dot find div I just think that there might be one of them that doesn't have you check the link lighting it right yeah one of them is none so we're probably in the list one of them is an object text look it's printing out well how far is it because of the nine look at this [ __ ] it's printing out a bunch of them you know what they must stop at one of them at eleven at twelve so so item 12 must be there must be an issue in item 12 okay so basically what I'm gonna do is this okay there is a simple workaround this we're gonna create prices I'm gonna create an empty list and I'm gonna say if that then I'll say prices that have hand that it's not the cleanest way to do it but gets the [ __ ] job done it gets the food on the table yeah so you understand what I just did yep yeah so this is it checks for like the true nests or something the truth the true dienes is what is Colin Python exactly yeah yep like okay it's [ __ ] smarter than he looks backhanded compliments all day sweet all right let's head that what the [ __ ] happened now puttin just puttin else and just just um else else a pen on the if statement just put else up end price not available it's gotta be the same way when you're calling the data firm so I just put an else statement after but it's still complaining is it you write it I just ran it right now in front of you I just it I'll run it again raise must all be the same length alright so let's uh I will 24 and why is it 100 cuz cuz it's an HD not a further dude it's probably not necessary a bit or maybe it could be yeah yeah it's probably useful yeah alright like undermining your authority I have a degree what are you I studied Tibetan meditation at the University of Himalaya it's gonna be outside the and I'm a little too lean enough after said every developer ever who didn't clean [ __ ] the code to call a ratio is pretty good here so could the comment is just a code no I mean like what's happening now 95 925 it's still throwing the air because it's trying to you're trying to act this is none Adam that item got fine without the dot text is none so I should get rid of the dot text ding ding ding oh dude Wow and their lengths are the same dude I like you dude you [ __ ] good sweet our excel file is made let's download this excel file let's let's give it a try I just downloaded tickle your pickle but a Bambaataa boom [ __ ] oh man this was the most satisfying oh yeah see my l7 was useful oh no this is I mean it it supposed to take that much like it took us only a few hours while we're livestreaming for God's sake trying to explain this ok before we did let us know I'm curious no they didn't figured he goes compute if I were to have another 90 mil all right Thank You guy all the objects have a price that's what I thought except it is SSD apparently see this one doesn't have a price at all yes I see details this is almost gone and then it says see details super annoying so weekend's week what we can say is if if and if not then like we can even put the strikethrough price yeah something like that I mean you can always add to the program right you can always making it better right this is a good Wow there's all my god can we look at that excel file again guys oh snap a t snap son snap a Bradley BLAP all right guys who's ready for tickle your pickle okay let's clean up the code all right this is pretty good and we'll share it with you guys hopefully you're ready for but a bang ready boom and we're going to send it to you right away this guy goes let's go Zack you hopefully that answered your question man Joe is so cool to look like live streamers alright well guys hopefully you had a lot tickle the 23 inch Bakula guys seriously sign up for this freaking training alright we just made a goddamn map so sign up for this [ __ ] yeah yeah so it turns out that they were just hiding its price but ok what is it was for Wirecast we make this fullscreen in front of them alright so hopefully you guys enjoyed that video if you like this video please give this video a like really helps out the channel and it puts our hardware to use and it's a way for you to help us in a very easy way please subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and most importantly sign up for the training the link is in the YouTube description 6 steps to becoming a Python freelancer Frankie wants you to join Frankie do you want him to join you guys should join there you go alright go right ahead sign up and we want to see in that live training we're gonna do on Friday and yeah we love you guys thank you guys so much for being on here as always Julia says this team is amazing I know we just were going strong thank you guys for being here I love your face and as always will see them in the next video
