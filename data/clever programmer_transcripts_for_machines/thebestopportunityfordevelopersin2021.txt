yo what is up guys how's it going this is kazzy from cleverprogrammer.com we are live on youtube we're currently in the pwg call i want to talk about the biggest opportunity that exists for developers in 2021 i'm on a live call and i want to be sharing this opportunity for everybody that is here but in short it's the biggest opportunity for people is to be able to build their own brand and we're going to be talking about that on today's call and we're going to be getting into it oneonone with a lot of people that are on this call so with that said i guess i'm gonna just open the floor hey how's it going dylan priyanshu hi nice we're getting people coming in hey what's going on it's frank hey what's up frank how are you doing man going on nice to have you on here this is exciting so guys i'm super pumped about today and i want to share with you guys a lot of things and at some point i'm going to open the floor up so i want you guys to just jump in and if you guys have questions feel free to like ask them at any any point um and one of the main things i want to talk about is really the opportunity we have to be able to build our own brands as developers and this is something you guys are seeing you guys are seeing probably a lot of have you guys seen a lot of developers channels out there like popping up yeah a lot a lot of channels right they're like tons of channels that are popping up everywhere so what is going on there like even even if i go to youtube right now right you guys have seen traversing media who knows about this channel traversing media right amazing channel uh we have aaron jack i don't know if you guys know about this youtube channel yeah i love that dude right uh he's a good friend of mine we speak quite a bit on instagram we you have uh and then the list just keeps going on what are some of your guys's other youtube channels that you guys really enjoyed simple programmer simple programmer ed dev web dev site yes that's another great channel which one net ninja okay am i sharing the screen with you guys by the way or no not no no no oh i'm not my bad so i'll share the screen okay there we go so free code camp yep and what other ones can you guys think of that you guys enjoy okay so look at that right there are so many channels that are popping up everywhere um and these just keep popping up every single day and so this opportunity at some point felt like will only existed for a few people but this is the opportunity that like i saw when i was drawing clever programmer right i i saw it as oh my god this is something that not only can i learn coding using this because it gives me a platform but i can share my journey and actually grow an audience does that make sense yeah yeah and so you guys don't need to be anybody like crazy special in order to be able to do this like there's so many channels like if i even take you to clever channel right and we actually switch to um and i go right over here and we go to uh let me go to sort by oldest if i go to my oldest videos who has anybody seen here my oldest videos on this channel i have seen like really all of your videos it's wild the progress it's crazy so like take a look at this this video that has 50 000 views this video never got any views for the longest time like ever um this is an odd video how are you even expecting to get views yeah it's a r video and it's so specific week two assignment one right and this video was made for only one person i had a client at the time that i was helping and i made a video just to help him in the video i even say his name so this video was just put up on youtube so he could watch it it wasn't meant for anybody else and like i'll show you this video in r it's called a vector our variable would be for now we're in one on 300 retain the information for a long variable pollutant right so in this now now a lot of you guys might not know r but all that's happening here is i'm teaching something and here this is like a for loop that i wrote okay just like a for loop how many of you in here have heard about or can write a for loop right most of you have heard about it or hopefully have written one for loop or know the difference between while loop and for loop right this is something that you end up picking up really early when you start coding and this is something that i picked up in r but he had trouble with it so all i did is just helped and explain it to him right and what it did is it made him um it made this video apparently this video helped so many people i had no idea like people coming out and they're like this is so helpful i i wish him let me mute guys if everybody could do me a favor if you guys have some sound coming out just please mute yourself and then if you have to say something just jump on in and unmute yourself that would be awesome because you want me to cohost so i can mute people yes please how does that work oh make cohosts okay that was easy thank you thanks thanks brother okay cool all right i appreciate it so if i just keep going right a lot of these people are they found this is what coursera is missing this is not our sunny this is another sunny that used to follow my content back in the day um now they're like boom phd student trying to get my head around r this is a great resource so apparently i was able to help some phd all i knew at that time was how to write a for loop in r and solve that one problem but apparently i was helping a phd along the way see what i'm saying so i put that up um who here has heard of recursion okay some people let me see i'm gonna go through pretty simple yep so for some people it's simple some people have heard about it some people have not when i heard about it four years ago all i decided to do was make a video on it right and then even if you look at my tutorials here that initially got me started they were on really simple stuff like teaching the basics of python but the thing is it may be just my way of teaching worked right whereas like you guys could teach the same thing and for people who connect with you it might work with them have any of you ever taught anything to anyone and they found it helpful raise your hands or just say out loud yep so kazzy i have been tutoring like uh i've been tutoring for in the past one to two months and i've got clients paying me around 100 to 120 wow and how old are you um 14. jeez so you are tutoring people right if what your tutoring is providing help here's the thing that's happening right now right you're tutoring them oneonone right you're working with them oneonone what happens is when you make uh when you have a platform and when you can make a video now you can teach a hundred people at a time or even more like you guys are already helping so many people by just making some videos about uh you guys coding up some applications so that actually inspires me a lot and that was one of the main reasons why i even started off with all this kind of stuff that's what i'm saying if i can help someone then that's i don't even care about money because as long as i'm helping someone that's even better right because i'm just making a video that gives me pleasure that gives me some learning and after oh happy birthday that is sick wow congratulations man that is amazing happy birthday everybody who's watching this on youtube please wish him everybody's on this call just unmute yourself and yell out happy birthday to him birthday bianchu that's amazing thank you all of you thank you guys so much that is awesome that makes me happy that makes me so happy so happy birthday that's awesome i'm happy you're getting clients but you see the power of being able to you know potentially teach in a way where you can be helping a lot more people at a time and like you said you're like i care i don't care that much about the money i actually care more about helping people so there's nothing wrong with charging people and working with them but i think you can also do this at the side is that possible yeah it is actually it is right so like the truth is you know we all feel like there's so much that you need when in reality it's actually like pretty simple the story behind this is let me show you something okay so i'm gonna take you guys behind the scenes have any guys have you guys ever been curious to go behind the youtubers like analytics and see what's going on a good youtuber's analytics yeah okay okay cool all right so let's go here so i'm probably an okay youtuber right eight hundred thirty five thousand subscribers uh we're we're on our way to hitman you're way better than average you know like i've seen so many tech channels who are still struggling around like 50k right i mean you're better than me so that's all i care about so let me show you guys something okay so i'm gonna go into analytics and here's what's going on man i just actually got a really great idea that i will share with you guys after this call but it's totally random you guys can see my screen right yep yes so now i want to show you something um these are the views that we're getting on a current like daytoday basis okay so 57 000 67 000 57 000 and right now this month youtube just in ad revenue youtube has paid us four thousand seven hundred twenty one dollars okay that's sick that's huge right so it's like if you woke up one day and you just had two hundred ten dollars then you woke up the next day at 176 dollars then you woke up the next 172 dollars and every single day and this is outside of any other thing right this is outside of like you being able to help somebody with like selling a product or you coaching somebody this is just like youtube paying you because you're making content would you guys like would you like being paid just by youtube to share your knowledge do you would you guys like the idea of that yes or no yeah bro right now and that is like i have heard so many people always talk about you know earning a lot and it is i'm even seeing you right now and we all know that it is very possible it's very real yeah but what is a very common question among a lot of people is that um what does it cost them right many people don't even consider that and they just jump in and they think of it to be very simple to get along it i understand the price of it but many people don't so i would appreciate it if you could touch it so i like i like your i like the point that priyanshu brought up he's like people see this and they like it but they don't actually understand what it takes to be able to build this so now is it cool if i share with you guys what it actually takes to build this definitely exactly okay so let me go to lifetime okay and let me show you guys something really funny you guys see let me let me show you guys this okay so let's go to views do you guys see this period right over here yeah stagnant hold on let me know let me go yeah right there you guys see that invisible period right there that's 10 months of my life where i worked my face off with nothing in return like nothing nope like not even my mom would watch it i mean she kind of would actually but very much so that's a 10 month long period so if i actually zoom into that like everybody sees this right everybody's seeing this which is the highlight of everything that we've built and learned upon and momentum of all of the stuff that's happening from the past but this is actually really where it started so if i go custom and i go uh let's go 16 yeah so like the first kind of 10 months wait hold on what is this oh this is november 26 okay one second let's go 16 right here so if you take a look at this 14 views 9 views 41 views and i started in march of 2016 so you can see going going nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing may june july another month right all right just one more question over kazi how many videos did you produce in those 10 months so this is where i got like so this is where this comes in right this is important here i produced almost nothing very few videos i produce about three videos this is where i started to get my breakthrough and if you look over here seven videos in this week seven videos this week six videos this week and then and then like pretty quickly the breakthrough happened and uh right at this time i was actually working full time not when i say full time i was doing parttime jobs the equivalent of almost fulltime work like that's how many jobs i would have backtoback so i would go to college and then i would get out and i would go and teach people like whether i was coaching people in chess or whether i was coaching people in pro programming i would do that i would come home by 9 pm i had a window between 9 and 10 pm because 10 pm i went to sleep so i built this entire channel in my window of 9 to 10 p.m when i would be in chemistry class and the reason i got like f's in my chemistry class was because i would sit in there plan out my youtube videos and then i would come home and at 9 00 p.m like sharp i would start shooting and i would end my shoot around 9 40 p.m 9 50 p.m and then i would just like uh go so um and then i would like pretty much go to bed i would like hit upload on that video with no almost no editing and then i would just like go to sleep then i would wake up the next day go through the whole day do the same thing again rinse and repeat every day but i had a passion for it i was like excited about sharing something i knew and you can talk about coding but you don't have to talk about coding you can really talk about anything you're passionate about the craziest thing i talked with melissa about last time she was on our call is like she has a channel where she's like making content about sleeping where she has a lot of dreams and she remembers her dreams so she's taking what she remembers from her dreams gives it to her friend who has a really nice voice he records it and now it's like sleepy bedtime stories that you can listen to i told her put that on tick tock or youtube it will actually blow up on youtube because there's a lot of channels that have that are out there to just help you sleep channels where they just play rain sounds for like a 10 hour long video or they're just playing rain sounds you know i use those videos to go to sleep sometimes myself and so really it doesn't matter if it's like coding specific or if you're passionate about something else there's really nothing that's stopping you from being able to do that oh i've totally forgot that there's chat okay wait okay cool just muted that so if you look at it look in the first ten months i made nine dollars do you think my mom was like super proud at this time and was like yo like quit college quit everything no because that's all you see when you're here you don't see the lifetime chart of what happens four years from now all you see is this um if i go to one month later 12 30. what about this now this is getting spicier right this right here in december is where i started getting my breakthrough this is when i decided to quit college right there that's when i made the decision like middecember because it was starting to break through whatever i was learning i was able to help people with and same thing like i was learning coding i was like getting better at coding in those days you guys so like everything i was learning i was trying to share it as fast as possible you know i wasn't much better than like even the people who are probably really beginner here on this call right now and you feel like you're like pretty beginner i was probably around that skill level and but everything i learned i just made it a mission to share right away if i learned it i just shared it was it good enough i don't know would it help this you know would it help like my motto was just one and this is something melissa was on that call too but like my motto became just one how many people does it need how many people need to view this video for us to be happy just one how many people to need to get the results from this for us to be happy just one how many people's lives need to change as a result of watching what you have what you've put up one just one and so that became the voice in my head just one i don't need these seven thousand people to get help if i can just help that one person that's what helped me through this but most people have the expectation of this so they're gonna quit right here everybody's gonna quit right here that's why it's so easy my expectations were i don't deserve anything i'm some random kid from pakistan i'm getting lucky every view is a blessing when the first day i got my two subscribers right around here i danced in my in i danced around my entire house in my underwear i swear to god i was like oh my god like jumping up and down my parents were just like laughing and like trying to chase me like what's happening like tell us i'm like i got two subscribers and they started jumping up and down it meant nothing i got paid nothing for it whereas i have had the same friends who've started to try to grow their own youtube channel they got 100 subscribers and they were sad what do you think happened long term they were sad because they didn't appreciate as many things they quit right so like they didn't continue whereas if i can feel like this is a win you better believe i'm gonna be celebrating the out of this every day is a lucky day oh my god like wow and so then then the results of this compound over time right so if i go back to 2016 but let's just say i extend this out to uh the next year so march 2016 i started but take a look at what was going on by 2017 damn 108k plus subscribers that's huge 70 plus hours 100 000 subscribers you have three point nine million people yep it's insane it's kind of crazy right and this is how i actually calculated so i say how much did i help the world move forward okay so every minute every minute somebody watches something of mine i go that's i help the world move forward by two minutes okay so what's the math on 270 000 hours can somebody help me turn that into days so 270 000 hours 12 days 11 days what did you say like around 11 days or 12 days i don't know about that oh wait never mind ignore me all good way more than that what should i what should i multiply this by what should i move now what i want to do is i want to divide it by years 365. so i helped the world in 2017 i helped the world move forward by how much 30 years by 30 years one year of my life helps the world move forward by 30 years so when you think about now you feel like a civil servant yeah complex so it's like if you spend one year and you make an impact of 30 years would you feel fulfilled like internally yes yes i don't give a damn money anymore bro i'm i'm happy with my life right so this is this is the that was the whole point of it like i didn't need the 108 000 subscribers and what that gave it away is how like i was working within this time frame right i didn't need the money to do this that's why i was able to actually get through that really hard part everybody looks at this part then they set their expectations like right here so they're gonna fail you need to set your expectations like way over in like the garbage can but like enjoy the journey along the way and all you all you have to do in the process actually share what you're up to just one more thing so what happens is that say that you luckily i hope that this happens to everyone but say luckily you uh at the beginning of your youtube journey you start gaining like your tone followers and internal subscribers and you uh basically like you you use all those hashing hashing techniques and all that kind of stuff and you're an amazing marketer right so you know all about the youtube algorithm right and you succeed but after the point of time it's like it's almost inevitable that one of one or one time or another i'm pretty sure that even clever programmer must have been on the two dying right after growing uh very high it is quite possible that the entire business might die someday but what happens is that i'm pretty sure that clever programmer has already faced those kind of situations and even talked about it uh in one of the freelancing um calls with rachel i believe yeah and then you told them that okay we brought it out together right but what happens is that if you haven't been through that struggle if you haven't if you hadn't been through that struggle i'm pretty sure that you would have been so broke that you would have thought that oh my goodness what i'm going to do right now right but you you because you had seen those struggles and you have seen those reactions i'm pretty sure that that's the only reason why you succeeded yeah no those struggles are really really important because without those struggles like you cannot grow so it was actually super helpful for me to face them like i my biggest areas of growth happened when i was the saddest where i felt like everything that i had like built was gonna get destroyed but it's just like literally gonna face this everywhere like whether you have a job whether you go to school like you're gonna have that same feeling pretty much everywhere so it's a process but it's it helps you grow okay so it's it's just like part of the journey my message would be to anyone who is watching this entire youtube video would be to don't don't give up basically like this all that kind of is part of the process so right if you are failing then uh learn from it learn from your mistakes and uh remember this quote that uh if if nothing kills you then it only makes you stronger right yeah you remember that yeah 100 so really wise words so like yeah i mean don't quitting is if you the only reason you'll quit is if you do it in a way you don't enjoy it so what's really important is to make sure you're doing it in a way you enjoy it because you can't have the same expectations like everybody can play basketball but not everybody's going to be lebron james right just because you know how to shoot a basketball now you're going to win i love gary vee says that a lot just because you start a channel or you start something doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna have the same exact results but even if the results were different if you just get to share something you really enjoy and believe in and have likeminded people wouldn't that be exciting so that's really the part of the game like to do it in a way where it you find it exciting so um what i want to do is i want to open the floor up to some questions you guys have uh but before i do that i do wanna share something guys i'm gonna be doing you know like if this is exciting for you guys would you wanna know how you could get more involved with this process just raise your hands if you would even be like mildly curious or interested raise your hands raise your hands i want to see everybody okay cool brian everybody okay beautiful awesome awesome so one way you can do that is i just launched a free five day youtube challenge and i'm just gonna so and i'm gonna be going like really hard into this uh it starts tomorrow by the way so it starts starts november 18th and it will go through november 22nd this is everything i've learned since i've started this is like all my secrets in here you know like how did i grow the youtube channel how did i get to 2.6 million dollars under the age of 26 how did i whatever how can you do the same things all of that i want to share here with you guys yeah i've seen so many videos always talk about you know how i made it how i made it but no one actually talks about how you can do it too right i'm not interested in what you did right i'm interested in how i can take value from it and that's exactly what player program is all about you guys yeah don't don't just say that okay we can do this you can do that you say that you can also do it yep so 100 the whole point is we want to do it in a way where i'm going to show you how you can get value out of this and it doesn't really matter what you're thinking about starting a channel on if it's developer well then you have the path laid out for you because i started a channel on developers and i'm going to keep it growing um so yeah we're gonna share all of that the link will also be in the uh description or you guys can just go right here cleverprogrammer.com five day youtube challenge and so once you guys sign up can you just verbally let me know that you've signed up already done okay cool okay beautiful beautiful some people don't have their cameras on guys i love having you here i want to see all of your beautiful faces so george martin carl adam luz guys please put your cameras on i want to see all of your faces all right beautiful beautiful atharva nice i see it lam i'm excited for your channel i'm excited for all of you guys channels um okay great so i'm happy that you guys have signed up for it beautiful if you haven't go ahead and do it now with that said i want to open the floor to you guys priyancho don't hog the entire floor i love you but i want to have somebody um some other people also jump on and get a chance to speak as well hey can you drop the link on the on the zoom chat please okay sure i'll do that right now copy paste boom this is something like i haven't seen any youtuber talk like any of the developer youtubers talk about how you can actually grow your own developer youtube brand and there's just too many channels out there like tech lead jomatech you know and like every day you'll see a developer channel pop up so it's not something that's like very hard to do anymore a lot of people are figuring out that this is something very possible and a lot of them can do it okay one question that i have quasi is that um if there are so many tech channels already available over here but uh doesn't this reduce the opportunity that we have now yeah no because um so here's the thing so people often go people often go hey what is hold on what so people often ask this right they're like hey what happens when everybody starts jumping in this doesn't it reduce the opportunity and then there's other people who are like i want to be really unique and i want to jump into something that doesn't exist very rarely jump into something that doesn't exist unless you're like very gifted or you just kind of know it's gonna work you want to go to where things exist so let me ask you guys something right if you had a choice to open up a store would you open up the store in like an abandoned desert or would you open up a store in like a mall that's like super popping mall right definitely the mall so you would open the store in a mall why isn't now there are more competition why don't you open it in the desert like there's no competition nobody's there you're totally unique nobody's there to buy it nobody is there actually nobody's there so nobody's there that's the point that's the punch line so here the lesson is put results over your ego okay you like put results over uniqueness people often value uniqueness more than they value like actual results so put results on a pedestal because when you choose to do that you realize oh all those developers are just bringing more people into being developers like i'm not your competition i'm helping you if priyanshu creates a channel tomorrow i'm helping him by getting people interested in javascript and python then those people then go to priyansha's channel because it pops up in my recommended when people are watching clever programmer video and they're watching mine on the right hand side they will see sayuri's new video then they click it see what i'm saying so like everybody who's there is actually not your competition they're actually helping you by making that niche more popular damn never lived never before yeah so it's actually creating much bigger opportunity than like it's taking away so that's the really important thing to take care okay guys i'm gonna open up the floor for questions so let's go so hi kazee anand over here okay hold on give me one second i wanna look at where you are okay anand go for it yeah hi so uh my journey with uh clever programmer began in uh like last year october but uh i purchased uh profit uh profitable python back then it was known with a different name yeah so but i couldn't uh pay the whole amount so i had to back off after one month but i made up my mind like i will save a little little right and i eventually got into profit with javascript so after that it's had it has been booming in my career in my youtube it's not big but it is still something like 520 subscribers nice you have a youtube channel yep nice that's awesome drop down like crazy code like crazy got it okay yeah so uh my my question is like when you've made your transition from uh from the whole python uh mindset yeah and even from your channel i'm sorry somebody interrupted you just okay okay so say that say the question again so when i made the transition from python to javascript yeah and your channel it was totally focused on python and how to become a python freelancer and when you've made that change when you change the whole uh transition when you made the whole transition like right now your channel is focused on javascript it is still leveling up with python but now you're more concentrated on what's the trend right now so how do you make that transition while you're working as a youtuber because right now it's at that level that i am stuck because i created a full series for developing a portfolio with react on my channel and people actually liked it but right now i'm stuck how do i take i did it because people uh uh like my demo that i showed on youtube but after that like right now i want to help them to what areas i found that was that they were struggling in so but that is a totally different that is still react but it is a different domain it's not a portfolio thing it's a okay so you're trying to transition into what like you're transitioning from one particular from a project mindset uh to a coach mindset okay what's your goal are you trying to grow your channel uh that's my actually that's my secondary goal my primary goal is right now to help one person get a react developer job okay and what do you and what what do you mean like you're trying to coach them as in like they'll pay you and you work with them oneonone uh no i i cannot give that much time to uh each individual so what i thought like i will do is group coaching not on group coaching it will be on youtube it will be a series of uh the latest skill because being in an iit industry so why don't you just why don't you just make that youtube content yeah that's exactly what i'm trying to do but i don't know how to uh switch the gears from uh from um project based to a coaching base you just do it that's a secret so i'll i'll share something with you can somebody help with this oh come on i'm on it all right all right cool um i'll yeah nice so here is the here's the trick to actually making this happen so he's asking like hey qazi how did you make the transition from like just pure you guys saw that transition happen on my channel are some of you guys aware of that transition happening it was all python and then it became like javascript it's very simple what happened was um to make your ideas a reality you have to live in like extreme practicality world you can't live in theory land that's how like ideas don't happen so one of the skills that is my gift and i'm extremely good at it is making things practical so when we put out javascript content we just decided to put it out and then it got so much traction and people loved it um then we were able to put an amazing team behind javascript so like we got nas behind javascript we had aaron we had me we had frank with the whole team get behind javascript and start like promoting it and then we had amazing reception from the people so tons of people joined the course and then even when we would drop the videos on youtube we just have tons of traction so now here's think of it from our perspective right i am not i don't care about any specific technology what i care about is people landing jobs does that make sense like i care about how i can bring the most amount of value to people so if python video does a hundred thousand views and if i drop a javascript video and it does 500 000 views the javascript video lands five people jobs and the python one lands one person a job which moral which one am i gonna go with more yeah you see what i'm saying so like moral compass is extremely easy where are people getting more value i don't give a about myself i don't care if my channel was branded in a certain way so i care about the people then secondary i am running a business i want to take care of my employees i want to make sure everybody gets paid so if more people are purchasing javascript products then i want to sell more javascript products a bit then we can actually then hire even more talent produce even more content and help even more people does that make sense yeah yes so when it came to making the content you just make it now there are tricks and tips that i can get into like how you make content that's just banger and like will work and do really well that took me so many years to like learn but the trick is you just make content and you can actually like here's another thing right in the pr right now i'm gonna hire a few python developers probably i'm like about to expand like crazy we just hired three new people last week i'm gonna hire a lot more people in the upcoming few weeks and then we might start creating content for python and javascript simultaneously and we might just grow both of those at the same time con here's the thing just make valuable content if you make valuable content on essentially any topic and you do a good job of making it and providing value people are going to start knowing you as that yep so just make the content and you'll be fine don't spend too much time thinking about how you're going to transition or whatever just actually just do it okay thanks you got it all right more questions guys i'd love to take one more question once i can pronounce you hold on hold on one second one second i love you just one second i'm gonna make sure other people get a chance and then we'll come back anybody has a question yeah okay hey okay go for it so i i actually dropped the question in the chat but i'm just gonna mention it now so i have a youtube channel which i started about a year ago i've been following you for quite some time so you really inspired me to to uh put the channel up so i i mainly did it because i want to i want to showcase what i do and i love what i do it's basically the artificial intelligence and business intelligence nice uh space so what i did was i started making videos um on youtube and then i started transitioning into my organization and they really loved it but like how do you deal with consistency in terms of constantly consistently making those videos and and and having the motivation to to to go forward with it how do you deal with that okay so i love that question and we'll get into it a little bit so this is your channel right yeah okay and these are all the videos on your channel okay cool started 11 months ago so you right now so i want to ask you a few questions and then we'll get into it so um do you enjoy making this content did you enjoy it i i do i do okay so what made you stop making it to be honest with you i'm not sure i think it's like my work commitments but i think that's a lame excuse um i i should have actually just continued but because i really enjoyed what i did i really enjoyed making those videos and i even purchased software to to make them animated etc so i'm not sure what has stopped uh but but yeah i do enjoy it okay so you enjoy the process of making it yeah um you are enjoying them but like for some random reason you've come to a stop yeah so it's just like halted like i do make some videos which i don't post on youtube because it's propriety proprietary to my organization so i i can't put on youtube uh but yeah i'm not consistent with the youtube channel i i sometimes make more videos with the organization than i do for the youtube got it so yeah okay so few different things are happening here so one you're um here's the thing right when in in areas where you start getting wins you start going towards those areas more just like naturally yeah if you start getting wins and like you start getting viewership you're gonna kind of naturally start going more in that direction that happens um few things that happened for me is the reason why i quit my school and every single client i dropped every single client too by the way the same time i quit college and i had i was making ten thousand dollars a month and i dropped it to zero dollars income and that put pressure on me to to like actually produce content so then i was excited to produce content and it was like if i don't actually do it i have to you know like i can't actually survive i have to go do something else yeah so um those things for me help now for you i know that if the practicality came into it that would be like one thing that would help you but that's kind of like not the right way to move forward one thing i would recommend for you is like i think you really just gotta like for you what i would do is i would just consume content around wanting to create content on youtube like literally like consume people's content we're talking about youtube so one of them would be me i actually just started um i don't know if you guys saw oh 848 subscribers damn um i did not know we were at 848 subscribers at all so that's awesome but i just started my completely new channel um this is something i've never felt before like ever in in some weird way like i just really truly enjoy making this content for no reason like literally for no like it's not attached to anything in any way like i just enjoy telling these stories that i'm i'm sharing here in these videos and like i'm not interested in like i have no purpose in mind to make money from them whatever i just like enjoy sharing this content for you i would just say like i think you should consume more things that make you want to do it you should probably try to be around people who are doing it because it seems like you are enjoying it too you know so like definitely i i love i love the industry i'm in so i definitely enjoy it um so yeah i just want like in terms of consistent my my consistency is not the greatest though and i really want to it's it's not even it's not even consistency it's just like you're just not doing it so there's something deeper that like you have to dig deep in like like for me i don't it doesn't make sense to me what you're saying because it seems to me you enjoy it you like making this content so what is it that's stopping you from putting it on youtube let's talk about that hello i think you pros live stream stream wait what froze no no i mean he historically oh okay okay you scared me all right yeah i think he i think his connection oh my god my live my youtube live froze your live is still going fine i'm watching it yeah yeah it's going okay so what i will say is oh velosh on your back yeah i'm back okay so did you hear my question or should i repeat it again uh can you please repeat it okay so there's something happening here that you aren't telling yourself and in a way you're not telling us if you are enjoying it and you enjoy making content for it what is stopping you from actually putting it out on youtube there's something that's happening there if if i'm if i'm honest with myself perhaps i'm probably thinking about maybe the criticism that i that i may receive because like there's so many like awesome people posting content about ai um in my industry so probably in the back my mind i'm probably thinking like maybe my content is not as it's good enough as this so so perhaps that's one of the reasons that is the main reason now you have hit the nail on the head and you guys feel that that sounds like the actual truth right yeah for sure so that's that's really what it is brother like that's what it is velocion it's those voices that you up those voices have stopped me for so long um if you actually watch this like a lot of people are like quasi i i should somebody watch this recently they're like i didn't know you had those voices in your head i'm like what the hell i'm like i'm just i'm human like i'm human too uh i think you should actually watch this at some point in the lotion um this is it was like i talked about it in this vlog that i recently made and i talk about the voices in your head actually stomping you and there were voices in my head that stopped me from even starting this brand even having 800 000 youtube subscribers and all of that and i wasn't posting i was like the video is not going to be like good enough i need more time um i can't post it because some people are gonna think of things and i just like never would keep posting it oh i need to have more results like if i talk about it like people are gonna be like what you only have 500 000 subscribers on youtube you suck like so i can't talk about how to grow your own youtube so those voices are the worst but the conversation that i had with my girlfriend and i talk about that in that video is there's something beautiful that happens when you just truly stop listening to other voices and just only listen to the voice that's in your head and let go of the other voices i have never in my life moved faster than i have had in the last few weeks because i'm just like i'm trusting my gut if i feel it in my gut in my instincts i just move on it and i'm trying to shut off all voices like people questioning me feeling the need to get everybody on board convince everybody that it's a good thing almost seek permission from people but like if you're making content like i'm looking at your content and let's actually look at uh which video are you the most proud of uh i think the other first one perhaps this one right here yeah okay i you need a phd or you need to be a math goal to see if the low to look at the columns we're gonna read right columns when who was trying dude this is awesome like this video is awesome how i know that is because i've seen thousands of youtube channels that are like posting content similar to this and blowing the up like literally i've seen similar channels that have like 800 000 subscribers million subscribers that are posting content like this um it's funny because it's the curse of the community that you are in um this happened to my brother who never posted content on color grading because he's like man i'm in this industry and everybody knows how to color grade there's a science to it they all look at like look down on me if i try to talk about it so he never shared anything about it same thing happened to my girlfriend she would never share anything about she's a professional boxer but she would never share anything about it because everybody in her community she knew would like make fun of her or find some kind of weakness and talk about it and share it because a tightly knit community so people are gonna make fun uh let me show you what is happening with my brother right now okay he also like one more thing is that you know i can actually give my own example over here because if but once you're like in india and if you're 13 years old and if you're trying to you know if you're telling your parents that okay uh dad i'm gonna do it i'm mom i'm gonna do it you know they literally laugh at you like like anything okay they just laugh at you and i was nearly in my tears back then and i said leave them okay i'm gonna show them my results and then they're gonna be proud and today they tell me that yes son you did something right so it's all about you know just getting over that feeling because i myself i faced that so many times in my school in my um like teachers always telling me and friends always telling me that you won't be able to do it do i even pursue why i even take the risk yeah all right let me show you something okay so let me show you something here below veloshan so check this out right this is my brother and he started his youtube channel uh and he only talks about color grading okay that he was like so scared to talk about he never wanted to like talk about this and this is when right around here was when i was pushing him to start it and this first these first two videos are a result of me just like pushing him so much for so long and then he finally just decided to start talking about it and now uh one year later i mean now he's like just flying right one year later he has whatever videos uploaded and 132 000 subscribers but he also let go of the job that he was uh i mean for him he got lucky like the day he called me he was like on the verge of tears and about to cry he's like i just got fired from my job and those clients were paying him almost like close to 20 000 a month but like as soon as you told me that i put him on mute and i was like yes whoa like i was the happiest that day that i've ever been and i was so happy last year in the summer and then i got back on the call and i'm like dude i'm so sorry that that happened to you because i knew that that's the day that's what he needed to actually start going in on what he truly enjoys and believes in and he did because he had no other choice and all the voice of all the other critics went away and then he started posting okay uh my other brother just recently started and he had the same voices and he didn't want to post because he's like oh they're actually gonna like probably uh take me out of the company and he just started posting and this is super recent so he just started i'll show you if i go to oldest two months ago right two months ago two months of posting what one two three four five ten videos that's not a lot of videos right ten videos and he's at thirteen hundred subscribers whoa now he's gone now he's gone he is a fly like he's hit his like now he's just gonna be flying so it's really doable but like the biggest most awful thing is those voices that come into your head veloshan that's that's the main thing that's your achilles heel right now so talk to me with lotion like we're having this conversation what are you feeling right now what are the thoughts running through your head right now so based on what you just mentioned to me like i'm just gonna go for it like i do enjoy it and i'm not gonna really listen to like people around me just saying whatever they're gonna say about it even if there's hundreds of thousands of videos on youtube i'm just gonna go for it and i'm gonna do it i'm gonna see where it takes me to be honest with you because i'm not really doing it for um for the money um i really enjoy teaching i that that's why i enjoy sharing my knowledge with people like even even in my organization even though i i have a specific job role um i just love like helping people so that's why i want to do it and i'm just going to go ahead and go for it and see where it takes me so so yeah i think it's genuinely one of the most valuable things any one of us can do in our lives to be able to help people and if we have a platform or knowledge that we can share dude it's it's everything those comments are what keep me going when people are like yo like this video helped me with this thing or this video helped me land a job those that's everything people being able to pick up the things that were hard for you but you maybe explained it in a fun way so yeah and if you enjoy it dude that's your calling like you're so lucky to have found your calling and what you truly really enjoy so like now's not the time for other voices and it's only the voices of people who haven't done themselves yeah no official 100 100 i totally agree so what are you gonna do as a result of this conversation valencia so i'm gonna make my my next video over the weekend actually i actually have content which is just i just been playing around in my mind do i do it should i not do it but hold on hold on one second one second i'm gonna go for it guys should he make his uh should he make his video over the weekend yeah yes go live right now guys this weekend too so you can do it beautiful and i want you to hear this as well if he makes his video and we check it and he shows it to us and it's on on his channel how would that make us feel amazing these are the voices i want you to have in your head cool awesome i'm going to make it this weekend 100 okay good good and share it with us okay drop it in the pwg channel uh there's a quote from steve jobs actually which says that don't let the noises of others opinion drown down your inner voices it's hard like it's the most beautiful thing and we've all heard it i'm sure it's the most cliche thing on the planet but like oh my god is it hard to do like to this day i struggle with it and like people struggle with it and i it's so hard but i'm learning i'm learning and i feel like i'm now have a better understanding of it than i did before but i feel like i'll still like i'll hear 15 years from now and i'm like oh my god it's brilliant it's even more brilliant now so it's truly a really hard thing to do it's not a easy thing to do so i'm very empathetic of that especially for an environment that like doesn't foster that if you're around people that don't like foster that then that's hard it's really hard so i can empathize with where you're at the lotion but like i want us to be the voices that fill your head now yeah you've got your back our back yeah thanks guys so just go man share your knowledge and just have fun enjoy it put it out there like if it's your calling and you enjoy it then that's what you enjoy like if you enjoy sharing stuff then you got to do it then that's your like obligation to do that you know okay by next week i wanna see how many videos are you gonna have on your channel by next tuesday so this weekend i'll make two videos at minimum beautiful two videos beautiful okay so by next tuesday we have two videos on your channel okay i commit to that amazing beautiful i love it i love it and that's all you got to do it's all you got to commit to it doesn't require you to do some crazy stuff but it just like when you're excited and motivated and you feel the shift happening those are when you got to make a commitment and lock it in lock it in with the date and the time after this call what i highly recommend maybe even right now veloshan is like what times you're going to do it um what time you want to shoot it or what day you want to shoot it if you can do that just by doing this called implementation intention you guys if you are motivated to do something they have found that motivation will get you 30 of the way there but by setting an implementation intention meaning setting a date time in place you're likely ninety percent likely to now do the thing that you want to do so let's have one more question in terms of in terms of your videos that you used to make when you started off did you like do like some sort of a script or do you just go ahead and just freestyle everything okay so um let's just go to the the source of the truth because that's just facts right if we actually go to my channel and i go to our uh and i sort it by let's go oldest so i'll tell you this these videos none of them are scripted like none of them all of them are one take uh this is when i developed my methodology called when i became what i now coined as the one take wonder um and it was all about like my channel was always about like not only providing value but improving my public speaking skills and i realized how many times am i speaking how many times when you and i were speaking velocia and you were like uh let me actually you're like cut let me say that again i didn't say it right let me say it again no you and i just have a normal conversation right yeah and you do it in one take yeah we all have a conversation we're all one takers but then for some reason when it's time for video now we get so selfconscious that like we have to do 300 takes and so now that video takes 300 times the amount of time that it should have taken it should have just taken that one time you explained the idea just like if you brought a friend and you explained that idea one time and it's done so i was a big believer in never removing anything and never redoing anything so like if this video says 39 minutes and 41 seconds it took exactly 39 minutes and 41 seconds to make the only thing i thought about ahead of time is okay i'm gonna talk about uh whatever like i was just walking through code academy tutorial so however far i get in those 39 minutes i get that far and then i just like do it and explain it as i go like i would to a friend so then the job of making content is like today at 9 00 p.m i started i finished at 9 39 p.m and then i prepared for bed and went to sleep this day i started at 9 00 pm at night i finished at 9 52 and then i went to sleep right and then i just kept repeating this process and the topics that you had did you did you plan them out like this is where so yeah this is where i was like a little bit strategic i found that code if you cover big websites and their walkthroughs um and i could just help you guide because i didn't see a lot of help on there and i saw a few people and i'm like this suck i could do it so much better and so i just made it on that so it's easy as because codecademy is providing all the material all i'm doing is just doing a walkthrough of it i just sit there and i'm like all right guys let's see what we're going to cover today and i was actually sick in this video too but i i just went ahead and made it anyway so here it is hey guys how are you doing so today i'm going to take on a very interesting challenge which is going to be i'm going to go through the entire code category and try to finish it as fast as i can and along the way my goal is to be able to help you guys i don't know what happened so my beard came along so like look at the comments right the amount of times he gulped he must be really thirsty right so like and then here don't ever stop uploading things so like you're you're gonna have people who are going to say yeah who thought the shy kid would be a loud millionaire four months ago yeah so you're gonna have people saying all kinds of but like i know the truth i know none of these i know none of the people would be here if i didn't listen to myself and make the content whether they're saying good like here's the real secret i don't even take the compliments to heart that's the real secret i'm not dependent on anything or anybody i don't even the compliments aren't even what drive me to do what i do so i'm like i have no vulnerability in that sense because if the i allow the compliments too much to give me validation then the negative comments are going to crush me now this is a little bit garyvee yes it's a little scary it's it's like really like gary vee and that's why like i resonate with him really hard but like i went to a school where i was like from 9 to 12 or 9 to 13 i was physically beaten every day and the school imagine you're a nineyearold kid and you have to be at the school you have to show up at 8 a.m and you have to leave at 10 p.m there's no worldly knowledge there's nothing i'm learning about the world i had no math no science no computer programming nothing all i had to do was memorize a book in a language i actually don't understand in arabic i had to memorize a book okay i had to memorize the quran with not understanding a single letter of it so rote memorization so imagine learning a language that you have you don't understand learning how to read it and recite it and memorize it doing that for four years for 12 to 15 hours a day and every day you get beat the out of it was just because i was in a bad school there were plenty of schools that taught in a very humane way kind way loving way and like they're amazing i just happened to be in like a not a very good one and so you know as a little kid that's really really hard so it's really really sucked and bunch of the people that were at that school it mentally them up kind of forever for me what it did is so here's what sucked right i went straight from second grade in pakistan to seventh grade in united states so like when they told me hey turn in an essay uh i remember i was in seventh grade and the teacher and i just came out of this religious school i had no idea about how the world works this teacher goes hey i want you guys to turn in an essay and i asked him what does that mean and he's like make sure it's written clearly and i can understand and uh yeah so guys go ahead and do this and this uh needs to be two pages long so i said okay so i came back the next day i turned my essay in the whole class kind of started like snickering and like laughing the teacher like smiles a little bit and i'm like damn like i must have written a really good essay and i sat down and my friends are like how many pages did you write i'm like two and i'm like yeah i don't know why everybody was complaining like it was so easy to write these two pages come to find out i had written the essay in uh sci fo font size 72 uh and i was using green color font and i was using comic sans that's how i wrote the essay because i thought i needed to write it clearly that's what i what i thought that meant so when i had that happen and the whole class is laughing i like learned okay that's not how you do it this is not how it works okay cool so there are a lot of like weird things you know that happened to me and so they made it so where every day i would just wake up and not get beat up the next day i was just happy i was like oh my god i won today it's a 10 out of 10 i didn't get beat up i don't have to be somewhere i hate for 15 hours a day like oh my god so to me in a really weird way it has made me the happiest i've ever been in my entire life i always have that like one point of reference like i know that it can get so bad physical and psychological abuse for 15 hours a day doing the thing that makes you the unhappiest force doing like it it it's hard for it to get worse and so it gave me a point of reference so that's why when i got that one subscriber i'm like oh my god i'm supposed to get beat up on sunday and instead i got one subscriber let's go like it just made me the happiest person on the planet so those voices in a really weird way help me where like when i drop my tutorials i expect everyone to say bad stuff so when i see all the bad stuff i'm like yeah that's what i expect that's like normal just i expect everybody to say that but then like when i see the one great comment i'm like yo that's cool i'm like all right let's just keep going so you know it's it's a really really weird thing and when gary vee talks about it like it's a really weird game of selfawareness like really it hits me like i i feel that so that's all this was it was a python tutorial series veloshan and none of these are scripted none of these are scripted i'll show you like this is a little bit more scripted this video right here that got 477 000 views but like you know but then it also got a lot of views uh this video was not scripted i just had maybe some key points like some bullet points none of these are scripted all of these tutorial ones where i just decided to launch a course as a developer guys like if you want to blow up your channel the biggest hack is just drop a free course on anything like literally if the lotion drops a free course on whatever thing he's doing and he makes like 14 videos on them he already knows it so it's not going to take him too long to make each of the videos and those can actually help you you know be put on the map all right layla i know that layla had raised her hand a while ago and gianna if you want to ask something no no no okay cool got it uh leila's still here no okay guys i'll take next question whoever wants to go george nice hat i love it i actually dropped a couple questions from the youtube it's they're posting so fast but i dropped a couple questions in the chat on here if you want to do those okay cool um also i want to know who else wants to go just so i have like a lineup of people and then we can go guys yeah i just have a couple of questions okay got it all right give me one second so we'll get to i'll go to you preancient next because i didn't really see anybody else unless i'm in a view mode that i couldn't see um so melissa go for it hey i was just pulling questions off the youtube one guy said can you tell me which app i can use for video editing for the videos for youtube um so here's the craziest hack you guys can use um you can get really fancy and use final cut pro that's a lot of what i use to edit my content but guys i swear to god this can even kick final cut pro's ass and this is how i've been editing a bunch of my content lately and it's like just really really powerful it's called video leap and like i'm actually literally editing full on videos on this and this gives you really no excuse to make great content you can edit right on your phone it'll kick your final cut pro's ass because it'll load so fast on your computer you won't need to like do anything the app is called video leap somebody can drop the name and uh um i'll i'll just drop the name so video jesus oh thank you brian thank you yeah and brian needs to be on tick tock doing videos where he provides value and breakdances at the same time and i'm actually dead serious that's i'm not kidding actually i actually had an idea about um keeping the health actually like you know how to keep your physical health stable because a lot a lot of developers we sit in front of a computer the whole time but then we don't actually take our time to really like keep up postures and everything you know yes which i think i think health is actually number one key yep behind you know anything yes like getting into development so i was actually thinking either like um you know quality over quantity you know like i i don't have to make short videos but i just have like all these different ideas i even jot down on my phone on like what i can maybe dance too if anybody's you know if they want to have it like basic groove i could probably like post it up on the slack channel just to you know have fun and be i think i think it's a huge opportunity and i think it's really cool too like what you want to do so like if i was you i would be i would just be like dropping videos like you know five health tips for javascript developers you know seven tips to improve your posture for or like improve your productivity as a software developer and then like actually talk about health tips yeah i haven't thought of that yeah like it's like so key i i feel like it's so killer um i even think that if a company launched like literally chairs that i'm sitting in and they were called like one company just um optimized them for software developers and just branded it like chairs for react.js developers chairs for python developers oh my god like it would just blow up so i i think the same way as well included the logo of python that's what i'm saying it would be so epic it would crush so yeah so brian like if you actually do that where you're like made content like it just starts off with like one fitness tip for javascript developers and then like you showed them something you know i think that would be really cool yo that that's an inspiration thank you man yes beautiful i think tick tock is a is a really good platform for you especially if you can dance you can make bunches content on on there that um i created seven videos yesterday on tick tock produced seven pieces of content yesterday just to prove that you can and you can do it i and we did it in two and a half hours so it's very very possible and you guys can model what i'm doing here so these are the seven pieces of content i produced yesterday one i i had help two three four five six seven and take a look at this this channel was this channel was not getting many views 1300 1500 2800 right nothing i dropped to seven yesterday and look at this eleven thousand on this one thirty four hundred four thousand twenty nine hundred hundred and sixty five thousand thirty three thousand and twenty thousand so like check this one out right it's lit i love it right so like you guys can totally do that this one is five jobs that will make you a millionaire right and i just list out some jobs like lawyer and then some other one and some other one right this is something you don't need to be a genius to be able to do this it doesn't require that much effort it took me probably 15 to 17 minutes to do it just got photos put them on my phone busted it out done so same thing like i think especially if you can dance you can make so much more content like extra content on tick tock that can do so damn well so quick question i actually have i actually post a few stuff on instagram too like those are pretty much for like my designs and you know yeah eventually you know later on i'm going to put like coding journey as well so you actually recommend me to put more videos on tick tock or like should i just use both uh if you can make videos that are under 30 seconds then that same video you'll post on ig reels that's how you're really going to explode on instagram if you just keep making instagram posts it's it just it's not gonna work it will take you like one year to get to a certain number of like hard work but if you just keep making uh ig reels then you can just keep taking those ig reels and put them on tick tock as well or vice versa 30 seconds that's the best i think that's the best way for the the way to fastest fastest growth i think that everybody should have a youtube channel because 15 seconds just isn't enough 30 seconds just isn't enough somebody isn't gonna pay you money because you gave them 30 seconds of value but i think it's the thing that can put you on the map the fastest way possible and your youtube is the foundation no doubt your ultimate foundation yeah so yeah like it's funny because like i thought about it yesterday right it's like we went to this like random massage place yesterday and i'm like man we're in beverly hills and this massage place is like really cheap it was like 40 like 39 for like a 30 minute massage usually where i'm at it's like 300 or 400 dollars you know for a 45 minute massage and i i don't do that i'm like that it's too like it's way too expensive um so my girlfriend and i we're there and i'm like seems suspicious but like okay we'll do it so it was like a nice you know white lady sitting at the front desk like really kind like booked our appointment and everything i'm like oh you know what like i might i might just get really surprised so let's see what happens i'm open to new ideas so we get we book the appointment at 7 30 we finish eating our dinner we go to the spot they send us like in the back somewhere like random and then there's just like two crazy like asian people that come out and they're like they don't even say a word to us they just like look at me and look at they're just like i'm like okay i guess so we just like walked towards them just like like point just grunting like just straight up grunting and pointing at the chair so we like lay down i have no idea what to do just like take my feet just like start going crazy literally like put up pull up like both of my legs all the way just drop it i started laughing because i'm like this is crazy man they take a dude they take yeah no no they take a hot towel it's so hot i felt those hot towels i know how to feel dude she put it on my face my face was like burning like afterwards like i had like red marks everywhere on my face like literally i felt sizzle and smoke come out but i didn't want to be like awkward and take it off like jesus christ so the the face you know the nice lady receptionist that's ticktock it gets you in the door the crazy that happens in the back that's youtube so like that's what you need both you need you need the face you need the tick tock and you need the youtube what's up no i must start a tech talk out yes yes yes yes definitely especially with dancing stuff um i think it would be a great idea all right so i'm going to get into some more questions that are happening here so carl has a question what's up carl let's jump into it brother what's happening hey nice to see you man it's good to be seen anywhere man beautiful there you go all right so what's going on hey listen mine's more of a technical question oh by the way i joined the five uh day challenge for youtube i'm excited about that i downloaded the video leap app i'm pretty excited about that too because i use camtasia um but uh interested not for my phone just got the s20 5g so i'm excited about checking that out okay uh mine's technical question more on the uh what are you using for a mic and the software for uh your videos i know that you don't really need to get all that technical but i'd really like to know specifically because i've been i've been chasing stuff how much money you got well i'm not worried about the money i just like to know okay so um there is an option that is phenomenal for eight hundred dollars and then there's the option that's the exact same thing i used to make all of my videos a clever programmer they'll cost you about twenty five hundred three thousand dollars cool so okay so which one do you want to lean towards could you put them in the uh could you put that in the chat um i'll just take you to my amazon real quick i don't care it's like i'll get half a cent for him ordering at all um all right here we go what am i doing with my life all right cool oh i got all this stuff i didn't even open it yet all right so this is the new one so all my content that you see on my rafikaze channel the new one that i just started so let me refresh here and go to this all this content that i'm producing so like for example even if i show you this video here december is where i'm how to get your first 1 000 subscribers let's talk about it so all of this is shot with this right here that like this exact thing and you know if i want to circle everything that's that's it okay so this i really like it's not too expensive i can carry around my camera really easily everywhere with me and the cool really cool thing that makes it easy is the fact that the mic that it comes with is actually really good so i've never seen a camera that comes with a mic on top of it that's really good so that was really surprising for me so this is the camera for that and it just makes the creation side so much easier for me and then the other one you know if you're thinking about like the a more fancier setup which i don't know i just i want things that make it easy for creators to create so i have a gh5 which i shot the rest of the stuff with um you you if you want you can go with that too so this is a it's a gh5 and i that i didn't order from amazon so i can't like show you that in my amazon cart sure but it's a gh5 and then it has some lens that comes with it so that's um that's what that is if you are about to order it let me know and i'll be able to give you the exact specs and everything like that i'll i'll just have to look at it look it up gotcha appreciate that cause thanks mmhmm yep you got it all right uh let me see guys questions you guys i believe that um this your phone's camera is going to be perfect i i actually agree with priyanshu like if if it's stopping you to create content i would highly recommend to remove any barrier from creating content so if expenses or whatever here's you know guys you know what's better than like no content some content content so like i'd rather you have a video that you think is really crappy that's way better than you not having a video at all like let me ask you guys would you rather have no food in a day or some food that maybe isn't even that good some food some food right what would happen if for a week you just had no food that's what's happening to you every week you don't produce content that's what's happening to all the opportunities on the upside that you can create for yourself and for your life so like i want you guys to take it seriously you know like and actually enjoy it not just like oh my god it's this crazy thing but like actually enjoy it so that's why even if it's bad content or if it's bad food you're still gonna eat it still produce it and then you can get fancier over time the thing that like i always hate thinking about is like i never want to be that like white guy in his 40s that's out of shape that wants to play tennis for the first time in his life but needs the perfect equipment the perfect tennis racket has like the white headband like on his head and then like goes to play you know what i mean like needs the fanciest equipment i never want to be that person who needs all of those things i almost want to like work my way up to it so if you're thinking about getting really fancy things almost make it a game for yourself and be like okay let me prove it to myself by producing seven videos with my phone okay now before i get the 2500 camera let me prove that i can do this with like my you know a 500 camera or 800 camera can i do this and then go from there all right guys um awesome by the way if you haven't signed up yet for the five day challenge can you raise your hands if you have not signed up for the challenge okay steven what's stopping you brother um i actually didn't know about the challenge until today so after this video i'm gonna i'm gonna say no okay okay awesome awesome awesome so the link is in the youtube video and it's also up here um so if you want to go to it you can do that anybody else raise your hands or just like speak out loud if you haven't yet signed up for the challenge okay cool all right awesome awesome perfect so i'm glad that pretty much everybody signed up um any more i want to take on more questions so give me one second here i'm looking at the questions that you guys have i'm reading them as well do you think it's a good idea to be a tutor as a beginner sharing that's what i did you know i just as soon as i learned something i just started teaching it um i also got yeah i also got a client to sign up for my coaching for youtube as soon as i started learning youtube so before i even had 3 000 subscribers i don't know if you guys know but i took on a client that paid me 2 000 a month to do youtube with me for four calls four calls two thousand dollars a month um under three thousand subscribers because i'm like hey look you see my results i have 3000 subscribers but i'm growing fast i am like learning this stuff so you can learn it with me if you want because it's going to take my time this is what i'm going to charge you because i know the value of it you want to do it and he's like yeah i'll do it okay cool so then i just now four years later and like he actually has an amazing youtube channel with over 10 000 subscribers now we're blowing him up on tick tock he just like broke 30 000 followers on tick tock so like this year 2021 end of 2021 he's gonna have like a really solid incredible brand like a successful brand so i don't let those voices you know stop me ever like if i'm a beginner it doesn't matter can am i like half a step ahead of somebody if i am i'm just go for it if you don't see guys always talk about in your webinars is so powerful like many people underestimate it and think it is over uh exaggerated right trust me it isn't yeah it literally isn't like if i know or like even if i know like for loops and functions i can teach it to someone else it's real it's real yeah so it is what it is um you can't convince everyone i tried to like i really tried to for a really long time now i don't just because like i want to give my energy to people who are already convinced because then it just drives so much results for them um and so and like nothing bad on the people who aren't like you know everybody has their own opinion so that's okay too but i just want to like keep moving forward all right brian you got one follower nice stephen okay dope yeah kazi i had a few questions right yeah go for it yeah so uh one question that always pops into any of any beginner's mind uh it was one of the questions that even brought me inside of my mind but uh the main question is that is youtube a stable source of income um no yeah that that is exactly what i thought because it's just a platform right and any platform can die off so it's not every i'll tell you something can you get fired from a job yeah can a client decide to not work with you anymore yeah okay like can all these like right now we have 45 people can all of the 45 people decide to leave the call right this second yep yes right can a like like asteroid hit us and the planet gets destroyed i mean there's a lot like yes it can really bad things can happen um a lot of things like everything there's a amount of uncertainty i believe that the biggest areas of growth happen where you are willing to take that risk that's why you have such a high upside that's that's only why you know um so the more i like for me what makes me a great entrepreneur like really really good is that i have very high risk tolerance um and i come in my element when things become really vague and really chaotic and everyone starts to freak out so like even right now everybody at cleverprogrammer is freaking the out because i'm like hiring people so fast and i used to try to convince everybody like no it's a good idea i have like really long conversations with them to really see my perspective now i don't try to convince everybody i know what i need to do like i i understand it i get it i get what needs to happen you know it's like a captain of a navy seal team or something like he knows what he's doing with his soldiers with his team what is so like the more risk you can take and the more the most valuable skill i think you guys can teach yourself is willing to play in really vague areas where there's really high risk and uncertainty but to me honestly if you think about it like what is the risk you yeah you spent a year making things that you enjoyed making oh my god what a risk and also meanwhile you can you can possibly generate money from it yeah and in the meantime outside of this i'll tell you something and in the meantime outside of this most of us aren't going to do much anyway like what's the alternative like what is something that's gonna be so great that you're gonna do then like actually make an investment into your brand into getting your self out there so here's what i will say right the biggest thing that happens that out of all of this the worst case scenario looks like now you have unlimited job opportunity that's the worst case scenario that happens when you start investing into your own brand that's the worst thing that happens you now have unlimited job opportunity do you guys think i'll ask you guys this okay if just clever programmer and everything died right and we just had to quit and shut off everything do you guys think that if i just asked everybody a clever programmer if there was a job opportunity for me that i could get hired yes is that possible yes you know no client will reject you and no one so like i and i just need one person to say they will hire me right so if i'm really looking for security i just need one person to say yeah like they'll work with me so like that's the worst thing that happens when you invest in your own personal brand you actually get unlimited job opportunity you know that's the worst case scenario best case scenario is you get more income you get way more opportunity brian starts getting hit up like here's the future right brian does stuff does stuff does nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens i mean things start happening and now one person reaches out to bran is like hey man like you know you're doing really cool stuff and you know if you promoted a bang energy drink with your dance like um we could give you like 200 for one tick tock post all of a sudden brian's like holy 200 dollars for one tick tock post the thing i was gonna do for free anyway okay 200 times four if they give me four sponsored posts this month that's eight hundred dollars what if i got another sponsor and i got four videos with them oh that's sixteen hundred dollars what if i got just one more sponsor that's 2400 i can probably quit and try to survive off of that damn then what happens up as his followers grow as more opportunities starting to happen right literally there'll be people who are like hey dude you're making content on like software developers are you interested in a software development job brian's like oh now i have a job opportunity and three sponsorship things that i'm thinking about hmm let me keep thinking here now i have like now i have a lot of opportunity that's pretty cool let me just keep going he keeps going he keeps going see what i'm saying now brian i was like should i launch my own course that would be pretty cool now really cool conversations are happening brian sits with his friend and now the conversation isn't like hey man what's going now he's like yo i got a sponsorship thing i also got a software development job opportunity and then like now i'm thinking about launching my own course like what do you think and now that's what they're back and forth talking about literally that's how my entire conversation is translated from my best friends like that's exactly how it happened that's and that's what i'm saying it's true it's true so it happens right and that's how you now are creating content now people are following you now people are paying you so like this can happen but in order to be able to do that you just have to invest in yourself in terms of like if you're looking for 100 stability there's really like nothing that's 100 stable and if you think a job is 100 stable like it's really not right it's like it's a company can go bankrupt and they have to fire you right or maybe they just decide you're not a good fit anymore so it's an illusion that it's like a permanent thing but it's really not so like why not do a thing on the side that you really really enjoy you can still do your work like i created my youtube channel with 30 minutes to an hour how many of us have one free hour in a day just raise your hands if you're one free 30 minutes to one hour in a day so like you can with that one hour you can actually create something completely on the side that's like your own that's an investment in you forever and you can't go wrong with this because it's an investment in you and i'll tell you something else even if here's another things okay priyanshu it's way more it's a million times more reliable of an income youtube than a job ever is and i never even consider jobs to be like something that i should even aim for i never consider right so it's like youtube pays you and even if youtube died tomorrow people will still look up clever programmer right people will still look it up people will still try to find it ultimately it is the fastest way to make human relationships with people and as long as you can do that you can have unlimited job opportunity income opportunity whatever it is that you're looking for that's all it is cool so that's kind of my answer on that end um okay atharva hey something is wrong with my instagram i uploaded two posts daily and i get 10 followers sometimes and those are disappeared the next day and i cannot grow my instagram my impressions are going down do you think it's because of two posts a day a tharva do you want to jump on i don't know can you hear me hey how's it going it's perfect i cannot speak louder okay go ahead so something is wrong um like i was going one post a day and i i got like 70 likes on my post but from like two days i have started posting two posts a day and everything is just going wrong i don't know what's happening okay what does it mean when you say everything is going wrong i mean the posts are not shown to many people and my analytics are just going down like impressions and everything okay um how many people are oh this post is gonna do well all right hold on let's go to a tharva right there okay so how many posts are we in right now 29 posts okay dude you're 473 followers for 29 posts okay you're at look at this um did you do did you get fake followers no at any point no okay uh did you do follow for follow type of thing where you went on people's channels and told them to follow you no okay so these why are you following 353 people because this was the person that recorded before so okay okay got it okay so you were just watching people and just following them i'm sure you probably followed okay cool all right um bro i think i'm gonna tell you something this happens um i'll just show you my youtube okay so here's what i want you to look at switch to clever programmer this is the craziest thing about marketing which is like really unsettling for most people and it freaks them the out um it's like it freaks you out because so much changes so fast all the time it's kind of unbelievable so like look at this right boom like we blew up like start of january we're like getting 27 000 views 27 000 views and then like boom we got 125 000 views and we're live oh my god this is crazy like this was the the start of 2020 right and then like look at this it just died no matter what we produce no matter what we did it just stayed like this and then right around here look at this this is when sonny and i were doing those live streams so it was going crazy during that and then you can see it has this crazy dropoff even now that we're going live and doing a lot of the similar things we were doing before like look at how much we're posting nine videos in one week nine in one week nine in one week nine but you can't it's hard to go more than this it's going down right now if i show you the trajectory of its lifetime look at this growth growth growth growth growth then goes down then grows a little bit more grows down massive stupid growth growth grow grows massive stupid growth goes down it's it's chaos but if you look at the trajectory is it up or down it's going up finally yep so uh you're thinking too close you're looking too closely at every movement that's happening you're too close like if i zoom in at this point i'd be depressed because everything is failing it's almost like you're looking at the stock market every single day you shouldn't do that yes so like you're looking at it too closely like you're you're just zoomed in right here and you're just like your whole focus is on this but it's impossible for you to see this and this because it probably hasn't happened yet right so you are here my friend and you're zoomed in all the way you just got to zoom out and just keep producing valuable content got it okay and then try different strategies like sometimes the that worked before is not gonna work again like some of our videos that we thought was gonna get a million views got like 5 000 views and stopped so ig reels is the game right now i didn't see that you're on it i don't see any ig real videos from you yeah i'm planning on that very soon right so like ig reels is a big way for you to grow so you gotta try a lot of those things and be careful about your internal dialogue because if you're like i don't know why everything is wrong what is he going to pay attention to guys once he asks that question why is everything wrong with my channel what is he gonna start focusing on once he asks that question is he gonna focus on all the great things that are happening is he gonna start no he starts to focus on every single follower that goes off and then he wonders that uh okay maybe i'm going wrong over here maybe i'm going wrong with your hand isn't focused on you know like um this post got me this good yeah so that's that's what's happening at tharva right now it's like the focus is too much on the things that are wrong and that's a bad question to ask my friend so like you're gonna put yourself in a mentally a really poor place and when you put yourself mentally in a poor place are you gonna feel less or more inspired to make more content at darva less so like the game is not worrying about the follower account and producing valuable okay and right and then if you want to think tactically you need some tactics to get out of it bro start posting more ig reels but not everything is wrong bro 29 posts 473 followers get the out of here like it took me a half a year to get my first 473 followers it's a lot of followers so you know and even the amount of likes you have is actually quite a bit for what you got going on now the game is you know different tactics like you know the same stuff that works stops working and you have to always be changing so it's like i was producing content and i'm always every day looking at what's happening every day looking at what's happening and i keep trying different tactics different strategies and like now i'm realizing reels kill it so i'm like guys let's try to post five to ten reels a day if you spent three hours focused focused working hard you should be able to produce three to five ig tick tock slash reels a day and then if you don't grow then then come back and talk to me then something is wrong you know but it's but it's it's literally the equivalent of like giving you the advice of like if you want to be healthy sleep more and eat more so like right now if you did that and you made more tick tocks and ig reels like there's it's gonna be yeah really hard for you to not grow it's almost like you know if you take if you take about fitness he's almost focusing on the daughter of one or two that's growing and yeah and not on his overall mental peace peace and is physical yeah like even even when you do a lot of physical fitness stuff right it's hard to see the growth every day that is happening it's hard to see every day the transition that's taking place in your body but over time you can actually see the difference that it make it's making it's very hard to see if you're trying to look every day like my sixpack here yet oh is it 60 is it here yet god so like it's not gonna be there if you just keep trying to look at it every single day just need to like do the process but while you're doing the process get smart and use smart tactics too so like use ig reels if you're trying to grow on instagram and if you're not then you're in the grandpa stage and that's why you're not growing so my my two cents on that um okay beautiful beautiful so i'm gonna see some reels from you this week at tharva yeah um oh new boston made a video i did not know that devin yeah it was like maybe like a couple weeks ago like my facebook was blowing up over like oh my god is he back yeah oh yeah yeah i mean yeah the new boston is freaking awesome oh tharva i just thought about something else i want to share with you so my clever cozy thing is big uh on instagram so whatever i make is gonna get a lot of views but my rafikaze which is like the personal brand side of things is not huge so when i drop stuff i don't get a lot of views like i'm in the same boat as you so remember when you dropped stuff you got 40 so think about this i have 1800 followers and i when i drop stuff i was getting the same amount as you so like right over here i started dropping content 253 video views 38 on this 63 on this 50 on this you see what i'm saying right two comments zero comments zero comments very similar to exactly where you're at right now yeah my video is getting 253 views 269 views so like look at what i did 294 views cool then i made ig reel and now look at what happened when i made ig reel look at the amount of views that this got as many followers you have yeah look at how many views this got while my other videos got 200 views now the trick is i model the people who are making the best reels and then i made something similar to that so you gotta model like the things that are working really really well and then make those but like it works when you do it right it works you didn't know i need to make reels yes you do need to make reels and you know for the coding channel just follow look at the reels that we're making you know and if you get in a good flow of it yeah like look at this right like this one um this one blew the up look at this one i love this one what's popping don't mind me just watching that's it there we go that was hard to quit out of it but like this one just blew up 300 most of my videos get no more than like few thousand views max 300 000 views that tells me that's what i need to pay more attention to so that's where like that's what makes me really good as a ceo like i'm not religious to how things work i'm very religious to results so like as soon as i see the 300 000 i told my entire team like everybody should be producing five tick tocks a day like guys let's let's literally produce 15 to 20 tick tock slash ig reels and then let's just see what the happens but i just have a weird feeling that we're gonna blow up like we're gonna have the fastest growth we've seen to be honest it's actually not even that hard uh like it's what i see is that whenever i'm making those uh carousel posts what happens is that i have to focus a lot on the content itself and whenever i speak about it it's always very fast right because i'm just gonna say it and then i'm just gonna record myself i'm gonna be like hey everyone and how is it how's it going everything like that right it's not so here's the thing with all of this stuff go and look at the person that you resonate with you would like to make content like them and they're blowing up then model it very closely and make it in your field so for example one of the people that works with us amanath he helped me make an amazing ig reel that killed it do you guys want to see the work that i had to do you guys want to see the work i had to do for this reel that crushed it yes here's what i had to do okay watch me very closely because i'm about to show you how i got a hundred thousand views okay so i'm gonna show you guys a secret all right here's how it goes that's what i had to do guys i hate you okay can i get a rounding like clap ovation can i please get an ovation like please let's get that going so that's what i had to do and now let me you guys want to see the actual reel yes i saw it guys libraries right no no no no no that's what the i'm talking about like that's what i had to do i'm more bad that that works there's a similar one that's what i'm saying there's a similar one that like i made that like got 2.8 million views and it's just like me fingerpointing in different areas i i think i prefer doing tiktok content rather than youtube content i don't know why i just started so do that then do ticktock do do the thing that you really enjoy like really enjoying india that's the only problem yeah yeah yeah that's a huge problem right now yeah so like but ig reels is ig reels instagram has like guys tick tock uh i feel like what what happened to what what instagram did to snapchat like there used to be this app called snapchat that just like died when instagram stories came out i feel like the similar thing is going to happen to tick tock in the long run because instagram is now ticktock like literally instagram is tick tock the middle button is tick tock it's called ig reels and like you scroll through and it's literally tick tock so you can use ig reels and ig reels is worldwide and you can use it everywhere right um why i believe in content where there's like youtube because there's now real depth to it and now you can go a lot deeper with youtube with tick tock and all of this stuff you can get awareness really fast so that's really like the key thing there um awesome so yeah that's what i'm saying like it's not a lot of work what we have to do is just modeling what works is the really hard thing so guys how was the session for today how'd you guys enjoy it amazing awesome i am really happy that you guys really really enjoyed it thank you guys nice i'm so happy dude i'm so happy and happy birthday to you so i'm happy that you guys enjoyed it if you guys

you've ever even dreamed of creating a youtube channel how many of you like mildly even dreamed of like thinking about i could be a youtuber or creating a youtube channel just raise your hands right

personal brand development bro what the heck yeah so this is what i'm really excited about guys is the thing that my heart speaks to i love it i believe in it i think if people put in their effort it's almost a hundred percent chance of success there's a reason why it works for me my middle brother and my oldest brother who like everybody always thinks he's like super awkward and weird and he has like you know and he's like in engineering so that's like even a weirder thing but like he is on there he's crushing it so i'm like okay now everybody can do it he's really smart i'll give him
