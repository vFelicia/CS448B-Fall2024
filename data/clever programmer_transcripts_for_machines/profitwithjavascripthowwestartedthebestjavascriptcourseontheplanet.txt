what is up everybody hope you guys are doing amazing this is me and qazi and we are today going to be talking about the origin of how pwg came about like how it all got started and how i started working with you guys too yeah i think this is exciting we decided not to even prepare for this and just like kind of talk but man it was a pretty crazy journey it was it was i remember how profitable javascript started was like i think i was at wework and i had learned photoshop yeah and i just like make this made this thumbnail yeah with the javascript logo in there yeah and i wrote kick ass javascript yeah yeah yeah and i called up nas i was like okay but before we get into that bro before we get into that okay let's get let's get into like actually let's go from the beginning kind of how it all started like how i kind of came about to work with you guys and how do you realize that javascript could be like interesting or cool potentially right yeah like what i remember is so i was kind of coding i was doing freelance at the time right and i was you know on instagram and i put myself out on instagram i saw qazi and i saw you guys post right i'm like oh [ __ ] these guys found me from inside i found you on instagram yeah not from youtube from instagram but not from youtube not from youtube from instagram you didn't know that bro i found you on instagram like oh [ __ ] this guy is interesting but i was like hmm a little bit skeptical at the same point i don't know why a little skeptical like what you guys were doing you know but then like i remember like you started messaging on in comments and just like dming for at the same time and then you're like you're like bro let's get on the call together you know yes let's get a call and like let's do a live call yeah that was the random thing that we decided to do i was like hey let's do a live instagram live together you said yes let's do it yeah yeah and uh i went live i remember still i was right outside a barbell brigade which is a gym in l.a and i went for a walk i went live on instagram and then i saw you got on there too yeah so i you sent a request i accepted it right and boom we were live on instagram speaking yeah for whatever reason i always thought you were like he was like 30 years old and married and i have no kids no idea and you had like two or three kids i don't know why do i look that old do i look this old guy i just think he really you really have your life together and i think just like randomly made me feel like you were already married or something you know okay maybe i am like a compliment almost okay well thank you thanks for that so we got on the live we were talking and then all of a sudden the next thing i knew like we kind of just became friends right on that call yeah i think i realized i'm like holy [ __ ] like these guys are cool i actually remember frankie was filming too frankie was filming and i was just just to give you a contest i was in michigan at that time and you guys of course are in l.a and i was in michigan and i was just kind of in my room and i thought like holy [ __ ] these guys are cool and but we're delivering value to people what are we talking about we're talking about like what we're talking about web development we were talking about coding i mean there was just like live journey i think like developer coding journey yeah like yeah yeah yeah yeah and that but like oh [ __ ] these guys are cool i love their vibe i love everything and at that point like we kind of stopped talking after that like we didn't you know touch base too much after that right it was just like just you know commenting on instagram post and so forth yeah and what yeah i think after that live stream we had that like connection built yeah and i'm trying to remember how did it come about that you were gonna fly in so that was interesting i was that i actually registered for a conference um called popcon conference which is in las vegas and because i was doing freelance i was trying to find clients oh my god what i remember okay remember now i want to talk yeah yeah i'm done and i was trying to find clients and i literally went to that conference right and i had my tickets back back to michigan right at that like when the comments finished right but i don't know for some reason like i was like i don't know like when i went to vegas i was like i'm already here i'm like so close to cali i've always wanted to visit cali i know these guys are in cali why not just just go you hit me up and i remember it was like the most random time and you were like hey i'm gonna be coming by yeah yeah and then you said can i stay with you guys or something and i remember we were in the middle of doing a launch or launching another product because we were doing lots of product launches that year so we launched like earn 1k with python in terms of products i remember seeing that message and i was in between a yes or no right i loved your energy i wanted to hang out with you but the whole team i'm like what are you going to do with us because we're just going to be working the whole time really yes you thought you thought about that yeah so i'm like we're going to be working the whole time like i want to make sure because some you know one time i had tens income and we were just working the whole time so he was like he wasn't upset but i felt bad because i'm like we weren't spending enough time we're not spending any time with him you know so i'm like we might not spend any time with you so like i thought and i remember writing a message like kind of explaining that we might not be able to meet really yes and i remember no [ __ ] yes yes i actually did not know that i remember then holding delete like i selected at all no way i hit delete and i just said what let's go yeah yeah i felt like that was the moment that changed everything yeah yeah yeah that is the moment i remember i was in las vegas and i didn't tell you like uh i think i told you this a day before i actually came to cali i was in las vegas and i was in a hotel room like [ __ ] i'm gonna like i'm gonna decide right now and actually decide to go to cali i council my tickets back to michigan i got another more another ticket to go to cali and my friend who actually will went who went to vegas for me he went to he went back to michigan but i was like okay and i went to cali and i ran by message i remember messaging hey bro i'm gonna i'm gonna be in cali can i say your place i'm like yeah let's do it fellas i'm like oh [ __ ] that's awesome dude we might be able to find those messages really yeah dude that's hilarious but yeah like uh and then of course iran cali and so forth he gave me you know the address i arrived and so forth we were yeah we were trying like doing instagram lives with developers we were trying like i remember that gary v style shooting those lives with developers yeah but i didn't know that we were going to create these amazing relationships these amazing friendships as a result of it i just thought like ah just like instagram live i didn't really think about it that much and then yeah so we were trying a lot of random things and the nas came over we were and we hit it off like right away dude i remember i i remember to this day literally i don't but you know what's so funny though is that i arrived at your place you're like bro i'm not there i was really waiting there for like 10 10 15 minutes i was waiting for you and then you're like oh bro yeah i'm at this coffee shop and so i had to go to the coffee shop with with my luggage [Laughter] with my luggage it was like i'm not sure what coffee place that was but like i remember and i met you frankie first i remember i was kind of saying that and i see frank i'm like oh bro what's up man how you doing you know and like we kind of like we started talking i'm like oh yeah yeah we hit it off right away like we became friends or a lot of people where i speak with them and i'm like something is off like my humor is off with them or something just doesn't feel right it feels like a car that's just like it's stuck in the mud and it's like things are not landing you know it's not clicking but i remember with you with nas like it was we started talking we just became friends kind of instantly because we both had really high energy we were both focused on like growth we were both hungry and looking for more and so we hit it off really well and became friends kind of right away yeah that was cool that was cool and then of course we went we went to your place and then and then at that point i think i met aaron as well when you when aaron came over yeah and uh and yeah i just kind of saw the things that you guys are doing and i i saw you know the content you guys were making and literally i think remember the second day no i slept over your place right on the couch yeah which is and it was [ __ ] cold all remember it was [ __ ] cold as [ __ ] this guy likes to keep it was his room cold 65 degrees at night i remember it was so cold um but yeah and then the next day right away we went to wework yeah and we just started working yes and then for the next and here's the crazy part bro i actually my plan was actually to be there for a few days and then go back to michigan i end up being in california for a whole month oh yeah i had to find yeah pretty much a whole month i think it's like three weeks and something and a half yeah he ended up staying i think for a while yeah not your place but i got a bunch of airbnbs like i got tried while you're ready then turn on that baby yeah yeah yeah but the crazy thing was we didn't talk anything about a javascript product at that time no no no no it wasn't at that time so like he was there we hung out we did a lot of cool [ __ ] we like went to some coffee shops went on long walks talked just i remember you would jump into whatever we were doing he would work really hard but at this point you were also opposed to a javascript product oh because you guys are just python you didn't really not even do it you were opposed to it oh yeah i didn't want to do a javascript product yeah yeah yeah i'm like we gotta stick to python like as a python it has to be on brand what are you doing like what are you talking about i remember you were like let's talk let's do something with javascript or something you know but i remember another thing like i hit it off with people really well even when i think of my best and closest friends it's not just from like having conversations with them where i become really good friends with something is we do something in common yes so for example some of my best friends i remember playing ping pong i play one game with them up to 400 points i think it would be like insane that's crazy uh or some other my best friends like we became friends over chess some friends became friends over work like hard ass work that's what i felt about frankie and aaron and that's how i felt like i bonded with you a lot we would work really hard like we would get to we work and just i mean we worked you know what i'm saying we actually really cool is we remember we went to a conference it was like tai lopez conference remember we booked a coffee stick and went to a comp oh yeah but garyvee yeah and then you worked yeah yeah garyvee was there and then we actually got to work together there like i remember like you all huddled up i'm like okay guys let's focus what are we actually going to do that was like pumped like that the jt fox yeah was that what was it he said he was there but he saw him yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dude yeah okay honestly and it was so much fun but i realized it's like i'm like i love this team you guys are doing crazy stuff and i love the energy and i'm like oh [ __ ] this is something interesting i want to be part of that you know initially enough in my mind i would start to think about okay maybe i want to i want to talk to him potentially like about potential like a javascript but i never said anything though right yeah sorry like something my mind was i had them that thought of my mind but never said anything and i think after a month like you know we i think we all bound it bonded we went to did some cool stuff we went to a virtual virtual what's it called vr you know you know that was fun and then yeah yeah and then i went back to michigan yeah so he went back and i think for a little bit of time like we were we just went back to like back at work at clever programmer we started doing these really long tutorials because we had just recently gone to a youtube conference and we came back and we're like we gotta explode the youtube channel again you know youtube channel is dying so we started seeing like we saw mosh putting out these amazing shout out to mosh like these crazy long tutorials and i was like you know what we got to do these tutorials and so we started putting out amazing long form tutorials and then the channel started growing again also i remember at this time i was learning i was going crazy over thumbnails i'm like you know what you can make the best content on the planet but it will get no viewership so like we gotta get serious about this thumbnail thing it's not a joke anymore we can't just get random editors let's look let's learn it so i started opening up photoshop started learning how to make thumbnails everybody was like you know what are you gonna do with the thumbnails like why are you learning photoshop like you're not gonna get anything out of this yeah and i remember i'm like no just let me be let me do this let me play around with it and i was sitting at wework one day really late at night one or two am playing around put an image drag the javascript logo oh no way put it right next to the image wrote kick ass javascript that's what i was gonna think to call the product and i'm like oh my god oh my god i just like it was like visualized there yeah yeah yeah it looked awesome yeah i was like oh my god and i remember i just like told frankie and aaron i was like guys we have to do this and that was the day i think i woke up the next day and i was like hey nas he was like what's up i'm like wanna make a javascript product and i was like i literally i remember this and he called me up and i was really like laying in bed it was so funny i was laying in bed he was like bro let's do a javascript product man and i was like literally like a second later or like 10 seconds later bro let's do it [Laughter] he he had he had zero hesitation like no hesitation at all he literally like was just ready to go he's like yes he's like let's do it let's work on the javascript product it was kind of like it surprised me i'm like whoa yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's cool because i was like i was like i've always wanted to teach and i've always wanted to you know to share what i know and i know with these guys and their energy that they have i know that collectively we could just do some crazy stuff like i just knew that internally and especially when you when you have a good bond it's just it's not you know it's it's pretty it's a when you have a good bond then damage just gets created automatically and you know that's a good that's like a good partnership and a you know and it's a good way to work together i was gonna say that yeah so it was like brotherhood and literally getting to work on something special that could impact so many people like that's cool as [ __ ] i remember i was driving and we're both so psychotic like and i love that about him too because i'm like relentless with [ __ ] so i'm not like oh my god it's 8 p.m now i have to turn off and watch netflix like no like it's all it's go time kind of all the time and i remember i called you at like 9 or 10 p.m i was driving and we started working on the javascript modules in google docs i remember while i was driving yeah i was like bro send me the google docs and i'm like driving like oh sorry broke your mirror like i have the phone here oh google docs open and i was like you share it like all right give me editing permissions and we started coming up with modules and video titles on the on the spot on the call yeah yeah i remember that that was really awesome i opened up the document it was like okay bro let's think about this what are we gonna do module one we should do some intro right module two maybe do like going to advanced javascript right i mean we're thinking about crazy projects what to do that was epic that was really really cool because even from the start what we thought about is we we constantly kept thinking about what is a transformation that we could put somebody through and we purely focus on like there shouldn't be a single module that doesn't have projects because i am so sick and tired i was so sick and tired of going through so much crap and just doing theory during theory because i would get left and i'm like why did i learn like the theory behind sequel like but but it was almost like i got i always felt like i got baited and switched it was like you're gonna make this you're gonna do this and then i would leave and i would just have theory and i'd be like so what am i supposed to do with like raw sequel in python why did they teach me raw sequel in python like there isn't a [ __ ] orm like i can just i could have just started writing you know what i mean like been having a conversation with the database like just teach me so well i am yeah so it's like let's say you want to become a racer and all they keep teaching you is like how do you make a car how do you manufacture the parts like the math behind the physics and you're like i just want to race bro i just want to race here's what a car is made up of all these parts and you just keep learning that nonstop you know that doesn't get that like it doesn't get you anywhere so so like i was so frustrated i wanted to make sure that every single thing had a project i remember i was talking to you and i was like let's think about projects first yes and i remember we also talked about like bro we need to do this differently than like udemy or something like that you know because like udemy yes is great but we're like okay but we want to we want to take this into where we create a community where we really make a transformation and i remember how but how did he come about with the profit with javascript like the actual like name like how did that come about i remember that i was sitting there and i could the the kickass javascript i liked it but it didn't really sit well with me yeah we kept brainstorming we kept brainstorming and i kept thinking i don't know necessarily whose idea it was um i mean i like to think it was mine but you know i don't know probably it's gonna be like you know it's so long i don't remember but like i remember that somehow we came up with the idea of like between kick ass javascript and profit with javascript because i wanted to focus on what was the result that it got and what made it stand out from everything else another reason with kick ass was i was like is facebook gonna learn you know let us run ads on kick ass because ass is a bad word so they might not allow it but i wanted to make sure that it focused on actual transformation that people got so i wanted to go okay you're not just gonna learn some cute stuff you're gonna like es6 like actual cool features like actual things that landed people jobs or so they could make an income and that's how we came up with the name like we were in between profit with javascript and kickass javascript for a while yeah and eventually we ended up like finally just going with profit with javascript and then i think at that point when we decided kind of the modules we decided what we decided on the name then we all got together we built the sales page now and this was the really cool part and i was like oh [ __ ] yeah it is so awesome to be part of such an epic team i remember together aaron it was frankie you right we were all together we were working on the sales page of this of this product and like i remember like it was like you know for hours and hours per day we were working on this and and and then we actually got into like okay let's launch this yeah we wanted to showcase what the product was what it did for people and like we made the sales page which like and we hadn't made the product yet we'd let everybody know the product is going to be coming soon right but we wanted to see if people would have any amount of interest because if people had no interest in it then we didn't want to like launch it and get behind it we believe that it's something that could help transform people's lives but if the people don't believe it then it doesn't matter like we didn't want to fall just in love with our product we wanted to fall in love with our customers right so if our customers are not in love with something that's not a place where we should be spending our energy you know yeah so we launched this thing on how did we launch it black friday or something like friday it was like last year like friday friday last year yeah it was literally last year where we just passed the anniversary let's go we just wanted to see uh how people would respond to it and the response was [ __ ] amazing it was overwhelming it was like i woke up i'm like oh my god oh my god i slept that night at wework are you serious they frown upon that but i slept at wework on a couch oh yeah extremely uncomfortable i use my jacket and the blankets that they have there really i don't know if you you probably were there you guys were probably there yeah we worked our ass off and we went to sleep at wework i woke up and i would check and i'm like oh my god another student oh my god another student oh my god another oh my god we were going crazy and i remember in those days we got i don't remember the exact number but i remember it was between like 100 to like 400 students that actually enrolled in the program and i was like okay [ __ ] this is real nas get ready to work your ass off we're gonna need to start executing and making these and that's when i actually and a few days later actually flew into michigan oh yeah that was really interesting and when we when we realized that holy [ __ ] this is actually happening that's like that's when it became real i remember you're like bro let's how about i just fly to michigan and why did you say hold on why did you decide why did you decide to fly what was the reason why did i not fly why did you decided to fly oh you're you're oh you were going to your parents house or my or you're going to your parents you're like i'll stop by i'll stop by your house at the same time we'll work together and then we're like okay bro let's let's build together let's build modules together okay i'm like oh let's do it let's do this so he came over he came over uh now this time to my house i met mama domonsky his mom she loves me yeah yeah she's a pretty awesome woman i slept in his basement in like a little room don't make it seem that bad bro it's a pretty cool cool room it's got everything it's gone it's a super dope room and we like we made tick tocks and oh yeah yeah i started learning dancing the first two days the first day that you were around we were making tick tocks the whole time and actually epic tic tacs and we made tic tacs for students as well like to actually have fun like bro we're working on the modules that was ton of fun and and yeah we just kind of started and then we went to europe i remember this one day we went to we worked like okay we actually i need to show the module yeah we had a lot of fun let's actually shoot the module yeah and we went to wework we actually got started you're like yeah we set up um we shot so guess the number and like again a bunch of the content at your house module two i think module three as well yeah we would stay up till really late shooting the content at your house yeah and then we like set it up like the blue light in the back and it was kind of nice and then after that we went to uh another important thing was a lot of the content and ideas we were coming as coming up with them as we were doing them it wasn't like we had it all planned out the more the more videos we made the more ideas we got of like what to make next yeah and then yeah and then the next day we woke up i remember it was like day three or four or something and then it was freezing cold winter and then we went to wework to actually work and it's so interesting i actually remember i was sick like crazy i was sick at that time yeah i was taking the time like unless i'm just looking at my camera and i'm like i look like i'm dying man i look at the camera holy moly but yeah we went to ebook and i think that day we just went straight into it like little we locked ourselves in one room you know locked ourselves in one room and we just started working start recording we you got the yeti mic i think i had it getting mic as well and and i think we were we worked literally from like 2 p.m i think oh 12 p.m yeah and then when we finish midnight probably probably no bro later we went to like until the next day morning oh remember we were like dying oh yeah yeah yeah it was like really awful like sleep to prep like crazy like it might have been the next morning and then we met some dude who like was making a app for instagram yeah yeah right like we like literally i think it was like till the next day we were like zombies you know after after you stay up past a certain time you go into the zombie mode we're just like dragging on with like zero energy but like your body is still like moving and you can like still do some stuff yeah we were at that level yeah it was crazy it was crazy and then we kind of finished that up and then finally kind of went home and they're like oh [ __ ] and then i think and i think that's probably just kind of crashed at that point crazy ups and downs we had while actually making this content for the course but the most important north star for us the entire time for this product was transformation transformation focus on the transformation don't focus on you're gonna learn this thing and this thing and this thing and this theory and this theory and this theory and just like get up in it yeah it was constantly like focus on taking somebody who takes it from point a to point b so they can get a job or they can get freelancing work or they can have an actual career so that was uh important very helpful north star because we could have just got stuck making content that was just like more information that's actually what made us more like made it more exciting as well to build it because if you just build it just say for example if you build like a udemy course you just build just like okay i'm going to build this project versus i'm going to like versus we're going to build this to actually you know to help people to get them jobs to get them freelancing jobs whatever it might be that just makes it so much more exciting yeah and i was like yes and that is the course well you need to take but that is the course that we would love to build yes or i would love to build as well yeah right so that was the course that like you know when i thought about it and we were like okay every single module is gonna have an actual real world project and we were kind of relentless about that you know we were like make something and we're like no like none of this stuff you know um like we don't want to put the most basic stuff in there like todo list and then the whole thing is over you know that's that's it and then everything else is theory so we're pretty relentless with it we wanted to put the google maps project we're like hey let's actually build fullon applications like whether it's an instagram clone or whatever it is like let's make sure that we are building real world things the entire time yeah yeah yeah and i think of course that that was our goal and i think at that point once we started with that then then kind of the whole team got together then we did another launch and then we got into coaching much how we got into coaching but we got to remember do you remember how do we get to coaching um i actually i don't exactly know what made us want to do like two to three weekly coaching calls every single week i don't remember what caused that but what i do remember specifically that was like crazy was i was sitting there and we came up like i came up i was in my underwear and i was like on slack and working and i'm like you know what one of the best ideas you ever came up with was moving our team to slack and then also that made us move the customers to slack we were in between discord and slack slack was just a way better option by every single mean because just a much better productive work environment especially for coding discord was better for gaming also we we realized i was like sitting there thinking and i'm like how can we make the community selfsustaining so they can actually help each other and that was the day we came up with the idea of profit of javascript success coaches yeah oh yeah that was really interesting yeah yeah so like that was something where it was like holy crap this has not been seen anywhere before you know like no program has other coaches in there that are actually giving you video feedback on your code like students who enrolled into the course now become coaches themselves and are coaching other people like how cool is that and that that's awesome because now you're coming from a point of like people are coming from a very simple point of view right if you're someone who just learned for example javascript right you can now teach someone who is a complete beginner with a very simple matter because you're still that beginner partially beginner as well yeah it's kind of like how i explain it like when you were in a math class and the professor wasn't making sense to what he was saying yeah but when you asked your buddy he was like this dumb dude who's sitting right next to me he's like yeah this is you know scary over the one you're like oh my god this algebra equation makes complete sense yeah yeah so your peers can sometimes actually do a better job and we wanted to make sure it was students that were qualified to be a success coach they were like the top performing students in the program and we created a structure around where they can actually take your code or anybody's code make a video feedback on it and send it back to you so that started creating like a very revolutionary type of experience in the program and that's the day the community started going to a whole another level uh and it started to become like a experience where it was like family for them yeah yeah it was like family i remember getting on calls with like with like the success coaches and talking about like what can we do for the students yeah and talking about what type of coaching goals we can all do like it was awesome like it was it's literally like you're building almost like a university but like a different type of like 21st century university within within this community yeah so the one thing that we actually didn't hit on is i think probably the biggest breakthrough we ever had was the momentum of like actually creating a community before students even got into profit with javascript that made it actually have an amazing community yeah so it was the first time we did a regular launch and we had a bunch of students enroll so around april we decided to do this like five day free facebook challenge javascript challenge javascript challenge we told students we're going to build google maps and we're going to make like fun projects in there yeah and uh we had tons of people sign up we ran this campaign on facebook and we had like 10 or 20 000 people registered for the challenge 50 000 people yeah 15 000. it was crazy it was the biggest javascript challenge that has ever run in the world unless i'm missing something it was crazy because i remember this is something new that we haven't seen ever before and we get we got 50 000 people and we literally the whole team were just working nonstop to just deliver value and just like have fun with it like i remember i remember literally me and aaron were literally like on a call together for like 10 hours straight on zoom call and this happened i think as well when during when kova hit too right this is when cloven hit right yeah so we were all kind of working a little bit remotely yeah and ovid went ham and march march yeah yeah yeah then and uh i just i'll just remember like me aaron of course and the other guys we all just working nonstop over zoom like to do this javascript challenge it was hard i mean for a small team to put it together like we are we are a small team we still are we were even a smaller team back then and for us to be able to put together this challenge was absolutely a herculean effort it was like one of the hardest things we've ever had to do because we didn't know it was going to be a is going to be possible we didn't know how we were going to get the money to run the ads to let we didn't know if it was going to make any money back we're like we we're just excited because it's going to change the world like that's all we're like just going to create an amazing experience for people and maybe good things will happen let's just see what happens end up being an amazing experience and it ended up being like one of the best experiences of our lives because we put ourselves through so much stress but i remember we would be on that live and we would have six seven eight hundred people live sometimes over a thousand people live watching and it was crazy and these people would be taking like instagram stories and tagging us from their homes and their computers and like sharing it and we would see the instagram stories and we're like oh my god these are real people watching the challenge that was so that was so like oh i remember like to this day i was like mom imagine this imagine coding with 900 people together in one room imagine this is literally what's going on right you're coaching and everybody is coding together 800 900 people are coding together and they're actually creating a project from scratch yeah i was like holy [ __ ] like that got me so excited i remember seeing all like people were tagging us in their projects people were like tagging us you know there was someone who had like a humongous like 90ish tv and we were on that tv bro i remember that photo that was insane man yeah i was like oh my god never but all parts of the world like we had registrants from hong kong we had registrants from korea tunisia turkey pakistan united states united kingdom we had people from like egypt canada we had people from um france italy germany literally like these registrants from all over the world and when they were sending us the photos it was like one of the most humbling and fun experiences of our entire lives i think it made us even more excited to actually to continue but it made us even more excited to put even more time and effort into this dude i'm getting excited about the next challenge just from talking about this like i'm actually just genuinely getting excited it's coming soon we're about to do another challenge and in the next few days we're actually about to launch another challenge this one is gonna be the biggest challenge that we've done yet so i am so freaking excited it's gonna be crazy how we're going to be running this one like it's going to be absolutely insanely twice as much of like effort than even probably the first one i will say because for this one we're freaking thinking to go all out like literally we might be doing two to eight hour long sessions yeah we're gonna be dead man zoom like everybody live on zoom so we might yeah this actually might be really really nuts uh we're gonna be creating crazy projects we're gonna have people dancing and laughing and crying crazy workshops crazy workshops with a lot of amazing people like imagine well i don't wanna i don't spoil it i don't wanna spell it right now like but it's gonna be fun uh so this is gonna be super super exciting but we remember going back to march this year the challenges were the things that really let us like communicate what's inside of this product yeah like it it let us like explain what the family and community is like by providing it for free on facebook yeah now we can't sustain that forever because we need to be able to have a real company and we need to get everybody paid so we can have amazing people like nas or frankie or people who are running the community so like we gave them a free incredible experience the best that we could just from the facebook challenge and then when the students joined the course then we continued it there you know so that gave us the best way to explain what this like what this amazing product is and i remember it's it was so cool when we started doing coaching calls on the thing on the first or second coaching call i was like you know what how about we do some dancing together you know to to this day like all my all my life i was like how can i merge like these two passions of like dancing and coding you know there's always my mind like how can i do that how could that happen yeah and here it was like we were on the coaching call i think was like 25 people at that point like holy [ __ ] 25 people and i was like hey guys how about we do some dancing yeah and then we literally started doing some dancing and people were pumped man like i was like let's go people were waving around their hands we used to get 25 people live on the coaching calls and profit with javascript and that was like crazy to have 25 people live and it was amazing on the zoom to see 25 human beings because even though i do youtube and we do youtube you don't see anybody else so it's still like you're talking to a camera and then everything else is a number right so 25 is a lot how many do we get like now now we get from 100 to 150 depending that's a lot of people in a room a lot of people don't know everything that's a lot of people dancing man there's a lot of people dancing and and it's so so cool now that portion of like for example dancing for example now providing value through a coaching call which is just a lot of fun indeed just in general but then actually dancing it out and having fun in the end yeah that also became such a big part of the product that like i still to this day like uh tell me like let's do dancing every single coaching call literally and so whenever i'm like guys are you ready are you ready are you ready they're like let's go like people have like their lights in the background people bring guitars bro it's insane man and now it's become such a big part of it not like now like between the js challenge between you know the success coaches between like the slack community how it all just came about is like so in a way in a way a little bit like random yes but almost like brutal amounts of work and effort like but then at the end now it's like now that is the reason why it is now it's like uma thurman and kill bill when she's dead when it starts and she's dead in a casket she's just just punching her way through yeah and then she like breaks the casket her hands come out of the grave and she's like it was kind of like that how this came together we're like holy [ __ ] there's so much work we're being buried under the work we can't possibly do anymore we're gonna die under stress in the lounge like come on come on come on ah oh and then finally we just like broke through the casket our hand came up through the mud and like we finally saw the light and we came out and made it alive and and in the wake of it had created something brilliant that was bigger than us bigger than us bigger than me and it became a family and now it's really really cool to see like how much they care for each other like there's no question that's ever unanswered in slack they will there's gonna be somebody who's gonna freaking respond they break off into their own groups we don't even know about this literally i don't even know like parents like what are you guys doing when i talk to students they're like yeah yeah we got this we're trying to stop them from collaborating stop it's unhealthy go to sleep get some sleep stop coding we're like literally like like as we talk to students they're like oh yeah i got you know this guy and this guy and this girl and this girl yeah we're kind of just like working every single day and we have literally have people he wanted one of the guys told me he's like yeah one of my friends uh from pdj community he literally goes ahead and texts me every single day hey are you coding today did you code today did you code today like what the heck man like like that to me is insane like the amount of love that that has created yeah that's just and we got amazing people like david we got from the challenge i remember tatiana amana and like all these amazing people jen and there's so many like rami like all these people that like came about and became part of the family some of them are now working at clever programmer but like man that that challenge in march the challenge we did again the challenge we just did now like lifechanging experience for us for the people um it is so freaking cool and i think for the mo the most important thing is like we just have fun with it like we literally have fun and i realized is because we we put our hard soul into this yeah like i mean the whole team put their heart and soul into this right yeah this product now has a heart and soul and literally yeah exactly this breathes it breathes like it breathes you know um and so now it is what it is today and like i'm just excited for where it's gonna go next man yeah so super excited for where it's gonna go next i can't wait like dude i'm so thankful to have you on the team and for us to create this and you guys of course yeah give me bring it bro holy [ __ ] this guy almost made out with me he's been going out on too many dates [Laughter] put a blanket underneath us the [ __ ] lights you know yeah pattern interrupt you know so yeah so basically very thankful to work with him on this you know and made amazing progress like a year ago it didn't exist it was just a twinkle in our eyes now yeah and now it's like this real thing that breeds is a living or breathing organism and has how many how many members two thousand fifty right i think almost thousand five hundred twenty five twenty thousand hundred to the five hundred i mean what is i think it's twenty one hundred students right now so about like 2100 students joined this program uh we love every single person in the community these coaching calls are always amazing yeah so it's really cool how it came together and now it's something that has taken on a life of its own and it's amazing amazing like we say it so much that it sounds like we sound like a broken record but just like these students getting these results you know like people going from not having a job like uh rishi's was pretty emotional for me like because i saw on instagram story him posting like how when he got a job as he was a beginner he grew up in front of my eyes i watched him grow up as a developer you know and when he got his job and he went from i think ontorio to calgary and he drove and left his family behind so like that was kind of sad yeah but then when he went and he documented his journey and then he got a job and now he's excited to work there and now he's making 50k as a web developer and like i actually talked with him yesterday he's like he loves his job he loves what he does and he's like bro it's all thanks to you guys like i'm like i mean bro it's all thanks to of course your hard work we're happy to we're happy that we have helped you we kind of guided you but of course at the end of the day it was still your work and we're just happy that you got the results that you wanted man yeah we're happy that you're happy so those or like jen who's like crushing it went from a junior developer to a senior developer went from 46k to 96k 100k plus with bonuses and then just so many other students you i'm sure you guys can hear us talk about that all the time staying cool at one point i had like um a woman a mom was on a coaching call and she was like nas i just want to thank you guys so much for what you guys are doing i have my kids here who are 10 years old and 11 years old and they're doing all the projects they are on the coaching calls with me and her kids literally like came on like on her lap they were just sitting there like oh yeah yeah it's so awesome just think 11 years old man yeah coding and building crazy projects i mean how sick is that it's pretty crazy but like it's you know we have strict car who's like 13 and landing freelancing clients and we have nasir who's 14 and he's landing freelance clients like what who's teaching them to do this is it even legal is are they even allowed to get clients i mean i don't know but it's really amazing to see that so those 11 years old you know they need to catch up they got some work to do yeah like imagine you're 11 and then you see like this other kid at 13 landing clients you're like [ __ ] like i got to get my life together like what am i doing like i need to step up so to the 11 year old who's in our program it's okay you got time you got you got some time be patient we love you you're still crushing it so i mean to me like when i'm on the coaching call with them if those moments i know what you're talking about it made me emotional when i was watching it because i was like this is kind of really cool you know like he's going to be inspired he's going to do something who knows he's going to make the next the next tick tock you know or maybe the next thing that like crushes tick tock and then is like grow outgrowing it whatever it is that they do and then and then he might also teach others right so he'll pass down what we passed down to him you know they will then pass down to others and so now we're just creating it's like a ripple effect right of so many developers teaching each other and just that's what makes it even more fun that's what makes it even more impactful so that's where we are well now i want to skip to now and now guys where we are we're in l.a i moved to l.a and now we're working on multiple different products we're roommates we're roommates we're all working together and in one place we're having fun we're out here in san diego it is beautiful and honestly we'll see what happens like i'm super excited the trajectory is looking great there's so many amazing challenges coming up for us in our lives and like we're excited to grow this product we're excited to help a lot of people maybe you watching it become developers whether it's with our free content on youtube or in our course like we don't care our goal is to help you get to that next level so we just thought it would be cool to share our insights what we learned from this experience and just like document the story because it's very rare to be with people who you call friends you can call a brother and then you guys also get some epic [ __ ] done and change the world so i'm very grateful for that i want to thank you for watching this and uh
