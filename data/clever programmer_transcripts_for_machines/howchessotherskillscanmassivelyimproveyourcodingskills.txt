hey you what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm so for the last few days I have been at chest state championships coaching the announced North High School chess team I used to play on that chess team in 2000 2009 to 2012 and I ended up winning two state championships during my high school career but I wanted to now kind of return the favor and coach the team because that's something I absolutely love to do and absolutely love to play chess so this video is gonna be a little bit about chess so let's jump right into it so to keep it relevant for you guys I'm gonna start off with one of my students asking me a computer science question that's related to high school and then transitioning over to a career so I'm gonna have him ask me that question and then I'm gonna answer it because I want to keep this relevant to you guys as well here we go my question is in order I am a high school student and in order for me to get a head start in the field of Technology and computer science I was wondering what I could do to get ahead in the field and learn the technical skills needed to get a job or an internship at a company how would I would actually answer that question is that work on soft skills more than you actually work on technical skills so yes improve your technical skills focus on them but I want you to work really hard on your negotiation skills and your tactical skills in your interviewing skills a lot of software developers just hope and pray that if they are good enough good jobs will just land on them and that doesn't happen and that doesn't happen with standardized testing either a CTS how do you score well on your high school a CT which is the standard test that you get in junior year of high school is you start actually taking literally the test and get good at taking the test so with getting a better job you have to get good at actually looking for jobs and interviewing for the jobs so that would be my answer work on soft skills work a lot on negotiation skills all right let me give you a little bit of a backstory here the the chess tournament that we had which was going to the state chess championships we kind of left on Thursday like really early in the morning like 6 7 a.m. and then we got on the van and then we'd roll like I was driving the team and then my other coach was there too and we got in we settled in around on Thursday yes and the tournament is a twoday tournament so the tournament took place on Friday and then the tournament also took place on Saturday so it's a twoday tournament there are seven total rounds and there were a hundred and forty nine teams there so depending on how how many games you want that's how you kind of got your ranking so in the chess tournament on at the state championships level with schools how it works is there's a eight board team so eight of your people announce north to go around playing against other eight player teams and if the noun or team members wins then you know that that makes us go to the next round with a good result our ultimate score at the end was five wins and two losses which puts us as the 27th best team in the entire state which you know may be good for some teams but for now north historically we haven't done like this in the last 20 years we have scored higher but our team did actually a lot better than we had expected because we have lots of new players who are inexperienced and these guys these students these kids are crazy like as a team they pulled through they were doing really well they were taking so many teams asses like out of nowhere we were thinking that we're gonna get only three wins or four wins and I'm gonna show you a little bit in the snapchat stories with you the quality is not that good but I think that you're gonna watch it and you you'll enjoy it and if you enjoyed it you know just comment below okay that was pretty cool and also like the video because I want to make sure that this video gets out to more people because remember the notification systems of the YouTube are completely like kind of broken right now so these videos aren't going out to everybody like they're supposed to and when you do that it makes sure that it gets ranked higher and so more people are likely to see especially you know people like you we're watching this video right now as a matter of fact so let's do that in the video and that I'm gonna share with you you're gonna be seeing me play some chess and I'm gonna be playing with some of my students I'm gonna be playing with my former coach his name was Harry Caray Oz's and I learned a lot from them and honestly a lot of the skills that I've learned from chests have translated into my coding a problemsolving skills high like levels of patience and then being able to analyze positions because in chess you have to analyze each position and you have to calculate out moves that are kind of very deep so I hate when people make and random analogies and connected to chess I ask it's so annoying for me they like connect anything to chests oh it's just like chess oh you're just making the next move but you know in certain respects I think it's okay and here I think I can make that analogy because for me chess did help me become the person I am today honestly I wasn't a very good student my whole life in school and so becoming good at chess becoming top 1% in the world you know just by playing on high school team and then you know just doing a lot on my own like studying and working hard every day it allowed me to get skilled at something and then I attack it and then that translated into spilled over into other things like coding and programming so for you guys if you are doing something else like another sport you know don't just wait it to get into programming like keep up with other skill because you'll be surprised how many other things from your different skill set even if it's table tennis or pool or swimming or whatever else will transfer over into coding like a lot of sportsmanship I had in a lot of like this insane ability that had developed to never ever ever give up and just like if I was stuck on a chess puzzle I would be stuck on it for weeks I would not look at the answer and then for me encoding what that meant was I would be stuck on a coding problem for weeks and I would not look at an answer and also not quit because 99% of the people when they can't find an answer they quit and I would just keep going and keep on learning you think so I would recommend you have different skill sets and you'll be surprised by how much they'll help you also I want to take this moment to just quickly talk about depth of versus breadth okay or with focus on being depth first and everything in computer programming there is an algorithm for search and it's called depthfirst search and I am a huge fan of that and I think you should live your life like that as well and what that means is instead of going inch wide you know for a mile you should go a mile deep and an inch wide okay so instead of learning 20 different languages and learning like little bit of every different language learn one language and learn it damn well learn all the concepts and everything involved inside of it hey Eric did you win against me guys seriously joking aside I want to give a big shoutout to Eric I've been working with Eric since he was in seventh grade and right now he's a junior in high school which puts him at 12th grade so our 11th grade she means he's been I've been coaching him for five years he's been able to do some tremendous things and I was incredibly proud of him at this tournament especially what he was able to accomplish the next part of the story is kind of dedicated to Eric so I really want you guys to watch this and also just you know give if you can give him a little appreciation in the comments below I'll show him and I'm sure it'll make his day okay guys this is the game break around the last round there's only one person playing on our team if he wins our team win explanation eric is playing this is the last round if he wins our team wins if he draws our team draws and if he loses our team loses this is super dramatic we are about to walk in right now so tournament rooms are dead quiet so what I'm gonna try to do is provide a little commentary here for you guys so here you're watching that Eric needs to win this round the other seven members on our team at Niles North some of them lost some of them want but ultimately it came down to Eric in chess you can either win by your clock hitting zero or you lose if your clock hits zero or you can checkmate the other person so that's how it works in real professional chess tournaments so Eric is kind of thinking here and he's trying to win he has a much better position also I forgot to mention that he's playing on board one which is the most difficult board to play on board eight is the lowest rated and board one is two highest rated and he had about twenty or thirty people crowded around him watching his game near the end so he has a tremendous amount of pressure here but ultimately Eric was able to break through and win the game like this was a tremendous moment for nows north and it was able to pull Niles north through to the next round and then play in the final round so ultimately our team ended up doing well everybody played well together I was extremely proud of everybody and here just some goofs and gaps for you guys to enjoy because we are just what feature does Android have that iPhone doesn't give us an example that's right for a sport or for another hobby that you have get really good at one thing and then move on to different things like become really deeply skilled because nobody cares about just these generalists like people want to work with specialists so I would highly recommend becoming a specialist and kind of everything that you get yourself into like really get a deep knowledge of it and then you can take a step back and then try to develop some soft skills around it for me what that meant was getting programming skills and then working on my negotiation and soft skills thank you guys for watching so much if you like the video please hit that like button subscribe to the channel and go ahead check out some of my
