what is up guys how's it going this is kazzy from clevver programmer thank you so much for joining we are live right now i just got a brand new studio i have a lot of things going on in my life that i would love to kind of give you an update on and mainly my goal is just to kind of connect with every single person because i haven't done that in a while and honestly i miss doing that so this stream is mainly to connect with you and so if you're in the chat or you're around definitely throw in some ideas or you know throw in some chats and i think what i would love to do as well with this is brainstorm and come up with a couple of you know different ideas with you as well about what type of content you would love to see on this channel hey how's it going hi sachin how are you doing nice to have you on here we have hairy minnie in the house let's go we got magesh magesh i see you on on the instagram i see on instagram so good to have you in here yo what is up zaki we got zaki vt it's been a while it's been a while what is up zzz hello what now hi gaming world hi cult patil hey jj trends hey ahmed raza hey jakka hi lawrence yeah finally a new video programmer marine says let me actually pop that up if i can show the setup yeah so there's a lot going on with this new studio i mean let me know how you guys like it as well but you know it's still in the process right you can see the kind of tv in the back uh right there that tv is not uh hooked up yet so we have to set it up because i got a new apartment so i moved to a brand new place and setting it up i wanted to make this studio look a lot better than all the previous studios i've had so the lighting setup is pretty cool i got two lights in the back i put some trees so it feels like i'm in a i'm in a jungle it doesn't just feel like i'm in this barren land um and then you know the the white board in the back of course yo what's up guys we got 140 people here what's up rnj communications joseph joe hey aryan how are you doing hi marouf hi jay communications yeah um it's hard for me to show the exact setup because my camera is right there right so let me actually figure something out and see if i can see if i can connect to my phone and show you guys from my phone so we'll take a we'll take a look real quick let's see if i can connect my phone as a source okay does that work oh that actually works beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so i can actually show you guys a setup now let me see if i can go this way oh unfortunately that does not work like i expected it to work okay so let me do this let me stay here and let's see if i can add a give me one second i apologize guys we're we're doing this live so my apologies okay whoops let's see can i switch this camera to the phone perfect let's go oh that allowed us to go wide on it too perfect all right that is a terrible view i'll just show it like this let's take this off i apologize so this is the setup right now that i have i got one light over here i have another light over there i got the camera right uh my second monitor where all the chats and kind of everything is coming in that i'm seeing my stream deck is right here stream deck allows me to control the lights if i press this button the lights go off press this button the lights come on right all of these lights right there i got the speakers set up and then what's cool about this monitor right here is it can tilt so when i'm coding i like to code on a like vertical monitor setup instead of like a um instead of a sideways setup you know how do you guys like the code by the way have you guys tried any vertical monitors because they're really really really cool like if you ever try a vertical monitor it's really cool by the way it's sachin's birthday so happy birthday sachin happy birthday yeah so vertical monitor like i can code all along and i don't have to scroll as much i can see the context of the entire like app in one go so if my coding productivity improves a lot when i have a vertical monitor set up it's planted there as you can see um clean setup yeah it's not super clean yet i'm working on making it clean uh it's it's decent it's decent it's definitely a decent setup but we've got to do a lot of improvement on it so let's see if i can switch my camera back here perfect okay so that wasn't too bad it wasn't too bad we we made it we made it work yeah all right what's going on why don't you make videos on data science kafka hadoop yeah that would actually be a fun idea i am not very good at data science so if i were to make videos they would be kind of from scratch and so it'd be like newbie videos if you guys are cool with that hey i'm down that would be fun um do you guys by the way do you guys do clean setup yeah you're an inspiration thank you man i appreciate that your phone's wallpaper is matt matt cute oh you guys saw that that's funny probably when i was locking it huh let's see man the frame behind is awesome you guys like that frame in the back yeah it's pretty dope right she's wearing um that's my girlfriend she's wearing boxing gloves because she's a pro boxer and now she's a pro wrestler so that's pretty cool and um i'm the dude with the laptop i just took on so i'm gonna also be kind of sharing life updates right like like i said in the start uh just because i haven't seen you guys in a while and i would love to kind of connect with every single person here you know it's been it's been a minute i've missed you guys honestly i've been doing too many recorded videos and i missed the thing about live streams hey jj trends just said hey i got my first fiverr order on javascript it's a 500 project that i learned by javascript in your videos let's go jj that is awesome man that is so cool let me pop that up on the screen that is awesome let's give that a big highlight right there let's see if i can still play my sounds okay there we go that's the clapping you guys let me know if you guys heard the sound of the clapping that'd be great awesome job jj real real proud of you man that is really cool super happy to hear that um aaron is um aaron is out doing his stuff he is you know uh yeah he's like killing it in everything that he's doing in life so aaron is not here right now yeah my gesh it's been it's been a while especially doing these lives man i missed this aryan says i watch a lot of your videos thank you aryan i appreciate it most definitely what's up yo front forum focus what is up um we definitely have a lot of react on the channel like every video has react i can't remember the last video that didn't have react except for this one right this one is not going to have that much react dope programmer says hey i got a chance to build social media because if you thank you thanks qazi i appreciate you as well thank you i'm happy that you're working on it i just completed your amazon clone it's so amazing 100 you got it yeah those react videos are a lot of fun honestly they're a lot of fun but every video that we do even if we're doing if even if we're doing these web 3 videos they are very heavily focused on react there's a lot of react in there so we're definitely not by any means cutting out react or doing less of it i think that we're doing even more of it because these projects are massive and then there's ton of react work that's happening in there oh some coding news that actually would be fun that's actually a great idea coding news like kind of what's new do you guys know any good websites for that um because there was something there's this blog app that's like pretty good or i forget what it's called but it like you go there and it shows you like a couple of trending blogs or what's going on in the developer world by the way i noticed your courses are very practical oriented have you considered covering some more of the academic stuff like data structures and algorithms yes so uh that is actually a really good idea we definitely have uh we're definitely that's something we're actually thinking about data structures and algorithms lance who's new on our team well he's not new anymore he's been working with us for over six months now but lance he's one of our bootcamp instructors and he is really good at data structures and algorithms so we've been thinking about him teaching some data structures and algorithm stuff on this channel that would be really really cool next js with typescript yep we're definitely doing we've done some typescript but yeah we're definitely doing a lot of next.js thank you for your react videos i recently got an internship as a react developer brilliant that makes me so happy to hear that is awesome really proud of you for that yo david what is up broski david is like cause he's flexing that uh because he's flexing the studio yeah yeah a little bit i'm flexing it and i'm also sharing with everybody the studio and uh you know just kind of showed them what i have in here would you guys want to know how much the studio costs or does anybody want to take a guess how much the studio costs let's see can i do a poll uh i can only add yes or no options it's kind of boring yeah take a guess i don't actually know at the top of my head how much it costs so i'll have to think about it but yeah take a guess and uh i'll let you guys know if you guys are in the right direction or not the person that gets guesses the closest how about this i'll paypal you i'll pay pal you uh fifty dollars okay how about that we'll keep it simple oh webassembly stuff zacky man i'm staying away from that webassembly bro aryan says 8 thousand dollars jj trent says 200 000 60 ten thousand dollars hmm interesting fifty thousand man you guys are uh you guys are guessing some massive numbers you could be right or you could be wrong i don't know david do you want to like calculate how much my studio is like roughly even if it's not exact and just text it to me don't post it in youtube chat but text it to me and i'll take a look at it 20k okay between one and two million dollars yeah that would be a really nice studio huh one trillion dollars no audio you guys should be able to hear my audio right i hope so i hope so my keyboard is a very simple keyboard this my keyboard is just the apple keyboard regular one it's very dirty but it's the apple keyboard as you can see right regular keyboard i used to have a mechanical keyboard but then i decided to not use a mechanical keyboard anymore because it has a windows key most of the times and it's kind of annoying because apple you don't have that key and then there's alt and apple doesn't have alt apple has like option and control and so then it doesn't really work and then my f3 and my f4 buttons and my brightness buttons like they don't really work as normally as you would expect 7200 boom let's see um all right david is uh david is giving me kind of some guesses hey i've already shown my board buddy maybe you wanna thank you amanath i appreciate that good work good work good work uh if anybody wants to jump on the stream to do an interview or something do let me know that could be cool because we could definitely set that up tried any functional programming stuff yeah functional programming is a lot of fun but i haven't been trying anything functional programming recently except i'm just doing a lot of functional programming in javascript but yeah i was doing closure and things of that nature audio is good right can somebody communicate yeah yeah people are saying good audio but some people are saying no audio but then some people saying audio is gucci hmm that is confusing man matec matex says it is where's my tech montage my bad my touch says it's nine k my studio setup nine thousand dollars and then i'll put on some guesses all right i'll i'll put up some guesses at this point and you guys pick honestly guys i apologize i don't even know who's the closest one oh wait i know there's a few people who are pretty close actually um there's one person that got it exact like on the dot a few people that got on the dot so i apologize i'll have to pick one person kind of randomly even if multiple people got it but if you took multiple guesses and they were different i don't think i'll count you you have to pick one and stick with it there's some people who are guessing everything and no that's not happening that is not happening you have to pick one guess and stick with it uh david can you write down the names of everybody who's like either got it or is extremely close and just like write down those names not in the chat not in the chat not in youtube chat but like just text me on my phone that'd be great yo another thing i got i got a freaking green screen you guys want to see the green screen i've never used a green screen before ever ever because i always thought it was so much work to set up the damn thing and it would take forever oh by the way i'm also training for a marathon so that's crazy if any of you are runners you should add me on strava you should add me on strava app i'd love to see your runs and push you and selfishly you'll push me and then i'll keep running and then i'll do my marathon my marathon is happening october 9th i believe october 9th so it's in 15 weeks less than four months so pretty scary pretty scary all right so my boy is collecting names now david and he'll find whoever is the closest and then one person wins and i'll send send you money through their paypal or crypto whatever is easiest for you well like we'll pick one person and you get 50 bucks okay all right guys we're now going to stop taking more answers for the studio after this point okay so amanath anything that's after the timestamp of 9 17 a.m pacific time don't take that anymore but the correct answer let me put up a poll let's put up a poll i'll add a few options okay a lot of few options boom let's go here and we'll say twenty thousand we'll say a hundred thousand we'll say five thousand all right so i'm gonna put this poll and uh you guys can take a guess on this poll as well all right let's see those answers coming in hot let's see what people are guessing some people are guessing 20k nice soon we'll do the reveal of how much this entire studio setup costs all right we'll announce the winner soon or probably later in the stream so stick around okay gives you another reason to stick around but uh there are some there are there are some people who guessed it very very accurate and uh we'll be picking you we'll be picking yeah yeah so that's what's going on um let me let me go here oh oh yeah did you guys say you wanted to see the green screen yeah no i can't remember well i don't care i'm gonna pop up the green screen because i never had it before so let me give me one second here there we go and i know it's not really doing anything right now but it does something once i start moving it closer to me okay so once i move the camera closer to me that's when it does something so take a look at this now i can be just chilling here right and i'm in the freaking screen yo like what that is so cool i don't know about you guys but i definitely find this setup really really cool being able to like kind of merge in and then if we're coding right like if there's some kind of coding going on it looks so much better coding like this so like in my new tutorials you know i definitely want to have um i definitely want to have some action like this right like isn't this a lot better instead of instead of like my screen before my screen was like so stupid it was i would do this do this right and it takes up like look at that that stupid square is blocking so much of the code and boom now there's like very little code that's being blocked or i could even like put myself on the other side and flip flip the camera or whatever right and then that gives that gives like even more space and just chill here right and then boom we're going through the code and it's like all right guys we're importing a bunch of stuff and then we're creating sidebar we have our sidebar option component and then it does stuff and let's check out our modal component big brains so yeah this just looks so much better so much better she's says your studio is lit thank you i appreciate it i appreciate it and as soon as i start dropping a green screen down it's gonna start showing the background behind me hey look at my hand oh and and one of the most awesome parts now i can point somebody said this in my team meeting yesterday i'm going to point to stuff so check it out this is my favorite part so like if i'm like trying to teach you something right for example you know what is this slicing business that's happening right over there let me let me uh let me mirror myself so i can like point accurately right so it's like hey what is that slicing stuff that's actually happening over there the slice of 39 or what are we doing here slicing from zero to six well what we're doing here is we're getting the first six strings of current account right and then we're getting the pretty much the last like from 39 on and i can i can literally move around like this and point to stuff and i don't know in my mind i feel like that'll make understanding what's going on actually a lot easier for you right so then that way i can like literally show you like this is the div that's doing the thing right this is the current user dot name that we need access to so i kind of love that and i can do that in my live streams i could do that you know when i'm recording a video um part says why are you not streaming a game i mean i think i would love to stream chess if you guys would want to watch because like i play chess competitively and i enjoy it a lot um so that's definitely something cool yeah programmer marine says that's a lot better yeah we have a lot of people saying aaron says yo that's a lot better uh mattel says yes it looks amazing thank you guys i appreciate that that looks so much better appreciate it appreciate it thank you aaron says big thank you story web 3 and react starting from your videos i appreciate you thank you so much yeah so this this setup is definitely pretty cool i mean i could even this is kind of cool like i could do my videos like this to show off that i'm a i'm a coder right like everything i do just has like this is probably how people just imagine me they just imagine that i just have like code in the background all the time just like oh must code just 24 7. i mean i kind of do so i kind of do code a lot all right so uh this is what's happening here and then going back to where we were yeah so add me on strava you guys add me on strava if anybody's using this app add me here i don't know what my username is but i think if you type in rafikaze you'll probably find me i'm not not exactly sure all right and yeah i'm a beginner runner pretty beginner very very newbie have terrible times at least for myself like 11 minute is fast for me i'm like dying at a oh you can't see anything oops sorry let me get out of your way so yeah like at 11 minutes i'm like kind of dying uh not very good so if i could use your help with that that'd be great my screen is moving at 20 frame rates per second is that true is my screen moving that slow i hope not i hope not the green screen is reducing the blocking of the code that's pretty good yeah because that used to be one of the very common complaints right every time somebody would be like you're blocking the code just so much anger and hate but we can avoid all that anger and hate by by just simply using a green screen in the back i'm surprised how good a green screen actually is like it's it's kind of mindblowing that it works as well as it does a strava is just a running app right here this right there just a running app and like you could use it to run and uh track stuff and like you could you could add friends on here and send friend requests and stuff like that so i don't know if anybody runs here at all but if you do feel free to add me on here let's go look at some coding news with this new setup hmm that's a good point real programming is an elitist myth i kind of like this because even without re oh my god is this one of those websites that begs you to pay them if you're even looking at it for one second seems like it but stop bothering us now so that's good we'll zoom in here look at this i'm in the freaking screen this is sick just my arm looks a little bit cut off but who cares who cares right this is fine it's not that bad um okay i have to do let's move it up a little bit so it doesn't cut my head off all the time there we go now i have headspace perfect yeah so i let me know what you guys think about this right real real programming is an elitist myth and i don't know about you guys but i kind of agree with this because um a lot of people will tell you hey pro there's real programming this is what a real programmer does a real programmer uses vim or a real programmer a real programmer uses the command line they don't use a gui to push their code they don't use a gui to use git and version control they use the command line oh you used an extension from vs code you are a noob you need to be using the command line more like that type of stuff right is just total [ __ ] because that's not true like you can code however you want and there are plenty of incredible programmers who are still using sublime text so blind text those days are gone you should just use either vs code or if you're going to use an online tool then use an online tool like replit or whatever but like don't use don't use sublime text guys i mean that's been that's it's over if you use sublime text you're not a real programmer you're a fake programmer but yeah like most things you guys are totally fine right like most whatever way that you code is your way of coding and it's okay like it's totally fine you don't have to freak out about it um going to come after you if you're using i mean you know some there's like some developers i know that we're using like notepad and text edit and like weird stuff to code and they're phenomenal developers so it's whatever your flow is you're gonna be fine and everybody codes in different ways for example i was never really good at data structures and algorithms yet i could build a ton of stuff so it does it didn't matter that i never got good at it or wasn't super interested in all the nerdy intricacies it's it's um coding is a there's a lot of creativity involved and i think people often forget that i use the regular default notepad because i'm godly aaron says i mean yo props to you man if you can pull that off that's huge you don't even need anything david says you can use a you can code however you want unless you use a gui that's for fake programmers only there you go you should i love this david says you should code on paper agreed if you want to be a real programmer i i definitely hate all that scrum solid agile uncle bob crap yeah i'm not a huge fan of uncle bob like that stuff was weird like when i was even watching that video just so long and this guy just thinks like he knows everything and it's just oh so frustrating like i can't even imagine being his wife like jesus christ man [ __ ] that is uh uncle bob is a interesting cat but yeah i watched a video a bunch and i'm just like this is this is crazy i'm not sure what's happening here yeah colorized theme yeah you're you're you're not a real developer alejandro says stop blocking the code hey i got this freaking green screen just so i oh i wasn't so i was blocking the code because there wasn't anything happening with the code earlier uh my chest elo is like 2000 to 2200 depending on the day time whether um my head being in the right place and me not being an idiot things like that yep so there is some programming news for you hopefully that was pretty good let's see what other things will catch our eyes the new startup no code no problem interesting so yeah there's this whole no code movement going on i am a big proponent of it i support it um jeez man pegging me for freaking emails no do not email me all right continue reading there we go that was easy you now you don't need to know any programming to launch a company we've been approaching this moment for years so basically what they're saying is there are tools like webflow zapier that allow you to like automate a bunch of stuff which yeah there is there's parts of it that are pretty true because you can you can glue together a lot of clever logic using zapier which makes sense right like so if you have an automation somebody opts into your email and then it sends them this thing and it sends them the next thing and then you can do a lot of that with zapier her company scribbly.io let's take a look at this let's look at this unbeatable content marketing services to grow your business book a strategy call tell us your goals and put your content on autopilot wow definitely looks really cool actually i would be interested in actually hitting them up so this looks super cool scribbly dot io i mean yeah so it looks like it's a basic website uh air table and online spreadsheet letter sort details about each job yep airtable is very very powerful tool if you use air table and use zapier and you use webflow you could do a lot of automation there yes that is that that is true uh she has 23 clients and was doing 25 000 in recurring business so basically at the time that this article was written the owner of this website was doing about 23 to 25 000 a month which is pretty good especially if you're a new business owner it's like really really good and i imagine you know you have a couple of people who are paying you this much and you're writing content for them and then they're just recurring customers so that's pretty good but here's the thing majority of this no code stuff will get you really far really really far but what i realized is even with the no code stuff you will still need to know some programming concepts actually pull it off like even with webflow and even with like cms's if you know some programming stuff it really benefits you and you build things a lot faster and why i like a lot of no code stuff is if you have an idea or you want to mvp you can do really really quick and just test it out and if you like it then you can spend the next few weeks coding it up because often times when you're coding something up the performance of that thing is going to be really really sharp and you're going to have a lot of finetuned control over it if you don't care about that much finetuned control over every single little aspect then yeah i recommend if you're building a sas or you're building something just use tools put it together but if you're at a job and you're at a company working and they have built something with react then you'll need to know react or if they have built something in web3 then you'll need to know wep3 in order to continue building on top of their software and to continue growing their software and to continue making that software more robust over time by the way on the topic of controversial opinions how do you feel about open source software in the fsf especially some of those extreme richard stallman stuff i haven't followed any of the fsf stuff i don't even know what that is or who richard stallman is but i know that linus torvals is a huge proponent of open software i am not against it i think it's really cool i was thinking about what open source software's i know that are really prominent and one of them that comes to my mind that i use pretty much every day is actually leeches leaches.org this thing and this is open source and this has like so much traffic i like this more than chess.com and most of the great players that i know actually play on here and the experience is awesome like playing here the experience is just so good i'll try not to play the entire game here but like the the entire experience of leaches is just in my opinion a lot better okay let's close out of it so it doesn't turn into a chess game and that's open source and uh if i go to if i go back to leaches you can see that it's open source where does it say again usually says on the home page that it's free let me go as incognito yep so lead chess is a free libre no ads open source chess server right and if i go to are github they often allow you to link you to their github twitch source code there we go source code and main backend and front end scala okay let's click that right boom there we go so all of the code is here for elite chess that is that is really phenomenal and you have 303 contributors helping make this a reality that is really really cool that you know that's something that would be really hard to pull off outside of something like this but you just have all these people coming in building it together and then they're really listening to the community and they're just making this phenomenal product and anybody that needs to add anything can just go ahead and code it up and actually help out an end result is such a brilliant and phenomenal product that leeches is and even their app is really really amazing so yeah i mean hats off to them for being able to pull this off and the whole interface just clean no ads nothing so i i like the open source movement i think it's great i also see the point of not open source right because that's also something i was thinking about on my run yesterday which is who's gonna pay for these people to be thinking about the thing 24 7 because they at some point need to do other things in their life right so open source yeah you'll code it up but then you need to actually put food on the table so then you're going to go do your job but with a job if you're working at microsoft or whatever you're making a hundred two hundred thousand dollars you can just fully focus and not worry about anything else and like literally do that for 10 12 hours a day that is a lot more fun and then you can build something really really great because you're obsessed about that thing and you're doing that thing every single day so within six months a year two years three years four years five years you're gonna build a better product that's why i think vs code is one of the best products out there and it's a private you know it's it's by microsoft it's not an open source software and um you know the best operating systems are not like i wouldn't use linux i tried linux it sucks i will never use it it's awful you can barely play a freaking normal video on there you don't have any editing tools you can barely even use the computer your email clients suck everything sucks like everything sucks zoom doesn't work properly it's it's trash um i honestly don't know why people use it they're like oh you could do sudo aptget who cares there's homebrew and there's all this other stuff that makes things easier so why are you sitting here and using linux like i don't know like i i just feel like it's people just being extra nerdy and just like oh i have a linux setup ah that's so cool like good for you but you know i don't know it's just um i i think either pick windows or pick mac and they're like mature operating systems they have actual support you can call support they'll help you and they have you know they're just very mature and then the whole native ecosystem syncs in and my imessages show up on my computer and they're synced with my phone and like my notifications work the right way and when i turn on focus mode it puts me on focus mode on my phone like the whole thing works right you know i personally think mac is the best of both worlds because you have this delicious gooey yummy native world along and then high performance along with like all the command line benefits you know so as a developer i that's one of the reasons i never go to windows because like first of all text rendering resolution i needed to be 5k i'm so used to it now that i need my text to render in 5k and i can tell when the text isn't rendering in 5k like and it doesn't look as good and so i've i avoid um anything like that and so yeah until windows has 5k monitors that's definitely one thing uh the other thing is just getting the whole command line and everything set up is always a pain with windows and there's always more annoying steps to do than if you're doing it just in plain mac or linux there's always like extra stuff that you have to do or there'll always be a tutorial they'll be like here's how to do this thing in five easy steps um but if you have a windows here's this other like sadistic complicated guide [ __ ] off like click this and just like figure it out yourself i'm not even gonna write the guide for you just like click this and and go somewhere else and figure it out so i feel like yeah window stuff is uh i don't know just makes me kind of like vomit a little in my mouth but you know you can still code on there like you'll be fine uh yeah muhammad says um i use windows but i have to admit that the windows command line sucks and it's worse than bash yeah that's that's all i'm saying like for coding and stuff it's always a problem to install stuff it's kind of a problem and i wish that they had a better command line system uh going on there um uh yeah zacky says hey i disagree with you derek qazi linux has its own place i use arch myself and i'll admit that windows and mac os is more friendly for the average user but calling linux trash flat out is so here's what i'll say if you're not if your main purpose is like just developing i think it's good you know i don't even know that vs code dude i don't know what they have like i'm not sure i don't even want to find out and like things are not even built for them properly but yeah like i think for coding it's probably good but then you have to have a zoom meeting and then like you have to share your screen and like zoom doesn't work properly and then sharing your screen like still shows all the people and it's kind of like annoying and it's like as a developer unfortunately you'll have more meetings then you'll get the right code and so i feel like all of those things work properly i wouldn't [ __ ] on linux this hard if they just build proper support for everything like for at least for like normal things like slack zoom like normal simple things that the whole world uses unless they build that i am just like it's trash and i want to run away and i also respect your opinion that you don't think it's trash you use it that's totally fine um i'll i can i could have gone full screen a while ago my bad that that rant who cares about pseudo that rant went on longer than i had expected my apologies where did my youtube studio go ah there it is that rant went on forever huh let's see did everybody go crazy in the comments was there a war yes some someone asked do you know the bota sisters yes i do know them not personally although i did run into the bodhis sisters um at the las vegas nationals uh no not nationals las vegas chess tournament and i saw botest there and she was playing she was playing pretty well and then i and she she i think she was a younger sister or older sister i don't know whichever one is like slightly weaker in chess like so around 19 2000 but she had a phenomenal tournament and uh yeah so they're super cool and then i ran into eric rosen there too if you guys know him he's a big youtuber in chess and i'm just catching up with him because we're we've been good friends from a long time see it varies from this redistro but here on arch i use discord and zoom and it works totally fine installation is easy as blah blah not dealing with other installers like other os okay that's pretty cool zach i did not know that those things are working perfectly that is super cool i'm also a linux user but i use macbook air too they are both awesome see if i can pop them up they are both awesome os's linux has some free alternatives a paid mac os offer which are many times better than the paid one oh yeah so here's what i will say i think that if you can have both then that's really solid that is like the best system because then you can have like a legendary coding environment with linux and then you have your mac or you have your windows and then your gucci so if you're gonna have multiple i mean then yeah then there's no problem because like i was thinking about getting a windows but mostly for gaming stuff so yeah my dad taught me lunia says my dad taught me chess i love it random question how do i secure a mirn stack do you have a video secure as an add security to your murder stack i don't think we have videos on doing too much security honestly so we don't have something on it right now i don't think 456 votes and 32 percent of you said this studio that we have here costs 20 grand the right answer i'm going to say the right answer right now you guys ready the right answer the correct answer is let's see if i can pop it up here the correct answer is how can i turn this text white whites please give me white data this studio costs roughly around 30 000 probably a little bit more especially with with getting more stuff so it's going to be a little bit more but yeah around there so you know not the most expensive studio by any means because it's like still relatively simple but like if you take the mac the mac is like eight grand and then you take the monitor that i just got on the side that i'm gonna put vertical is around three grand so a dell ultra fine 32 inch something if you combine all the license a couple of grand speakers grant camera a couple of grand road caster pro stream deck a bunch of other accessory stuff green screen gonna get bookshelves on the back plants white board photo tube lights and then some stuff that you guys can't even see yet honestly so maybe this wasn't totally fair but yeah if you add all that up you get something like this maybe i should make this a thumbnail huh this would actually be a lot better as a thumbnail what do you guys think should this be the thumbnail all right if we're gonna make this a thumbnail then uh let's see if we can add can we add drop shadow i mean it all i guess it already has drop shadow so that's good all right let's switch to here we go thumbnail time let's move this a little bit over actually right there i think it'd be better if i hit the green screen the thumbnail would look better without the green screen let me hide the green screen that's silly all right there we go green screen hidden now let's go here perfect there we go now you guys see how in the back end we get our thumbnails set up it's as easy as that that's it it's done we got the thumbnail yo what is up francisco michelle says wow that is a lot essential what is going on man nice to have you in here what is up frankie nice to see you brother strava clone that'd be fun to make will you build something you're awesome thank you michelle appreciate it um let me do another poll actually let's end this poll so 27 of you were roughly right good job let's do another poll content you want to see next okay so what content do you actually want to see next my money don't jiggle jiggle it all right you guys type it in chat and finish the song for me okay my money don't jiggle jiggle it i'd love to see you for sure it makes me wanna you know write it in my all right here we go uh so content you want to see next so let's go view js that's something completely wild let's go solidity let's go python as an option and let's go more react slash next gs and let's hit it and let's see what you guys want to see more of next and we could do tutorials we could do projects so we'll i'll kind of ask about that too after hey lance is here he goes wiggle wiggle what is up lancy coos where is lance lancy pants there we go aaron goes for sure you know nice everybody knows what's up i apologize for the latency it's kind of crazy it falls there yo you guys are legit this gang is legit all right going through your guys's comments yeah i'm not sure how the quality is coming on acro on the stream looks good on my end but i think it should be i think it should be good um all right so the poll is getting some answers let's take a look at the poll oh heavy heavy you guys are asking for the react and next js stuff but let's see if the tides are going to turn soon aaron says i sing that song every day that's funny yeah that song is very addictive and like you can you can also hear the autotune in the back right whenever you sing that song you hear that autotune in the back awesome react native content appr yeah that definitely makes sense you guys want to see some good react native content yeah there's definitely a big delay oh crap i don't know it was a two minute delay uh i didn't want to do low latency because i wasn't sure what the late low latency does i wasn't sure if it like lowers the quality of my video and so like i don't want to take the chance awesome all right guys thank you so much for being on here i think we're gonna be wrapping it up jiggle no i'm kidding we're not gonna actually wrap i'm gonna wrap it up with a like wrapped eath okay i'm gonna wrap this up and then we'll catch up in the next one but so far i can see the poll you guys are looking for more react content and then i also see some python requests coming in hot so we might have python coming up soon too um i will not be teaching you guys how to code i mainframes in cobalt zacky just made me do a little uh little gag reflex action some acid reflux just going like this all right i thank you guys for being on here i appreciate the uh interactiveness mages front forum focus everybody akib
