what's up there we go now we're live what's going on guys welcome to another build today what we're going to be doing is going through a previous build that we've done so the instagram clone and we're going to be showing you guys how to go ahead and transform the instagram clone to a complete man stack build right and it's going to be real time everything is also going to be working in the way that you would expect it to be working i'm just going to go ahead and show you guys a run through of the app but before we get started i'm here today with your boy david how's it going guys um i'm papa marin as probably you already know and i'm gonna be helping you guys make the react with firebase build uh become a full mern stack build right exactly exactly guys now we are super excited for today's build we actually went ahead and whoa the numbers just spiked up we got 255 people already on nice let's go ahead and see who's here we got priyanshu what's up dude he is now inside the course he's actually a 13 year old awesome coda uh what's up guys we see stephen we've got a few faces in here we've got a kz says jay sean and justin bieber that's funny dude right now guys let's go ahead and run you through what we're going to be doing today okay so for those of you who don't know what mirn is man stands for mongodb express react and no js right that's right yeah yes that's for those right so what we've done previously guys is we went ahead and showed you how to build a dope instagram clone now this instagram clone if i just make it a bit more visible this instagram clone was a fully functional um app so we pretty much showed you how to do this this was built using react and we used firebase to host the back end right so this is exactly what we built last time and you can find this on the youtube channel and we pretty much go ahead and show you guys how to build everything so let's go ahead and test it out quickly so what you would do is you would add a caption so here let's just go and say yo what is going on guys and then let me go ahead and check oh nice little super chat from somath thank you so much dude oh sam thank you i appreciate that dude let's go ahead and choose a file let's go ahead and upload something um boom boom boom i'm gonna go ahead and pick the i've got a picture of the cat i mean i don't don't even ask i don't even know how i've got that picture what is this what's this one okay let's just just play it safe and go with the cat okay so then you go ahead and click on the upload button and then you can see it goes ahead uploads it and we get a nice animation and boom we have a cap all right so everything works on the right hand side we have this lovely little widget and this is actually pulling from my instagram account so we just hit 13k followers thank you so much guys that is amazing the support you guys continue to bring and also if you join profit javascript welcome to the course the course is currently on its final week of doors open if you're interested the links in the description but guys let's jump into today's build right so today's build we are focusing heavily on the adaptation of a reactant firebase app to a man stack build right so we're going to pretty much show you guys how to transform the app that we have right here over into a month stack build and we're going to use what what tech are we going to be using today david so we're going to be using node.js uh for the backend with express.js for the server we will be using mongodb to store or out they or all our data and posts and stuff like that okay and how do we make a road time and we will be making it real time using pusher uh it's something we already showed you guys on this channel but we will be using it again and more dope okay nice so whoever has done the previous build guys the instagram build if you've done it awesome stuff right so like you can go ahead and use your code so you can actually have an adapted sort of instagram build if you haven't done it i've actually gone ahead and included that link in the description of the uh of the youtube link so what you can do is you can go over to that link so i'm going to go ahead and pull it over you can see we've got this man instagram build and pretty much what we've done is we've put the code in here for you so what you need to do is you can get hit code do this go into your terminal right you can open up a terminal go ahead and type in git clone paste it right that's going to allow you to paste this into your uh like into a photo directory and then you can pretty much go ahead and use the uh use the code base so you would get this as a starting point right you should be able to get all of this as a starting point all you need to do is do npm install to go ahead and install everything and then do npm start and then the whole thing will start running okay so you'll get this as your starting point right so this is currently don't get confused guys this is currently a fully functional react app right it's a fully functional react app it's using firebase to power everything now we're going to show you today how to go ahead and power the entire thing like we said with the man stack right so it's going to be a man build that we're focusing on today everything is going to be pretty much all around the man stack so we're going to show you guys how to incorporate a node.js back in i'm going to show you guys how to go ahead and use mongodb and then we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and use pusher to make it real time so that way we still get this very nice functionality so when you go ahead and upload an image it goes ahead and and pushes it into mongodb and then you can see that in real time over here okay now if you're excited for that smash the thumbs up button let us know in the chat right now because this is going to be a fun build today it's going to be a bit of debugging it's going to be a bit of different things but we want to get that momentum back on youtube guys for you guys we know that you guys love this content we're not going anywhere and we're going to go ahead and carry on bringing the fire for you guys so david anything before we get started that you want to say you said pretty much everything um i'm super excited dude oh nice and we got another donation before we started whoa thank you so much um it says smiling face with oh oh yeah it's like a smiling face with the red eyes we can't see it sometimes on the super chat so we've got loads of people saying mr talks again let's go awesome stuff right now uh elias just popped in the question he goes hi what should i do react.js localhost is not loading um try refresh is the best bet sometimes it just takes a little bit of a refresh to go ahead and kick start things but um this one says abbay thank you so much for that donation yeah so guys if it's not working please do not spam that chat otherwise i will time you out so sorry about that um yeah if it's not working guys i mean like literally all you need to do is npm install and then do an npm start and everything will start working for you okay now if it doesn't work for you literally what i said before don't worry if the data is not loading because what we're actually going to be doing is transferring it all over to a man stack back end okay which means that that's where everything's going to be pulled from so don't stress okay as long you've got the code you can pretty much go ahead and start from that point so the code is in the description go ahead get clone it right now and you can pretty much go ahead and get that started priyancho says how about some react native builds yes we've got some regulatory bills coming so that'll be some fun stuff right like um that'll be some super fun stuff uh david can jump on those builds with me david you have to code it in react native uh i actually used it once okay but i would be super interested in that yeah yeah let's do it yeah be awesome right definitely so it'll be some fun stuff we can go ahead and do that and guys before we get started quick shout out right so before we get into this lovely big build today i want to just shout out to this is the final week that we have profit with javascript open and then we close the doors right so link is in the description you can check that out also the code link is in the description so don't go ahead and rebuild this just literally copy that code and then you can pretty much go along with us right so guys before we get started smash that thumbs up button and let's get this video out to many people as we can and let's get this thing pumped up nice the cp fam dropped in hard whoa the team never stops delivering real value if you thought we brought the value the last few months wait until you see what we have in store for the next few months of epic builds right here on youtube exactly guys we are going to keep bringing the fire if you thought it was hot before when we done those builds when we done all those crazy clones that we had the netflix the tinder we had tick tock everything which actually hit over 400 000 views which is mindblowing like on some of these videos right so 300 000 views on some of them um it's insane guys we're gonna keep on bringing that heat so all i'm gonna say is get used to drinking that coffee get that energy up right make sure you've got your water nearby and let's go ahead and jump into today's build let's do it guys you ready david go yep let's do it let's do it okay so starting point not the cap hit the code right once you get that code uh imported in you're going to reach at this point right so you're going to have some stuff over here right you're going to have your files over here now what i want you to do is pretty much go ahead open up a terminal right so i'm going to go ahead and make this a bit bigger because i guess this is tiny for you guys right now um where is my code um david do you mind sending me over i will send you a live share link right now and you can pretty much but i haven't got your so i think you're going to need to live share the code that you had previously as well uh humidity oh yeah just a moment yeah um okay one sec guys we got a nice lovely donation from sumid thank you sami oh yeah i've got your code here dude nice okay okay so so let me go ahead and pull up some meat thank you dude appreciate that he says i started my new job today hey let's go man nice hi samit was actually in he's been watching quite a lot of these um these builds he was actually part of the challenge and the guy's crazy man like he was followed along and he pretty much landed a job and uh yeah awesome stuff man and i hope your first day went well that is that's sick that's what this community is about guys that's dope so someone that says you're the best thing you learned a lot from you guys remember it's not just me guys it's literally team cp we all pulled together to make this stuff possible so appreciate you dude scythe thank you so much you guys wish i could afford pwj what i would say there is a payment plan yeah there's payment plans there's like there's a lot of things offered right now make sure whatever it needs whatever you need to do to be able to get in or literally if you can't afford it just make the most of the free youtube content that we drop right that's what i would say honestly you can you can grow so far with just that so make sure you you can pretty much learn from that make some money with that and then you'll be able to get in the course that's my way that's my opinion on it right that's correct right let's do this so we currently this is the code that you're going to have right now once it loads up what i want you guys to do is i'm just going to create can you send me a live share first yep so yeah guys so what's happening at the moment is that sunny is sending me a live share uh that's that's an extension i was talking about uh in one of the videos last week it's basically allowing us to work together yeah exactly so it means we me and david can work together in real time just how you see me and cause you do it um pretty much like it's like a google doc but we're coding right so it's real time code editing together now you should be able to see this make sure you're in the correct directory so like if for example you were here you're gonna make sure you do cd and then go into your correct directory so in this case i've called it this and then when you you can do ls to make sure that you see all the files you should be able to see all of this stuff right when you do ls now i want you to do npm install now that will go ahead and install all the dependencies once you've copied the code so again anyone who's joined just like recently make sure you go ahead and clone the code so that you can go along with us and code along with us in today's session okay it's going to be really important for you guys to save a bunch of time and be able to be able to actually keep up with us so uh nikhil says hey so is this a continuation of the previous build yes exactly so we showed you guys how to build instagram previously now we're going to go ahead and show you guys how to power it with the man stack okay um yeah right nice okay so i somebody says it's it's a bit unclear to be able to see what's on the screen right now to be honest i think this is pretty big enough at this point i think this i think i mean let me know guys but i think you guys can pretty much see all the code right now um and also i have i wanna address i wanna address this one somebody said man is better of course i kindly disagree right i kind of disagree on what we bring the man stack builds because it's very valuable a lot of people ask for it guys i'm telling you right now if i had to choose firebase i would choose firebase every time right honestly i would choose firebase either as well yeah exactly right like is in dude like it's just nobrainer for me like the setup everything is so much cleaner like why would you i mean there's no point in just you know making it extra complicated niraj says can i get a job in mnc in india as a fresh using man uh not underst i can't understand your question properly dude but what i will say is yes you can get a job with the man stack so very simply yes okay let's go ahead and jump in dude okay so somebody says zoom in a little bit please i think uh i think that might do okay so yeah once you've got this up and running what you're gonna do is mpmi and then you're gonna do npm start and then npm start will go ahead spin the app up right that means on your local host so right now i'm running it already so i'm going to go ahead and run it on localhost 3001 and you can see here you should be able to get the app up and running so it will say starting a development server once it gets up and running then it's all good so there you go you should reach this point okay now once you see this stuff you're a very good point somebody says can firebase handle big projects okay dude if you consider it this way do you think apps like uber are big projects like uh huge apps use use firebase okay so that will answer your question um now exactly dude exactly uh we also got another one hey sonny say you rock feeling pumped that's the energy dude obey tewari we want more of this energy um leroy says i can feel sunny's focus and energy through the screen hey let's go dude we had a bit of a rest now we're back right uh because he says it's only just a little bit more zoom okay it's looking great however i think on the phone it will be smaller with slower intense speed it will look too okay dope right so let's go we'll make it a little bit bigger for you guys i think this is pretty good right now so this is this is a lot better and you guys should be able to see this and it's quite quite big at the moment so what we can do now guys is once you've got this running i like to open up a second terminal for any other work that you need to do right so if we look at our folder structure i want you guys to pay attention to one thing right now we have man instagram and i've just called it my instagram david right and this is our front end build now the backend build i'm just gonna go ahead and create that photo right now okay so i'm gonna go ahead and create and say man back end back in oh man instagram back end right so this is the back end that we're going to build right so it's going to be a backing so right now of course it's empty so david let's go ahead and actually set this up right so okay in order to get this set up how do i what do we actually need to type in um so first up we need to initialize our node package uh we can do that by npm in it i need to be in that photo right uh that is correct that is correct yes okay so i'm gonna go into the backend folder and now you can you guys can see over here it says my instagram back in right so i'll make that super big right now so you can you guys can see now i am in oops let's go ahead and unfreeze there we go i am in this folder right here okay so we're inside this photo right there now what's what's going on david now we need to uh type in npm init okay we'll go ahead and create our uh note package okay it's gonna throw a couple of questions uh we can just basically most of them we can just uh hit return and go go on okay so enter oh sorry the the name cannot contain leading or trailing okay so in this case i could just say instagram oh man back end oh name can only okay so it's just gonna go ahead and do instagram i think you need to add um dash in between insta kaziko's never have spaces in your fire names huh yeah i wasn't i do i knew it i knew when i wrote it i was like [ __ ] i'm going to get some slack for that yeah there you go instagram dash i never do that i it was a wonder it's a one time thing guys don't kill me this is a good example for the wrong example exactly i did that on purpose guys you see that's what you gotta be like definitely you know all right let's carry on so now okay we can go ahead and hit enter on this right here okay so we can just enter uh until until the entry point uh pops up you need to change that to server.js it's not like um not like a necessary thing but it's more like a naming convention stuff yeah it's nicer the way it and the way it is right now and let's go and i think you can go ahead and hit returns uh all the way down yeah so guys david was saying here is it by default it's index.js for the for the sort of server that we're running uh it's more declarative it's more simple if you just write server.js okay i mean it's down to preference but whatever you do here just make sure that you this is going to be consistent throughout so in this case we're going to say server js is our entry point uh test command enter enter enter enter and uh is this okay yeah perfectly and perfectly just yeah that's it um and i think you want to go ahead and initialize git version control as well okay oh yeah and that actually popped in our package.json file that's correct nice so now we got this beautiful photo right yeah okay dope so now how do i initialize get uh you just need to type and get in it yeah done now you should see if you guys are using zs oh my zsh comes up really nice so if you guys aren't actually using that quick pro tip right go ahead and download this right now okay so oh my zsh and this thing is like it's so sick man like it tells you pretty much it makes it very very simple for you to know if you're in the correct directory like a lot of the time especially when being like kazu or me and david are coding and stuff we find ourselves constantly kind of in the wrong directory right now here yeah i know immediately i'm in the wrong one because it's not a git repo right as soon as i go back into it so cd my instagram back end then you can see now it says get master so we're on the git master branch it's very very clear it's going to help you out when you're coding okay yeah i will close the terminal once we start coding guys i'll keep that very dynamic don't worry okay now david um what's next let's create the server so next actually no no no uh let's actually import all the dependencies that we will be using okay uh we will need the terminal for that as well so if you can just type in npm install express mongoose and course and we will be also using pusher okay is that everything i think so so and then what you can do and guys if you didn't know it's a little trick you can actually go ahead and do just a space between them and it will actually go ahead and import them right yeah exactly exactly right this is a good question by the way david just want to pop it up so sydney says uh question i want to focus on learning either react i think that means react firebase or man what would the most viable stack right now be in industry okay my my advice on this is going to be pretty much for industry potentially man i'd say for landing a job potentially man is going to be more sort of useful i guess right but that's correct or personal projects 100 react firebase every time i would choose react firebase but the reality is is that inside of uh commercial bills and stuff like that the demand for men is a lot higher than the demand for firebase at the moment right now firebase is so damn powerful i trust it i believe in that i'm a big supporter of it google support this video sponsor us yeah i see google sponsored you in the chat yeah so um go ahead and yeah i mean that's my take on it david what should i what's your answer on that what's your take on that david to hold on first so my take on that is that first up i would definitely go with react and firebase that will give you the most um result in the least amount of time right and once you're comfortable with that i would go for mern uh definitely but if you would like to stay on the front end side of things uh you will be fine with the and firebase yeah exactly yeah exactly 100 and to be honest dude like do both you know like like do both like i would say start with direct firebase it's fun or it's easy to get started with it and then pretty much like if you need to do it as you enjoy it right don't do it just based on demand like do what you enjoy and the rest will come right that's my advice now uh this is pretty cool uh untrickish verma says wow saying love your videos i recently got a job because your clones my css skills are boosted and literally i built five clones damn dude instagram facebook spotify and whatsapp let's just let's just take a moment for that dude like that is like he deserves a round of applause for that stuff man that's dope so and then he goes yep actually uh drop drop me or sunny oh wrong direction drop me or sunny uh dm on instagram uh with the proof of your uh job and we will add you on the counter yeah is that right yeah so if you did get a job or anyone gets a job let us know send the dm to either instagram account over here or just give us a follow as well if you haven't and then pretty much we can go ahead and add you to that counter of 5000 developers by 2020 so that is dope thank you so much and i'm so glad that you find value in this stuff uh sydney replied he says so it's basically comes down to want a project or running quick go with react native firebase and man for bigger purchases landing job yeah honestly dude just do it based on like react firebase it's gonna be a lot more fun it's gonna help you actually get used to that sort of stack um and then man is a good way to sort of move from there so i would do it that in that way manavarora thank you for the donation and let's get on with it so future code sunny right on the [ __ ] nice elizabeth in the shower in the house awesome i need to book a coaching session she's she's going crazy she's actually an insane developer and she's crushing it right now um yeah so leroy says kazi said a discord build coming soon 100 yes we have a disco clown coming soon uh we also have an imessage clone coming soon guys let me know in the chat right now smash the thumbs up button if an imessage clone sounds pretty juicy like i think imessageclone will be sick like i i really think it'll be pretty sick man like that'll be fun to do yeah and we're going to be using react and firebase for that one so stay tuned it's going to be like are we aren't we going to you do it in murren as well yeah yeah we will see you know don't tell apple we are not building it in swift i know exactly all right guys so here we have package.json so now let's go ahead and we've got our stuff right here we've installed the dependencies you see that's correct three packages and and it's done right now let's go ahead and create that server dot js right so yeah but don't just go into that just yet uh we have still some stuff to do in package.json okay so if we go up here under a main and we just go ahead and type uh type in type and module okay uh that's pretty much gonna enable us that we will be able to build a better thing in es6 right and another thing we will need to add is the start script which will be used by heroku to start up our uh app uh when when we actually deploy it right okay we'll start and we would type in node uh dash dash experience oh yeah oh oh sorry sorry let's do nodes have it done yes yeah it's just my computer that needs it for some reason okay yeah and i think that's pretty much it for package.json i'm going to add this start script in add them type module in and then we're good this will add the es6 features this is going to be needed when we deploy this to heroku okay whoa by the way birthday coming soon happy birthday uh thank you i think he's he's talking about me because my birthday is coming at the end of the month the 27th thank you dude oh nice appreciate that appreciate that nice um so oh nice somebody said one guy recently found robo 3t as a database workbench oh sure have a look at that dude thank you um okay now let's carry on so server.js what are we doing correct so we first import all our stuff uh we will need to import um mongoose course uh and express and all these dependencies and then we will we will need to import uh pusher as well which we will be using a bit later but just in case it's nice that we have it already okay uh next up actually let's create our structure of uh let's create a structure of our uh app um so we will have an app config right yeah we will have some middlewares yep and we will have db config as well so this is a good tactic guys just mark out what you're doing just like we're doing the react builds just want to go ahead and mark it out with a comment that will help you out exactly and it's just easier for you to see what's up uh we will also have api routes yep and last but not least we will have the listener okay listening part so with that done i think we can go ahead and uh create our first api endpoint are you pumped let's do it david are you pumped i am david said that's so calm he's like are you pumped [Laughter] we were pumped dude let's go guys smash the thumbs up button get this video up to as many people as we can okay and let's get started and if you haven't already code is in the description okay so make sure you go and check it out right so app config what we're doing here app config let's first create our instance of app so const app and equals express just like that and that pretty much uh prepared our application uh so it's now it's already an instance but we will need to add the port uh for later on and that's where our application is going to be actually listening for all our requests and stuff like that okay so we will need to say process dot environment and oh no there is a port first just like this and we need to add two of these standing lines okay and basically a port so i i'll just add 8080. um that's pretty much it development server side i think okay uh with that done before we forget it uh like we always do or i always do we need to add the middlewares which will enable us to process json files and we we will have all the course headers right yep it's going to be working nicely uh and for our very first api endpoint we will just use like a health check thing it's pretty much not going to be uh doing too much thing it will just send a hello world once we call the application right so whenever the application receives a request on the route it will set the result status to 200 which means okay and it's going to send back hello world now with that done uh there's one more thing left to do before we can start our very first api and that is adding the listener okay and we can do it in just here uh does it actually highlight on yours yeah it does um so we would just say that listen on the port that we uh up here defined and once you're done once you did that just console log uh uh where you're listening right with a couple of screen uh string concatenation that will be pretty much it uh for the first api and we can just test it out i think okay let's do it dude so this is pretty much what you guys need as a bare bones server right so this is basically saying we don't need to be a we've got middlewares this is basically just going to pass everything as json which goes in and out of the server think of it that way cause is uh something which handles something called headers so it's like a security middleware this is going to determine which port we actually run our app on so in this case it's going to be if we set a port locally or it's going to be aea by default and then here it's basically a test group so you can get different types of uh rest api requests you over here we're making a get request to the base url we're saying okay if if everything's good then say 200 which means okay and send back a hello world and then we're basically starting up our server and this is how we go ahead and do it okay so that's dope and now let me go ahead and make sure my chat is on doing this up there we go nice so okay what are we doing now with that done uh we will need to use our terminal once again okay and you can just type in nodemon server.js and whoa nodemon server.js that's correct nice and that starts up our server yeah and you should get to this point now this is very good right now what i would say at this point is grab this just copy paste it to your browser and if it says hello world you're good to go here we go nice there we go happy happy days let's carry on so if you get to this guys then that's dope right and what i would say is also test it out if you don't believe us you think oh my god they're lying for whatever reason i know how some of you guys are go ahead and do hello world one two three and then refresh boom right so it's a server it's running on localhost aea okay so everything works um nice so now what we're gonna do is what dave now now we what we're gonna do is uh i think we can start uh setting up our database what you say let's do it dude okay so let's head over to mongodb.com okay so we're going to mongodb.com that's correct and it's actually a free no sql database so anybody can go ahead and start using it for completely free uh i think sony you have already an account so you can just go ahead and log in yeah i do i think i have it on this one so once you get to this screen you're going to have a little bit of a different setup page right it's going to say like you want to create your first project or whatever it is now what we have to do at this point is i'm just going to go here we're working on tindercon last i'm going to click on new project right so when you create an account it actually will pop up and say you want to create a new project so you can click that one or if you get to this page then make sure you go ahead and just click on new project here uh also just one highlight and the kill says did so many clones with your help sonny fingers crossed soon i'll get that freelancing contract 100 dude the amount of people that have got freelancing contracts off these clones is ridiculous like frank ramos just man 170k 170 000 contract with sonos like mind blowing stuff let's carry on dude yeah yeah so on this screen you pretty much just have to name your project that's a nobrainer you can just zoom on instagram i think uh let's add the dash in between just so it's not gonna get confused okay uh smash the thumbs up button guys destroy it yeah and you can just go ahead and create a project without adding any more members nice um yeah okay okay so with that done it's gonna be taking a couple of minutes to uh oh no no we we have to first build our cluster i forgot about that so you have to build your cluster when your project is ready and the cluster is actually the server that will run your database right let's go and just go with the free version that will be completely enough [Laughter] ali hassan we like you dude thank you for watching exactly nice let's carry on so we're going to click on that free tier unless you want to pay i mean it's up to you guys i don't want to pay him click on free uh aws you can leave all this stuff by default we don't really need to change any of this that's correct and you can just go ahead and create a cluster um and that's pretty much it for now nice oh dude edwin says thanks for the great work guys i will try deploying this to microsoft to zero both the back end and front end after the build dude if you do that right and it works please like send over a video because we're always trying to bring on developers who can bring value to any other developer right which means if you can do that that's pretty cool right a lot of people want to know about azure right if you can go ahead and actually send a video into us so like hit me and david up on our instagrams and you can pretty much go ahead and send it through that and literally we are never against bringing on developers to go ahead and teach something valuable to the community to everyone else so if you're not to the point of zoo good stuff we can maybe bring that on the channel that's cool okay um yeah it's going to take a little while while it finishes up so we can go to pusher.com okay and guys this is another reason why i like firebase this this [ __ ] takes ages seriously like firebase will be done by now david yeah yeah so let's go to pusher.com i think you have an account there as well already yep um you can just go ahead sign in um yeah but so what we will be using pusher for is pretty much just making mongodb real time because mongodb itself it's not it's not real time at all yeah so we will just be using another tool and on the left hand side you want to go to channel channels and manage okay uh yep and on the top right there should be an ad oh create app yeah yeah sydney samia says i think i have my answer now yeah you see this crazy sound no yeah mirn is so much cooler huh yeah also guys i just want to say um somebody said how can i learn github that's actually a really good comment um more than happy to actually drop an entire youtube video on github i think that'll be really useful smash the thumbs up button if you want to see that let us know and drop it in the comments as well um also thank you viraj for that lovely donation cheers dude all right david let's carry on yeah sorry okay uh so you can go ahead and hit create app boom and just name it somehow or instagram oh damn or something let's do hunky instagram let's do it god damn it [Laughter] okay all right yeah uh you want to select a cluster whichever you prefer okay um we can go with any and yeah island is good uh and you can just select the front end which will be react right yep and the back end is going to be nodejs and that's actually important because pusher gives you the initial code right yep let's go and create the app because that was pretty much setting up pusher don't okay so guys just to clear this up by the way uh pusher is essentially what it's gonna allow us to once we've got everything built up and sort of like working pusher is gonna be that middle man who allows all that realtime communication to happen between our front end and our back end so it's kind of like a guy that sits in the middle and just passes things across like the front end of the back end so it's real time right think of it in the simplest way it's just something which sits in the middle between our front end and back end and it allows everything to stay realtime and allow everything to be just as you saw it when we demoed it in the beginning it's gonna allow that same functionality okay that's correct it's just gonna watch what happens and if something happens it's gonna trigger everything once again yep and it's gonna like make the whole thing real time right yep oh okay what's next david okay so next up um i think we can go back to mango db i think the cluster is already built up oh [ __ ] okay they finally finished oh [ __ ] nice dude ruin that just says damn it was going to go to sleep but got the notification now i'm going to spend the whole night watching your crazy content see you save it and stay on the zoom call oh nice he's in the course welcome dude and i will see you in tomorrow's coaching call i'm actually going to go ahead and broadcast that on youtube so you guys can go ahead and see or get a taster session as to what is inside a proper javascript so awesome stuff i will see you there dude that's amazing okay definitely okay oh this is good dude yeah sydney summit so so pusher is like the on snapshot part of firebase that's really nice um actually it's not oh so snapshot is is actually more like the change stream of uh mongodb yeah and we need to trigger pusher when the change stream change stream goes off into english in english yes dude it's like on snapshot okay like it is a little bit more fine green but yes it's like the only snapshot right i mean there's there's more complex to to it but in in a very nice simple nutshell yes in nature yeah okay okay so now we just need to create a database user and uh set the network access on the left hand side so let's go with the database access uh just add the new database user yo that's right um you can just go ahead and like name it however you want to okay like let's go with admin maybe i don't know i think admin is bad elon musk okay uh and you wanna you wanna generate and uh uh seek your password [Laughter] all right so to generate secure guys you wanna make sure you copy this right copy this and throw it and you're in you're safe okay yeah yeah you will not be able to see it again um and with that done you can just go ahead and create uh the user so you're gonna smash this add user button just like you smash the thumbs up carry on david okay uh and then now let's go to network access boom dude five dollar donation by salmon whoa five dollar canadian thank you dude what does he say so he says i'm a huge fan of this channel but kazi's insta post earlier was completely wrong burger app selling your course course but yeah okay guys i'm gonna i'm gonna clear this one right up right guys chill out okay like chill out nobody's degrading anyone nobody's doing anything but and you just can't be so soft okay like everything's fine everything's good like nobody's degrading anyone or anything we respect all the developers if anyone is pushing content to help someone else then we respect them okay anyone who drops negative comments like that you know like dude i appreciate the donation but i don't appreciate the negativity so let's keep it let's keep it optimistic on this channel let's go okay um so let's head to network access um and just add an ip address and we will be allowing anybody um to write and read our database you can just go ahead and allow access from anywhere that's correct and just confirm um oh yeah yeah it's like a huge huge disclaimer yeah do not want to do this when you're working with clients yeah right this is not a production friendly um way of doing things yeah the way you would do it you won't want to add like a you know something which is um like a safe ip address like your ip address or something like that okay make sure you go ahead and do something like that rather than making it accessible from anywhere now uh something i want to say is start a code somebody said in the description oh not on facebook uh actually okay so if you're on facebook and watching then please hop over to youtube the starter code is in the description sorry about that yeah i completely didn't realize that and i said sunny is on top of his humor tonight yeah let's go dude um all right let's go ahead and click confirm and now this allows everyone access to everything so pretty much at that point you can say goodbye to security and jake so good i mean that's pretty much true yeah i mean it's true like i mean for demos and stuff it's fine guys and especially when you're building your stuff don't get like too caught up with this stuff you know like make sure you just just build it yeah and just go for results over perfection dude i once had somebody here who was like oh i created an app right and it does like some some cool stuff and i was like oh well done that's awesome it's like yeah yeah yeah i spent ages on the security and i was like dude nobody's gonna hack your app like unless you've led these mark zuckerberg or you're making crazy money no one's gonna touch your app don't worry it's fine so like don't worry guys yeah yeah folks for personal projects it's completely unnecessary exactly yeah sunny is always good in it right thank you dude okay now let's go back to clusters and actually do connect to our database okay okay uh you can just hit uh connect on the left hand side of the cluster okay and that's gonna pop up something and with the uh connect your application button um you will be receiving a huge huge string right okay you want to copy that um so this huge thing right that's correct and notice that there are two uh properties highlighted with green one of them is going to be the password which you hopefully already saved to somewhere safe and the other one is going to be the database name which we will be hard coding into this link yeah yeah um so that's pretty much it so let's go a copy and let's go back to our db config so right here i like this comment i like this coin it says nuts dude proudly proudly nuts dude like those are the ones that run [ __ ] now dude like elon musk is running the entire bloody planet on his own jeff bezos pretty much runs all of us so those two rule the world exactly right all right so let's go to db config and oh yeah uh you will be adding the uh connection url right you just want to paste what we had in there guys and then you have those two things that david spoke about he had a password and the db name so the first one i actually copied it earlier so i'm going to go ahead and pop it in it's this one right here that's the password that we saw and i'm just gonna rename the database which will be in insta db so this one this one guys is actually the name that is going to create the db4 okay so this is very important to make sure that you don't just type in some gibberish there like make it something which actually makes a lot of sense okay exactly exactly that's right and now let's go and connect to our database using mongoose and we can just go ahead and type in mongoose.connect i think it's uh showing up yeah there is it let's just add the connection url yeah and we need to pass in a couple of properties which i actually had them on clipboard but these are it's because mongoose is still under development and this is how in the current version we need to pass in a couple of stuff awesome um so yeah that's pretty much uh nice that was setting up the database right you got a lovely comment here from libro he says david you are killing it too mongodb can be such a pain and thanks to simplifying it so much oh thank you so much dude i'm actually planning on dropping some uh like written content uh if you're interested drop in the comment oh nice thank you dude yeah yeah nice um yeah let's do it dude so what's next this is what we we use to create to that that mongodb instance exactly uh and actually we want to see uh because it's going to be crucial this time that we need to see when the database is actually connected okay so we want to go ahead and type in uh still in db config so mongoose dog connection okay um and once and we will add the uh property as open yep so it's pretty much like reading english so once the mongoose connection is open we want to fire off a function right okay um and we can just add like a simple error function and first up let's just console.log uh that db is connected just like this so uh so i think if you run the application once again uh with the terminal it will actually show the db connection um yes it's up so now what we can do guys is go ahead and shut this oh i need to save the file you see it starts yeah it restarts everything it says listening on localhost and boom says db connected now if it freaked out at that point just leave your computer and just walk away i'm joking just just just check the code again and you know what's up with you today you know it's a good way to keep the energy up you know so at this point guys you should see db connected and it and if you don't then just make sure you go back through the steps try not to lose hope at that point yeah that's right that's right okay um now let's go ahead and actually create the api endpoints that we will be uh using to store our images comments and all that kind of stuff in our database right yep let's do that before we do a quick shout out to sydney says are you guys keeping everything in one server file for the purpose of tutorial yes this is exactly why we do that and also for this one again it's the purpose of tutorial we we there are ways obviously you should split things up into separate files to make it like more like you have roots database you have some kind of structure for a tutorial though i mean if we go ahead and do all of that it's going to extend the build by a huge amount so that's what we're doing exactly yeah yeah go for it okay let's go uh down to api routes okay now here we first we need to upload some image and then uh be able to return it okay uh so first thing first we will need to add a post endpoint uh which will be responsible for uploading uh our images so let's just actually at the endpoint of upload yeah to keep things very very simple um and it will fire up so what happens here is that when you call this api this api endpoint uh with a post method it's going to fire off a function which will need to have two parameters which are request and response and those will be responsible for uh saving our stuff into the into our mongodb right oh you have printer on right yeah okay um but let's stop here for a little while and add a new file which we will be using to uh define the data structure okay so new file which will allow us to define the data structure we call it what a model right um yeah i i would just go and call it db model okay um db model.js and if you're following me i don't know if you're following me so you just created this file right yeah that's correct that's correct so okay and let's actually import mongoose here as well uh from mongoose of course yep and we will just simply need to create a an instance right so cons instance and we will be creating a oh damn it okay david david froze a little bit um so he says what we would do here guys is create a instance okay so this would say let's go ahead and check it out mine isn't actually loading up as well god damn it um okay so let me go ahead and pull up the code myself in case we have a connection issue okay so can you guys hear me by the way if you can let me know um otherwise everyone just dropped some fire in the chat be like oh my god everything's broken uh can you guys still hear me i'm not sure um okay where is the code [Laughter] somebody wrote david david's on that staring contest oh damn it we lost david [ __ ] all right i'm gonna go ahead and get the code and we can don't worry guys we can save the day david's laptop he's actually getting a new laptop tomorrow so he shouldn't have that issue from tomorrow onwards so that should be okay from the moment um i'm just pulling up the code myself guys because we actually prepped this before but let's just give it a sec okay so of people can hear all right now guys while i set this up go ahead and feel free to fire up a question if you want let me know fire off questions um so many people think david he is bluffing he's staring at you just imagine that guys like just david frozen staring you know oh right now i'm just pulling up the code right now um this is by the way how i quickly pull up code if you guys are wondering so what you can do is if you've got a new sort of oh david is calling have you got david okay okay david's back everyone smash the thumbs up button for david hey david is the instance guys david david got stuck in a circular loop yeah okay okay let me first reconnect to the live share and i think you need to do that too because yeah it said you left it oh sorry guys sometimes my connection just drops i'm actually going ahead and gonna go ahead and create um uh i'm gonna open up the code on my local as well so let me go ahead and do this boom ah this one is how far did i go um i mean just before you one sec code insiders boom okay got the code up nice now guys what i want to say is uh i saw a good question here somebody just said um okay david answer this might be a good question for you by elizabeth um i can't see your scream god damn it demo gods you get really good at multitasking when all this stuff goes wrong right okay i'm still a little unclear as to why you do not need to hide your mango db in a dot environment uh it's just for the purpose of this um of this tutorial so normally you definitely need to hide every single thing into your dot m file um but it's just this time when we're doing the tutorial right yeah so we don't really work and mess with the security part of stuff we just want to keep it super simple for you yeah so uh exactly so anything when it comes to environment files and stuff like that again there is better practices for this stuff it's because we're pretty much trying to fit this into a live stream so elizabeth i can pretty much teach you a lot of security stuff on our course separately or in the coaching course inside of pwj uh we can pretty much go over that so awesome question now uh simon says is this course understandable if you're doing react for the first time and if you know angular.js yeah so uh even if you're a complete beginner guys yeah pwj profit javascript link in the description is available for anyone who has zero experience encoding right so like you don't need to have coded before even if you've just heard of coding you don't even know where to begin that's uh that's what why we built it we built it so it's got a jacked community like everyone is insane energy inside the your success coach we have everyone we hold your hand with coaching calls pretty much we'll take you from a complete beginner to absolutely crushing it like david um and you can probably let me actually tell you this i joined without like almost any coding experience yeah how much did i take it before um like a month yeah and and it wasn't actually actually it was in college so that kind of doesn't count if you know what i mean yeah exactly yeah in college it doesn't really have the same hit you know like that's what i found um yeah i think i have your david the code that you sent me before by the way is that the code that we're using today yes it is okay let's go so now guys what we're going to do is inside of db model where we have cons instance we're going to go ahead and basically just go ahead and copy this code in and we'll break this code down for you okay so what this is saying is we're creating a schema for every single document that we're pushing into the db i think you're not showing your screen right now oh okay yes i'm not sharing yeah there you go somebody wrote david is in a staring contest when you froze um and i'm not in you're um or you're actually bidding it in on your local um yeah yeah what's happening yeah i'm building your local yeah okay okay so now we have a content since a mongoose dot schema and then we've got cap so this is basically the structure of each document right so in the in a sql database in nosql database or you have this structure you have collection which is um essentially an array of documents right and then inside of that you can have another collection and yeah that has an array of documents and so forth and this and it goes on and on and on right now actually you want to change the image to a string wait what wait yeah yeah okay so this is now a string right just like yeah okay don't because it's going to be uh yeah exactly um so now what we're to do um is it possible to use sql with react yes and also dude keep the comments clean otherwise block um okay so yeah this is going to be a structure for every sort of piece of information they're going to push inside the database right now once you've got this we need to actually export this into a collection right so what we're going to do here is go ahead and say export default mongoose.model and this is the collection name so imagine this is what a post will look like and this is the collection that each post goes inside of right now we're going to export it as um instance instance this should be instance so we're going to export it as this and basically this will allow us to go ahead and use it inside the server.js file okay that's correct right okay um actually you want to change the the uh change to capital s um oh for the image strings yeah yeah and now we're good to go uh back to server.js file by the way nice let's go okay um so now in the upload uh you can pretty much go ahead and like save um whatever comes in as a request body you want to save that into a variable right okay if you're my in my live session on you nope i said you joined um oh yeah you're in am i i see you david who is this david should i go ahead and get this guy guys someone is in the coding session and their name is david and it's not our david i just typed in hello who the hell is david i just typed in hello to your code where uh to the upload um upload api like no just there david you're getting kicked i'm sorry okay i've been removed okay i just got the notification yeah so now i'm gonna do is send you a new one yup go ahead and join in that one oh okay david your mic's echoing out man okay i think it's because the sound goes from my headphones to the microphone okay um is it all good now guys hopefully okay joining again let's try it yep okay uh while i'm joining that's actually uh sonny you can go ahead and uh add the stuff in there so let's first create a simple variable like const uh db post okay so now we're gonna go ahead and say const um we're looking for the upload endpoint so yeah it's uh line 31 really yup wait um yeah not on r1 no i'm saying in the actual code right okay yeah so so we've got an upload endpoint right and that's on and what i'm going to do is we want to strip we're going to get the body and we're going to get a file from it right no no no no no we want to uh get the body we will be sending everything as a string okay so you want to go ahead and just create a simple um david i've sent you a link just jump in um i'm jumping i'm jumping yeah then we can carry on like that that'd be awesome from joining yeah so everyone let's try this one twice all right so give us a second guys let it load up okay yeah it's you see me inside um can you see inside the code uh not yet it's still loading okay right so david what we're trying to build here right let's just explain it to everyone okay yeah yeah we're trying to build api post and in our code we had api post upload in here we're just gonna say forward slash upload right and then correct we've got a request and a result right and then what we're saying is we want to actually go ahead and strip out some information from the the request whatever we send uh with the request yeah and with this with that information we want to go ahead and create a new document in our database right that's pretty much it because it just sent me a funny message on um it still says you blocked me blocked you yeah um okay and what are they saying david unticked okay um uh david this is carry on so we've got the database object so i'm going to go ahead and guys what you need to do is we're going to basically create a database object we're going to strip it from the body right so what was we're doing here correct we're creating an object and then we're saying um that's not a code uh you're going to create a simple const um okay and and um yep and you want you want to strip out the whole request body right and then you can go ahead and uh with the body yeah um let's actually first import um the database structure that we created uh from the model file okay and you wanna go ahead and just import it up top okay and yeah that is correct and don't forget to add js at the end uh because it's es6 okay okay and you want to go down and say db model dot create and pass in whatever uh pass passing the body no no not db. model just simply db model which you just imported yeah dot create uh and pass in the body okay and it will have a callback function with an error or data as a parameter that's correct and you want to add an if gate all right if if statement and if there is an error uh we want to set the response status to 500 and send back uh the error oh yeah wristband status 500 and send error um okay and if there is no error you want to just go ahead and set the response status 201 and send back the data that we just stripped out from this creation okay and that actually should be able to uh save a post okay uh and because we are using that in in uh we will be uh destructuring the image file on the front end to phase 64 code this will allow us to save it as a string okay with that done uh let's actually create a get endpoint as well because we have to actually re render out this stuff to the screen so let's go ahead and create app.get okay so wait where are we doing that um we're creating an uh no no uh outside it's uh it's going to be another uh endpoint okay so we're going to say app.gap yep we will say app.cat uh let's actually just say sync as endpoint what's up nothing nevermind async and then wait so what's this endpoint no no no no uh the endpoint was sync yeah yep wait why are we gonna get called sync because we use that to synchronize data between the database and the front end okay and it's going to fire off another function with the request and the response parameter okay so um just like up above uh request response and yep yep that fires up the function uh which will go ahead and find all the uh stuff for us so you're gonna just add two squiggly braces and in between you wanna say uh db model dot find yeah and inside of there uh just another uh pair of brackets yeah no not quote bracket or okay yeah yeah and just error and data because we could actually define what do we want to search for okay uh but since we want everything to be rendered out we will just uh go this way and you can copy paste the if gate from the um post endpoint yeah and there is one thing you will need to uh you you need to you need to watch out and that's the response status uh on the second time okay you want to go ahead and set that to 200 actually okay okay and that should be able to uh retrieve all the data from the database right yep okay do we want to actually go ahead and save something into it with uh using the frontend code or let's just keep on with the back end um dude you tell me um let's go to and build it on the front end okay so here we have the front end stuff right it's running over here so let's go ahead and pull up our terminal on this right here yep that's correct yeah okay um and wherever you have the image upload dot js file that's what we will be using right now um and on the front end we actually need to import a new package uh we will need to go ahead and import the image file to base64 uh exif um package okay it's actually it's going to allow us to uh destructure the image into base64 code okay so give me one sec um okay i don't have i don't have the latest code so what we're doing uh just go ahead and type in npm uh or actually npm install that thing uh i just sent the joe over on the front side yeah where have you sent that uh slack okay i think what might be better dude if you just zip your code and send it oh yeah you don't have it nope okay one moment okay um just uh just one moment and i gotta get rid of the node modules first yep so guys we're gonna go ahead and install this right as we're to say make it simple you guys go back here and say control c and with npm i image file to base64 exif right that's correct and that is going to um make an actual string a long long string from our uh image well once we upload it okay yeah i'm still deleting no modules at the moment uh but actually you can go ahead and create a new uh state we definitely need to i mean i think in this case dude what we should do is rather than doing it this way right what might be an easier approach is guys you you already have this code right you already have this code you can adapt this to actually pull from your firebase by swapping out your firebase.js with your config right now once you have your config all you need to do is actually go to firebase go to the project settings change this out for your configuration file um that's very easy to go ahead and get right now what we can do is we can go back here and then what we can do is whenever you upload the image right you actually upload it to firebase you get the url back in this file image upload right so this will go ahead and actually upload something to firebase and it'll give you the image url now david we can make an axios request here to post and that would actually be a very simple way of doing it let's go that way okay that's that's actually correct um yeah let's go that way okay uh so once we got that you are back um you just wanna uh pass it in the body yeah what's happening now so we're talking about server.js so we're talking about image upload no no uh we want to stay in the image upload um and and let's let's prepare the axios okay first so guys what you need to do is go ahead and create an axios file so axios.js okay now here what you're gonna do is you need to install axios so you need to make sure you go ahead and do um npm i exhale so make sure you're in the correct folder when you do all this stuff right so axios is gonna allow you to go ahead and install everything that we need and then what we can do is we can go ahead and open up our axials and basically we need to do here is the import axials from axios uh also guys i'm going to moderate the chat in a second i'm blocking a ton of you because do not spam that chat man like rishu anand like that's not coded so you're blocked abhishek chaudhary you're blocked hey guys come on keep that chat clean like simple as you know otherwise like it's super annoying when we have to like babysit and do stuff like that like because it is babysitting so i'm just going to block you so here we go right now what we're going to do is import axios from axios and then here what we say is const instance equals axios dot create okay now what we're going to do here is we're going to go ahead and say base url right and this goes ahead and sets up um okay and now this goes ahead and actually we can set a base url at this point so here we're going to say http we're going to use our localhost so we're going to say um just local host am i running on 88e right yes that's correct then we say export default instance like so okay so go ahead and save it and then what we're going to go ahead and do is we are going to go go ahead and go back to our image upload now we have axios prepared okay so to import it we can go ahead and say import we can say axios so we can just say axios from and you're going to import from our local axios so i see a lot of people make this mistake you don't import it from here but instead you actually end up importing it from this one we're not doing that we're importing it from our local okay um so now david what's next so what's next is you actually want to go ahead and create your axios post request okay um you just want to go ahead and like uh so here yeah yeah and at the url in the body and the user that is actually logged in we need to pass in those two properties right okay because this is the upload right here right yeah and of course you will need to add the caption as well okay yeah so let's go ahead and make it super clear for them so it's going to be post and it's going to be forward slash upload and then here we pass in data because it's a post request and then what we do is inside of here you want to mask your db model so this right here so this is pretty much our db model so i'm going to go ahead and pop this on the side so here's the database model i'm going to move us down here and now what you can see is when we have image upload.js now what we can see is um and also guys i see those people asking about what is profitable javascript is the course that we offer uh link is in the description it's only available for this week and then we close the doors um it has a ton of coaching calls and value that you guys will benefit from and that is going to be something massive which will go ahead and literally change your career so um now guys also i see people saying like price this price that guys i just wanna i don't wanna focus on negative comments but i do wanna say one thing like if you think that's expensive and you think that's like not investing in your future then guys i have one thing to say to you good luck trying to get to a six figure salary okay like you have to invest in yourself me and kazi we literally will spend like thousands on our personal development if there's anyone like i guarantee if you ask the same question to someone and you say all right here's would you pay a hundred dollars on a night out or something like that they'd have no problem looking cool on a night out right invest in yourself stop complaining and let's carry on seriously there's too many like there's too many people who get like you know like caught up on that stuff like it's fine if it's but don't spread the negativity around the community okay keep it positive and there's no room for that [ __ ] so now um okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and upload so we actually have the po the caption the user we have as the user name right it's the username yep yep so we have the caption we have the username we have the image itself and we have comments but i don't think we're going to be pushing comments right now are we so previously we were pushing to firebase over here now um here and also guys one quick question is so many people ask like how did you get good at coding how did you get good at this and that guy's like we invested in ourselves like that that was pretty simple you know like it didn't take like i didn't wake up one morning and i was like oh react react papa react like no you know like it takes a lot of work like seriously reality check let's go right now upload so here we're gonna say caption we're gonna pass in the caption here i'm gonna say uh user is the username because that's what we pass it in as correct here i'm going to say image is just the image oh no image is the url because this is the one that comes back from firebase after we upload it and then we're going to say comments i don't think we upload the comments uh we don't upload comments you can just uh leave that uh full empty it's not going to cause any problems yeah okay done okay um so with that done actually i think you can go ahead and uh check it out online okay or or actually live right how it goes let's go ahead and see what happens now so we go back to our code let's go back to our react app and let's go ahead and whoa let's zoom out of that okay so now it can't be reached so we need to go ahead and do um bring it up and say npm stop boom save it and then what we're gonna do and i actually really like this comment i appreciate this comment so suddenly says if anything they're asking too little money for the amount of value they gave honestly i couldn't agree more dude the fact that we are able to provide what the level of what we provide at the price range that is i'm telling you now guys if you get it for anything less than a thousand dollars you're absolutely stealing from us like as in it's literally a case if you're staying for us like you're getting a bargain trust me when i say people will pay like thousands and thousands to go to university but freak out over a simple course you know like exactly and also no one's holding your gun to your head guys like it's all we we drop free content on youtube it's all free you know like everything's good right look awesome okay now why is it so zoomed in oh wow okay there you go so guys now what we can do is let's go ahead and open up our inspector let's go ahead and go back here we're going to go ahead and say login and here just i think that'll be oh damn it let's go sign up yeah sonny let's just do abc abc abc register and oh man damn it trust that to be in use register all right there you go now what we should be in so if i refresh we should be logged in yep there we are logged in so now if i go ahead and type in like a test caption right now we're not actually logging anything out to be honest here we do a post request so what i'm going to do guys is we're actually running the server on the second over here right so what we can do is let's go ahead pull this over here for a sec and i'm just going to pull this to the right hand side pull this to the left hand side i'm going to close this for a second and now whenever i upload a picture so i'm going to upload that same picture of the cat okay yeah i'm going to go open now as soon as i hit upload some db stuff should happen okay so i may error out i may freak out we don't know but let's go ahead and click upload so upload and okay so we uploaded to firebase actually we are not actually console logging anything i don't think um but david that should have pushed into the db right hopefully it should have yeah so yeah actually if you refresh it it should show uh if it's in there uh but we're not pulling from the we're not actually pulling on our front end oh that's right yeah oh that's right okay let's check the database let's go inside and to check the db what we do is um we go to collections yep and inside of there you should be seeing your um collection name right now we should see we've got comments test caption sanger and we've got the firebase url hey that's dope okay that's it that's awesome good right so now what we can do guys is uh also if also damn thank you dude five pound donation another masterpiece from the cp fam let's go dude i love that energy that is insane thanks dude and akashi i dare you to make the whole internet done bring it dude challenge accepted um okay so that's awesome we now have things pushed into db so next challenge is to we're not actually going to go and hook up the comments and stuff today we'll go ahead and do it with the posts instead we'll do the post we'll make it road time with pusher and then we'll get everything working on that front and it'll be some homework for you guys to go ahead and hook up the comments okay so okay so let's go to pusher now okay um and let's actually copy the back end code okay so i might push it right now we've got some yep and just uh scroll down a lot a lot more down yeah because first it goes with the front end but the middle one that's the one uh the bar pusher equals new pusher that's the one that you want to copy okay okay and just go back to the uh code all right so here i'm going to copy this right yep that's correct i got it uh the trigger one that is not necessary but okay well we we will use that later which one okay this this just yeah okay and then i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of this one as well so thank you so much iodelli uh as well very much for that two pound donation thanks dude thanks dude yeah uh let's actually go to app config now yep in in the server.js file sorry um and we will need to paste yeah exactly and just go ahead and paste it okay um the first first line is not going to be needed uh we have already done that over there exactly uh let's actually change the var to a const that's correct and that pretty much uh sets up our pressure connection oh yeah don't ever use war yeah i don't ever use it god dammit okay there we go so now if that if that helped you remember it then smash the thumbs up button okay now you see we've got cons pushing this is our basic our push of credentials right here okay exactly one more thing you want to change is uh in the last row uh it says encrypted but you want to change that to use tls um that's just uh one little thing with capital t's no no no not the true uh the encrypted part so you you want to change the whole uh let's delete the whole line and just type in yeah use tls uh one word and all capital with the tls yep and yeah that should be uh good okay okay so now what's next now what's next is we need to set up our change stream so let's go down where you uh console log when the database is connected okay okay yeah yeah yep and now you want to go ahead and type in uh we need i think i have it here so we need to go ahead and do constant change stream equals mongoose connection the collection that we made was posts so you guys can see that inside of the db over here so this is actually posts you see it posts there we go so we're not lying then we say watch right now watch is basically going to create like a realtime watcher on it and then what we need to say is whenever something changes on that right so if anything happens if some information goes inside we're going to basically go ahead and trigger off like a a callback function and the way we do that is we say change stream dot on and then you say on change and then whenever a change comes in we get that change and we fire off some some code right so at this point you go crazy okay i'm joking [Laughter] and now at this point what you can say is you can you can basically console log at this point if you want to you could like at this point just have some just um say change stream triggered change some stuff and then console.logs change end of change right so at this point i'll make it very simple and just say change was change triggered on pusher and then the change will log out and then you can see end of change right so it's just kind of handy now david i see we've got two types of operation change are we only doing the insert here uh we will be only doing the insert uh because we're not doing the command section right okay so first we will be just using the first one uh and you're actually oh no statement so let's type in if change the operation type okay when a bit robotic all right if change dot operation type if change operation type yep uh if it is if it equals to insert okay uh you either want a console log something where you don't uh but definitely what you want to do is save uh the change the full document into a post details um uh uh variable okay so to put it very simply guys the that change that comes in on that change stream right has a different as a type of type right so if we hover over you can see it's got different types it's got insert replace update to the bunch of them we're going to check if it's insert we're just going to console.log and at this point we're going to basically trigger the upload right as if we're going to do some upload stuff so what i would say is here we need to get the change itself has something inside of it called a full document so we're just going to refer to that as the post details right yeah full document is pretty much what was actually uh inserted into the database right with that done uh let's type in push.trigger and now we need to yeah we need to add a post and we will be defining an event which will be inserted okay um so okay so we can say inside inserted that's going to be our even uh it's still yeah it's instiller yeah that's correct and that's where you want to strip out the data uh that you want to uh like upload to pusher and what's the um realtime part of the things right yeah so this is where you want to just add user postdetails.user and you want to strip out the post details.caption and if you want to make like just like last time with the whatsapp clone you want to strip out the image as well done that's that's right and let's actually add the else branch okay so it doesn't like crash the whole application so else uh just console log error triggering pusher that's pretty much that wouldn't be the else i guess but um wouldn't it be okay i mean okay because it could be a different type of change request that comes in yeah yeah but since we're doing just this part uh so you have to prepare your front and your back end as well um but that kind of that can go as well i think something more like this unknown trigger from pusher or something you know yeah yeah okay and now let's go back to our front end where we are um by sydney he said would destructuring the post details make the code faster um no so it's not about it wouldn't make it faster it would make it more i guess es6 you could use definitely structure it would make it maybe more readable um depending on how you want to do it but may it doesn't really affect the speed as much yeah okay um now you want to go back to wherever uh you fetch the data from my firebase okay and just get rid of that um so what where are you talking so i think it's posts.js or maybe even app.js um we're gonna find it first yeah it's pose.js okay so in post.js we have this use effect right now this user effect right here you can see what it's doing is it's saying go ahead and grab this is the comments this is not the one we want this is not the one we want we want this is for every single post we actually render out the posts here this is where we get the posts oh okay okay so now guys you can see we've got the db collection posts order by timestamp on snapshot right so on remember on snapchat is basically what we're essentially changing right um to to become man friendly think of it that way so david what are we adding here so you can just go ahead and get rid of all the firebase stuff and instead we will be adding an axios uh target function okay we can keep it in the use effect um yeah so and so i'm gonna get rid of this yeah yeah uh and actually just uh name somehow the function that's gonna be the easiest uh so let's just name and let's just give it a name so let's type in sync data and that's the function that we wanna or we can yep yeah uh let's go in axios.gap all right yep and this is where the endpoint goes which is i believe it's sync or something like that yep so inside our server.js we had this one over here so this is where we're doing it and this basically gets back all the information yeah yeah yeah and that then um we will receive a response which we uh want to either console.log or not okay um but anyways we definitely want to map through it okay so response.data.map so we want we want to go inside of response and there is the data that's the one that we want to loop through and we will receive an item and we want to create our own uh use state which will contain all the fetched images because there is like lots of things going on what's up you mean the posts oh that's correct yeah so the posts over here so here now what we can do is we can say go through everything and we actually want to do set posts like this right yeah that's correct and then what we're mapping here is we're we're getting the data and what how are we grabbing it so you want to strip out every single uh relatable item so like id you want to grab the image you want to grab the caption and this time we are not doing the comments but normally you would want to grab that as well and like put that into like uh simple json uh objects right yeah i mean the easiest way to to check this guys is you the console log the response on the use effect and then what we do is axios is not defined so we need to actually go ahead and import this so we need to go ahead and go up here and say import axios from our local axios like this save it and then uh what we can do is we go back to our code to here and now if you go ahead and okay f12 you should be able to see it says on app dot js where is it app.js line 50 so no was it 950 yeah no line 72 so here we should see now 1972 we get the array back right so over here so this is this array that right here is pretty much i'm going to make that a little bit bigger and there we go so you guys can see a little bit bigger so here we've got the data right inside now you can see each item has all this information right so what we want to do at this point is pretty much grab that data and pop it in our variable so what we can do is we can say set posts and all we need is this we don't actually need to do a map we can go ahead and say response.data and then we can go that way too you can say console.log down here and you can just say um posts are posts right and then here what you can do is this is a asynchronous uh core right here so the way you should do these is you should actually make this a function uh which is async right um anything which is async you should always do like this you should actually have fetch posts like this and then here when we have this you need to await and this will actually abide by the rules of react and and it will fetch it in the correct way otherwise it doesn't abide by everything correctly and it does some weird stuff with rendering if you don't do that okay so now we go ahead and it says kind of reproperty username of undefined so um this is happening let's go ahead and just double check something so sync them response why are we getting the username now uh i think it's above when you're authenticating the user this is strange why are we getting this now of all times um let me go ahead and just hit the log out okay so now guys you can see we've got the posts so the data did come back everything worked in that sense but could not already properly have undefined radio map app user name okay so this is why because right now guys it's looping through we're passing these posts down right so there's a map so here post.map now this is not username anymore remember in the database we set it to user so post is now post.user so we need to make sure we change that otherwise it's going to freak out it says that it can't use a username so it's going to happen again because inside of our posts let's go ahead and check out so down here we've got data we've got data dot user so the data user is correct but in here we've got the user user post.user user okay then we've got posts dot anywhere else where else we're using posts that should be it so in here now you can see posts are and you've got each of the posts you should have post.user right so it's still freaking out for some reason so cannot read property user of undefined now so post dot user so let's see why it says that so we're going to array an object saying loop through it now what i'd like to do here is what you can do is just kind of stress test it and say rather than this you can actually go ahead and say console.log now i'll just say posts dot for each post console.log post and this will actually go ahead and debug the debug step okay so now when we refresh it says posts are but you see like it says post it shows us then we go down it says user is you can already property user undefined app.js post.userpost.caption strange so we do have user in there but we need to go ahead and check so kind of replace the user postpost okay here's why we're actually destructuring so we're not actually getting it this is really bad okay so here we should say and the idea in the post itself okay so oh okay i see what's going on so now here what we can do is we can actually make this post and then what we can do is here it wouldn't be post id anymore the key is actually different now the key is this one so if we go back into data you guys can see it's underscore id so post dot underscore id this is key as post top underscore id and then the username is post.user and then yes now we have everything and then image is no longer this it'll be post or image there you go by the time thank you so much for smb plays for the lovely donation and go crush your job yeah awesome stuff dude a massive we love it when that stuff when everyone gets a job and stuff like that that's awesome um somebody said you need to destruct user as well uh i don't think so i don't think so i said idm post before there we go boom we have a cat hey look at that we have the [ __ ] cat yes let's go right so there we go happy days now guys what we can see is um and also for that debugging effort i think you should smash the damn thumbs up button because that was an awesome demonstration of actual some debugging and play sort of figured out nice let's go frank frank goes it's a great instagram build let's go awesome stuff dude thank you for being here frank always comes in swinging right now we've got that done david what's next okay um we need to hook up the pusher on the front end as well okay so let's actually install a package which uh which is called pusher.js okay so i'm gonna go ahead and do yeah just simple mpm install so i'm gonna go ahead and pop a new second terminal npm install yup that's correct js exactly and while it's running uh you can go back to pusha.com to grab our initial data or actually code and yeah uh you want to have the uh yeah that's correct done okay and just copy paste replace the voice to const um you want to actually strip it into a use effect uh somewhere in the beginning okay so firstly we need to get we've audience imported pusher and then basically what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead so this actually went ahead and finished installing so i can go ahead and close the terminal down here let's go ahead and create a new use effect so right now we can clean this up after let's get rid of some code but let's keep it simple okay use effect and then do a callback function i'm going to have some code inside there and then the dependencies are going to be empty at the moment and then we're going to go inside here we're going to say variable pushups we don't like var we have change that to const all right and then this is our id for pusher the cluster is eu and here correct we have cons channel equals pusher.subscriber it's not going to be in my channel is it david it's going to be posts exactly and the my event under that uh that's going to be uh inserted inserted now just to show them david because i think this is really handy if we go to server.js and we show them you remember here guys we actually went ahead and this is the collection posts or like the sort of pusher event that we're listening to post and the inserted action right so it triggers at the back end and then on pusher it's listening and it's subscribing to that collection it's called something called a pub sub model that's basically what it's using uh when we do this so it's publishing on the back end every time something changes and then on the front end we're subscribing and you have this pub sub method that's right such a good name pub sub google also offer this as well um and if you haven't already checked out firebase then what the hell are you doing can you live without firebase exactly five goddamn awesome i swear to god google if you watch this sponsor us thank you let's carry on i think i think devin is getting a job at google oh yeah devin get us in man get firebase to sponsor like i don't know make make them like super firebase instances or something [Laughter] do some fun [ __ ] yeah right okay okay uh let's actually delete uh line 77 we do not need any kind of alert or something oh yeah yep and you just want to go ahead and sync uh the data once again like uh do uh i think i think you need to move whatever yeah do that same fetch oh i see so what we should do actually at this point is move this function outside we use it here so we fetch the post in the initial load of the page correct and then in here when we get the data back every time we're going to go ahead and refetch just refresh um david that's not actually true i don't think so i mean okay we'll do this first but i'll show you i mean i have a feeling we could also do something else so here what we're saying is every time we get an inserted event it needs to to go ahead and refetch the entire database right but what you can yep what you could do here is actually do console.log data data received and then go ahead and do data and you can you can actually push that into the current uh state and that will stop you from having to do that sort of refetching of the entire database ever over and over again um we can do that it keeps the performance um it's going to keep your performance uh a lot better which is going to be handy but for now anyway let's test it out dude let's go ahead and see it says pusher is not defined so everything's working joking um import so if you're like me and sometimes you get lazy go to the end of pusher press command push oh damn it didn't work i need like some sad music you know like when that stuff doesn't work like and i have to type my own import it's like sometimes you just have to so sad i have to just do the hard stuff you know smash the thumbs up button guys thank you smash it let's go nice okay we basically went ahead and added that code in so now it should be saving and oh man we've gotta look at those three things if it's working so hey [Laughter] i think i didn't add that did you add that david no it definitely was you because last time you were the one who changed some stuff yeah so let me go ahead and save this image thank you have you ever done that like you don't have that image already i'm going to reupload it now so i'm going to say this is dope right this is dope all right i'm going to go ahead choose file and i'm going to find that picture that somebody actually uploaded that's awesome yeah and i click upload now everything might just blow up on me but let's just give it a try upload and then boom so it went ahead posted it and it actually okay so there we go so it actually did work i actually did work but the reason why i didn't come in order right it's because we don't have time stamps right so it's the only difference here that we don't have timestamps so timestamps is the reason why you're not seeing in descending order so what you could do is you could simply add timestamps when you do this stuff but if i go ahead and just type this and say this is not broken right so it actually does work and let's just do a huge kitten again like or something but you know what let me see if i got another picture let me go ahead and just move this off elon musk uh actually yes i do have elon i mean if you don't have a picture of elon what are you doing what are you doing yeah what the hell is going on man all right so i've got elon gonna click upload and we can see elon is now here right and you see guys i'm not refreshing okay so this stuff is working like this is insane to the brain oh god damn smash the thumbs up button i thought that was pretty sick [Laughter] all right now we're going to add the second cat who's ready for this guys let's go ahead and click open and upload and then let's see it should say we should see some huge [ __ ] cat right no hey there we go hey you see like this is real time right it's actually working it's refreshing when the data comes in um and that's awesome like i think that's pretty cool david um i think that's pretty much the that's using pusher right yeah that's pretty much the build uh actually homework for everybody to find a way how to add the comment with the knowledge we just gave you yeah you can go ahead and like whenever something gets oh [ __ ] okay maybe wait oh my god dude you know what it's doing right now wow it's combining it's combined this is insane this is this was totally planned right i mean honestly i need to stop the music for a sec that's insane guys we're actually combining firebase with um so right now what's actually happened here and oh man i have to show this wait this is um i don't know if i've got the firebase up and running i mean i might do let me go ahead and check it um that's so sick man so it froze a little yeah so basically what's happening guys is we have these images right now and then are being uploaded right so this is being uploaded to mongodb and if i go ahead and type in like this is awesome and then we just post right so added a comment right now add the comment now but that comment is obviously going to stay like it's not going to just disappear um and i just want to check if i go into comments and let me see if abc okay let's just try this that one's like testing i'll show you guys what i'm looking at it's mining oh my god damn dude it actually is okay so remember guys we actually went ahead and created this before on firebase right so this is insane and this is pretty cool and i think everyone should destroy the damn thumbs up button for what we're about to show you right now okay so the comments are actually working so this is being every time we upload an image it's getting uploaded to um to firebase right so it's not no sorry it's getting uploaded to mongodb right then is getting triggered off it's firing off like a realtime sort of pub sub listener which means that it refreshes the page right so that's awesome and then react rerenders it reenters the page now what we unintentionally did because the code is so brilliant is right now say we got this like um let's go ahead and check where we've got a comment here so we've got abc testing right now if i go ahead and type in because we've got the ids from mongodb what it's doing is we didn't actually remove the code from here so if i go ahead and do this is insane and it works guys watch this on the right yeah watch this on the right it's actually so this is from mongodb being rendered on react using pusher to stay real time and then on the right hand side we've got firebase which is also being fed into the comment section to power it post boom is sick man that is so thick oh man okay guys that was totally intentional yeah that was how did you prepare for this that was awesome man and i think that that actually will go ahead and show you guys that you can use both you can use mongodb and firebase and that's a that's a realtime example there guys of showing you that it works right sorry i just saw a comment akashi says clever programmer be like hippityhoppity big companies code is now my property exactly sydney says perfect ship it i couldn't agree more dude i think that's production ready i mean like look at that cat's face like i think that cat is like that cat's like yeah this [ __ ] this is insane dude like sydney's like yo just this is the [ __ ] cat man [Laughter] dude i think that was awesome guys let us know in the chat right now if you enjoyed that session um we actually overcame a lot of obstacles to get that to you guys so that was insane awesome work from david go ahead and give it up for david and if you guys aren't following david oops wrong way make sure you go make sure you go and follow him check him out on socials um david anything to say about what we did today um huge give up for sonny definitely because he was crushing it as well uh he's being super busy on the team side uh so let's give it up for him too and i think you already have a lot of followers but definitely somebody [Laughter] and otherwise i guys hope you enjoy the build and let me know if you have any questions literally shoot some questions last second guys uh also if you haven't already we appreciate if you just smash the thumbs up button it always helps the video get out remember if you need to uh actually go ahead and start this or use join later remember the code starting point is in the description so you can actually go ahead download that and then take a running chance at copying along with us and remember also if you do that then make sure you actually go ahead and swap out your firebase for the um our firebase.js for your firebase.js so that way you can actually go ahead and see on the backend and then you could also deploy it to um to to your your endpoint right to hero cool now we did we've shown in a few other builds about how you can deploy to heroku so i think we're not going to show in this build um but i think that was awesome i think like everyone enjoyed it we have we have a lot of people we said hop reaching says totally enjoyed that mohit says amazing session adash it was an amazing build um uh harper is saying that's a good question so you said can we do amazon man stack with [ __ ] node and js damn dude that that amazon build is actually really jacked we can definitely do that yeah we do that no hell yeah why not we can go ahead and do that uh ayodele says sunny the coding model thank you thank you so much david's got the hair for it man [Laughter] dopamine beatbox says i will send the instagram dm to you guys okay go for it definitely you think says good job boys thank you thank you fluchako kevin attivone says amazing session future code aka elizabeth says love that you're all in different countries perfect example how we can collaborate or work with people all over the world in real time yes i was actually saying this is correct yeah i was saying this to nars yesterday as well like we were on the phone yesterday and i was driving back from my girlfriend's house and and now has called me and we're just talking for an hour and it's insane like we we we're doing stuff across the world and it's it's with people like like i've never met david in person i've never met kazzy even in person or any other team and yet we are transforming lives right and like you guys are a part of that this whole community is what makes it possible um so like we just want to say a massive thank you for you guys watching and being here because without you guys it wouldn't be possible okay and also frank hey love that barry smith instagram clone yes that's awesome dude um we got viewers in indonesia i love this dude like this is a really nice sort of ending to the video like there's a lot of people dropping some love now guys i also want to shout and say if you're if you haven't seen profit with javascript or you don't know what it is it's a course that we offer and basically we pretty much have uh 15 coaching uh 15 modules inside there which will take you from an absolute beginner all the way to an experienced developer damn sydney smith just dropped dude and you watched the entire stream i appreciate you did 10 euro super chat thanks again agent have a great day fam thank you so much for tuning in bro honestly i really really appreciate that um yeah and guys like i was saying we pretty much have a i have an awesome awesome community inside of our uh our course called profit with javascript and basically yeah we only have the doors let's actually show them this lack yeah we show them we have a buzzing community exactly andrilla uh i can't pronounce the last thing but it says awesome builds i learned a lot from these live tutorials best teachers indeed thank you so much um yeah so two things i want to show you guys so firstly here's the actual course um let me go ahead and make it full screen so link is in the description for profit with javascript it's only going to be available for one more week and then we close the doors and then we're not sure when we're actually going to open it up again so even if you haven't seen this before go ahead check out the page uh give this video a watch we put a lot of time and effort into making this awesome video so we've got 15 training modules javascript success coaches so you're going to get a bunch of video feedback on every single one of your assignments so it doesn't matter if you get stuck it doesn't matter if you get caught up on a piece of work or you don't understand a different principle then all you need to go ahead and do is go ahead and hit one of your success coaches and we also have a bunch of weekly coaching calls so we actually just dropped the um we actually went ahead and dropped the timetable for this week for the uh oh yeah and it wasn't for the coaching course actually it was for the um and it was for the coaching no that was a fun one for the coaching call yeah so actually it was up right here i think yeah so this is the schedule for this week's coaching course so we actually keep it very proactive guys and here you can see pretty much um this is what we have for this week so we've got like tuesday with me so tomorrow and i'm actually going to be bringing everyone on youtube so that you guys can actually get a taster session okay which would be awesome wednesday we have back to basics with david and amanda thursday we have nars with javascript saturday we have the basics with the success coaches so you see this is every week right now a lot of people are complaining about prices and things like that guys we bring that to you with that single price right which is insane of value okay like it's really really insane value that we're able to bring that to you guys um i want to go ahead and show you guys the community that we offer inside of the course so i'm going to go ahead and actually go ahead and check and go to profit with javascript there we go and let me go ahead and close this and now guys you can see that we actually have just uh around 2 000 members inside this community so at the top over here you can see it's 2 000 members okay which is absolutely mindblowing and the community is absolutely on fire like you can see there's just it's

so many students have landed jobs it's insane we've got jen who landed literally lost her job due to covet doubled her salary from i think she went from like 35k to like uh 17. no no no she she almost had 50k and she went up to 100. yeah i think it was like 95k she got afterwards which is 99 insane but with with the all the all the equity and all those kind of bonus and stuff like that it went

because a lot of you guys want to learn coding to actually go ahead and make money right we don't want to sort of make it just to play around and play games we actually want to make some money from it and change our lives right everyone wants to go ahead and change their lives now i see a lot of people saying maybe some people don't sign up because they don't speak english well david honestly i think even you can vouch for me here that like how many international students do we have i think a lot philippines uh sri lanka um we got from romania we got from all over europe uh we got from south america dude we're we're an international yeah class exactly like there is no language limitations on on this post guys like seriously no language limitations um here's some of the apps that we will

going to go ahead and dive in inside proper javascript and then you've got the awesome coaches inside so you've got all the success coaches you've got kazee you've got nars you've got myself and and you've got the amazing david who you can see today and then guys like here are some of the the here is where the proof comes in the point so frank actually was on today's session he landed a sixfigure job from sonos which is amazing which is why he's donating a hundred dollars like and it's just proof like guys like honestly like it's insane stuff this is jen who we mentioned earlier she made twice which what she said about before so 90k year job so insane stuff and um nazari actually got a contract for 110 000 exactly yeah guys it's just it's just mindblowing honestly and if you don't believe us go ahead and go and check out the the page for yourself and um it's more than just a course it's honestly a family and we do offer a payment plan so you guys can go scroll down here and you can see like there is a payment plan option so you can split the payments up and all you need to do is go ahead and join but the doors close in just a few days the 26th of september those doors are closing guys now what i would recommend my personal advice make just come out try it out you've got 30 days to go ahead give it a shot and on the 29th day if you still are not happy you can get your money back but what i will say guys and this is a warning to everyone if you don't grab it in the by the 26th of september and it closes the doors closed you don't get to even try profit with javascript so if you've got two options right you've got a chance to try something out which may i mean like i'm telling you it will change your life but like in in if you're skeptical if you put in your hard work yeah if you put in the hard work and sort of combine it with the course it's going to change your entire life right now you could you could take that leap right and you can try it for for 30 days but the course closes in six days so i think five days so by the 26th of september the entry closes right now you can either risk that and you can go for it and then say in 29 days you can pretty much go ahead and see you can pretty much go ahead and see and if you're not happy guys get your money back it's completely there's no risk like i said it's a 30day moneyback guarantee but if you don't and let's say you okay you just think oh yeah i'll wait until next time guys i'm telling you now the cost is going to keep going up in price like like i said before is something which we massively undervalue in fact and um yeah like i'm telling you now like if you on the fence now then you're just if you want to really make your dreams down come true invest in yourself and make it happen right like if you look up to people like myself like david like kazi like nars everyone on the team like everyone got to where they're at because of really really hard work and just being genuine right which is why we all found each other and we made a genuine product right we made a genuine course that can actually change people's lives and that's why we've got the traction and love and that's why we're the one we're literally the fastest growing youtube channel coding youtube channel on youtube right now right that's why we're flying past everyone else that's why the family on cp uh the cp farm is insane and we will be getting so much at some point like we have to do that cp fam is such a sick like brand you know like um yeah yeah yeah but guys beyond that i think let's wrap up here
