what's up youtube how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com today we're going to be talking about day one of the react challenge it's going to be front end developer guide okay front end developer guide that's what you're going to be learning because let's be honest we all want to become developers and if you become a frontend developer i mean that's the fastest path to becoming a developer you know between 90 to 180 days if you work hard and you don't slack off you can actually get a job as a developer and so we're going to talk about the exact roadmap how you can step by step get to that level and get a job if that sounds exciting drop it in the comments or the chats or somewhere let me know you're excited with that said let's just get right into it so i'll share my screen

amazing knowledge on how to become a front developer let's get started beautiful so here's the front end developer guide for 2021 you guys so uh oh oh yeah 2022 we're apparently in the future so that's incredible that's incredible um okay cool let's rock and roll about this guide okay so yeah smash that like button and subscribe okay be smart do the right thing it'll help us out a lot so let's go over what is the agenda guys day one we're gonna which is today okay today wednesday and this challenge will end on sunday so day one we're gonna be doing the front end developer guide and exactly what you can do to crush it next year because the next year is on upon us right it's almost here uh day two through four so day two three and four what you're going to be doing is you're going to be building the uber clone with next.js react.js tailwind and firebase yes this is this is the sauciest okay the sauciest clone you'll build right between technologies like react to next yes now guys which is like the new up and coming you know react.js technology that you that a lot of people are learning and a lot of companies getting into yes building you know an amazing application that looks beautiful you'll learn how to design you'll learn how to build something from scratch is the most important thing and you will also be able to put that on your portfolio absolutely remember this is a five day challenge you guys so day one through five we're going to be bringing you massive value for everybody that's on zoom with us turn on your cameras we want to see all of your beautiful faces i'm looking at you guys and i love seeing that albert keeps waving i love it day five your road map to becoming a frontend developer in 90 days who here would like to learn how you can get the skills to become a frontend developer in 90 days give me a raise of hands beautiful we have a ton of people talking about four years here four years of college no we're just talking about 90 days because if you learn the right skills right now the right technologies you can get things a lot done a lot faster absolutely and i just want to keep prefacing this with a huge disclaimer the huge disclaimer of hard work okay so that is what is dependent on your hard work blood sweat equity right towards your dream of becoming a developer so let's get rocking and rolling um now this is what we're gonna be doing on day two to four right this is what you're gonna be building this is gonna be the login page you're going to build you're going to build a home page you're going to build this page and then you're going to build the confirm ride page so guys how good does this look right i mean look at this we've got by the way the login is not just login the login is sign in with google so you know you'll actually be able to click on it it will give you a google prompt you'll select your email then once you get the homepage you can see the righthand side it will actually have your username and your profile picture right so it knows who you are at this point yeah then you can click ride or you know two wheels whatever you want to click on you can actually enter a real yes a real address and then it will plot those two addresses and then calculate what is the price for an uber ride for those two at between the two addresses that is pretty cool i would say absolutely so we're gonna make sure that you have all of that okay now if you're a complete beginner you're like oh my god i'm gonna be way in over my head that's okay we're gonna take it slow we're going to build it step by step you're going to have the recorded video to watch and even if you feel a little bit like oh my god it's overwhelming we have a whole community around you to help you but remember if you take this project and you put it on your portfolio man it's going to make your portfolio look so damn good right it's going to make it look so damn good also we're going to be giving you a free portfolio who would like a free portfolio tonight raise your hands nice okay amazing so we're going to be giving you a portfolio and our goal is that over the coming days when you build this uber project you can put it on your portfolio okay that's our goal and we're going to be giving all of this uh to you for free okay that's right and so later on guys when you actually finish the project you're about to put on your portfolio and you know and then give it out to potential recruiters yes exactly um we've had this happen where multiple times where students will build a project just from watching our videos we'll put on their portfolio and there's so many times they'll either get recruiters to hit them up they'll get interviews and some of them have even gotten jobs so but all i ask for you whoever is watching this right now on youtube and on zoom please take it seriously okay because we're gonna give you our 110 we would really appreciate if you're like hey i'm gonna take advantage of this opportunity sounds good guys beautiful beautiful let's keep uh going so stick to the end of day five we have something special coming up for you okay this is going to be absolutely incredible we've been working on this program for a while and our goal is to be able to release it on that day for you guys so it's going to be something awesome it's going to be super valuable and that's kind of all we're going to say about it and we'll let you know on day five cool let's keep going so let's get started with today's training okay and what we're going to be doing so let's start off with this this is according to glassdoor here is an average frontend developer salary okay an average frontend developer makes 87 000 a year who here would like to be making 87 000 a year yeah i mean that that's not bad that's a pretty good league right they say an average a person who can make around 90 000 that's that's like your epic happiness in terms of especially like for one person in terms of being able to afford a lot of different things right but just be clear right guys this is yes it says 87 thousand dollars that's great but you know that's not for everybody right it really depends on where your clash your location is if you live in summer like california it's a lot higher right if you live somewhere for example that's much cheaper it might be even lower right so right just clear it's it varies right it varies and it varies on your skill level and all of those things right so junior developers might make 40 000 or 30 000 a year but let me ask you guys this right one of the things that's super important for everybody to know and be aware of is like look we're we're all at a different level right but what's your level of happiness where you feel happy not everybody needs to make six figures like i don't need to be a billionaire for me to be happy so for you guys what's your threshold like of where you feel like you'll be living a peaceful life that you enjoy and that's the number that makes you happy drop that in the comments below and i want to see that and and don't let other people persuade you right for some of you might be like hey if i just make literally 28 000 a year working as a developer remotely while being a digital nomad in bali like that's the freaking dream right so so drop your numbers below and i want to see where you guys are at some of you might be like 46 000. some of you will like six figures but just stay true to yourself so i'm gonna start seeing it in the chat uh coming through um 150k we've got somebody 60k 165k something 500k damn dallas that's i mean that's pretty good that's pretty good you know yeah beautiful beautiful plus says 70k carlos 165k yeah 80k winners is 70k see you so like this computer peter on youtube says 90k uh brian says just enough 90k my micro size around 100k would be good okay beautiful um yeah so look everybody has a different goal that's totally fine like look if you're working at netflix those guys are making like 200 to 300 000 a year but it's not easy to get at netflix right you have to be really freaking good to get at netflix so again and sometimes too at the same time like you know people just don't want to work at a big company like that like i know someone you know who i personally have worked with previously who's worked like even amazon right i know him personally and he's like yeah yeah man you know i went to amazon i worked with them for like two weeks night and then i just quit yeah like it you know so really depends um the most important thing here guys is just learn the skill this skill that you will be learning here in terms of developer developer you know developer skill that is you can take that anywhere no matter what you want that is the value here if you get really good you can even take it to the bank let's move on so here is indeed right and i'm gonna try to move faster through some of these so there's tons of job openings my my goal to show you this is not just to go oh my god you're gonna become rich like tomorrow my goal is to just show you guys that there's a lot of opportunity regardless of even what's going on on the planet right now if you learn these skills they are not just for today but they're for tomorrow and the day after that and the year after that because coding and development is not going away and even with the whole new space of nfts and blockchain and crypto and all of that craziness is happening we're seeing some of our coding boot camp students like joshua hua interviewed a few days ago he came to our coding boot camp and he ended up landing a job at a crypto uh company and that company's called teller tellor and so there's tons of opportunity right like even that space is gonna need developers for tomorrow and that space is blowing up but yeah i mean it's like tons of job openings are available right this second for front end developers so this is just to show you guys like hey there's a lot that's happening here and it will keep growing that's the that's the coolest part about it too absolutely now let's touch base on the differences between front end and back end okay so front end and back end like you know there's so much jargon have you guys ever heard a frontend backend you know i know there's some people who are intermediate i know some people are beginners so jeff says that he has dakota says that he has cool we're seeing a lot of text messages coming in yes yes yes yes yes cool awesome um so basically um you know it seems like you guys are aware of it but in simple terms front end is all the pretty stuff that you see that's visible or that you feel when you click things and click buttons and back end is like think about google search algorithm how it's able to like quickly find all these things or when you go to instagram and how all the posts are stored somewhere right like when you refresh instagram it's not like all the posts just vanish they're still there exactly exactly that that would not be a good user experience otherwise i wouldn't say that yeah like hey all the posts vanish every single time so now you might be asking what do i need to know to become a frontend developer in 2022 so let's um talk about it have have you guys ever seen any graphs like this by the way you know when you think about becoming a frontend developer either raise your hands or drop it in the chat or show it somewhere anybody seen those yeah oh nice alejandra gomez is a boot camp grad nice did the front end track so we got a ton of people have seen graphs like this okay but let me let me tell you guys something nasa what would you say about graphs like this and let's keep it pg because we don't want youtube to demonetize us i think they are nice thank you we do our own editing you guys is that is that pg enough for you so a lot of these graphs are not a representation of reality okay and that's like a understatement you know if i could be off of this i would say it in a much more um harsher way or whatever but like this is not really the reality right like for example i don't even know what this thing's stylus is but like i'm a developer yeah and it's the thing is like you know it's you know everybody says that so you all need to learn all these different things to actually get a job and to a lot of people i know to a lot of you guys probably it feels like that like you know if i don't know all these things i can't get the job done right but the thing is that's not the case right even if you know just one little tidbit off of that structure of that graph right even just one little tidbit that already is a value for the company already gives you the value to be able to go out to companies and to provide value to them right yes so this graph yes it's immense and there's probably people who know all this stuff as well right but to actually be able to get into the space this is not what you'll have to learn right we actually have a much better perspective on it so for example right like if you're looking at this html css javascript it's like look jquery is already like pretty outdated most i mean there's still some companies using it but like you can get jobs without ever knowing jquery you know without ever writing that weird dollar sign looking thing that i used to have to write and i used to think it was awesome um like you don't for example i learned jquery probably like three years or four years into my coding career personally honestly like right so it's like so when nasa is saying you need to know a little bit of it like for example you might not need to know all this testing and all this other stuff but like if you know javascript really freaking well you can actually go and get jobs true true right if you know javascript and if you know certain things on top of it but as a frontend developer like certain things that are going to be key when i think about it is i'm thinking html css javascript right i'm thinking like you probably need to know um you probably need to so css allows you to style we'll talk about that later you know pick any of these like you might just need to know one of these like bootstrap okay and with just even those few things i talked about you can build a lot of things you can build fullon frontend websites yeah and there's for example even like you know a student of ours uh our student who was actually here uh you know asked well do you somebody has told me that you need to learn typescript before you learn javascript right you know like that's not even the case right most companies don't even care if you learn typescript honestly like i didn't even know tyscript until probably two years ago and i've been coding for the past 10 years right so um you know it's like a nice to have like you have to look at what the core things you need to learn that really teach you the coding perspective right it's like it's like i like to think about it's about building a house it's like when you build a house you have to build the foundation yeah right and so in our cases there's only a few foundations that you need to learn but then you can have all the nice decorations you know all the beautiful things all the colors you can paint your walls as much as possible that's the other stuff that's not as important you know and we'll talk about exactly what is that core moving forward absolutely um so yeah let's keep on going it was so slick amanoth asked me to make him the cohost and i just it was so smooth how i did and i just transitioned back to zoom like that was cool all right let's keep going boom exactly yeah that transition this exact thing that came to my mind that's just what happened how you transitioned okay cool so let's keep on going so now let's simplify the process so it becomes easier for every single one of you okay um i'm looking at the youtube comments as well and they're like javascript is the cake if you have the foundations employers want the cake then the framework styling and projects are cherry most interviews will see if you have javascript down so lax lifter said this on the youtube um and yeah that's that's money what he just said okay yeah so now it's like let's talk about what's your end goal all right and it's get a job as a frontend developer that was awesome that was so cool that wasn't right the way it just the way it just came out nice animation amano guys ahmad made these slides let's give it up for him i don't care if you're on mute just give it up give it up i want to see people clapping there we go we got fabio and anthony and albert and everybody yeah that's what i'm talking about beautiful yeah thank you just say amanoth you're amazing in the chat guys yeah you're the man look paul gonzalez said i just graduated from general general assembly about two weeks ago i'm already getting interviews and rejections to go along to anyone reading this who is planning on moving into a career into the space listen to what they're saying right now then he went on and said other things which are really hard to read because we got so many messages coming through but yeah yeah awesome congratulations by the way and yeah you stay at it most importantly he says like learn one language and learn it well don't get caught up in the tutorial hell get strong with the business and that will help you so much that's the most important thing he's talking about awesome yeah i agree i agree uh any any one of you that wants to join zoom guys tomorrow we're going to be doing it again um day two three four of the challenge and five you know click the link in the description among us uh can you please on youtube put a link to the challenge page so people can sign up so then tomorrow you can get an invitation to jump into the zoom cool let's uh let's rock and roll okay so tons of opportunities here right front end developer like okay i'm gonna wrap it fire through this who here would like to work as a remote developer making potentially 50 an hour raise your hands cool okay so we have some people who would like to work as a remote developer who here would like to work as a salary okay i want to talk about his lifestyles too like how would you want to do it so between a remote developer and a fulltime developer in person which side you guys feel like you fall on freelance remote remote nice salary salary remote dev remote dev okay let me ask you another way full time versus freelance i want to start seeing chats coming through full time versus freelancers or maybe you want to try both freelance freelancers maybe you don't try both yeah can we get polls going thank you for the donation on youtube you have to make me a wholesaler unfortunately um oh dude don't make me a host because if you make me a host then you can't share it okay cool no it's all good you made someone else a cohost and not me oh lol um so maybe i was not as smooth as i thought i was okay who is the ghost i'm bad ah i'll find them i don't know i'll give up that's fine so we have a it seems like we have a split between freelance and fulltime even on youtube we have freelance and fulltime makes sense it's all good uh both are really really great one is more about safety so you know when you think freelance you know you i think freelance you have to be a little bit more um you know if you're if you're riskaverse then fulltime is probably gonna be better because there's less risk you have essentially one client that's guaranteeing that you're going to have a job with them for a extended period of time freelance you know they can use you and then they can you know if they don't need you for the next months then that's that but you get to kind of be your own boss so there's there's both sides to it um cool yeah and then yeah and then there's tons of opportunities right i'm just showing you guys this you guys see again what's possible okay this is not so you'll get this tomorrow that's not what this is about yeah no no definitely here the key here guys is patience you need to start coding and start applying so what does this mean let's dive in okay let's talk about the fundamentals so when it comes to the fundamentals most people are you know there's all kinds of confusion going on on the internet um you know we're kind of part of that confusion on the internet too which is like we're showing you you know all these like hot frameworks and amazing things and i think that's cool right i think there's a lot of bells and whistles there it catches people's attention it's exciting but like you guys came here for the truth so we want to give you that you know so like the real thing is learn these three things that are in front of you really freaking well and these three things are one can you guys actually tell us so number one is i'm gonna give you five seconds i think you guys think five html the second one is css and the third one is javascript script beautiful so these are the three things and if you just learn these extremely well like extremely well you can have a lot of job opportunities available because even when if you listen to like nasa's story right and we don't have to get into the whole thing but like he got a job doing react and he actually didn't know any react at the time it was like he was a python developer but just a really good python developer yeah i'm just a really good developer in general in terms of i knew my core knowledge right i knew how to solve problems that's the key here right and then because of that i literally told the employer like listen i am not going to be your reactive i'm not a reg developer yet but i will learn it all of it fast and most importantly i could just solve a lot of problems for you so um with that said you know even though i failed all of his exams all his tests that he gave me um i still got the job somehow so there you go yeah seriously so um the main thing was that he failed the test right but he knew uh coding he failed the react tests because he didn't know react but they still hired him and they were able to teach him react because react builds on top of the fundamentals of core computer science and programming concepts and that nas knew really well okay so does that make sense guys like that understanding the core concepts and fundamentals is like the main thing right and everything on top of it is like cherry does that make sense can i get a thumbs up if that makes sense to you guys tammy thumbs up chris beautiful melissa fabio okay nice awesome anthony garcia in the chat garcia jesse gracie says devlop's queen here just be a quick learner you all got this i love these bits thank you thank you appreciate it beautiful and lax lifters commented and he said um you know companies will also pay you to learn if you have solid fundamentals your first two months can be paid training right so that's huge so when we talk about what these things are when we talk about html and we talk about css and we talk about javascript and sometimes it's confusing for people like what these things actually are html is really just a structure so you can think of it like the skeleton okay um it's like your skeleton what makes your body all right so it's the tables and the and the head tags and the you know the h1s and h2s if you guys have looked into it this is what the structure overall is so when you go to a landing page where's the headline where's the call to action button exactly exactly now your css for example is like your clothes right so example peter right you've got the headphones i'm guessing you probably got you know you've got a shirt on everything that's your css right it is what kind of you know uh that's the things you put on on yourself right now that's you know that's kind of i know if you compared to a website you know that's how a website looks beautiful otherwise it will look like i don't want to say it but crap right yeah um now portion however the javascript portion that is your movement right that's your dancing you know you're dancing you're having fun you know that is it is your brain that tells everything what to do so if you're going to a website for example right and on the website you click on buttons or you see some things happening you see interactions right for example when you click when you go to google you type in you know you type in your search and then you click google search and then you have the search results all that's happening through javascript guys right so yes there's a javascript portion of it yep so that's the javascript portion and it's that's what adds the dynamism that's when you click things and they load fast when you're on instagram right and you're scrolling and like when you go all the way to the bottom it does this little loading thing right and it loads more you have to like click a button and go to the next page that's like a fancy javascript concept you know and it's like a web development console which is known as like lazy loading and so that's where javascript and more dynamic things are coming into play okay when you hit the heart button or you double tap a post on instagram and it hurts it that's javascript okay um so cool i guess let me ask you guys these okay and you tell me which one it is is it html css or javascript so when you're on instagram okay and the background of a page is colored white okay it's colored white or it's colored black let me know what that is okay nice okay cool a lot responding good good job let me ask you something else so that's just a great job on that okay that's css let's make sure we get we give the actual thing yeah yes yes guys that's correct that's css everybody good job guys okay absolutely okay now let me ask you guys this okay if you go on to um those like old professor sites um that they would put up their homework for like a cs 151 class and it's like 1990s you know what is that mainly yes yes yes yes so we got ton of people saying it sam says sam says myspace that's so true okay i've actually got a trick one for you guys okay yes that's right it is html i gotta trick them for you you know how sometimes when you go somewhere let's just say you go on instagram or even go to google and you have like a loading icon like it's like loading it's like turning it's like turning right yeah so it's doing something what do you guys think that is because that's a trick question oh it is a trick question because a lot of people are saying it was javascript but actually it could be javascript but actually it's even css because with css you can actually make things turn as well so yeah yeah we're yeah we're tricking them now a little bit nice but yeah exactly so that that one is a little tricky one so i like that one uh now let me ask you guys another one when you guys uh let's say like a post right or you delete a post on instagram what is that is that html css or javascript happening boom we just got so many javascripts coming through beautiful awesome so great so you guys are you know hopefully getting a little bit of understanding of where they work and um what's happening so if you said javascript that was absolutely right let's move on so when we talk about html this is what html looks like okay um this is just htm so it's html here and then you know this is a heading where which line of code is this coming from say the number of the line in here that that is coming from boom even i don't know okay let's see it now beautiful um guys it is not number six you are wrong at this one nah he's lying just kidding yeah he's trying to trick you guys so there you go it is number six okay beautiful um so line number six is getting you this okay now what is getting you this this is a paragraph i mean this should be really easy so you guys should say it very fast beautiful this is coming from line seven okay line seven gets you this okay very simple all of the other stuff is just for fun um just kidding so that's kind of the overall structure of a html thing in the start it can look like a little intimidating but once you get used to it that's how html thing is usually structured cool that's right okay awesome let's go on to looking at a few more things okay so here is um we have some html inside of like javascript or we have some styling going on here actually right so take a look at this do you guys see do you guys notice where the html is with those tags here with the tags like that right so these this is all html now let me ask you guys this what do you think this part is beautiful yeah that's right it is the css that's right but there's a specific who can get who can tell me the specific word what type of css because there is actually a type of css what type of css is this one oh looks like we got who can who fancy in mean god this anthony got this that's right radula got this yes benjamin got this that's right it's called inline css guys yes exactly it's in line with actual html usually you'd have css outside in different file called a dot css file yes in this case it's in line with css and with html and another question okay this ugly green background which line of of the css is getting us this which line on the page is getting us this beautiful seeing a lot of people come through yes so line seven gets us this okay cool so it seems like you guys understand that okay and the font style where's the font style coming from real quick what line beautiful so line seven was the background and line six is the font so good job everybody nice okay damn they're all pros bro what are we doing here yeah you guys teach it we're leaving um cool so that's what's happening here okay so the console.log so this is now javascript okay it's the simplest javascript thing you could ever run console log hello and it says hello okay that's just javascript that's all that's happening here okay let's move on now you might be wondering like where can i learn these technologies of course some of you have already mentioned different resources somebody said linkedin learning there are a bunch of other resources that you can go online one of the resources we would recommend that you check out is we have tons and tons of content on youtube it's absolutely free enjoy it watch it it's hours and hours of training so you guys can go and bookmark it uh devlin says such a pretty face thank you so much i appreciate it um that boosts my selfesteem so thank you um in the last picture i'm very sad i don't know why but i'm really sad in the last one but i promise you it's a very exciting free course on javascript okay i love that still even though you know even though you're sad you know yeah yeah i think maybe you're sad because you know you had to spend a lot of time making it yeah it's been just really tired in the end the reason why i'm actually sad is i did a thumbnail a b test and this thumbnail where i was sadder one compared to the other thumbnails so i don't know why youtube did that but that's the real truth okay yeah so it was just so we can get more clicks on this so we can teach more people online okay so yeah there we go cool so check out those resources now did you guys know javascript completed its ninth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language according to stack overflow no way really flex that is flex did you flip java javascript needs to have an nft javascript used to have oh don't say this out loud bro we need to launch these nft projects outside of class no this is a great idea if somebody wants to take that go for it javascript nfts would be awesome i agree with that one so going through this right this is according to stack overflow one of the most favorite technologies of most developers and this is from 58 000 responses is javascript right and then right behind is html css okay now i know somebody's gonna be commenting but don't start a programming language i don't i don't want to fight you i don't care it's i love you if you're watching this i love you regardless oh god you're wrong there's no no you know this is not right you're not doing this rightly no yeah that's look javascript is a programming language html and css are not programming languages there you go okay all right cool now what's next all right you need to learn a frontend framework on top of javascript so that's why we're talking about react and teaching you guys these things okay so frameworks there's the react logo frameworks are very simple do you guys want to take a shot at what a framework is drop it in the comments or or chat and let me know what you think a framework is okay let's see if you know like what is it guys don't don't give us the frameworks but right i know people in the comments also they're gonna be like react as a library and i knew that but like i know people are going to be going crazy about that but but just give me what a library slash framework is okay yeah yeah yeah gracie was like yeah they on it i actually like it gracie was like it's code that's been written for you that's actually not a bad explanation yeah so i see a lot of your guys's like explanations coming in that's great somebody says set of rules library reuse code templates consolidated yeah i like it a lot of it is it's yeah i mean i love that gracie explanation it's so simple it's code that's written for you essentially and then it makes your life a lot easier so if you use react it makes it so much easier to do the things that you want to do compared to like when you try to do it with just vanilla javascript it's much much harder actually um and so react will make your life way easier you know that's why we recommend it there are other frameworks out there too like angular vue.js and you can learn all of those there's svelt which is really good uh there's ember alpine js and a ton of others okay yes but according to stack overflow survey react.js is now the most popular web framework surpassing even jquery so it's taken it over okay so it's the most popular framework and that's kind of why we want to cover it because i think it'll help the most amount of people and why do we because a lot of people like why do you guys care so much about popularity because we care about your results and and job demand and job demand right like we could be teaching you svelte it's pretty cool and it's pretty fun but not all these jobs are gonna be like hiring for svelte so then your like pool becomes a lot smaller and it becomes much more competitive whereas like react there's way more demand than there's like supply of developers and so we want to like help you and produce more developers that fulfill that demand if that makes sense you know what's funny actually i started out with angular when i was first starting out with in in web development and then i actually moved to react because i had a you know a few more job offers that were in react yes so there you go uh okay i see so uh yeah you love money yeah okay awesome so no that's that's smart that's smart and i mean for most developers right your career matters like you work for money right that's the whole point you're exchanging your time for a dollar currency value so you might as well you know do it in a beneficial way yeah of course cool so web frameworks right here we have all these web frameworks and react is the number one as you guys can see so it's a good one that you guys should learn should use and if you're a complete beginner right now you know it's like hey just focus on html css javascript and then learn react on top of it that's going to be the best path for you to kind of learn all this okay now here are the companies right that are using these types of you know that are using javascript and react and airbnb instagram facebook skype netflix dropbox and and twitter you know and the list just goes on so there are massive companies that are powered by these technologies yeah especially i mean all these technologies technically even use react.js right so you know between facebook to dropbox and netflix in some sort of way they're using that technology either on the front of the website right or even in their application for example if you guys know tesla anybody here know tesla anybody yeah there we go nathaniel yeah there you go all right so everybody of course the car company right but if you guys don't know but their main application right uh that you use on your phone to actually even open your car like literally you can you know the the phone opens your car it's the key to your car it's usually for example react technology it's used something called react native yeah right so that right there is just such a big opportunity you know if you learn the technology you can use it in so many places absolutely absolutely and facebook invented react yeah but what is facebook i don't even know what that is that's not a company yeah it's meta it's meta now it's not facebook yeah it's meta uh well were you guys like how did you guys feel about the the mark zuckerberg's like announcement on it like were you guys excited or are you guys more mostly like creeped out like what what was your guys's uh yeah say it's not facebook no more it is meta confusion all right i mean damn what do you i mean okay hold on what do you guys think about what we're sharing with you so far please be nice i love it okay awesome thank you anthony is like five dollars i appreciate it appreciate it thank you all right we're gonna keep rocking and rolling so you guys keep getting more and more value okay so now let's talk about your next steps huh okay um you guys are gonna get what i mean in a little bit um some of you have already probably gotten that okay cool so learn a css preprocessor framework okay so there's other types of things you can use with css so for example tailwind the logo that we just popped up at the top left is a really nice thing to learn and and have an understanding of because it'll make writing your css a lot easier and it won't just look like your website is made out of bootstrap so it'll be nice from a design perspective and making your design more unique the next thing that you can learn is bootstrap okay so that's also really good sass bunch of other stuff style components which are super awesome when you're using react that make your code so much easier and easier to read and you don't need these extra css files that's personally how i like to code in react i don't like to have all these extra css files i haven't even used a css file in a while actually my with react my javascript html and css essentially just live in one javascript file so it's yeah it's really nice and it makes it easy for me to process and you guys will actually be able to see that you know starting tomorrow because we will be using one of these technologies tail and css together kind of a style components to put css into your javascript so it's gonna be really cool it's probably something you haven't seen before so stay tuned yeah i heard like somebody said fang is now changed to manga because facebook is now uh meta oh snap son we got frank in the house frank ramos just dropped the 20 donation yo guys let's give it up for frank ramos thank you so much brother we appreciate it wow wow wow we got his donation is 19.99 yeah thank you bro i appreciate it you know much love and nice seeing you after a while um all right cool i'm happy about that here is a material ui material ui is a great one to learn as well you don't have to learn all of these by the way uh just a few of them are like pretty good like for example if you want to just pick up tailwind you can just pick up tailwind now word of precaution for all of you for people who are beginners which are a majority of you on this call um just learn css first okay like just like learn css first you know watch my battle with nas no i'm kidding just like learn the basics of css and then build on top of it okay just like remember how javascript you learn javascript and then you learn react on top of it just learn css first and then learn any of these other things on top of it because if you try to just go to styled components like without learning css you're going to be very confused or if you go to like tailwind you're going to be very confused because you'll be like oh this nice thing i can just write in like px10 but you won't understand that that's like padding you know horizontal or padding vertical whatever 10 and you'll be like what's padding you know go to css to learn that so i think the better way to learn is learn css first yeah and then all the all these other things will be a lot easier for you guys to understand absolutely absolutely next up my beautiful people is going to be learning get version control okay whoops one is so important guys so important right so any developer when you go into any job they will expect you guys to learn this right and anybody here knows what exactly is it and what is it used for i'm curious put that on the chat right and and what i would recommend is you guys take notes on it because i think this is going to set you up for the rest of the year actually so like make sure that if you weren't already like you know bring a notebook or something and like write it down so you're not distracted and and take notes on this so so you have this exact outline with you and anthony just got up to seems like he to get his book or notebook albert just got up nice cool yeah but looks like reuben is doing something there too so yeah that's beautiful nice job ruben already has it reuben came prepared nathaniel came prepared let's go sam sam came prepared nice he's always prepared sorry we if we lola says you know git was used to see different versions of your code remotely that's actually a really good way you know it's kind of like yeah you know kazi you know you say it so i'm going to steal your line yeah but that's fine but it's like dropbox for coding right it's like dropbox for your code yes imagine if you were to work if ruby for example if you were to work with joe for example right you know you guys might work on the same project but how do you keep the project in check right maybe ruben you're working on one on the login page joe you're working potentially on the you know the home page right you need to have some sort of way where you guys sync those projects together well yes and it comes in git and github absolutely yeah so this is um what nas said is like really really just on the money right i think he he said it brilliantly um and you know the way it it's just like a you know what not said also is it's a time machine and if you messed up if you're like just imagine i'll start with the simplest way of it right it's a time machine for your code and it allows you if you if you guys any anybody here plays video games raise your hands you know and you've experienced what a checkpoint is right so in video games you have these checkpoints and you can save and then you can come back and you can even roll back sometimes to different checkpoints just like that for your code you could have different checkpoints and then you're like oh my app is just now like let's say you build the login page and now all of a sudden your app just broke we just go back in time to when it wasn't broken anymore and then start from there again um and whatnot said allows you to collaborate and build things together with other developers okay so it's going to be really important to learn just make sure you have it in your roadmap like git is going to be a key thing to learn like for example you probably don't need to learn style components to get a job but i think like git is going to be a very important component when you need to get a job because they're going to want to you know be able to see that you can work with other developers because if you don't do this you really can't work with other developers yeah and jonathan for example said you know my problems understanding how to use it right and if you're of course you know sometimes it does feel a bit confusing and how this works right honestly there's a lot of like you know tutorials that told you tell you all these things about how to use kit and all these different ways to use kit but if you just simplify it to three four functionalities for example you can write this down guys i was gonna say this too actually that's perfect go for it yeah so like for example like git push right get a pool can i give them an order yeah go ahead okay so write this down in this order this is going to be really helpful okay number one get init right frank just made another 50 donation let's go what the hell yo frank let's go thank you brother wow a 50 donation that is crazy and then we've got tamiya who's talking about our donation thank you so much appreciate it that is amazing thank you i'm getting excited you guys are giving me so much life i'm super excited thank you guys uh man just the last few weeks have been tough so thank you guys uh it means a lot means the world we appreciate you so much seriously wow another freaking donation by dante and he goes let's go thank you for sharing your valuable knowledge guys and he just gave us 200 something mexican i think it's mexi i think it's pesos pesos okay yes 200 not 200 yeah okay 200 pesos got it not 200 mexicans 200 pesos we understand like mexican like dollars you know i just thought i didn't know how to say exactly yeah yeah yeah okay because it's just mx so thank you so much for that really appreciate it so going back to the version control right it's really important for you to learn it so here are the commands i'm sorry i'm sorry let's get back to it number one get in it that's number one okay that will like start your like git project in most cases okay number number two get space add space dot so git add dot okay get add dot all right that's the second one the third one is git commit dash m followed by whatever your message is okay so um maybe i could actually type it out it will start to get deleted as i type it out i guess yeah that's still weird that was weird where did my you have to click x click escape there we go okay cool that's the weird part about it so how about this maybe we can just put it in the in the chat so like let's just put that in the chat so like get i'll do it i'll do it i'll do it okay you got it right yeah okay awesome so yeah so git uh space commit space dash m space just whatever your message is okay um cool and then that's number three and nas is adding all the one two right and make sure the g is lowercased yeah yeah sorry because it does automatically cool uh and the fourth one is going to be get push origin master okay git push origin master i know right now you're like what the hell are these why am i memorizing them it's it's not so you can memorize it so you can know that that's 99 of git like you do that you're pretty much good 99 percent of the times there's other donations sorry for gone it says thank you guys for all i support you from beginning of the road beginning to end big fans appreciate all the time and we'll keep up the good work yo thank you appreciate it really really appreciate it thank you so much uh super super awesome yep um so those are the the four main ones that are gonna be absolutely amazing and then i'm just gonna give you like two other ones that i think you should just write it down the reason why i'm giving this to you is here's what's gonna happen you're not gonna write them down right now and you're gonna be like that's fine i'll learn git later you're going to be so freaking confused because whenever you go to look up anything about git they're going to just like destroy your brain with so much complexity and they're going to be like giving you all these commands with all these flags and branches and checkouts and rebasing and you're like i don't need to know these things right now you're like what are the main things do i need to just be able to do all of this with that's what i'm giving you okay the last two um is git clone have that written down that's going to be needed for you like that's yeah that's going to be needed okay so git clone and then uh the last one is get pull origin master okay get pull origin master so if you have these five or six commands that i've given you and you just re you you don't have to memorize and just write them down somewhere this is it that's it like 99 of what you need to do you'll be able to do it you'll be able to like get a pro download a project you'll be able to like write code you'll be able to commit it aka checkpoints you'll be able to push it pushing all it does is it's just putting it on dropbox okay or just putting it on um you know drop box of code which is github okay yeah cool gigi ishan and youtube says you can pretty much learn git in like an hour yeah you know once i probably guess is just start to use it start out simply by just using it with like something like get in it and you'll see right away things happen you just have to start using it because the hardest thing is there's probably fear in trying to get into it yes that's the biggest thing you're right now that's the biggest fear that stops specially beginners and like you don't want to touch it i know let me ask you who is afraid of get raise your freaking hands and drop it in the comments who's afraid of git so many people have this exactly see see yeah we got tons of hands going up right people saying me me me yeah carlos is like lmao me uh daniel says i yeah um so that's what i'm saying it's scary but like if you just know that there are like three commands but my work when i'm working when i'm actually coding up a project i'm literally just doing git add dot like git add git commit get pushed get ad get commit get pushed get ad get commit get pushed get out get commit get pushed it's like three commands i'm just doing them again and again and again and again and again for like 10 hours as i'm doing my coding project like it's the easiest workflow once you get it it's just the initial fear that's going to stop you so my urge to use like overcome that fear and just like get into it those are the few commands that i we gave you that are the holy grail of all of git and then anything else is just like extra complex stuff that you'll you'll just pick it up as you go thanks very agree they're critical cool so uh what i want to show you guys is this okay keynote is weird uh is this so this logo over here which do you guys know which logo this is here on the left hand side what is it so on the lefthand side this is good that's right this is git this is get over here and what's this logo right over here do you guys know okay beautiful they already knew what i was gonna do next wow beautiful mine man yeah that was awesome so this is github git github they are uh let me ask you guys are they the same thing or are they very similar are they like the same thing git and github git and github are not the same thing it's a very common confusion that a lot of people have they are different okay github is dropbox for your code the simplest way i can put it yes it's like google or if you don't know dropbox like google drive for your code it's like where you're putting your code online yeah it's like it's a remote right while git the lefthand side as you guys see that's your version control that is what's going to keep track of all the changes so for example let's just say you make a small change you add a button you make that into a change it will keep track of that yes they'll say maybe you add a background you know a background image or a background photo boom that's a change you keep track of that yes so it will keep track track of those changes locally so you can always you know like time machine and like i just said you know in terms of a time machine you can always go back and forth but in order for other people to use it right to see it right for example like your you know the people you work with then you would push it to github that's the big differentiation absolutely exactly um so let's keep going and yeah git lab is i see some people talking about git lab git lab is like github git lab is um like another place like google drive where you can put your code there's bitbucket too there's a bunch of places where you could put your code okay all right now we're gonna get into some more like complicated stuff so this is like gonna be the in the next part of your journey so write this down guys it's server side rendering okay so what the heck is server side rendering and here's an example of it now do you want to take a shot at explaining what this is yes i will take a shot but before i do that i just want to say thank you so much for appall for paul for another generation thank you you for helping us change our lives of course that's where we're here this is sick we need to be going live at 5 00 p.m every day i know i realize that too this is awesome wow beautiful so servers are rendering guys right right with react.js for example you know if you look at for example google or let's just say you go on facebook okay when you go on facebook anybody here ever see that when you go on facebook the first thing it loads is probably your header and then it kind of loads your post right after anybody here see that like you know did you guys notice that by any chance when you go to facebook well yes that's right that's because you know it renders the things you know on the client side that's right it runs thing on the client side so basically you know it takes time after your page is loaded to load other things however with server side rendering it's basically like you are sh rendering your your creating all the posts behind the scenes and then just slapping on it to be for people to see well it's kind of like that's right so in this case for example the the server for example is cooking noodles right the actual server yeah right then the noodles already cooked and those cooked noodles are already shown to you ah beautiful that's right versus for example in react g.s right not xgs you would actually be still you would still be cooking the noodles while you're on the page uh okay you see what i mean that's the big difference so basically like so basically before it's almost like the client or me if i'm logging into facebook i'm doing the work of loading it exactly right whereas now it's almost like facebook is doing the work of loading it before i even get there it's ready to go exactly and the reason why that's so much better is because then pages low a lot faster it's like all your posts have already been preloaded right they've already been preloaded all it is is just a bunch of html yes you're still right away for the user you see it really fast yes and then also here's a kicker guys listen up this it's really cool because then your seo or google loves you google love oh yeah rendered pages yeah that's why the people are starting to head towards that because it increases your optimization anybody here knows seo or what seo stands for raise your hand if you do raise your hand if you do no no okay so seo search engine optimization basically it's like you know the more the better your seo the higher up you will show uh on the actual google rankings so instead of you instead of your page being shown on the second page of google your page will be shown on the first page of google does that make sense everybody does that make sense yes got it good job awesome albert thank you god cool cool cool cool cool yeah so that is the big difference here server side and the create guys the crazy thing is that we're actually going to be learning we're going to be using serverside rendering actually in this uber clone so yeah so hopefully you guys are excited about that okay we're gonna try to make it as simple as possible for y'all i'm pumped awesome um okay cool apparently this was a video oh look at that clientside rendering oh yeah so this is kind of a cool um you know the way to show it is like before clientside rendering is like you make your own food yeah see as i was saying on the although all the way on the righthand side you're making your own food okay and then um on this side server side you're coming home to a chef that's making your food and they played it for you so basically the simplest way for you to remember it is server side is nice and it's going to help you and make things faster joe was like let's make some noodles i agree with and the types of websites this is better for is where there's a lot of user generated content okay so if there's user generated content it's better to go server side rendering if you have a static portfolio website where there's not anything happening and nothing will ever change and it's just set in stone and nobody can add anything new and there's no authentication and there's no you should go with let me ask you which one should you go with so you have static site option you have client side option you have server side option it's a little bit advanced if you're a complete beginner you have no idea it's totally okay you're in the right place don't worry i'm just throwing in some things to keep the intermediates a little bit happy you know so static site is the way to go okay static site is the way to go um cool all right let's uh keep rocking and rolling okay so you guys go ahead sorry i was gonna say on the right hand side you guys saw how that one was much faster and on the left hand side it's still loading right so like this is the difference here is on the right hand side the server has already done the work for you you know and then the before one is clientside and it's like you're doing the work so you can see the speed difference so like let me ask you guys right which experience would be better the one on the righthand side for you or the one on the lefthand side you know do you want to wait one second to have your app loaded or like four seconds yep boom got tons of people saying right yep exactly imagine just being the website trying to wait for it to load for like 10 seconds straight that's not a good experience you'll be like peace out so now the business implications of this right if you're a big company like let's imagine you're google or trello or facebook or some big company um going from four seconds going from four seconds to one second how much percentage improvement have you made like what x improvement have you made here i'm not a mathematician and i'm probably just going to round it up to something dumb but like you've improved it by almost three to four hundred percent right that's what you guys are dropping in the chat you've been through three to four hundred percent so if you improve google or facebook by 300 to 400 percent do you know what you've done well yeah i mean you imported by 75 percent around around that or improved some of the 75 right but it's like but but that reduction is massive massive right it's massive reduction that you've done and when you do that and you add that much improvement to something like now the user retention is gonna like almost double for facebook you know or close to that which means like now they're gonna make almost two times the money they made or one and a half times so it's like a huge increase these are simplified examples but but there's a huge like from a business perspective there's a huge value proposition to being able to do things like this and i hope that makes sense for you guys yeah and sam asked the question you know with service around does that mean that you know on the server it's going to be a heavy load as in the people need to spend more money on the server hardware well sometimes yes that is the case but the money spent on that hardware is a lot less than what you will earn right as if you spent it right you would earn a lot more yeah you know in terms of because there will be a lot more customers than you know of you just spending you know some some money on some hardware yes yeah that's that's a good way to put that so here is the most popular framework that is built on react that allows you to do server side rendering and that's the reason why it's blowing up so much and it's called next.js and this is the this is the framework that we kind of referenced a little bit earlier and you can see over here it's being downloaded about 1.8 million times and when that happens you know that that package is hot there's tons of community around it it also means there are tons of job opportunities i mean not all the time but most of the times it means like there's tons of job opportunities around this and now netflix and all a lot of big companies are switching over and starting using next and just keep in mind you still have to learn react it's built on top of react yes okay and it's very interesting actually frank in on youtube said walmart is implementing serverside rendering so it helps with a lot of ecommerce stores yes that's a great one actually yeah yeah uh yeah that's that's a really good one exactly so walmart is about to use it as well and yeah so let's go ahead joe says nextgs is dope yes it is all right and now if you're looking for a static you know more static framework um is gatsby that's a really good one for if you're trying to build like blazing fast portfolio sites and things like that gatsby's a good one to keep in mind your speed wise you're probably not ever going to beat it until maybe something else comes out but if you're doing some simple website that is static i would highly recommend to look into gatsby and then of course there's things like testing your application so you know the next step is when your application is done how do you test it and testing basically means if you have a login page you have a page that accepts payments right imagine if you're not testing it constantly well what if it breaks so let me ask you guys this right imagine you are uh kylie jenner and you just launched your new product and you know so many people hit our checkout page sometimes millions or billions of people hitting our checkout page where it will crash right but if you have millions of people hitting your checkout page and imagine it's not working how much will that cost kylie jenner a lot how much will that cost put up it will cost millions it will cost millions so let me ask you this would it make sense to have something that automatically tests that page constantly and it the second it ever goes down it alerts you right yeah what is that useful that's very useful i use i actually used it at uh an old company i used to work with um yeah they used you know they used all these different you know testing to make sure that and we've actually had a lot of times where you know literally at 5 00 p.m in at night we got an error whereas you know our payment was just wasn't working yeah and we were working on it from like 5 p.m till like 10 p.m yeah five hours straight like the developers were all just stuck didn't know what to do we had to figure out what was you know we know how to fix it yeah you know so yeah there's some you know that happens you know but it's important that we learn about it is faster than than later yes exactly i agree so yeah i mean there's tons of things uh so on the left hand side you have a testing thing called just on the top right you have cypress and you have mocha and you have selenium selenium is a popular one probably a lot of you have heard it uh they're all really good in their own way i think cyprus is really good for doing like where your mouse is moving and clicking things and opening things cyprus is pretty good for that just is really good for writing like unit tests so something to just keep in mind and again if you're a complete beginner right now you don't really need to worry that much about testing honestly you'll be fine it's just something to have on your roadmap that later you could learn it cool okay let's move on now you guys might be wondering hey how do i actually improve my frontend skills right like how do i what do i do next quasi no it's like how do i do it so there you go it's called no i'm just kidding so there are a couple of great resources here and one of the resources here is called dribble and this resource is really good for and it's dribble with three b's so that will throw you off guaranteed so i'm gonna repeat that it's dribble with three one two three b's so when you wanna type it in make sure you you find the right website and this website will have like modern designs websites and you can use these as inspiration to model something or build a new you know whether it's a portfolio or a new website you're building i think it's a really good idea okay so you could use this for inspiration so let's do that yeah and then not necessarily guys for like for copy you don't have to copy you know the actual website but you know i have done it where like i take you know i create something called a mood board so i take for example like you know one image another idea another idea and i just put a few things together and that creates like a unique style in itself right yes there's nothing wrong with that right the only way you can get an inspiration from it too exactly exactly that that that's you know so it's okay to do that that's that's what i want to say yeah yeah yeah that's smart yeah no yeah don't copy the exact thing that they have there but like you can use it to kind of model after it or get some inspiration after it or if you're gonna copy it you know you don't have to like make it a public thing you can just use it to practice and then keep it there and then modify it to be your own yes exactly cool so let's keep on rocking and rolling here so front end mentor okay this is another great service platform you can use it's it's free to use they have a paid version as well but most of you will be good on the free version most of you will be good on that and they're really good because you can pick so for example they even have it broken out by difficulty so here is a newbie project here is a junior project and here's an intermediate project right so you guys can go ahead and pick like a newbie one and it makes it really easy for you to follow it they'll even give you all the resources the graphics you might need and then you can try to make it look like that so they have interesting challenges you can do to improve your skill okay anybody here let me ask you guys this question a very serious question we ever just like tried to build a project and it looked like beep yeah not that great huh you know you're like i do not want to show this to my employer i don't know i want to show this to my mom or to my dad or to anybody you know you're proud of this that was great but you know you don't know how to show this this is where you know these companies do come in right they have designed these things for you because in the days developers sometimes we you know sometimes maybe we just don't want to design it right and so we sometimes maybe you just don't know how to design this kind of stuff but the more you learn from these designs the more you build it you kind of get a momentum on what it takes to build a website and then actually design just comes to you naturally after a certain point of time you just have to have to start building this and then you'll be building because imagine this if you build one project it looks amazing like for example you build one project from from the mentor now it looks amazing you're like holy moly i just done this would you be excited to build the second one yes or no yeah right yeah absolutely right and then you built that one and then would you be excited about the third one you're like wow looks so great yes you will of course right yeah so that's what we're trying to do here is you want to create the momentum and this will allow you to create a momentum not only for you to learn but to build beautiful products absolutely and by the way guys we're going to be giving homework at the end of the video or at the end of this training so stick around because that's going to be really important for you as you um compete in this project or in this challenge okay five day challenge cool so let's keep on going where am i clicking oh yeah look at that it's a video a month you killed it nice work buddy yeah so it's a nice website you know use it um and another thing you guys can do is be a part of the community right so we have a community which is a verified community super sick flex no big deal thank you amanda for getting us that green check mark he worked really hard for it um and you know join the clever programmer community guys
