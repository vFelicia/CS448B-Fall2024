lots of questions and we just want to be able to provide as much value as we can to you guys yes on what you could do to become a developer on your journey as a developer what that's going to look like we might get technical we might get mindset we just have so many things to discuss yeah with you guys and we just kind of want to have that platform for it oh yeah we'll definitely get that because that's that is for sure right that's gonna be the the really fun part of it let me say bye bye bye good bye so yeah we'll definitely get technical that's me the really fun part about this and

david look you want the episode too yeah i'm gonna say this right now boom save you see it david drop boom what's up david i'm gonna say this right now there we go absolutely was the first was the first one called the clever programmer experience though i don't know is it i mean the title of this it definitely is i don't know 61 concurrent viewers there you go you guys beautiful beautiful he's like already published episode one low okay good good good good good good so like i said uh just kind of as you were jumping in uh just to let you guys know what's going on here again this is a clever programmer experience a very simple you know i'll have multiple guests i mean multiple people that we'll be talking with you know today we're talking with daniel as you guys know daniel's amazing guy you guys know him at this point and then and so forth um we can cover we can cover multiple topics we can cover you know also said the you pockets and spotify yes this will be also be on spotify it

so go to command 2 right here if you go to spotify here this is our normal spotify let's go ahead and do let's see clever programmer clever programmer oh no clever where did they go clever i i think kazi literally popped up as you're writing clever i know right there right there this is the one right there there we go so everything kind of should be on here right uh holy moly july 16 16th the last one was episode one clever programmer audio experience you see cp on clubhouse episode 1 april 14th look at that look at that that's beautiful that's beautiful guys and again if you have any questions or tour for us um you know feel free to leave them down below in the comments and if you just honestly if you want to talk to us because we would love to talk to you and if you want to actually get in the call um here's what you what i want you guys to do okay really really important okay i want us to i want you to text me text us okay we have a community we're going to get a text message from you guys yeah text us what does it text us uh let's see i want you to text us podcast so let me do this right now on the chris community just called a podcast text us podcast to this number okay listen up really quickly guys okay let me show you this um podcast right there there we go so text us podcast to what number should they text us to the number that that we have right there at two so remember this guys two two four six five one eight eight one seven so again that's two two four six five one eight eight one seven text podcast podcast to that number and we'll be able to then actually call you from our number at that point and that's pretty much it and then we'll just get a call uh no problem whatsoever awesome so what shall we talk about today well i guess let's just talk about getting started right yeah because guys there's going to be so many different points in your life where you just got to get started doesn't matter if it's programming doesn't matter if it's a podcast it doesn't matter if it's anything right but yeah you could talk about it all the time until you actually do something right so there's lots of people that are going to go through that process of wanting to become developers right it just becomes an idea and they just have to be able to actually start somewhere and actually have to start to take action in a specific part of their life yeah and if you guys have any questions uh just let us know we'll be able to answer them as well right somebody said how hard is it to become a developer how long will it right there so how hard is it to become a front end developer and how long will i in what i need to learn good question good question so um you want to go ahead and get started yeah man it depends right it's going to depend on a lot of things what type of program you're trying to become right how much time are you going to put into that are you just going to do like a couple hours a week or you can go full in and all out are you going to have the right mentors are you going to have the right guidance or you can be wasting a lot of time you know dabbling and like udemy courses and all these different things so it's going to depend on a lot of different things that you are trying to do and it's kind of like there's no perfect answer for them yeah sometimes if you do everything right it might take you some time right assuming you do everything right something you put in the work you have the right guidance and things like that i think it could be done in around half a year to a year time frame yeah i think six months to a year time frame is a pretty pretty pretty good uh pretty good way of going about this amy says where are you where you even get a mentor well if you're interested in the mentor right we can definitely be there to help you guys out like i said amy if you are interested i want you guys to text here text here i'm going to put a text podcast text podcast podcast 2 to uh what number let me see this again two two four two two four six five one right there two four six five one pump six five one and then 8817 so right there okay i'm gonna send this to you guys okay so text podcast to that number guys and then uh it will maybe we might be able to actually help you guys i'll help you out on that point but we're even gonna mentor i mean um where i personally got a mentor from um when i when i got my first job like i had a job it was a it was a beginning it was a beginner uh programming job and i literally got it for free so i was working for free for the longest time yeah literally a year and a half guys for a year and a half i was working completely for free without any pay right and i was like i saw these guys were doing some cool startup you know and i literally came up with them i'm like hey guys this is so cool is there anyone that can help out you know and they're like yeah yeah sure sure so they gave me like a really cool um uh project to do not a cool project for me to do to test out who how i am and literally at that point i was like i had to create like uh what's it called that was really funny i had to create a um what's it called um oh a scraper a scraper but using python with beautiful soup classic i had no idea what python was guys i literally the first thing i did when i went to uh when i went to the thing when i went to the uh when i went online i was like what is python you're like where'd i get a snake from where can i get this and i don't like snakes i'm not a big fan of snakes but you know i was like what is python you know the next thing you know i was like okay okay i guess it's a programming language then after that point i kind of went on and you know uh do did more things and at that point um i built the project in like two days a little did not sleep at all and i decided to work with them and i built this project showed that they're like holy this is awesome they loved what i did and that's it and i started working with them and then i the mentors were they they became my mentors right um and they showed me around you know what is django how to build projects next thing you know i'm building like a big jingle project with them right i'm learning how to build a startup company i am learning how to you know get started on you know creating an idea from literally an idea to reality yeah that's that's crazy that's a great place to have those mentors yeah right so like where would you find a mentor yeah and i mean that's a great question so i guess when i think about that right it's going to come down to a few things right if you want to be able to have a mentor most likely unless unless it's like some relative or some friend who's doing it who's willing to just do it for free or whatever yeah there has to be some sort of exchange of value and even then even with the friend there's still an exchange of value because they probably have some sort of fulfillment yeah by kind of helping you and guiding you yeah very much so so you know unless you're not and you're in that case then there's probably two things that you're gonna have to do is one you're either gonna have to exchange your time like how nas did no that's what's exchanging his time knowledge was working for them for free the value he gave them was his free work they were able to get a result from the projects and whatever they were doing or you're gonna have to exchange your money so that's like paying someone hourly at code mentor joining some sort of course or whatever that looks like to making sure that you're able to get in front with the right teachers correct so you're gonna have to bring something to the table to be able to find that mentor because very often people go and they're like you know like go sending out messages like you know i remember i was there like sending a message to gary be like garyvee mentor me you said that really you're on those people i was one of those people molly you know because that's those are like the things they say but the thing is that's not how you're gonna get mentorship you have to bring something to the table and usually that's going to be one of the two big things which is either time and money and for me it was also very similar to nazi story right i ended up doing time right so i ended up going to a local startup and i wanted to get into mobile development and i asked them like hey are there literally like any projects that you guys have in the back burner mobile development wise you guys don't have a plan for that i could just start to work on like at least get a design out there for you guys and move it forward yeah yeah and get the yeah so they give me like some shitty projects but i didn't care bro i was excited dude because i had now i had the resources to ask them questions right and be like oh okay okay so i'm building it out like this like i'm designing a database like this what do you think about that you know like oh like look at this research i was like oh dang like i was learning a lot really really quick so it was important to be able to get that mentor yeah no i agree i agree like with the mentorship that i got from that that one person i mean there are two people that i always talk about them their name is steve and robert um and you know they they also also watch my content a lot all the time and um what's up steven rubber but but yeah i mean i mean robert especially when i first came in like he it's crazy robert initially he like he wasn't like he initially i kind of knew more about databases and like html websites when i first met him and then he joined this startup company and then next thing like he became this amazing person who just like knew so much like literally you know within two months because steve mentored him right he became really good next thing you know i came out like holy robert you just got really good within literally a few months and then he mentored me right together with steve and you know steve you know he taught me things like you know project management he taught me things like how to lead how to become a leader uh because steve was a it was an amazing leader right um you know he taught me a lot of things about that you know lilly went from who from knowing html css and then within a month to two months i was building scrapers a whole scraper system that was using scrapy that was scraping from amazon from zappos from nordstrom and so forth and it was a whole system and we even went to our what's it called um we went to our uh what's his name um teacher like at school to figure out how our database should look like damn yeah it was so much fun like that's legit man those are those are the cool projects because i always talk about that like building projects outside of school yeah like guys if you just do the if you happen to go to school for computer science yeah and you just do the minimum amount of school work that's not going to get any recruiters attention yeah right like you have to be able to plus it's it's just like the bare minimum that you have to learn right yeah i agree so so it's like if you do those things outside of school right whether you stick in school or not that's where actually get that experience stats are actually going to build like amazing projects and then it's like exciting to you too because you're like holy like who else is building this stuff you know yeah yeah yeah yeah like i think i think from my perspective i think um yeah do things outside of school like do one i always tell to people you know don't don't rely on school just to to get you the job to become a developer right it takes a lot more than that uh you know for us for example yo robert's here holy holy nah robert i was just talking about you i only hope that you you heard me yeah just go back like about a minute or two holy moly no way guys say hi to robert right here holy oh man this just made my day that's amazing oh man kind of love that guy love you too bro i love you too man wow ah god you see you see like you have people like you or like like that around you like i haven't seen him in like a year or probably so forth today's day you know like we support each other now whenever whenever whenever we call he's like yeah what's up what you're doing you know he's always like hi all always like working on his amazing stuff he's like he works at a company right now and you rob are you coming to visit oh let's go yo robert we're gonna have to bring you in on this man let's go get third mike here guys who wants to bring robert here for a podcast dude you put the wrong one there wait which one you go wrong [Laughter] yeah drop some fire in the comments if you want to be able to talk to robert one of nasa's mentors and friends drop that fire so we know we can bring him over here he's an amazing guy like great explainer right really cares about people right like have them come need him let's go let's go oh yeah the robber you're you're on the spot now so yeah we'll definitely bring him on once he comes in once he comes here i will definitely have him as a guest here but yeah no he's just an amazing person right taught me a lot personally um i always talk talk about him and now he's just building crazy stuff he works at a company uh what's the company he works at a company oh shoot i already forgot loan loan company it's a loan company hold on no cooking loans there we go cooking loans and yeah he's just building amazing stuff right now like building infrastructures and everything he loves it you know he enjoys it so so did robert also start off like like you what's up always so he he started off yeah kind of like me as well because he started off working with steve initially because he was working with steve initially um yeah he started out just working for free and we were all three of us were working at this company you know it was trendala on this application called trindala and and yeah like we worked together for free for like a year and then he while being in our office we were working for free he was working also working with this other company at the same time in the specific office i'm not sure if he wasn't if he was working for free for them or working parttime for them not really sure i forget that portion at this point but uh dude well let's just let's just say that story man because it sounds like a crazy story that robert has to come in here and freaking you're saying over here we'll watch them on podcast episode three that's right come in soon bro let's go but yeah man i mean that's just classic example dude like nas myself robert like we we put in the work right in the beginning and that goes back to what we said in the beginning this podcast which is just getting started right that big scary project yeah just getting started on that right those first few lines of code i mean do you remember the first lines of code you ever wrote by any chance not like exactly what they were but like where where was the first line of code that you wrote like were you in class were you up like what was going on first lines of code oh man my mind was in class dude mine was in high school ap computer science that teacher bro you know like this teacher tell me we were learning java right this teacher would just show up and just babysit us they're like hey like like she would just be like hey go read chapter three and do these exercises really and she would just answer questions if anyone had any questions great teachers the first the first lines of code i wrote it was in java i tried to write my main function and i wrote system that out that print outside of my main function and it wasn't working and i was like what the why isn't this working really yeah i know the hell i was doing didn't matter what i was reading you know but honestly because of that i didn't do programming for a while really so instead i went to electrical engineering and i did electrical engineering so because of that teacher yeah dude i was like screw that teacher and then it was even crazier bro because as i was doing electrical engineering and i had a second class which was you know uh c programming so software development but for electrical engineering you know i was going through my lower uh right lower division class yeah yeah yeah yeah and that teacher also sucked man that teacher just read out of the powerpoints right but there was something that kept on bringing me back to that wow wow dude i feel like i really there's something that i like something there so i actually ended up double majoring for a while and unfortunately now i finally had a good teacher so it wasn't until my third try that a good teacher yeah and you're also like dude i knew i was gonna like this like i knew there was something here that i really liked and and so what pushed it to do it again like you know we'll push do it again it's uh and at what time because you said you sweet you went you went away from it yeah yeah so in uh junior year high school was when i took the ap computer science class and okay like screw this like i wasn't learning anything i just did one i didn't do the whole year i did one semester and i switched out of that right and i actually started like electric engineering stuff and i started to like that stuff they were building circuits and stuff like that went to college did freshman sophomore oh and half of junior year in electrical engineering no way yeah dude i did not know that about you yeah but i'm a beast but but then then that's when we had that software class and i took it and again i hated like dude i cheated my way through that class because i didn't understand what i was doing bro really i was like what the is a pointer what's it what's a double pointer you know why i wanna see plus plus so it was a variable i know it wasn't even t plus plus it was c bro i hated it bro um but but then yeah man that's when i was all like dude like something was still like in there like man i was like i still kind of like i like the idea of programming but i feel like i didn't have a fair shot with the other two instructors really so then that's when i i declared a double major so i could start to take those classes and then after my second semester i just dropped electrical engineering and part of that came up from the frustration as well because i dude i went to a university yeah where the acceptance rate is 100 percent like they don't reject a single person why what kind of verse did you go to man it's badass bro dude so it's like no it wasn't like this top tier university or anything like that you know yeah um so yeah dude like just some of the professors there i hate to say it are garbage and that's what i experienced in electrical engineering as well when you say the school's name yeah utep oh really is that it yeah i mean look man i love it it helped me create the stepping stone but at the end of the day some of those teachers they just showed up to the class and read from the powerpoint and didn't teach anything yeah that's a very unfortunate portion about like uh universities and things like that that's what i see a lot like like even for example roberts or steve's you know or my friend another case case like we when we first got our jobs like we did not have a degree at all like because we we early on realized that we're not going to get the education as as we thought we would and it's very unfortunate i don't know what it will take you know i don't know what it will take for university to finally make some change right to finally make some change around this but i'm sorry people talk about this every single time right they just you know they stick with what they used to teach you know i'm i'm not gonna lie we used to uh there was this thing and actually robert probably remembers as well because that's that's when i really really got to know him even better through that is we were in this class it was a programming class it was a beginner's programming class and the teacher we had to use like uh we didn't we couldn't use git so we were learning a version control system called smart something it was like i don't know i don't even know anymore but it was a vertical system that was outdated by 10 years wow it's like it wasn't yet it was it was a version control system we would not use it and all we had to do was follow instructions to like okay commit this code you know and we couldn't even get to work because it was so old and i'm just like i'm sitting in there you know and i'm saying that and i'm like like what am i doing here come on in bro come on in so what are you doing hey [Laughter] it's clean good webcam dude that's a good webcam everyone's just singing yo neil patel what's up man what's up dude i just noticed bro where where where where where dude patel neal neil patel what's the guy right here the guy in blue bro oh patel yeah i love you guys hey let's go neal yo bro robert's in the house too robert from robert from uh what's it called i mean my friend robert i mean yeah from college from college yeah yeah the guy who mentored me he's like yo let's go right here see because we were talking about him how he mentored me and he was he's watching because he watches the videos yeah yeah yeah oh my god yeah everybody look everybody's like hey now as i'm coming to visit everybody's like robert come come for a podcast it's gonna be the next episode yeah i mean here i mean no i mean online or here oh yeah he's coming to visit here at california so we'll make it live i don't know robert why are you coming by the way let me know the date let me know the date if not noz will hit you up if you're still the one [Laughter] oh we should probably wait send it to me through send it to me through slack i'll i'll i'll uh send you just like a plate for everybody okay oh in three weeks let's go [Laughter] awesome sweet sweet sweet amazing cool so um yeah like as i was saying like it was very outdated very outdated you know and yeah and i'm gonna say like obviously it's not even to generalize universities but you know like at my university where it's like a place like that you're you're not gonna have like like the purpose of university is to have people to do research not to have people to teach yes so unfortunately in some of those places you're gonna find people that just show up there and care about their research and they don't care about really teaching they're not really passionate about that correct right but but then again like in other universities like my brother he he ended up going to mit when i tell him about that experience he didn't have that experience with the single professor right really like the professor is great that's awesome i know and that that speaks again to the the level of the university right because it's like the professors there are obviously gonna be the best like some of the best in the nation in the world wow right wow so they have to be like high quality and things like that so of course there was a lot of stress a lot of pressure it was very difficult but it was like professors that cared that's good i love professional professors like that exactly in the end that's what's going to make the difference between anything right it's going to be the professors that are happy to be in that classroom whether it's virtual course whether it's a live course or whether it's recording whatever that ends up being man because that's that's what really changes so i don't know how we got in this tangent but i agree some of the stuff is outdated yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly and guys i know that you know right now what's gonna happen is we're going to get a lot be live on this podcast every single every single day um at this point i do have to jump on the meeting but when we do this podcast on a daily basis
