hey guys what's up how's it going this disc Ozzie from clever programmer calm and today I wanted to answer your question of what's the difference between a freelancer versus a consultant so without any further ado let's jump right into it okay so this question I've been getting a lot because I talk about it almost interchangeably and I say freelancer software consultant or software freelancer so I want to answer this question for you guys whether you're a programmer or in any field this is out pretty similar okay so this is not going to be so programming specific because I think it applies to pretty much any field and you can take it away right after watching this video so a freelancer is somebody who doesn't really work for one company as an employee a fulltime employee they can generally choose their own hours choose to work with their own clients and a consultant is you know pretty similar in that case they choose to work on their own time to pick their own clients but here is one key difference that I think is there between a freelancer and a consultant so freelancer you know you're just trying to get as many people to work with you as possible trying to accept as many jobs as possible whereas for as a software consultant you're not thinking of these people as your customers you're thinking of them as your clients so the difference between customers and clients is that a customer is somebody who buys from you whereas a client by definition is somebody who is under your protection and there's something I got from Jay Abraham and it's helped me make that connection so as a consultant you're thinking that of them as your clients not just like somebody who's giving you a temporary job or just like you're trying to make a few extra cash or make fifty hundred thousand dollars extra this month as a consultant you're choosing to work with this person because you respect them or this business and you want to basically safeguard them and protect them from anything even if they're not thinking about it so now let's make these examples just a little bit more tangible so as a freelancer maybe you get a job right as well as a web developer you can go on up were calm and try to apply for a job there and let's say that they give you some Python job to do which is okay make this simple web app for us so people can check out and buy things okay as a freelancer you're going to literally follow every single thing that's given to you but do nothing more outside of it so everything that's in the requirements like make a check out page make this make that and then that's it whereas as a consultant even though you're up taesan web development consultant you'll be like okay wait a minute I get that you're trying to sell something but before I start to work on it do you have an audience and if these people are like no I don't have an audience well you should be like okay if you don't have an audience who are you going to where are you going to sell this to it doesn't matter if you have the greatest product in the world or the greatest service in the world if you don't have an audience so or somebody there who's ready to buy what's the point of investing all this effort hiring me as a Python developer for you you know charging you X amount of dollars to make something for you when at the end of the day there's nobody that you can sell it to and at this point they might go okay this guy's thinking too much I just wanted to hire somebody who's like a dumb brute and just does things and they might fire you in that case that's not the type of person you wanted to work with anyways because you want them to respect you and actually give you you know a thoughtful answer and not just fire anybody that you know they don't like or they don't like a question from them you should be in a habit of challenging people and challenging pre you know these these assumptions on the other hand instead of firing you they might be like holy crap this guy doesn't just do this geiger curl doesn't just do the bare minimum out of work that we give him this person does everything and then Beyond and still is able to think so he's not just following directions he's somebody who's actually autonomous and can think for himself so that level of autonomy is what most people need or most businesses need that type of you just being able to think by yourself whereas and that can make the difference between a lot of some people like how do you become a $100 an hour freelancer and I have a video on that and I think that something that's misleading maybe in that video is that it should really be $100 an hour consultant because it's hard to pay a freelancer that much money because you're just a commodity you think like everybody else you're just offering the same service that everybody else is offering there's nothing more that you bring to the table but as a consultant you bring your brain with you and you bring some other skills and care and love for what you're doing other than oh let me just get this job done because the person who's working with you is thinking this person doesn't even care about his own job he's trying to do what's best for me so somebody who you're trying to do the best for and they feel that do you think they're gonna try to you and pay you less money or will they be thinking okay I can trust this person a hundred percent now the question is just whether I just want to pay them or not and most likely they're gonna be like okay I want to pay this person the price of he or she's asking because it takes out the thinking for me to deliver quality work and if something's not right they'll also watch my back and tell me even if it hurts them it has a consultants one of the biggest things even if it hurts you you have to make the decision that's best for your client because they are under your protection that's your difference between a freelancer and consultant that's why I always talk about software consultants the reason why I'll use a term like freelancer is because most people don't understand consultant and they do understand freelancers so consultant is similar except that you really care and put your neck out there for your clients that's when you can charge $100 $150 two hundred two hundred fifty dollars an hour or sometimes even thousands of dollars an hour but if you're just starting out focus on first getting to that $100 an hour all right guys that's it for this video thank you for watching as always I love your faces often I'll see you in the next video
