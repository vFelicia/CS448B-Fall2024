five right now what's up guys this is Kazi from clever programmer calm welcome welcome we're gonna talk about quite a few things I'm gonna talk about turning 25 and maybe what are some of the things that I learned from it what are some of my regrets what are some of the things that I wish I could change what are some of the things I'm proud of and since it's my my birthday was actually yesterday but you know that you could wish me happy birthday if you'd like hello Zaki Talib and what I like to do is I love playing chess from time to time so I'm gonna play some chess and I'll take on some challengers from this livestream so if you want to play me you can challenge me I'll drop the link in the chat right now and you can go there sign up and then play me in chess so let's kind of start off by talking about let's start off by talking about what are you know some of the things that I'm a thank you Kennedy thank you new technology appreciate it Thank You Zaki dope hey Kazi Kazi says cake Ozzy happy birthday thank you yeah it's crazy you know I don't even feel like I still feel like I'm 19 but I'm 25 so I've hit the quarter life crisis is there such a thing as Quirrell life crisis I don't know if that's a thing or not that's the thing what a life crisis yeah apparently Frankie says it's a thing so I believe him but yeah I've been I'm pretty happy I've been pretty happy of the past 25 years and what I've accomplished the things that I'm regretful of are things to do would consist that require consistency for example working out and getting fit that is something that I regret not being consistent with consistency is one of them like my weakness as big weaknesses a moon says he's 23 that's awesome mister says he's 26 Joseph says 25 yes 25 so that's been one of my weaknesses you know consistency anything that requires that I wish that I was more consistent and then I would have actually much better results what the thing that I am proud of the thing that I am good with is you know for example how I grinded really hard on creating this YouTube channel and how I grinded on improving my coding skills and that that type of grind that I've done that I'm pretty proud of and I'm happy with but yeah so there are certain things that I'm I you know I'm like I wish I could go back in time and I knew them in a better perspective and then if I could go back I would improve so much faster and I would grow yeah just pretty much grow a lot faster you know in all kinds of ways like financially emotionally physically and all those Thank You Joseph for wishing happy birthday thank you Neha I thank you mister Thank You mood Thank You Vic Nash appreciate it so yeah I can go so what I want to do is actually I want to jump on now and play some chess and if you guys want to jump in and play with me and challenge me and go to Lee Chester Oregon make an account but I'm gonna play some chess and I'm gonna take some questions that's kind of what I would like to do on my birthday so if you have some questions for me ask me questions about coding development freelancing whatever have you I'll try to answer them and I'll also be playing chess and I'll be sharing my screen so let's by the way you can also see me like this which one do you prefer do you for the devil Kazi or the normal cause II the devil called you're the normal kasi hey Kazi can I really become a developer in six months like is that even possible yes bro of course you can oh [ __ ] hold on let me get my glasses yes bro of course you can't you just have to put in the work that's it gotta put in the work all right when I was coding when I was practicing it I was doing it for 16 hours to 18 hours a day that's why my three months or six months I always say it's more than some people's three years or four years well I've been coding for a really long time and I'm still not earning an income from it so well you know it's not really happening for me I've I'm coding one hour a week well that's your [ __ ] problem you're coding for one hour a week you need to code a lot more you need to code a lot faster all right all right let's see thank you videos help me the normal normal normal devil the intelligent one I like it all right cool let's go to the intelligent one let's go this way all right guys actually you know what I'm gonna for a little bit I'm gonna play chess like this so let's let's do that right now I'll share my screen boom chess mode here we go if you guys want to challenge me you're welcome to just want to go three minutes here stream a game I haven't played in a long time so I might actually suck but let's see well how can we control our workflow in freelancing daring of OOP the game has started it's a three minute game I'm gonna just play super solid actually okay let's go here I'm gonna bring my Bishop out here and attack his queen go there tank its Queen this guy comes out cool I'm looking pretty good probably gonna I don't think I can play d5 anymore but let's try to kick his night goodbye night okay what is happening now can I take take c4 yeah that looks fine why not oh he's after my bishop I don't like what he's trying to do my bishop I'm gonna move my Bishop Mike here and then push nope byebye oh I just dropped upon whoops c4 Bishop takes Queen takes he moves the knight okay let's go here let's expand and go see for next I'm smelling a d5 here he's not castling I'm just gonna play it he's not he's not been castling I just have a feeling that it's not gonna be good for him to open everything up Queen check Queen here night I don't know this is uh this looks a little loose on his end okay let's go here let's try to confuse him and then I'm gonna go here next if he plays f6 no he's not gonna play enough six okay I don't want to trade Queens yeah check Queen blocks hmm all right so what I will do instead is I'm just gonna play faster I'll put my Queen here and my rook is gonna come out next and it's looking pretty good for me I'm liking my development I'm down upon down to pawns but I'm a fan of my development now I'm threatening to take his Bishop so he defends that okay can i play a4 a5 next yeah I'll try that let's see what happens have five have five a5 a5 that looks good okay let's dominate the can I take advantage of this pen even more now let's just dominate this file instead oh no totally overlooked that silly me I had an advantage now I lost an advantage and now I am probably just losing let's get some material I guess form the troubles I have the bishop pair my king is very open that's not good I'm gonna get into a lot of trouble probably gonna get checkmate it soon I also have 20 seconds he has one minute and some seconds so okay let's try taking this pawn everything looks solid for me uhoh I think I just got made it why did I do that yeah that's it all right let's come back to the chat let's see what's happening boom boom all right questions questions how can we control our three Lance how can we control our workflow and freelancing during a vacation well mix it up a little bit you know go freelance and then go back to your you know like I sometimes do coding while I'm on a vacation not anymore as much but I know that I used to I used to do that all the time it's better so yeah you can code completely when you were in when you're on it I started coding at like 18 or 19 Joseph's cool I don't like the CS degree in college yeah I don't really like it that much either a moon says why are you so beautiful a moon I asked myself that every day yeah nourish my birthday was on the 14th so that was about two days ago that's right my birthday past alfa con asks cos you have a question if i take your profitable program or master class would i be able to cite hustle and python programming a beginner in all fronts yeah I mean what is your goal first of all if your goal is to freelance if your goal is to earn an income then if you take profitable program master class and take massive amounts of action over the period of ninety two hundred and four days which is sixteen weeks long it's a 16 week long program then you will see those results in a much shorter period of time so yes it will help you even if you are a beginner on all fronts but if freelancing is not your goal fulltime is your goal then I would recommend that you not take my program profitable programmer w8n see says I feel yeah I just turned 30 in January and finally thought I need to actually do something worthwhile instead of [ __ ] around and procrastinating yeah we spend a lot of our lives [ __ ] around and procrastinating so it's it turns into a waste of a life honestly yeah whoops I just kind of turned off the livestream there for a second cool yeah so it turns out turns out in till huge waste of life I recommend that you not do that I recommend that you you focus on actually putting in the work actually executing on things you know if you work on building the execution muscle you will win all right guys I kind of want to just come in pop in okay so here's the thing I am feeling actually a little tired I just got off a twohour long one not 1 1 hour and 10 minutes really intense podcast interview and I have to jump on a 6 p.m. calls for 25 p.m. right now so I got to jump on a long coaching call a group coaching call in my program from 6 p.m. to like 8 p.m. so that's what I'm gonna be kind of going all outs and that's gonna be taking a lot out of me so I don't want to underperform on that so I apologize I wanted to stay here for a lot longer but I'm kind of yeah now yeah it's like my brain is getting just a little bit fried so I'm gonna go and take a walk and maybe grab some coffee but yeah I'm gonna hop off this I thought I was gonna play a lot more but I just I think I just been in the house for too long all right so guys again I really appreciate it thank you for being on here thank you for wishing me a happy birthday I really appreciate you I love you guys this is cozy and I am gonna bounce okay and nourish happy birthday to your wife I that's awesome you know or yeah and then her birthday is on the 14 so that's crazy narration all
