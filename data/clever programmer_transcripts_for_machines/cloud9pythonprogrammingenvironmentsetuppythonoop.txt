hey guys so for this tutorial make sure that you are on Python 3 because now we're getting into the part of the code where we're importing specific libraries from Python 3 and if you are on Python 2 these commands actually might not work so either you're gonna have to follow this course and try to figure out online how to translate these lines of code some specific ones from Python 3 to Python 2 and make it work for yourself or I suggest upgrade to Python 3 and use Python 3 if you are still having problems and you cannot figure out any way to get past them then I will show you a very nice solution and this will make your life really easy though I encourage local development more there is an online solution and it's called c9i oh okay and let me just show you this very quickly this is just to make sure that you don't have any problems like worst case scenario nothing is working for you guaranteed this is gonna work so essentially on scene on dot c9 dot IO you just go on this website and create a workspace so you can create any workspace you want I'm just gonna call it whatever and let's call it test and pick Python as your template or you don't even have to pick a template you could leave it blank it's totally up to you so I'm just gonna pick Python and then hit create workspace and then it just creates a fullon working environment for you so you can code in here you have a terminal that works perfectly just like a Linux or a Mac or in a bunch of system and you won't have any development problems no one problem might be that if your internet connection isn't working you're kind of screwed you can't do anything but for the times that your internet connection is working it works and another great thing about this is that if you switch from your laptop to your macbook or you switch to your Windows whatever wherever you go in the world you can even go to a different country you're in programming environment will be the same because it's on the cloud it's on the internet so on my left side you see there's some folders you can create your own folder if you want you can create a file so like here I'll just hit that plus sign do new file I'll just say print hello world and I will hit command s to save it and I'll just call it hello world make sure to give it that extension that py and for the folder it says it's storing it in the home folder well how about we just create a folder and call it PI thon code whoops what happened there oh it's smart it doesn't allow you to actually do it doesn't allow you to actually rename things so or sorry it doesn't allow you to put spaces so what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna create Python here code what's happening there forget all that stuff just put Python code do it right the first time basically is what to say unable to rename the project folder okay no worries we're not trying to rename the project folder anyways let's hit save there whatever I don't know where it put the freaking code okay right there so you have new folder dot one and the code is in there and now to run it I can just hit run and it runs it but again I want you to practice with command line so go over to your command line hit LS see where you are and here it shows me that I am in my if I do PWD it shows me that I'm in my workspace so let's just go to new folder whoops period one and that's there there it is my hello world so I just hit python hello world and run it okay so nothing is working you need Python three go here then you should be able to essentially even do something like if you had python so before i move further i just wanted to point out that when you go to sign up at c nine oh if I remember correctly they asked for your credit card but they don't actually charge you anything it's to make sure that you are who you say you are and probably I don't know oh and maybe it's easier for them to charge you once you kind of get to the point where you need more space in the start you don't need that much space you can just keep creating a new workspace every time you have to do something and most of the projects will be pretty lightweight but if you feel like you need more than a few gigabytes then you can you know pay them monthly and they'll give you some space but again it's free you just have to put your credit card number and in the start now if you do Python it'll take you to Python 2 and if you want to go to Python 3 then it's just as simple as Python and then type in 3 ok and that's it so I did it essentially right here at the bottom hopefully you can see it the screen is not too small and that's how you access Python to Python 3 kind of everything works in C 9 dot IO so I love it and you really should love it too all right that's it for this video and I'll see you in the next video you
