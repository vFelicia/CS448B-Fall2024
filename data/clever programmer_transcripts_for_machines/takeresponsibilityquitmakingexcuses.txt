Hi how are you doing I want to talk about responsibility and if we break this word down right it's essentially response ability so what does that mean well it means your ability to respond to a situation it means to transcend circumstance or the things that are happening to you that you think are making you act a certain way the things that are making you dependent on your actions or rather your reactions all right so with responsibility you have to take things in your control it essentially gives you a way to respond to your situation rather than being a byproduct of your situation now these things are very important I don't care if it has to do with computer programming or you're trying to learn about finances you're trying to become a business consultant whatever it is this is something that's very important for you to understand there's so many people that try not to take responsibility for their actions they blame others and they react to everything if the weather is bad well they're gonna not go to the gym or they're not going to be productive they're going to let the weather decide their mood their levels of productivity their levels of work and if you think about companies that are trying to hire you they're looking for problem solvers they're looking for people who can come up with solutions to solve things they're not looking for problems and by reacting to things and by not being responsible you're not going to be able to provide Solutions you're not going to be autonomous you're not going to be selffunctioning and nobody wants to work with people who can't function on their own you know the people who always have a question about everything and won't go out of their way to research it even if they knew how to because well it's simpler to just ask rather than to actually conduct their own thorough research before asking a question right So within your lives if there's one thing you can focus on right now to improve this is probably the most powerful thing you can improve in your life start taking responsibility for things even for things that potentially are not your fault especially if you're working on a team if one person makes a mistake the love to say it wasn't them if somebody makes a mistake they go well yeah that guy made a mistake right that guy made a mistake they won't take it as we made a mistake or if they do something good they'll be like oh yeah you know we did this but that was my idea instead of that was our idea and we did it so learn to take responsibility learn to stand up for either people you're with and practice those things it's going to be very valuable and if you won't see the power of it now in your life maybe if it's helping you with your relationships or if it's helping you with how you are with your friends or your levels of popularity or whatever if it's not helping you with those or you don't care about those you will see that disability will definitely transmute itself into its monetary equivalence what do I mean by that well what I mean by that is money so if the other things aren't that important to you then remember that this high levels of responsibility will make you more employable more attractive for job opportunities and more attractive for promotions as well okay that's my message for today take responsibility
