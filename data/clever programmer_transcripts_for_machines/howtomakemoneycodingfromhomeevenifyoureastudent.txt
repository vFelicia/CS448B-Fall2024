hey guys Jacob here so today we'll be talking about money I want to show you how to make money as a student with code basically for all of my methods you don't need any experience but you should know at least how to code I will cover five bullet points and describe all of them let's go alright let's so let's get to the first advice so basically it's the most simple advice you can get it's get a job yeah I'm not kidding I literally suggest you do first of all find some internship and then work parttime as a student during your summer holidays you have probably two or three months free so you should use this time wisely and get the internship in some software company I did that once I went to Austria for a Python internship for three months and then when I came back to my hometown I would be able to get two or three different job offers and I could easily choose one of them which is super cool and I suggest you do that and now a lot of you may say Jacob but I have no and I don't have any experience a lot of companies they just declined my offer yeah I've been there what I did is I applied to 50 different companies in Germany I went for tons of different interviews processes all them declined me I was super sad but what I did I didn't give up that after Germany I searched for Austria all the companies and Austria's applied to also like 50 to 70 different companies and for different interviews I felt most of them but the one company they accepted me and I used that opportunity I went there and I learned a lot and it also great for your CV so do that I was also talking about it once in my Instagram you can see the video probably somewhere here when I was talking about it guys so many of you asked me how did I start as a Python developer how did I get my first job so most of the companies they ignored me they didn't even replied for my mails but it's okay I guess because I didn't have much experience migrants but few of them did and they took me to the next stage to the coat interview process but I felt all of them except one so I got this a chance to go to Austria as a Python developer I was pretty excited and that's what you should do guys you should send your CV to as much companies as you can and try to go through the process and maybe you'll get this one single chance all right the next and the second step is freelance I mean this is obvious it's related to get a job but it's actually different for this you may not need any experience at all because you can start from scratch what I do as a freelancer because I also have some experience at freelancer I was asking my friends if they need some help then I was looking at the different groups on a Facebook there are tons of them and I was asking people if they need help if they need some service you can do it as a frontend developer or you can also do it as a backend developer what's funny about my friend on Instagram he actually got a client and the client pays him 50 years per hour for coding he's got his client through Instagram and now for freelance I have also a good advice for you so basically if you have backend developer as me and you don't know how to design your tera bullet you had colleague frontend you can team up with someone I did that with my friend from uni and we actually deliver a bit hope product in two months and we got paid for that he was doing the front end he was designing and I was developing backend and we just combine our forces together and I earn the money with this and provide the great product for our client ok and let's talk about today's video sponsor skill sure skipper is an online learning community that offers membership with meaning with so much to explore real projects to create and the support of fellow creatives sculture empowers you to accomplish real growth skill sure is also a great platform to go if you're looking to improve your skills they offer great classes so you can improve your web development skills you can learn javascript CSS HTML and then it will help you to get your first clients and earn money with code skills are super affordable the early plans are only ten dollars a month also the first 500 people who click link down below will get two months free mobile skills so the third way how to make money is actually by creating the online products and selling them to people you can also do it in different ways first of all you can create some game or some app and put it on an online store and earn a lot of money through the ads or for some subscriptions like freemium games you know the premium games basically you put you gain for free but people are willing to pay for items in the game there are many of them you pay for the game and you enjoy with mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid but if you pay for incentives you're rewarded premium the Miam is that not many other way is to create the SAS products as means softwareasaservice so basically you can create some API for example the API which will predict you the weather for next week I know that there's a couple of them and they already for free but you provide a good new product and market it well people are willing to pay you monthly for access to your API I saw some basic products such as generator of the random data' and I know that there are a lot of free ways to do that but there was like this one website and people were earning a lot of money you can check for example the nice website such as poker use of indie hackers people there are posting there bootstrap businesses they are earning money from 0 to millions of dollars so you can do it definitely buy your own for example last time on a YouTube I posted a video about influence and marketing we got a stop here very quickly so basically this video is posted on my friend's channel clever programmer you can just check it check him out he's one of the most popular youtubers related to programming on YouTube and there's the video a building a simple Instagram influence at bot with Python it's about influences database so I highly recommend and I'll put the link to this video in the description and I created an online product which is online database of influencer if I will deep dive in this product and provide better features which with the detailed reports of an influencer in a certain niche I would also make create an online for it and use it as a softwareasaservice and charge monthly fees the other way is if you are for example frontend developer and it's hard for you to find like good clients which I want to have a nice website you can create the templates for example portfolio templates you can put it down on an online store and people are willing to pay for it let's say from 10 to 20 euro spec template then if you market it well you are able to scale your business and earn money number four teach others get tutor be an online teacher or create the online courses I know that there are a lot of online courses and you don't want to become a next guru such as Tai Lopez here my garage just bought this new Lamborghini here you see this tik tok ER get in a little closer Johnny you in tighten up these guys are crazy you can actually provide a ton of value creating really high quality online course and helped a lot of people out there the other way is to actually just be it online tutor so basically there are many students who have problems with coding West problems will start and you can be an online tutor and church for example thirty to fifty dollars per hour for such a consulting session and again here it's all about building a personal brand it's all about marketing if people know you if people are following you they are willing to pay you the money they are willing to use your resources because they trust you they know that they will learn from you more than from some random udemy courses and the last which is the number five and this is my favorite is going to the coding contest so basically here I will focus mostly on the hackathons because I'm a huge fan of hackathon so basically I would suggest you first of all go there buy your own or with someone and just try it out see what is the hackathon what is it about how it is coding 24 hours per week but then if you are keep doing it you can have like one team for example of for coders they will be like one design and run from the engineer one patent engineer and the one DevOps then you are able to create the full products and win the hackathons I did that I went to six hackathons and I want four of them and basically you can get a really really good money and this is also some kind of like a side hustle not really regular and stable income but this is always good to have some extra cash with that whirring where we go in are we going to extra crunch for absorption session alright guys so that were my five points how to make money with code if you have your own ways how to make
