hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm so did a lot of work today a lot but my new website should be up spent a lot of time on it before I was like you know hosting it with one platform now I switched it because of a lot of reasons B ok so before what was going on was I had you know too many websites doing too many different things at once and then what I wanted to do was make all of them do everything at once but simpler meaning that I had one website where I had my main website right in my blog posts and all of that stuff then I had another website where I had all of the courses ok now what I've done is I have made a website which it has the entire blogs and everything cool that's going on clever programmer there a way to contact me and all that as well as the ability for you to sign up for my courses and actually start taking the courses it's all in one place as before for some of the students that was getting lost in translation they couldn't find where they had to login and sometimes they would log in and they would get a problem it was like you know causing some problems causing some confusion that I don't want you to have so now if you go to clever programmer com hopefully crossing my fingers nothing crazy happens and embarrasses me you should be able to go to clever programmer calm you should be able to sign up for my free course and then it should send you the information for how to actually enroll in my free course also yeah and anybody who is interested in my new upcoming course that's coming up in November I'll try to put a link videodescription or whatever but uh sign up for it for the VIP I call it the waitlist so basically you're the first one to get notified as well as you know if you join in if you sign up for it now I'll also send you my bonus is where I give you all my free resources I use to become a Python software developer in less than three months okay and all the resources I give you are actually free of cost so if you sign up for my new course and you're interested in it I'll give you a bonus in the meantime to keep you occupied but other than that you know what's going on with you guys hopefully everything is awesome and arm is kind of getting sore from holding my thumb for so long but you know something kind of interesting happened which was before I was about to log off for the night and head out and eat a thousand calories because right now I'm supposed to be eating 2,500 I'm at 1400 so I need to eat a lot I haven't eaten much today I saw a post by somebody named maja Han on medium.com and it mentioned me I was like that's interesting so I went over and checked it out and it was a really cool post and basically what she was saying was that she watched my video called successful people vs. lazy people that videos on YouTube you can go to it search it up but basically our video is about you know stopping consuming stuff and actually starting to create meaning like if you had to think about your time 90% of it is consuming and okay I'm probably being generous here for most of us let's be honest it's like 99% consuming and like one person creating if that so for example you know you can start doing like little shifts in your behavior patterns like small things like instead of spending more time watching a video how about spend a little bit of time commenting on a video so go from 99 1% kriya maybe like two three four five percent creation in your day right so now you comment on a video and you know it doesn't have to be a video it's just that example is coming to my head because I'm making a youtube video right now but if you're on a forum or you see a Facebook post and you're scrolling through and it's one of your friends Facebook post she's going there and if you like it or something funny is there or you know was helpful to you make a comment you know or if you watch a vo anywhere else put a comment there you're maybe on a forum and you looked up something and there was a solution there on a forum go give you know go go to the forum reply comments you know engage with the community if there is no solution and you're the first one who's solving a problem post your solution okay a lot of the times we underestimate ourselves and our experiences and all you have to do is you know you don't have to be this amazing genius just document what's going on in your life right you don't have to worry about creating something new that's what Gary Vee says as well just document what's already going on so meaning let's say you're going through a current challenge in your life or a problem or you're trying to learn something just talk about that in a blog post okay if you're interested in writing write on medium.com it's like free it's easy to write and there's already audience there so people will find your content just like I found my Hawkins content you know right you can you can write or you can make a video about where you're at and post it on YouTube you know it doesn't a lot of people think you'd requires extra time out of the day or some kind of extra effort it doesn't it just means like that time you spend consuming you just replace a little bit of that with actually creating so let's say you were gonna sit and you know scroll through the Facebook feed for the next 30 minutes spend 10 minutes just writing a little thing about your thoughts and posting it or and five minutes making a simple video just like I'm doing right now right but it's been six or seven minutes you know so what and now a lot of people get to see this video also don't worry about you have zero followers right now are zero viewers that shouldn't be the thing that motivates you to create this content you know like you have to understand you might look at my channel and be like obviously cause you're making this video because you have so many viewers well now yes I do as of now as of today we just hit 80 thousand subscribers which is pretty cool so thank you guys for that but I was making my content when I had zero viewers and zero subscribers because I just like believed that if I put something out there it'll help some people you know because I thought okay you know I was really stuck on certain things I'm just gonna start helping people I'll put out content and I didn't worry about marketing I didn't pay for any ads I didn't do anything fancy I just put it out there and I'm like if you know hopefully people are gonna find this helpful and you know a bunch of people did and they started finding the channels for gaining popularity but you know that's how it happened wasn't some amazing thing I did I just literally you know I was still going to college I was still going to you know hanging out with friends family it was still watched Netflix I would still do all those things but then instead of spending you know 30 minutes extra or two hours extra doing those things I just said okay let me take that one or two hours out and just make a video and then post it on it's fun and I have a chance of being discovered you know it's just their chance of being discovered it's cool and you know imagine like somebody was trying to hire you who would they hire somebody who let's say you're trying to hire somebody would you want to hire somebody who just like fits a very basic criteria for a job or would you hire somebody who is so passionate about it that in their free time they have videos or that or they have a website about that subject so if you want to call a programmer you know you don't necessarily need degree or anything if you have a website you have a platform or you have something where you creating content and people can see it you're you're gonna get people to reach out to and want to hire you and you'll just stand out like for example just a few days ago I got a job offer for about 100k for a Python and I turned down the offer because I'm at a point where I'm actually more interested I need more time to create content for you guys and help you guys out and one thing I'm realizing is that it's not even necessarily like I need to help you guys with just coding you know one thing I'm realizing is that knowledge is not what's stopping a lot of us right knowledge it's not knowledge that we need it's actually behavioral change motivation the right guidance to get started and I feel like that's where I can actually be more helpful because there are tons of tutorials there's tons of guys it tons of howtos but not a lot of people make the big picture connection of why software development why programming you know what are the big picture like nobody even mentions or at least not anywhere that I seen you know their online courses and they have content where they don't even assume that you have a job or you're not busy currently in your life you know it's almost like they just assume everybody's like a student and they have like nothing going on in their lives so they'll make really dense technical content without explaining any of the like you know big picture like when should you start freelancing when should you start becoming a fulltime developer or how do you know you're ready where can you go to start getting clients all those things right they don't mention that they'll just have this dense content and if you're busy you likely don't have how much time available at your hands right you have a very little bit of time so again those are the things that I found more important that need to be addressed that aren't addressed so that's where actually I'm going to be focusing a lot on and you know my future of content is going to coming out you can expect a lot of that to be there and you know let me know if you guys find this stuff helpful because yeah I want to make like really technical videos but I don't think that that's what's stopping a lot of us I really don't think so I think we know where we can find the resources and stuff I think it's that we have sometimes trouble about like visioning how software development or programming will help improve our lives if we are able to become a developer if it's something that we will actually even like in the future right so that's what I want to focus on the most and I didn't discover this till later right so if you guys are making your channels and everything or you're making your content or you're writing a blog post or whatever it is that you're doing right in any shape form you're contributing you don't have to have this whole game plan or this whole thing mapped out just you can figure it out as you go you don't need some amazing stuff already they're just like start and then you get search steering in different directions based on what people want from you what people like from you things like that okay so just my two cents a little bit tired a new website is coming up check it out let me know what you guys think if there any bugs or anything please comment and let me know like hey something's messed up so I can fix it or something doesn't make sense please let me know that in the comments below I really want to make sure
