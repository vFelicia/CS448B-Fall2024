here are the four things i wish i knew when i started programming number one programming is thinking what does that mean that means that most of my time is actually not been coding my time is spent actually thinking a lot number two pick one language and stick with it pick one language if you want to truly deeply improve then you need to improve your ability to think deeply you need to do that by sticking with one language and you're able to focus on the real thing which is problem solving number three always have a passion project you have a project that you are excited about building that you've either started it or you're very actively always thinking about it number four programming is just like how to show it in a hollywood movie it's a lot of googling and it's a lot of stack overflowing that's not all it is but this is one of the best abilities you can have
