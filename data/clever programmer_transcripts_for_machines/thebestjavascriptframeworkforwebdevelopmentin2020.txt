what the hell is a framework guys we always are asking like which framework do i learn is it like angular view react javascript's always evolving it's always changing so how do you know which one which which framework to start on and cause you like when you first entered this domain what was your thoughts on that i was very confused with all especially the web development it was just like i'm like let me just do python because python was just python and then web development was like view react angular this that that other thing and i'm like that seems like too much is going on yeah exactly there's a lot going on so we're gonna we're here to clear that up for you today guys on what you should focus all of your attention on so you're the most popular go ahead the most popular ones that we're going to cover guys are the first one you've probably heard of this angular it's google's uh framework right so you have google's framework it's very popular it grew quite a lot but it's sort of on the downward trend right now and then they had a view um i'm not actually sure because you know who actually came out with the view i'm not entirely sure i don't know who came out with you very lightweight uh library extremely sort of popular it's very opinionated um but it sort of surpassed angular and then the guys at facebook just came along and just like blew everyone's mind with like react like they came along i love this and they just took it to a whole new level you know like they um have we have have we gone to the next slide we're on react oh nice yeah awesome yeah so yeah this one guys this is by the guys over at facebook and this is obviously if you're not if you're new to the channel go ahead and check out the last few videos and we'll clear up what reactors yeah so yeah massive companies are using all three of these right now guys so you've got airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox using react you've got guardian upwork paypal sony using angular and then you've got alibaba and a bunch of others using vue but how do you know which one to choose from these so like what would you look at when you were when you would make this decision that's really important i honestly a few things i always look at which is why i looked at python as well i look for simplicity and ease of use i almost put that above so many other things just because i want to know how what's the learning curve can i pick it up fast and then i also look at how long is this thing here to stay so like is it popular is it picked up by a lot of people and then of course i want to look at like what companies you know are using it so when i see like i look at the guardian and i'm like that's cool but airbnb is like more badass you know like upwork is cute but instagram is really where it's at yeah exactly yeah so i mean i think all of them are being used by popular but i strive for simplicity and um something that's just you know popular and trending right now exactly so with that said guys we went ahead and checked out stack overflow and wanted to see what the most wanted framework was and you guys guessed it right whoa we just broke 1 thousand viewers concurrent we're over one thousand viewers on youtube you guys are absolutely amazing thank you so much thank you guys damn that is amazing let's keep it rolling so go ahead thank you guys so the number one most wanted framework right now is flying with react right so yeah at the top you've got react so guys there is no downfall right now to learn and react react is here to stay you can be sure for the next five years if you learn react you're going to have a job but you're going to have some kind of income that will come from that so definitely worth investing your time yep and it's the most wanted framework now if we go over here you guys can see react is just flying off and this is actually like look at this is the real download so this is not just some popularity this is literally download so take a look at this versus angular versus vue and honestly a lot of the reason with angular is because it's too um it's it forces you into a framework and it forces you to code a certain way whereas with react it's not a framework it's just a library it's super lightweight so it's plug and play and then it's also badass and you know you it's pretty much just like javascript under the hood yeah so next time you guys have that question should i let angular should i learn view think about this like visual right here like angular is going off the reactor going off the chart okay this visual right here okay i think you were talking about this visual because i'm like that other visual makes me not wanna you know if you guys love to drop a thumbs up warrior warrior says this is insane you guys are lit we're always lit somebody also said this is like watching two friends just kind of give us advice so that's cool hey i love that it is guys there's two friends just giving you guys advice amazing so what what is this over here right so yeah so we talked about reacts we're gonna dive a bit more into react guys so react is all about component based design and what that means guys is literally you go ahead and break a website down into different components the header the nav bar the body the text and all that goes in like the cards on amazon all of those things and you basically just reuse them right so it's literally like once you get the hang of that the reason why it's really really related guys it's actually super simple it's actually really easy to go ahead and reuse components so getting your head around the component based design is crucial now managing data and react like how does this work so when it comes to managing data and redux this is where people start to kind of lose their and start going crazy and this is why in our clones that we make like amazon clone where we use context api where we start to introduce the idea of redux and we built another tutorial i think with spotify where we use context api so this is another concept which introduces things like data layers and you needing to understand that which is super powerful and super valuable once you learn it and the stepbystep process of learning is learn context api first and then get into redux and is the easiest way to do it send me your thoughts on this exactly what cause you said pretty much so guys well the minute the minute you kind of hear about redux and you look at tutorials for redux this is your reaction it's pretty much like oh my god like it's kind of freaking me out and stuff so all we're gonna say here is pretty much like kazi said go ahead learn the react context api first learn that pattern and then picking out redux is kind of easy so it's going to it's going to be a lot simpler than as if you were just jumping straight into redux for the first time so the next one yeah react context api is going to be a lot easier to learn and pick up um and if you are interested in the builds that we done we actually went ahead and done that so you can definitely use those as reference yep and you you know we have a free training for you guys profit with javascript free training so you guys can go ahead and sign up for it at any time we have a webinar that we've put together it's a one hour free webinar it's in the description below so if you guys want to go ahead and check that out definitely go ahead and sign up for it because it just gives you the exact roadmap to you know here we're diving deep into the front end developer guide in your roadmap in that one we're talking about how are you going to go from your zero dollars to making a hundred thousand dollars whether you do that in one year three years or five years it's really the road map to learning the coding skills and the practicality of your first hundred thousand dollars so i put that in the description below click that link and then sign up for that training it's freaking awesome definitely go check that out guys free value so definitely worth checking out now i included this one because i have a lot of people who do ask about something called mob x right i had a question about it before uh is it basically another uh opinionated version of like managing data within a reactor honestly my my viewpoint here is if anyone has this question go ahead and use react context api and then redux if you want to do this it's just kind of a cool thing to learn but honestly if you want to land the job redux is the way to go got it and now check out the live bills that we have free on youtube all right so bruce buffer is endorsing us apparently and over here you can see we got the zoom clone i mean i know it's really hard for you guys to see but we got the zoom clone that we made recently we made a spotify clone for you guys we made the tick tock clone uh that's at you know in six days we have over 117 000 people watched that one and a lot of them built it out we built a youtube clone for you guys you can see the exact front end design for youtube and then we also did the tinder clone and then a bunch of more stuff so go ahead and guys like that's all there for free on youtube so make sure you get value from that as well exactly and guys if you were if you've watched any of these and you found value from that just all we ask is you smash the thumbs up button and that's enough for us we're to break the break the thumbs up button exactly now okay
