yo what's up fam just wanted to fill you in on a little something it's your boy kazi here from clever programmer let's just jump straight into it so i have recently been learning react native as you saw probably in my recent video where i talked about that and on this mission i'm gonna be doing something absolutely ridiculous so today i wanted to come and share that ridiculousness with you so that you can hold me accountable and you know this is the month where i'm probably gonna you know die with the work that i'm taking on but you know i said [ __ ] it i'm gonna be doing this for you so i'm just gonna show you this and i'm gonna stop talking okay here on the screen what you see is the content calendar that i have for the rest of this month of may it's gonna be crazy i'm probably gonna puke my guts out trying to make this happen but we're gonna make it happen it's gonna be freaking sick so you guys already saw that i dropped linkedin clone on may 5th a huge build absolutely insane but we made it happen it's a six seven hour long video today i dropped clubhouse may 10th i'm recording this video on may 10th that was ridiculous it has so much going on i mean it's this project is just so freaking heavy and massive on front end this one had all types of stuff going on and you can actually even make posts on this so super dope on may 14th luckily nas is going to be helping me out and he's going to be dropping tesla clone with react js okay so this is gonna be the tesla website it's gonna have all the freaking dope ass functionality that tesla has so it's gonna be super freaking cool here is the app okay let me refresh this just look at how it looks it's freaking ridiculous let me scroll down you see that vertical scroll snap and how it snaps right and now i'm gonna change into one of the other tabs so you see that text pop out all new interior boom game from anywhere stay connected it's just it has such a wow factor it's so freaking slick and then you got that burger menu on the side um i know it's cropping out a little bit but that's because i'm just too zoomed in and i'm not going to zoom out because i'm going to mess up my other stuff so i'm just going to go back to what i was talking about so that happens may 14th so what i also want to do in this video is tell you the rest of this month's content because it's going to be crazy we're going to be going so freaking hard and react native and what i want you to be able to do is i want you to be able to put all of these builds on your calendar so you can actually show up for them and learn because i don't want you to miss out any of these okay so pop it in your calendar set alarms because you don't want to miss these some of these we're going to do live some of these are going to be videos but again they're going to be bangers so you don't want to miss okay may 17th we're going to be dropping the uber eats with react native because i wanted to challenge myself and go okay let's not just do react let's do react native so we're gonna be adding this entire build don't worry this video is not dropped yet this is just me doing um you know some visualization kind of visualizing it into the future and it keeps me excited it makes me want to build this may 21st we're going to be dropping postmates with react native may 24th we're going to be dropping amazon with react native and may 20th we're going to be dropping instacart with react native all of these are going to be massive massive builds it's gonna be absolutely ridiculous again i don't know why i'm signing up for this but i just wanted to come in let you know that ahead of time these are not completely built yet we're gonna be working on them i'm gonna be working on them and then the shooting of it takes tens of hours and sometimes my neck breaks because these aren't regular builds that most older youtubers do no no these are not like that most other youtubers just build one screen two screens they're done okay most youtubers are not building fullon databases for you to add a ability to add posts take things out you know stuff like that and then also to go so deep with react native as well so we're going to be going freaking deep you guys this is the exciting part so i hope that you are excited i hope that you have marked this on your calendar with that said stay ready these bills are going to be incredible we're just going to be banking out two a week and we're gonna crank it up even more so we have four bills actually five bills there's one secret build that i'm not gonna show you yet we have five react native builds happening this month of may and two react.js bill so that's this total of seven builds at least six more upcoming bills that are going to be happening in may and then in june it's just going to be freaking rampage on react native we're going to be doing about eight bills so i'm not gonna show you the calendar for uh june yet and what i'm gonna do instead is i'm gonna have you drop a comment below on what you would like to see in june okay so let me know what you're excited about seeing in june what react native bills do you want to see do you want to see amazon i mean actually we're already doing amazon this month but like tell me do you want to see facebook do you want to see instagram do you want to see whatsapp venmo what do you want to see or is there something completely different that we're missing okay so let me know in the comments below and the ones that are the highest uploaded we're gonna end up taking them and
