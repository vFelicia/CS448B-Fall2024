dude what i knew raphael says i'm really feeling more like a coder now her deep says kazi or son you're the best teachers i swear for real and nas they capture your focus in a jar and lock it damn and throw away the key samuel kabuska says just arrived from work straight away to code haven't slept third day but it's worth it please be patient and slow for tired guys like me thanks damn holy crap what a boss um frankie says oh thank you raphael for the five dollar donation wait was that yeah thank you raphael and um frankie came in sanchez and he says guys i'm a senior backend developer oh nice i always avoid the frontend skills because i never found a good way to learn you are on another level congratulations many companies would use this method for teaching i never thought i'd be loving react.js and doing my own projects dude i think we should be doing that soon man like we should be pushing enterprise level teachers yes a hundred percent what we should do is focus on helping everybody get jobs as developers and then help and then at their jobs help train their companies that would be sick that's awesome yeah sharing says you guys have revolutionized the learning experience to a new level to everyone thank you j sean of react and papa python thank you and zachary who dropped a 50 donation yesterday said so pumped to accomplish my why and become my own boss and live a real life that's dope dude wow jean pierre with the 25 donation yesterday said gratitude to you guys for getting me excited about software development again you guys are such a blessing yo this is awesome and then this uh siddharth said he wants to give a gift for his mom for her birthday coming up and uh he wants to learn the skills so then he can get a job so then he can afford the gift for his mom so that's sick amazing dude and guys this is as real world as it gets right like these are real people landing real world jobs from our projects that they're like learning to do right so for example we have jen here and she goes right at the end of the live call i got a phone call with a job offer at almost twice what i used to make so she was making like forty something thousand and this job offer was for ninety six thousand a year and she goes they mentioned one thing that really impressed them was the covet tracker this is the cova tracker she actually built inside of the profit with javascript um program and she goes we're learning real world projects that land real jobs yeah and just to give you guys some background on jen jen was actually she lost her job due to cover 19 right so she lost her job due to cover 19 but she turned that crisis into an opportunity and she doubled her salary which is insane guys so give it up for jen in the comments i think that is massive absolutely massive guys um all right we got a bunch of people here so that was jen sumit over here said oh this guy's sick dude they actually reached out in my dm's really this was during my dms go ahead yup he said uh he actually i actually put him on a live stream today so samit is based in boston right and he went on a holiday to new york city and while he was there he landed a sixfigure job at mathworks as a web application developer so what he did is he went ahead and built the netflix and the spotify clone and it was the spotify clone guys that he actually demonstrated to um his employer actually oh my god dude i just saw that holy crap we'll cover that in just a sec but like he literally guys he demonstrated that to his employer and landed a goddamn uh sixfigure job like it blew my mind i brought him on a chat today i had a i actually spoke to him he showed me proof insane stuff that's crazy that's crazy and i love that he actually even showed proof for it because we always want to see that thank you guys we just got some epic donations from you guys uh jen for ten dollars says thank you i want to change my profession from 20 years chef to a programmer and let's go because thanks i don't know javascript i'm learning a lot just giving me a head start beautiful and ganesha's dropped a 20 pound donation so thank you so much for that as well dude don't you love it how we see so many different professions move into the fields yep bartender from patch got a chef who's turning into programming that's insane insane dude i love seeing that and this was frank you guys who dropped a 100 donation a few days ago and he says guys i just landed a sixfigure consulting project for sonos to make their new react and react native radio station product they hired me based on the spotify clone i built using sonny's live video on youtube i'm so incredibly grateful for clever programmer team guys how sick would that be if you landed a job with sonos if you landed a job where you were making a hundred thousand dollars a year as a react developer the first step is you have to actually believe that it's actually possible for you that you can get a job so we want to show you a ton of people who are crushing it within our community and winning because there's not enough of that right so when you see you're looking on reddit or stack overflow you don't see people winning so then your mind doesn't believe that it's possible but if you believe that it's possible you can actually make that change in your life so that's why you know do you think that this would be amazing for you and also do you think it could be possible maybe for you exactly and guys this is like why we build this community so that you you don't you can actually see that it is possible not through us but through the actual results like these are people who've landed jobs from the clones that we built and the sort of people in the course it's insane it's really really insane 100 yep so um and then prince got his first job today on upwork and for 400 just because of spotify clone so that is freaking awesome and yesterday something else amazing happened where raja was like hey kazzy i got my third project within 20 days earned almost 5 000 and i was like hey give us some proof because i'm like maybe it's like not real or i don't know i just felt like from his message i'm like maybe it could not be real because somebody else like joked with us earlier and i was like okay and then we saw and he sent us proof from fiverr and look at this he got a thirty seven hundred dollar project that says thirty seven hundred i don't know if you guys could see it but that's freaking awesome right would you guys right would you guys like to have cleared 3 700 from coding or from a react project yeah like how cool would it be guys if you could have that same view right now on your computer and see a seven hundred dollar project all right oh nice donation by jumada thank you they say keep changing lives haven't done the challenge but love you all thank you for being here even if you haven't done the challenge that's okay guys we're just glad you're here yeah and now we

really want to spend more time with my little son dude oh he wants to do it because he wants to spend time with his little son that's why he wants to code by the way daniel and everybody in the comments is like hey done we're signing up amazing surya great job awesome and tech ahmed awesome yep great job so and his project is looking really good by the way i'm proud to say excited for join

was that us so guys give it up for luis that was freaking awesome great job with you guys thank you all right we're gonna now see uh jason also had an uh amazing experience uh with us working with us so i'm gonna play that for you guys that is awesome i know a lot of you guys have submitted them we won't be able to go through all of them but uh there are some that we can definitely go over now all right bro let's jump into this one uh my name's jason and my experience with coding by the way dude this audio is [ __ ] great like we should have audio that's this good is probably about like four months in i totally boot camp and it was pretty good you know i learned a lot of my foundational things i made about three projects with full crud functionality so he is talking about a coding boot camp that he's already had experience with and they built three projects i just don't feel like they look good or like real world applications so uh that's a really common thing right that happens even when people go to full stack boot camps or projects don't look that good or real world so common dude so coming for the job hunt and i think um i joined this clever programming because i wanted to get like real world applications and i looked at the channel and i was like totally amazed and i'm kind of like binge through everything now and just like go through all of those videos um i love all those clone ideas and i think the biggest achievement for me was like totally grasping all these ideas i know a lot of time you guys were saying pattern recognition but beyond that like i actually really like your basic and like simple breakdowns of these concepts because to me like it made so much more sense than what i learned in my coding boot camp to be honest um you guys explained it so so i'm looking forward to that and i really really appreciate this it was such a great experience thank you oh man that's insane jason that is an awesome video testimony if you're here right now thank you for sending that through that is amazing dude and also akeem just dropped a 5 donation oh thank you for that man i freaking love this like this is the thing that for me makes it real like yeah where they go from comments to like actual like oh my god these are like real human like these are people who are using this to get jobs better their lives like i don't know bro like that makes me when i saw those i was like i'm proud to work for clever programmer like i swear to god that's what i thought like when i was going through it though i'm just like i'm proud dude playing experience ever yeah yeah uh mine waleed says we the best team oh yeah dude have a programmer is the best team all of you guys are part of the family yep and this is going to be amazing yup totally honest simply sharing great knowledge uh love your guys's positive energy by the way thank you for that uh here's patches i love this one too dude patches of boss there we go more here checking in uh i'm an actor i'm a writer and i was also a bartender up until about six months ago when this damn coronavirus hit so i'm looking for a new opportunity so i decided to take up coding because it's creative and i've always been creative and so i love that about coding dude bartender oh yeah he was a bartender for 11 years insane and now he's switching to programming and look at that project and he was one of those people who's like oh dude i was up till 4am 6am like just coding and not quitting and there's something to be said about people who just never give up because even in coding um honestly that's that's what separates you like a good senior developer from a junior it's just they have the aptitude to keep on going even when they're debugging even when things get tough they don't quit they just keep on pushing guys so it's going to be something which is going to be crucial for every single one of you guys to make sure that you if you get stuck you don't cry you don't freak out you don't like start like uh wondering oh my god i'm doubting yourself you just keep going just like patch now let me know in the comments right now how many of you guys actually have ran into a debugging issue which is random which has lasted longer than three hours and you push put past it and you solve the problem let us know guys yep let us know and um jesus christ dude i just i give up i give up with all these tech issues um all right these are like the weirdest things that have never happened we'll keep going you can see my screen right sunny yeah what's happening um just hold on i'm i'm still alive guys so okay but don't move that as much so let's go have a look we got uh loads of people still joining if you haven't already joined links in the description make sure you add that webinar guys so jazwinder sodie said i sold an an error in eight hours damn that's amazing dude well done um mustafa osama actually dropped a really value point said most of the learn most of my learning comes from debugging dude that's so true honestly all the learning like when you get that gem all those things come from when it's solving that debugging headache like once you sit there spending ages let's say you spent ages on fixing a little problem i can guarantee you that is not going to be the headache like that is not going to be another headache in the future because you're going to have learned so much having run through that again and again and again like it's it that's really where you sort of master that little bit of skill okay right okay so what i'm gonna do is um my tvs back up okay great fantastic another donation by sri charon where he says with little full stack experience i'm grateful for you guys for making me pumped up to complete the amazon challenge halfway but super excited go on dude you can do it keep pushing and i guarantee you'll make it to that finish line i'm not sure if it's a challenge now for other people anymore i really think it's a challenge for us dude yeah same dude honestly the amount of tech that goes into it yeah okay we're back up and running hey let's go guys shout out to the team uh nas and frankie just helped my life out and my air horn is not playing anymore either all right great um okay so those were some great experiences here's another one ivan submitted one which is freaking awesome oh actually let's finish patches because i think patches is really good so um my experience in coding up until about two months ago was virtually nothing so i hopped on a couple classes got my html i love that until two years ago no experience or sorry until two months ago no experience in coding on my css skills partly savvy um and i joined the uh cp five day challenge because i wanted to learn from the best and i've uh i'm a big believer and if you want to learn something and do it right you just gotta throw yourself to the [ __ ] world let's go patch the hard way um and the achievement i'm most proud of is definitely making this here amazon hell yeah i'd be proud of that too bro i've yet to deploy it i'm still working out a couple bugs but rest assured i will get there um you know dude i like his style and it pays off right like other skills that he has of like being an actor and stuff like you can see it and his communication skills are so damn good you know take days off or do whatever i need to do but dude in two months building this that's sick but i really enjoy coding i'm having a lot of fun with it it's very frustrating as we all know but uh i will not super excited to uh see what happens next and i'm gonna steal your line quasi i love your [ __ ] beautiful faces and i'll see you soon hey let's go dude that was phenomenal guys if you guys enjoyed that with patch gave it up for a patch that was freaking awesome nice dude i don't know why it's going all bad quality right now oh i think for you so that's fine all right guys we're gonna look at one last video experience that i thought was really really cool and then with that we're gonna get into the rest of the training uh that we have planned for you today so here is one also from ivan and in the back you guys can see that he has of course this one okay um you can see in the back he has the um amazon project open yep hello there my name is ivan hernandez and i've been coding for three and a half months and ooh another relatively new coder what's your guys's experience by the way he's been coding for three and a half months i want to know like what overall is the experience of everybody who's here yeah i joined because i just wanted to push my limits and definitely i did um i was uh not super successful but very successful within my own limits and i was able to finish that's all that matters except the deployment part couldn't figure out as much but i'm very happy and very proud of what i achieved a lot of people are saying six months four months two years six months two months 14 days damn sort of that's brand new and i can taste like we also got no rash in the comments dude he says brother i'm just 12 and i earn 103 136 dollars this month by teaching coding like you nice great work that's phenomenal i love people who do that that's sick it's a great way to earn an income from teaching coding growing and we're going to touch base on that a little bit bro and keep growing and uh i really enjoy joy having this challenge it was a great experience it pushed me so flintstone in my career and like really byebye guys this was awesome uh if you haven't submitted your video experience yet go ahead and do that if you're in the facebook group the air table will still be there for you to upload your video experience and how you enjoyed the challenge sunny and i will be pretty much reacting and looking at every single one of them so still not too late and it's the only way to be considered for the prizes such as winning the six thousand dollar online coding bootcamp at cleverprogrammer and working with us exactly guys make sure you submit those portfolios and submit those um that form and we'll get back to you with some video feedback yep so make sure you guys do that because we definitely love to see we don't definitely love to just see that it gives us so much like we just love it you know the human interaction is what is um amazing to see all right guys now today for agenda for today's ex training share your experience videos from the five day react javascript challenge which we did we're gonna then go over your roadmap to becoming a six figure react javascript developer if you're excited about that

out a little bit over here all right guys let's keep on rocking and rolling so these are the units go ahead and enjoy them uh take them at your own pace this was day one's experience guys there we go so day one's experience was absolute fire we had 11 000 comments on the first post alone which is insane guys and we showed you how to build your react.js portfolio which a lot of you guys now have and you show off and and show to everyone because this is day two day two was insane crazy we had massive engagement and then we went ahead and done day three and four well we built out the remainder of the app so this was an insane experience let us know guys if you enjoyed this experience did you guys have fun oh yeah did you guys enjoy this yeah let us know how did you like it yeah did you have fun during this or was it was it really boring yeah like could be really boring too but i think that it was a a lot of fun but we definitely want to know what you guys think all right let's go this was the day three experience where we built the amazon we were building the amazon clone day four experience guys where we added the stripe and all that functionality and today is day five your road map to becoming a six figure react js developer so i hope that you guys are pumped and excited so now guys remember with react right it's one of the most popular things and javascript is actually the most popular language right in the world and this is according to stack overflow and with javascript and react you guys can make things like facebook facebook is actually done with react you guys can make android or ios apps like this with react native and you guys can actually even build server apps like netflix which we actually showed you how to build and by the way netflix front and engineers make 300 and 6 000 a year or more so that's pretty crazy would you guys like to make 300 6000 or more a year it would be nice then you can be like so teary and just donate like hundreds of dollars and it won't make a difference in your bank account literally won't even done the wallet yep so here's your earning potential as a react.js developer if you are you know getting a job in mountain view california 65 an hour or you're getting a job in u.s to be honest and if you do the math here 65 an hour multiplied by how many what is this eight why is it eight out of the week oh twentyone weeks uh twenty yeah twenty days in a week a month a month and then right that by twelve that's a hundred and twenty four twenty five k much 125 k guys insane got it i was like dude how many eight days in a week what is happening here yeah but yeah that's your essentially earning potential guys as a react gs developer and look at this frontend developer salaries within one year or over 63 000 a year or more so even if it was your first year and you got a job for about 60 000 that would be pretty insane and right now this is pretty insane because we just broke dollars over donation and we just got another 20 donation by chris cavern you guys are insane we love you guys oh my god this is insane go ahead without much development experience i had the worst feeling of uh of imposters these builds are so empowering thank you for rebuilding mine and the confidence of the developer community let's go thank you chris kevin for that amazing donation just insane dude god all right oh my god this makes me want to cry and laugh at the same time and i want to show this presentation and i hope no tech goes wrong i mean there's so much going on guys stop spamming the chat i will personally block you blocked somebody just got blocked in the chat please guys keep it clean we love you but just don't spam it because then it becomes a bad experience for everybody else and we love everybody so we want to keep it a clean experience all right so guys now whatever market you're in right it doesn't matter like you can be in any country in the world but you can still get jobs in u.s and canada and germany united kingdom u.s right is average salary for a javascript developers around six thousand a month and if you're react it's probably more canada is about four thousand a month germany's about four thousand a month united kingdom is about three thousand a month so it doesn't matter where you are in the world these are big enough markets for you to get a job in honestly for most of you can get a job in u.s no problem doesn't matter if you are in the us or somewhere else exactly guys and we mentioned on the next side so can somebody demand the chat on youtube frankie because nobody's being blocked or anything i'm having to do that yeah i just blocked someone as well so guys please don't spam it yeah like we just picked two huge donations from one from kyle potter five pounds he says hey guys thanks for all the work you do currently a test engineer looking to be a full stack dev how can i join without facebook so yeah go on guys the answer i was just gonna say that kyle potter says how can i join so that webinar that we have you don't even need to be part of the facebook group you can just click the link in the description below and jump on that webinar that's also when we're going to be announcing the doors opening to profit with javascript and sharing amazing case studies and results of other students crushing it and that is one thing you guys don't want to miss out on because we're going to be closing the doors to profit with javascript as well because what we like to do is we like to take a few students work with them get them incredible results just close the doors and not allow anybody new to come in and then a few months later open the doors again and then start getting new people's results as well because if we try to work with too many students you can't get them results so we like to work with fewer students and get them results so kyle jump on that webinar and definitely jump into the course profit with javascript as well you're going to be blown away yeah also i want to say a big shout out to rick felix yeah he says five dollar donation you guys are amazing thanks for the energy and the inspiration thank you all of you guys and especially rick um you guys energy is insane yup thank you so much here's a react.js developer salary for oh my god bro what's going on it's just insane oh god wow you buy 20 uh canadian dollar donation we're about to break 600 dollars in donation this has never been done before looking forward to make more clones and put into my portfolio if i get a chance to join team cp i'll be the happiest person in the world uh we are actually dropping a video today on how you guys can actually apply to work at clever programmer team cp our number one mission this year is to help 5000 people get jobs as a developer whether it's a javascript developer or react developer we don't care we just want you to get a job and make an income and so um we're looking for talent that can actually make fulltime content like us because this is one of the best ways to help developers you know and we make content for for everyone so we're going to drop a video on that soon exactly all right so back to the slides guys we told you that the uh entry salary was around 68 000 but your earning potential is a lot more than that so here we have the median of one hundred and twenty thousand and it goes all the way up to one hundred and seventy one thousand but remember kazi said netflix developers get 300k guys like 300k it's insane right so this is why this is this is median right this is like a median if it says median 120 that's better than average because average could be like one guy can be making like five million dollars a year as a react developer which is [ __ ] crazy but average will skew it right median is like what the majority of the people are making like the majority are making this which is ridiculous so nothing is stopping you from being on the high end or even higher than this if you're working for the top companies exactly guys yeah all right so here are the top tech companies that are using javascript and react so you got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay tesla did you guys actually know this by the way let us know that as well groupon netflix google uber or like do some of these companies surprise you like oh my god like tinder maybe some of you didn't know that react was using that or tinder was using react airbnb and paypal these are huge companies guys all use javascript and or react massive value and now what can you do with javascript or react these are the things you guys can do we've touched them on them already native apps web apps like progressive web apps desktop apps using electron which you know visual studio code is actually written with electron yeah how many of you guys knew that let us know in the chat yeah all right and uh you guys can make all types of apps right so whether it's like the beatboxing app you want to make you can do that with javascript and react if you guys want to do you know and this is by the way covered if you want to learn how to build the beatbox app we covered it in our profit with javascript course which will actually be launching in two days not next week in two days uh if you guys want to learn how to build the twitter app right would you guys actually like to learn how to build the twitter app all right and go from what's on the left hand side to what's on the right hand side if yeah then if you want to learn how to build this we build it in our profit javascript course which we'll be launching in two days yep it's pretty sick and here are all of the things you'll learn how to build inside of profit with javascript as well and in detail like netflix clone you'll learn how to build the airbnb clone the zoom clone how do you build spotify how do you build slack from scratch and how do you build facebook from scratch imagine this on your portfolio guys yeah and imagine guys being able to add all of this to your portfolio and then have coaching calls with myself with nars with the rest of the cp team and that experience and the apps are it's just like no boot camp touches that honestly no i've like i've seen boot camps i've been to a bootcamp this doesn't touch this they do not touch this guys this is like next next next level stuff which is why you see so many of the people who are submitting their video experiences and they're like i'm not taught this in a boot camp yeah um so guys we have over 1200 people registered for this training right now so make sure you guys sign up there right hey who is here oh nice dude quasi here right so you guys see all these people there are already chatting here they're in here and we got over 1277 registrants and they're like hey what's

13th we're already at 1285 people uh let me see if i can actually pull up the analytics to show you guys because it's really really cool like we have people from all around the world actually joining these trainings yeah really really awesome uh somebody asked uh can we can you remote work for the usa with the react yeah doesn't matter where you are in the world guys if you know react you learn react you can be anywhere in the world and tap into any market us uk canada anything you can do it you just need internet so exactly so take a look at this i think it's working now so take a look at this right we have registrants from all over the world like look at that that's amazing dude literally from everywhere so guys make sure you jump in we're getting a lot of people joining from youtube that's awesome so that means you guys are jumping in uh we got tons of tons of registrations and we definitely want to make sure that you guys get a chance to jump into this training and enjoy it okay

days from now awesome so let's continue with this epic training that we have for you okay boom so um now these are all the projects you're also going to be learning inside of profit with javascript as well so netflix clone facebook clone and guys these are all the projects you should be putting on your portfolio so whether you're going to join profit with javascript or not just take this out of it put projects like these on your portfolio that's how you're going to be able to get those 60k a year or 80k a year or a hundred thousand dollar a year jobs you know projects like facebook these are the things that people want to see even steven who's a cto who shows up on our live streams he's like hey the number one thing i look for is people's projects and their skills okay yeah airbnb clone we also have the slack clone oh [ __ ] yeah so all of this stuff is going to be included inside the course i'm going to teach you how to build all of that so exciting stuff guys let us know if you're pumped up for that yep abigail thank you for the donation and he says how are those projects different from the projects that we have on youtube so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going into more detail and behind the scenes with how you can actually build them also they're going to be nice and modularized for you rather than a long four or five hour long video so we're going to be breaking them up and giving you tons of like behind the scenes of react okay and also guys take the amazon clone as an example so you previously saw the amazon clone without the checkout functionality we then went and upgraded it to make it a full ecommerce app so think of it that way if you've seen the netflix phone on youtube think of an extra pumped up version of netflix clown yeah like a super portfolio job ready type of thing right so not just like maybe the front end but you're gonna have full back end the stripe functionality cloud functions ever like the entire mern stack you know how to use mongodb express react and node.js together to build an app like things that can actually really just land you jobs those are going to be covered in detailed uh in profit with javascript just because like on youtube you know people want to see fun content and if we made a video that was like 20 hours long people won't see it right so that level of depth is in the program exactly i love this comment by the way i just want to highlight so it's on youtube it says i uh derek coley says i love the way you teach you make it very easy to understand react because i gave up on react two months ago oh wow we pumped again and they're ready to learn more so thank you for this amazing appreciate you eureka and that's an awesome comment thank you that's awesome all right um so guys we'll be launching the course soon now let's jump into today's training and i'm going to touch base on a few of these but mostly just what i want to talk about right is before we even talk about any of that stuff is here's what a simple roadmap can look like for you becoming a react.js developer okay so for example you can see the whiteboard right sunny yep okay so if you are let's say you know let's say you're this person right here oh okay you're this person right here a disappearing human um that's you okay now if you want to become a react developer and let's say you have maybe just a little bit of experience maybe your patch right patch has what three months of experience yep all right so i'll just write patch here right so imagine patch and as you go in your journey we can make this the timeline all right so maybe this sunny let's say realistically if somebody goes hard how long would it take for somebody to land a job whether it's an internship whether it's a junior level developer job they want to land a job as a react developer and somebody like patch who's putting in massive amounts of effort how long would it take them from zeroth month to like when can they land a react job right so in all honesty if you're putting a hundred and ten percent effort guys the range would be between three to six months i would say if you're really crunching like and i'm not talking like you code a little bit you give up and you go to sleep i'm talking like you get those builds out you push and to be honest this could actually even be shorter than three to six months so like putting in that 110 though is an absolute must yeah that's a must so that is insane that if you can land a job between this period right over here between three to six months yep and it's very possible if you're putting in that amount of effort like patch amount of effort i can guarantee you this guy's gonna get the job and i guarantee you that everybody was like you could get a job in three to six months they're gonna be the ones who haven't gotten a job in three to six months or can get one and patch is gonna have a job and the clever programmer family are gonna be the people who have the jobs but like three to six months is a realistic timeline now let's talk about what should we do from the zeroth month right like let's just say this is zero yep uh and this is all months to the three month or six month mark so even tell me like maybe what projects should we have like what should we learn and what projects should we have and i'll like map it out on the timeline okay do so builds builds are huge right the more builds you can rack up in that portfolio the better it's as simple as that that's going to be your number one sort of ammunition when you go to that job interview and you you can like if you literally handed someone a resume with a link to um a little portfolio with all of your builds on right and these are not just pictures these are these are not just like github or repos with like random code in there these are like actual links that lead you to a working live online project yeah even if you literally had a one piece of a4 paper which said hey i'm raphael carzi check out my projects and they click it and they go to that link and check out all the actual projects guys that says a billion words in one that immediately builds trust sunny you know what we should do i'm thinking about this and we should do this probably after the challenge at some point you and i should start applying to jobs live on youtube and on linkedin or like actual and then have people like watch over the shoulder or we could do that in profit with javascript yeah i think i think that would be awesome dude so then we have like a smaller community and on zoom because they can communicate with us what we you and i can do is like literally have everybody who's in profit with javascript look over our shoulder and then we go and apply for jobs and they can lit exactly see how we apply for them and they can follow along i think we could even do that with freelancing sick okay all right down let's [ __ ] do it i'm down okay um so keep going um yeah so number one thing builds right builds are going to be absolutely huge for that progression right now there is something else i like to talk about it's called the 33 rule now most people don't really do this stuff like most people have no idea what this rule is and what most people focus their time on is they kind of sit in the middle ground right and now there's three areas where you need to spend your time one is learning and that's whether it be through tutorial whether it be for reading up on books or something whatever it is that's going to be 33 of your time okay so on your own level so that's on your own level so that's in the middle ground then you've got a third of your time with somebody above you right so whether it be uh learning from us on youtube whether it be learning from us in the coaching course on profit with javascript that's going to be where you want to spend it uh another 30 years and the final third of your time should be spent teaching now whether it be delivering value for absolutely free or whether it be coaching students under you but when as soon as you can teach something for example if you can teach a little bit of react right then you master react you go from becoming a normal developer to somebody who is a insanely good developer exactly and you guys will go to the next level so that 33 rule take notes on it take a picture of this memorize it print it out put it in your like everywhere so you can see it because that's massive actually if you spend 33 of your time learning 33 of the time people above you and 33 of your time teaching others who are maybe below you now suddenly let's go through the bills and map it out okay so let's just get really specific uh and also maybe with the react basics right so maybe i'll give you just some examples so maybe month one i do my react basics and like i become amazing at the basics or maybe month one i do like spotify clone and then month two like just give me exact detailed steps if i'm patch okay so in fact let's assume patch doesn't know anything right let's assume patch is a complete beginner i would spend my first month nailing the web development fundamentals so html css javascript right learn the web dev fundamentals so one month at least just spend it learning it playing around with stuff seeing how it works break stuff right because when you break stuff you learn from it when you fix it right that's month one then once two and three i would go hard on the builds like i would go hard on building things like the airbnb clone building thing like the whatsapp clone understanding how do databases work how do i connect my app to a database all of those things are going to be the juicy differences and probably somebody who is in the live and whatever and they're like what what makes you qualified to be able to talk about this you yourself have made how much would react and this is a question that sunny like never even shared anywhere publicly but i got them to like kind of share it on one of the live streams just like asked him randomly and he's like oh and he just gave up the answer so how much have you made in like a few years with react so when i started learning react within two and a half years i cleared over two hundred thousand pounds all right so that's what i'm talking about so two hundred slightly at the top quasi just cutting off yep okay cutting okay so let me um go ahead and just pull that a little bit there we go okay so when you say 200 000 pounds or can you do the math for me hold on let me actually ask siri convert 200 000 pounds to dollars two hundred and fifty five thousand nine hundred and eighty dollars and thirty two cents okay oh no all right so there we go so that's 255 okay that's literally puts you at a hundred k a year right like because you said two and a half years yeah two and a half years so somebody who's making ex like 100 000 or more per year as a react developer that's who you're getting this knowledge from you can't exactly it's not just some bs person and how long okay so another question i want to ask you how many years total professionally being paid did you work as a react developer how many total years did you work as a react developer in your entire life like professionally being paid yeah so it's been three i've worked three years in the industry but as a react developer yeah so so three years in the industry as a react developer and i've been coding guys for over just hitting over 10 years now got it got it and in those three years um this is the total in those two and a half to three years this is total amount we're looking at right with react yeah and this is what i want to emphasize right so this is what's insane like do you know how many people said to me i would need to be working for two years just to make about let's say like 40k a yeah 50k yes and if i listen to those people probably all the senior developers who are like pissed yeah and literally the senior developers like that now it's so funny because i'll go and i actually i bumped into like old senior developers when i'm in london and things like that and they're like oh what are you up to now and i'm like oh like what are you on right now and you tell them like as then when you have that conversation it's like if it comes out you tell them like oh yeah i'm on this much they're like what the hell like i've been coding for 10 years and i'm not on that and then but then i've been going for two years and it's all about there's a lot more to it than just the sort of development skills and that's something that you're not going to find elsewhere right so me kazi nas we've all gone through that pain that sort of like failure failure and now we've got a bunch of shortcuts and knowledge that we just want to share that's it exactly that's it we want to try to give back and you know for those of you guys who have known me for a while you've heard my story but i was also making over a hundred thousand dollars a year as a developer and then i found um you know i was like 20 21 and then i at some point i also got two developers who i hired from upwork and then i started managing them to work for my clients and i became the middleman so they would work on the projects and i would make sure they were doing a great job they were delivering for the clients and that put me like at well above the 110 or 120 000 a year mark around 22 23 so that was something that was a valuable experience for me and just a lot of fun yeah dude absolutely crushed and it's so cool because cause he took it slightly different route i took a slightly different route yeah and then we come together and it's like you guys just get the best of both right yep because you guys will get both you guys will get the full time you guys will get like how do you actually get those like insane jobs highend paying jobs and for me what i can share with you is how can you actually do it if you wanted to go to the freelancing route or maybe how can you supplement your income while you're doing a fulltime job right because suddenly you were doing that too at some point you were doing a fulltime job and then a freelancing job on the side yeah i mean i was doing a fulltime job freelancing on the side and i was teaching students in the spare hours so yeah we showed you how to pretty much do all of that yeah and how old are you sunny 25 years young hey damn so there you go he's not like some 40 year old here telling you how i learned that was actually [Laughter] i don't know where that voice came from um but all right so let's go back back yeah yeah he's laughing so going back to the road map we got so month one i'm covering and crushing my web dev basics month two i build what what exact project should i build the amazon clone or should i build multiple builds right so you don't want to limit yourself to just one go ahead and vote as many as you want so the amazon clone the more the better the amazon clone the netflix clone is going to be amazing to see if i'm in the if i if i'm in the profit of a javascript course and i'm like mastering the web dev basics right yep and then i can go ahead and do the builds exactly okay dope mastering web dev basics do the builds the coaching calls will help you out with that a lot um and yeah i would recommend focusing on getting as many builds built as possible got it and basically do that month two and three yeah exactly those months so you see the majority of the time is actually fixing towards a react and now a lot of people when they're starting out their development journey will end up doing months one two and three purely on the web dev fundamentals i flip it and i say like don't waste your time doing just that just get into jump off that cliff and figure out how to parachute you down okay i like it yeah don't literally like don't just sit there and say oh you know it's too hard to start we will literally hold your hand the entire way and it's and then and you will get it you will understand so many of students are literally crushing it and react is insane it's it's really insane so now i am i've got my web dev basics down i got my second uh i got my bills down in month two and three so let's say i've built like the spotify clone i built the amazon project i built uh my slack project i got like three solid projects done is that enough to start job hunting yeah i would literally start in fact i would actually this is what's crazy right in in the one month one i would tell you to actually start teaching straight away i was asking you to teach right so like you start to teach you can make an income in month one from teaching if you learn how to put a web together a web page together on a very basically other people right yeah teach someone else how to do that and then you can start making money at that point now months after month two you might have built a few builds and you might be comfortable enough to be like you know what let me go ahead and check freelancer.com or fiverr or something like that i might be able to actually pick up a client so at that point you can actually make money on that yep and then a month three you could be like okay i've got a few clients on my belt i've been i've done something now and you can start actually applying for a job like and it's really is possible and it's we've tried it's tried and tested and it works it's very possible guys um yeah like teaching is one of my favorite routes because i think it is lowest barrier to entry you just have to teach somebody who's one level behind you so for example even if you learned like patch right now for example um he and he can do he has just a two months of experience with coding he was a bartender before so zero experience with coding before that but now he's done some basics of web dev and he's built the amazon project he can not he can teach like 70 of the people on these online platforms that are looking to get coaching for like learning how to code yeah and platforms like wise and um is a good platform uh if you're in us we have take lessons which is another good one for us uh if you guys are not in us another great one is craigslist so yeah literally if i'm patch i can make posts with uh image like i would make sure that i i put my picture on there because people want to see you just like a smiling picture and then you just talking about you have coding experience and you can teach people how to build amazon project like literally i would write that in my copy for the ad and i promise you you will actually get so many clients from that it'll be crazy i started my career in coding off of i was three months in instead of going the job hunting route i actually um within the first three months i was teaching coding and i started getting tons and tons of clients because i would do crazy amount of outreach i would be like reaching out to 50 to 100 people a day and i was just like disciplined as hell about that i would just like reach out to so many people and i was able to scale my income to like within five to seven thousand dollars or more per month and then i just my teaching alone i was making over 100k a year and then on top of that i was getting software development jobs too like freelancing so yeah that really allowed me to push it over the edge but it depends on you guys right if you just hate teaching really don't want to do it okay don't do it but teaching for me was one of the biggest hacks because what it allows you to do is really it's a hack for you to like learn really fast has that ever happened to you guys where you were teaching a concept to somebody whether it's in coding or anything else in life maybe you were teaching somebody a tip on how to use like their computer and the first time you taught them maybe a math thing or a computer thing or whatever it really clicked in your head and you're like ah that makes sense yeah that's the power of teaching it's really just you learning but on like steroids because when you have to clearly explain a concept to somebody it like instills it in your brain so for me it was just a hack to become a better skilled developer extremely fast exactly but i got you hated guys how about a multiplayer game with javascript just imagine micro payments and going viral with such project rpg style can we do that next please hands up guys hands up if you want to hear that yeah hey that's beautiful that's a sick idea yeah okay dope um so yeah so that's what so if we were to do it again guys even if you wanted to make it extremely basic and you're like i don't want to go to teaching route that's fine first three months do bills web dev projects and all the projects we have already for you on youtube and also in profit with javascript course we go deeper so then those portfolios and those things on your resume will look even more badass and then between months three and six now what do i do sunny like what do what does like let's say patch does all of this what does he do between months three and six right so three and six is pretty much so once you land that job right so let's say you land the job oh you're skipping the you're you're skipping the part so let's say i did three months of builds and learning right now how do i land my job between months three and six right so you would want to set up different so it depends at this point you wanna you need to identify is it going to be freelancing is it going to be a fulltime job right two different very different things most people want to go full time so let's address fulltime as well okay so fulltime there's so many platforms out there right now so hired.com is one that i recommend oh nice okay higher.com yeah i use hired.com quite a lot now hired.com is basically imagine you flip the script with interviews right so rather than that you going and interviewing for all like sending out recruiter emails and all sorts of rubbish like that you just go onto this website literally put in your details and they come to you with offers right so they find you and literally i've landed literally two jobs off the site like and they're very good paying jobs like uh and and they also sent me a bunch of stuff as well like as soon as i got the job they even gave me a little coffee mug and they bought a champagne and a bunch of other stuff and a 300 amazon gift voucher so i couldn't believe it like it's insane so um so companies like this you want to sign up too um i would also recommend signing up to things like yzan and all those takelessons.com just if you haven't already if you're in us yeah if you're in the u.s and guys one thing that all of you guys should be doing without a doubt is recording your entire journey right whether it's on social media or anything like that because that is actually unbelievably powerful yeah because when we said teaching as well we were talking about you can teach through social media right if you write a post that's informative and you say hey here's what i learned today about react right dude that's gonna help somebody else that's going to help a lot of people out i'm going to slap a present we're exactly at 600 in chat revenue um dude that's insane let's go oh holy crap like that is insane wow thank you guys so much for that insane all right my bad i didn't mean to kill your flow no no that's insane dude like literally so now um yeah so after months three i would say pretty much go ahead and start applying so make sure you try and look for those kind of sites they're really really good um but just like kazi said right it's all about that aggressive approach tired is kind of like tinder for developers right it basically just the the other people hit you up tired basically makes you like a hot girl on tinder yeah exactly they just like beef you up literally like make you attracted to employers and then employers will come out and reach you and you just select which one you want that's pretty much literally such a nice experience okay no cruz noel bro crews just dropped a 5 donation he says i had technical issues while getting vs code studio working i was finally able to figure out thank you for sharing your knowledge yes bro thank you that is incredible wow yeah huge yep so tin deaf people are still talking about dev um so there you guys go that is basically one of the clearest road maps you can have to becoming a 100k a year react developer and so it doesn't get any clearer than that guys like this is exactly what you should be doing on month one two and three if it makes sense to you by the way drop in the comments below like does this make sense to you like yeah if it did and it brought some value to you smash the thumbs up oh yeah do it because this is really what it takes for you to get hired right and hired.com hencehigher.com and it makes your life so much easier than a lot of this going to indeed.com and like blast applying to a million platforms whereas here you can stand out now okay so say sunny i appl i apply on hired.com now what happens after that do i just wait or do i you know like go back to working on my coding skills or do i go on linkedin and try to reach out to as many people as i can like what is the process there or yeah yeah so you never want to stop moving guys right so i see a lot of people when they land the job that even when you land the job i see people kind of get into a comfortable place they get into a comfort zone you want to be far away from a comfortable spot like never be sitting in that comfort zone where you're not learning right if you land the job or if you're in the process of getting interviews keep sharpening that blade right keep sharpening that skill set make sure that you can really really um i think i think i don't know who said this quote if you guys know it drop in the comments but basically it was like i think it's abraham lincoln it was like if i've got like i don't know like five days i'm just gonna change the timing but if i've got like a year to um go ahead and cut down a tree i'm gonna go ahead and spend the first 11 months sharpening the blade hey right and then so like it literally is like a powerful quote because it's literally like you want to make sure your skills are dialed in that means signing up to newsletters for react signing up to newsletters for javascript yeah all these things are going to help you stay ahead of the curve yep right like investing in yourself to grow your own skills what i used to do dude that made me a really kickass developer really really fast is every single dollar i would earn on my own i would pay developers like on codemen i would go to codementor um which is are you familiar with that platform by the way or no codementor yeah yeah so i would go to literally a code mentor find some developer there so i can actually even show you guys this and i would find another developer there and i would hire them to teach me so say like i worked some job or i like taught clients or whatever and i was getting paid 50 an hour so say i worked for somebody for two hours and they gave me a hundred dollars right yep then i'd be like yo i only have like six months of experience of coding i would go online hire a developer from here on demand to teach me like python at the time um but you guys can actually pick somebody who teaches you react or javascript and i would pay them like 50 an hour 70 an hour so essentially i was trading my time and i was just feeding all the money back into them and then growing my skills for free because i knew my skill was the ultimate thing that was going to pay the most yeah so just reinvest every single dollar back into my own skill a lot of people are trying to invest all their money into 401k you uh you guys are trying to invest your money into ir roth ira you guys are trying to invest your money into stocks nobody ever gets rich from any of these things nobody ever breaks out and has financial freedom from any of these things it's complete [ __ ] like most places you look at how they got rich if you ask them how they put so much money into roth ira or their stock portfolios it's from they were doing something that earned them a really high income so focus aggressively on developing one skill that can get you a high income if you look at yourself like a stock you have the greatest earnings on yourself like for example sunny can have two choices right sunny can today put a hundred dollars into the tesla stock let's go back to when you were becoming a developer right you could have had you could have put a hundred dollars into the tesla stock or you could have put a hundred dollars into your own self to learn the skill of react yeah which one would have had like a hundred x return tesla is yeah and also another way to put it guys is what the mindset that we often see and that most of society is trapped in is if i said to you guys or like if your friend comes to your house and says hey like you want to go for a meal today or hey you want to go watch film you're going to go for a night out you pretty much i guarantee most of us will be like yeah yeah yeah let's go right yeah but if i asked you to buy a react a book on react or a webinar about react for 20 or like 10 you i guarantee the conversation would be a lot different you'd be like that's kind of expensive but we would all happily pay like 50 on a night out or 100 on the night out you see what i'm saying so like that mindset has to switch in order to achieve financial freedom otherwise you'll never just you're just never going to get there yep like yeah and one of the other things that happens is when you've had that happen right where you've got something for free versus something you paid a lot for and the massive amount of difference between how one of them doesn't do anything for your life because you don't care because it's cheap yeah versus where you paid for something and then you take notes then you actually do everything that's being said you actually go and complete the thing which is why oftentimes like coding boot camps get a success high success rate because if you're investing 10 or 15 000 into a coding boot camp you're gonna be serious you're not gonna [ __ ] around like you're like hey i'm committed to this whereas sometimes people just watch you videos on youtube and you know there's like fraction of a fraction of a fraction of people who actually take action right most people are just watching it getting entertainment out of it maybe it's like it they enjoyed watching the content but there's the tiniest amount that less than one one one percent of one percent of one percent that actually goes and builds projects and does these things so when it comes to investing in yourself whether you're trying to invest on code mentor whether you're trying to invest into a coding bootcamp whether you're trying to invest into our profit with javascript course whether you're trying to invest into a book from amazon into react or anything guys please do not be scared of that that is the guaranteed fastest way to get to a hundred thousand dollars a year as a react developer elizabeth who is also a dj and she's like dope as [ __ ] she pops up in her streams her name is future code she's like i don't know is she paying you for coaching yeah yeah so she's actually my oneonone coach yeah she doesn't i coach her so she's deciding to pay sonny to get oneonone coaching from him and now she's actually going through like a crazy technical interview and i think she's probably there today and she's in between getting a pretty sick job yeah that's true yeah she had it today guys and yeah i literally do oneonone coaching with her and she chose to invest in herself right now if any of you guys were on my instagram earlier i actually had corey on there and i'm coaching him as well um so these people are actually they choosing to put money into themselves and i'm telling you those are the people who are going to see those 10x 100x returns yep in the future here's something great i want to highlight okay so here's something that i want to highlight puttvik says are you kidding me twenty dollars per 15 minutes which is what some of the developers are charging on code mentor there's so many other resources to learn let me ask you pudvit exactly how much are you making and i promise you the answer is going to be putvik is making a very very little amount of money i can tell you that right yeah so this is what's called scarcity thinking you think that there isn't enough out there if you go out there looking for the freest resources all you're looking for is like cost and there's only a limit to how much cost you can cut but there's no limit to how much you can earn on the upper side now imagine this on the other hand where so teary is dropping 50 or 100 on the donation in just even our live stream right if you have a developer like sunny who can help you one on one he's not gonna be charging you two dollars he's going to be charging you more because his work and his results are worth more if you work with sunny you have really high chances of getting over 100 000 a year job but if you go to and learn from somebody who's charging maybe three dollars an hour from india and they're probably also not making that much right so maybe max you'll get a job for ten thousand dollars a year exactly guys so that really really crunches down to investing in yourself and actually i guess the way to put it is valuing yourself enough so that you are saying that to me what patrick's message basically says is he doesn't think he's worth twenty dollars for every 15 minutes yeah right if you're not willing to invest that into yourself to learn a skill you think you are not worth or will ever be worth 20 per 15 minutes yeah and then that's actually going to be your reality too yeah and you know what dude so many people are brainwashed by like society today like with education system they will happily pay like ridiculous amounts of money for university yep right like insane amounts of money for universities but like yeah like eighty thousand a hundred thousand a year for or you know uh for yeah now dude let me ask you a question like if i if i gave you like let's say i said to you right you have his 80 grand right you have two choices put it all into personal development and courses and all those things or it will literally pay for one year at university what's your decision people will always pick a university most people will because they're used to that but then look at the debt dude somebody who developed puts investment into personal development like you know like it's just results um i invested all into my personal development my skill set i grew really really fast as like a software developer now i'm lucky enough to work with amazing people and be a clever programmer and i dropped out of college because my professor was asking me for career advice and i was like you know i'll probably get out of here but i was investing heavily into personal development my own coding skills i had mentors for like physical fitness i had mentors for like learning more business and marketing skills i would have mentors for really everything and because i was just like i only care about growing my skill set because if you i feel like this right you can test a person and their character if i take everything away from you so who is sunny if i take every single thing physical thing away from you like your mic is gone your cool camera is gone your like instagram account is gone your everything you have if that is gone who are you what do you have what can you do and if you can code and you can make badass apps that's the thing i cannot take away from you yeah and that's the thing that's going to make you really yeah i've never thought of it that way it's a really really nice way of putting it yeah yeah like i'm a big big believer in that so that's why you guys have to change your mentality from thinking about expenses and something being expensive and you guys got to think in terms of value right so if you think in value everything changes you know cause you actually change my mind on some of that and guys this is like a true story right now so i remember i was saying to quasi yo should i upgrade my screen and my setup even the mic right like things like that like i mean cause he went back and forth he was like dude like why are you even questioning it the fact you've been asking for longer than five minutes right now buy the thing it's gonna come back to you right it's an investment in yourself and ever since then ever since we've started doing that things are really they grow things are going much better like you you're much more efficient with your time so don't even waste five minutes on the decision if it's gonna if it's something an investment in what you love and what you think that you believe in yourself to do then go ahead and jump and do it yep 100 like i cannot stress this enough like if there's one hack you're looking for to become rich if there's one quick tip which is what a lot of people are looking for is aggress as aggressively as you can invest in yourself to grow your skills be religious to skills money is a lagging indicator of your skill and the value that you bring so i'm going to say this one more time it's really important for you to understand money hold on so this stuff right here right this whatever it is this is a lagging indicator of my skill and the value that i can bring okay so now if i can only clean your floors in your house you're gonna be like okay bro here you go like you did a good job today here's like 20 bucks okay great now i got 20 bucks but i learned the skill of actually cleaning the floors i if i even clean them really really well maybe you'll give me like a five dollar tip and you'll be like hey bro here you go here's 20 bucks and then here's a five dollar tip and you're like boom there you go right but now on the other hand let's say that you're actually developing an app let's say you're serving the app to millions of people like tinder and you're helping change the world you're helping people have kids getting married match make on an app like tinder or hire.com or whatever now you are providing crazy amount of value right but then you hire me i'm your react developer and i have to now turn your tinder app or whatever uber app into a reality where it can help millions of people now i can bring you so much value it's crazy you're gonna be like bro you're just gonna let you you'll be like here's a hundred bucks here's another 20. here's another just take everything like take it all because what you're bringing for me is changing the entire world and i get to make a lot of money and i can grow my business and i can help people so here you go like this is not anything to me like does that make sense guys like it's just money just a lagging indicator of skill and value so if you spend all your time on the skill and value they can provide to people then as you do that months or years later then you can get a lot of this but if you think extremely short term and you do everything that gets you money right this second and you don't invest in your skill and you do parttime uber and you spend all this time doing like crappy jobs that don't let you work on your skills then this is what you get right now and this is also what you get in the next 10 years if you can eat [ __ ] and focus just on your skills you will get nothing right now i'll give you zero dollars right now but then here like maybe you can make like hundreds you know of dollars or more and that all goes to you yeah dude that's so powerful money is a lagging indicator if you think of it that way it really just rewires your brain in some sense yep right like it's true because most of us like we get paid a certain amount and we're like that's my worth it's not your worth it's a lagging indicator i will prove that to you i will prove that to every single person who here here's a here's a very basic example of money being an indicator of value okay take a look at this how long have we been live one hour and 41. okay how would you guys like to make 609 per 1 hour and 41 minutes would you guys like to make about 600 an hour that's insane yeah we're about 300 let's just say 300 an hour would you guys like to make that yes or no how is this happening and this is just donations we're not talking about anything else why is this happening the value that like sunny and clever programmer team right we are working hard to provide value to millions of people millions every single day our stream ends we have these messages in our own slack team it says 151 days of watch time a hundred days of watch time 200 days of watch time you know what that means every two or three hours we help move the world forward by 200 days by a hundred days so we're providing massive value up front right so then it's really easy for us and for to justify 300 an hour or more just and that's just donations you can do the same thing exactly that's why like i want you guys to get out of the mindset of something is expensive only think in the mindset of what can i do right now that can make me so damn valuable like whatever our course is right profit with javascript whether it's 300 or 500 or 900 doesn't matter what it is but if you were to invest that and on the other side there's a potential for you to make thirty thousand or fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars or more per year are you really losing money right are you really losing anything or not just our course right if you're investing in somebody else's course on udemy or their own platforms or whatever it is it's an investment in yourself so i just want to make sure that you guys know how valuable you are and that you are your biggest investment and asset exactly and guys investing is not just monetary right it's not just money when we're talking it investing your time as well is also a huge investment like if you're waking up late going to sleep late you're not really getting much done in the day right like you're wasting so much like valuable time that could be dedicated investing and learning where you can invest this stuff into yourself so even if you don't have the money as such you can start that transformation right now by changing the way that you spend your time wake up early get that sleep in before and don't stay up late watching netflix every day like those subtle changes or what leads to you then improving as a person improving your skill set that builds up your monetary value because you're going to be able to do more with your time and then you can do what kazi said so you can start right now regardless if you have the money or not and guys if you want to start right now and actually this won't cost you a thing and this is going to be a thing that is they'll bring so much value to your life if you guys enjoyed this today wait till what we have for you on day six which is september 13th which is two days from now guys it's gonna be the most valuepacked thing you have

data structure and algorithms exactly how dev roy says how i can mix my skill of javascript with react um okay i think he's saying java i think he's saying java would react okay so i actually came from a java background so um to help you out there dude just start right so honestly just start you use the resources use clever programmer use proper javascript use w3schools um learn how to google

action takers get the best deals and then as we begin to get late action takers and people are procrastinating um it's gonna be more expensive um and the best deals or the bonuses are not gonna be there so because we wanna incentivize fast action takers to join first so then because those are the people who crush it right those are the people like patch who join those are the people like louis who join and they're all action takers they're already crushing it even the video testimonials you know they were like crushing it yeah i saw somebody say how do i join today uh you literally just go

javascript course and you know if you're watching this and this page is still up you're lucky because this page will be closed down and um you will have to be on a wait list but if it's open right now it means you're still able to join exactly guys yeah so there you go we have to watch this closes guys i can't stress to you enough like we try to keep it very selfcontained which means once the doors close you won't be able to access this page okay so it is temporarily open right now and then on sunday we're going to actually open the doors for every single person and then once those doors close like they are done they are closed that that it is a exclusive environment yeah we'll give you a little bit of a sneak peek of this program right now hold on where is this audio coming from i'm going to figure this out in the meantime let's check out the comments so uh ahmed says do you need to learn javascript then react yes it's part of the you need to learn like sort of the fundamentals web dev like html css javascript but all of it is covered in inside of javascript we teach you if as we assume that you know nothing and we teach you from the absolute beginning so even setting up vs code we run from that level and then we take you all the way up even with coaching calls and everything until you're at the point where you're absolutely crushing it landing clients teaching people adding jobs we're going to hold your hand the entire way uh what why why do i get the weirdest freaking errors on this entire planet oh there is also one more person with pwj um that is nas yeah nas is also teaching yeah thank you thank you so much baby that is legendary i just got some food delivery let's go thank you everybody my amazing girlfriend amber lee hi to everybody hi everybody oh i don't know where to look everybody give it up for my amazing boyfriend quasi hey let's go guys all right let's get back into it so um let's have a look so all right hashtag girlfriend op hey let's go i will never understand ever why these errors happen to me i'm paying for sound source see over it yeah go down that's what all right fine so guys you can go and watch this video it's on this page but if you want to join today you can uh but we're going to be opening the doors officially on the 13th yep exactly guys all right so there we go is it not working the audio oh yeah that's actually right so the audio is not gonna be working so that's gonna be pretty pathetic what i just don't understand these like weird errors uh zero one text says uh your message if you write in all caps it's gonna get blocked by the nightbots we have like an automatic moderator so please don't write in all capitals um so text says please can i have somebody teach me for one week if you're inside a proper job we run coaching calls where i run them it's a zoom call which means that you guys can have a full conversation it's not like this where we have just text um yeah it's not like this where we just have text and things like that it's going to be a complete conversation that's going to be huge for you guys yep exactly so i think that's going to be massive um i'll try to see if i can try to play some of them with um i don't know if they'll actually play or not but let's try let's do it i don't think it's gonna play but uh i started coding just a few months ago when i was furloughed um i jumped into the fiveday react challenge to try and push myself i wonder if i could i think they can hear it if you guys can hear um chris that's great but he said i started coding when i was furloughed after i was furloughed from the job because of covid i did i was really really nervous about it dude that's not in the comments if you can hear this i was really nervous i think they can hear it bro i i can't hear it but they can hear it i'm happy that i took that leap of faith um as far as the future is concerned all right let's just let play continue yeah i'm listening to it continue to learn uh hopefully reach a point where i can land multiple clients so he's saying i want to reach a point where i can land multiple clients or make some money above all else be happy while i'm doing it and in the back he's actually like coding it up i just want to say thank you and uh see you along the road see you guys nice nice oh did you see stuff that's awesome dude here's andrea this one was a cool one too if we have any other ones you like sunny we can play them as well yeah so let me have a look nice glad you guys can hear it at least somebody can hear it veronica's pretty much she's in the slack channel in react challenge that one was awesome i'm making a great effort to see an a certificate damn what a badass yeah that's awesome a badass so on slack there is in the react challenge group there's a amazing video that i've uploaded by veronica let's go ahead and play that one um okay in react on september 2020 uh oh in the channel yep oh my god we're starting to get so many groups again in slack yeah it's a freaking nightmare someone said where is nos noz is right behind kazi guys yeah nas is right behind me so i'm gonna move my chair and it will reveal gnaws give it up for wow beautiful beautiful all righty here we go here we go i will never find whatever we're looking for oh we took a massive donation from louise fernando sanchez so much for it yeah so a 20 discount 20 discount now i'm 100 sure he's activated again just five minutes so guys the price of the program it's like if you find it for below underneath like five thousand dollars if if you find it for less than five thousand dollars profit javascript it's a steal just take it yeah because it's only gonna go up like it's the price is gonna shoot up to a thousand or more very very soon in like one or two weeks it's gonna be over a thousand bucks so if you get it for anything less than that it's a crazy steal because all the students keep telling us this program is worth more than a five thousand dollar coding boot camp cause you're like this program is worth more than the 15 000 recording boot camp that i just took it's an insane program at this point with like three to four weekly coaching calls you're getting insane projects that are landing people a hundred thousand dollar a year job so if it's a hundred dollar 200 difference don't worry about that just get the program if it's less than 5 000 you're good you're getting the best deal possible exactly anything less than five thousand don't trip over what did they say don't trip over dollars to pick up pennies all right don't trip over dollars to pick up pennies all right let me play this one oh [ __ ] i just hold on i full screened it on my tv um she even added subtitles sick yeah this one's this one's insane all right here we
