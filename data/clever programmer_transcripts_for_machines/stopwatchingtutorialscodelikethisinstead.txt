look i get it most of you are stuck in tutorial hell a lot of you can't seem to get yourself out of that this is something i was in for the longest time that i can imagine and it's one of those things that probably frustrated me and just straight up [ __ ] on my career from getting better for the longest amount of time because all i kept doing was going tutorial after tutorial and don't lie to me right now because i know you're probably doing that there's a high chance of you whether you're watching clever programmer tutorials and you're doing build after build or you're watching udemy or something else out there whatever it may be you are not making a lot of forward progress and what do i mean by forward progress what i mean when i say forward progress is really are you working on projects that excite you and are you working on stuff where it's useful to you and going on your portfolio are you working on things and are you able to code from scratch and build real world things because if you can't do that i mean to be honest you're kind of screwed right like you're not getting making forward um you're not gonna be making forward progress you're gonna be kind of just like stuck forever you know like if i was to show you on the screen it's kind of like um let me see if i can open this up boom so if i was to show you here you'd be just like running in and this is what most of the people who are coding right like you're just kind of running in circles forever and it seems like there's never any getting out of there going after tutorial after tutorial and what you want to be able to do is you want to preferably be able to go in a straight line where your career is moving forward like this but right now what's happening is you go to one tutorial make progress then you go to another one make some progress then go to another one and then maybe you even start picking up a new framework where in my opinion you're making backwards progress sometimes because if you want to get really really good you should just stick to one thing and keep getting better at it like for example in the start i personally don't think that you should be learning like basics of javascript and then moving on and trying to learn react and then trying to learn next js and trying to learn ever like all of these other things because instead of making forward progress really what you're doing is you're branching out you're make some forward progress with javascript then you start all over again make some forward progress with react then you start all over again make some forward progress with um you know what is it next js or tailwind css or whatever is your flavor of the month and you're not really making any forward progress at all in reality what you should be doing is pick up javascript and just start coding day one okay then this is day two code day two then if i keep going right this is day three and when i say you're coding i literally mean you are coding like yes you can watch tutorials yes you can try to pick up exercises but like code [ __ ] that you could do with whatever you do know for example if you learn if else make a freaking game out of if else you can take if else statements so far make something interactive where if you have a if else block i can type in something a popup happens and then i type in you know guess you can make guess the number game with fl statements right if i guess 50 it goes too low then i guess uh 30 and then it goes too high then i guess 40 and then it's like close and then i'm like 42 and it goes correct you could do so much so then do that and you should be coding or thinking about coding or problem solving for many hours in a day so many of you have this crazy freaking problem with being able to sit there and think and focus for a long period of time if you cannot sit there think focus for a long period of time i'm not gonna say you're not gonna become a coder ever but like you're gonna have so much more difficulty right because for example if you are sitting there and you have trouble focusing you're making turtle like progress every day right so like for example this is you you make this much progress and that's all you got done in day one and then day two you make this much progress and that's all you got done in day two then you make this much progress that's your day three right and then you have a freak like me who will code there like a [ __ ] just not stop and i'll code for 10 12 14 hours and especially when i was picking it up as a skill i was literally coding 12 to 14 hours a day so then you have somebody who's not more talented than you who's not smarter than you because i failed my math classes i sucked at them but i will sit there and code for that amount of time and that's and that's my one day okay right and then and if we keep going this is my second day i've made this much progress on day two this is my day one and day two whereas like for you and most people you're gonna be here on day six right what i got done in in the in one day because with coding unlike let's say you're doing power lifting right with power lifting okay yeah if you dead lift and squat and bench if you did it for like more than two or three hours you'll start to have diminishing returns where you've broken down your muscles so much you literally need to give it more time to recover and heal with learning you can learn for 14 hours a day and then go to sleep let your brain process that and then wake up the next day and do that again with learning there's nothing that kind of messes you up or is in the way with um with uh when it comes to power lifting you need time for recovery because you're literally breaking down your muscles but learning you can just keep going okay so that's a huge advantage and you can do this for example where else can you do it okay when you're driving your car can you listen to a podcast about coding boom there's your extra learning time okay if you drive for one hour you're like hey i have a long commute great one to two hours a day one to two hours you are able to now um you're now able to learn coding okay or learn about coding which is super super important if there's other things you're like hey i am i i have to use the bathroom so i just need to kill that time if you're in the bathroom or you're showering or if you're not showering you're just freaking going um and pooping right you can watch a youtube video that's talking about code and maybe it's even interesting or maybe pick something that might excite you but you need to be doing things that constantly move you forward excite you brainwash you to want to code and makes you want to do things right most people first of all they'll only code very limited amounts of time and second of all they will never do their own learning like most people will just only do the learning that's prescribed to them through whatever their school tells them to do or whatever their youtube tutorial tells them to do or whatever their udemy tutorial tells you to do if you keep doing that here's what's going to happen and let me just make sure the audio is audio is good let's check the audio okay it's looking good there and let's check here beautiful so what's gonna happen when you do this is that you're you're just gonna be like stuck and you're just gonna be confused and you're not gonna make forward progress okay and also when you go to a job interview if you weren't able to turn things into your own and you weren't able to code something creatively and you go to a job interview and i tell you hey turn it into this you won't be able to do that you won't be able to make it something custom and you won't even be able to solve the problem they gave you because all you taught yourself how to do is to follow a tutorial so you got the skill of following tutorials but you did not work on your skill of thinking and you did not work on your skill of problem solving so you're not going to get the job you're just going to be stuck so this is why right this is so important like use all this time that you have at your disposal if you're washing dishes learn coding watch a video listen to something okay what else is there there's there's dishes uh driving there's tons of countless if you're cleaning the house you can be listening or watching something related to coding okay if you drive a truck all the time that's perfect for listening to audible listen to the story of how linus torvalds you know built linux listen to elon musk's autobiography listen to books that either personally develop you or make you interested in coding or straight up podcasts that talk about coding i know wes boss has a podcast called syntax and there's a bunch of other ones out there i don't care what you pick i just care you pick something and you learn and you keep improving your skill because at the end of the day it's about the hours that you actually put into this skill and that's all that comes down to if you're not putting if i have more hours like assuming our intelligence levels are equal so let's say that your intelligence level is here and my intelligence level is here okay um my bad i meant to make equal lines so these lines are fairly equal okay this is line one and this is two they're fairly equal well um we're both going to be pretty much at the same level right but now if you if we're same amount of talented but now if you're putting in two times the time as me to learn coding you have just 2x yourself okay now if you're brainwashing yourself and watching documentaries like instead of watching netflix at night in your wind down time maybe you're watching mr robot maybe you're watching a show like silicon valley that is entertaining funny but still hypes you up and excites you about coding and programming and you're kind of altering your reality to become that of a developer now instead of 2xing your results now you have four extra results okay and this this multiplier can keep increasing if you're taking care of your body and you're sleeping healthy and you're eating healthy and your body's clean and now when you code and learn coding your memory is stronger because you're able to retain more information you have less fogginess so you can absorb more information and actually apply more information now you've doubled maybe the result of the previous 4x multiplier and you've 8xed your results okay every time you add a new element you essentially double your results so one is for example maximizing your time right the other is kind of immersion which is like what i was calling like uh brainwashing yourself and then um i don't know what was the third one i forgot somebody in the chat will let me know but i'm not live so that won't help but whatever the third one was right that that is what gives you that multiplier each new thing that you do oh yeah body okay with each thing you do essentially is a new multiplier and gets you freaking jacked in your career and when we say 8x well 8x is massive because what 8x really means if we get out of this is you're going to achieve in one lifetime the results i will achieve in eight lifetimes you've 8xed your results you've eight extra career results you've also eight x shortened your results that you would get so for example let's say in your coding career the success you would achieve in 30 years well now you've 8xed it so just divide 30 by 8. so what's 30 by 8 30 where's my 30 divided by 8 that's 3.75 3.75 years so now you're getting 30 years of results in 3.75 years which is kind of ridiculous when you put it like that but you're essentially getting incredible results so then people ask you hey how did you get that sixfigure income so fast hey how are you able to build these real world applications and you were able to figure that out so fast that's how you have maximized your time you've maximized your body and you've maximized how much you believe in it the immersion if you start to now make friends this also goes towards immersion if you now go from friends who talk about gears of war or call of duty or league of legends or complain or negativity now if you replace that with friends who are cool friends and also talk about coding that's another multiplier that's part of the immersion multiplier now what you've done is you have friends that add value to your life and you have they fasten you to speed up your growth because as you're speaking with them yes you're having fun you're having a conversation but you're learning at the same freaking time so they're realtime tutorials that are teaching you okay but they're more practical even than tutorials okay because tutorials are great but they will not make you a better developer a lot of the times because you're just stick you're stuck there watching somebody else you will make progress when you do it so even when you watch tutorials i highly recommend you keep pausing them you keep building your own thing you keep switching it and changing it until that app is now yours completely yours completely unique or maybe you had a like if you somebody's building a blogging app you copy that and turn it into a video app okay that's how you win that's how you will win all right so these are some of the things i wanted to share with you maximize your time with coding don't go wow i have one hour a day two hours a day that's not gonna make you good you have to invest a lot of time if you have a family if you have kids which i know a lot of you do a lot of the students that are in our coding boot camp i know you hi if you're watching this archana hi if any of you are watching this hello brandon i understand you have families you have kids you have maybe even a job that takes up so much of your time whatever time is left over spend it into coding and during your time you can still be listening and learning about coding you can be literally watching my youtube videos and talk hearing me talk about coding and even if you're not seeing the screen even that might help just because you're getting familiar with the thought patterns what i'm saying the lingo it makes it less intimidating it has a huge impact so keep an eye out for that okay so that's all i have for you today okay if you enjoyed this video smash the like button subscribe to the goddamn channel because this is the channel where you learn everything react react react native and also full stack development and last thing i want to let you know is that for the cohort of june we're going to be shutting down enrollment for our full stack mastery boot camp in just a few days okay so for the june cohort it starts june 1st so in the next five to six days we're going to be shutting down enrollment for that so if this is something if you want to learn with me and my team and you want to be in our immersive coding boot camp that we just recently launched it's an incredible boot camp and i mean we just dive deep in this boot camp so just a couple of things that you should know it's uh six to eight months long right now we're we are making it even eight months because other boot camps they just don't do you justice like in two to three months you're not going to become a great developer i'm sorry but that's just the truth of it okay the only people that become successful out of those boot camps are people who already know coding so this bootcamp is mainly for people who are looking to switch careers or complete beginners and like looking to learn all of the skills if you're more advanced you will still get your ass kicked and learn a ton of things okay so you're going to learn data structures and algorithms we're going to teach you all the front end back end you're going to learn everything okay so if this is something exciting to you and you want to speak with me or my team members about schedule a call with us okay in the link below i'll have the you know there's a form fill that out in as much detail as possible currently we're mostly working with u.s students okay so if you're us go ahead and apply and fill out the details because we are very selective about the students that we take so we can only take a couple of students at a time so please fill in on as much detail as possible so then that gives you a chance for for me to pick up and get on a call with you or one of my team members to get on a call with you and then we'll just let you know i'm gonna be honest with you okay we're gonna be honest with you if it's a good fit for you we're gonna let you know if it's not a good fit for you i will tell you hey self teaching is better for you so save your money um hey this other bootcamp might be better for you we will just be honest with you okay my number one goal is that you actually get a job you actually increase your skills my number one goal is not to take your money i don't care i want to see you succeed i love your beautiful face this is qazi as always i'll see you in the next video
