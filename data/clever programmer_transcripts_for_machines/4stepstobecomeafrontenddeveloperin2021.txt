now when you look at front end nowadays it's it has gone like a little bit more complex than it used to be there's a lot of things you guys have to kind of know about of course you have to know about html css a lot of our channel is pretty heavy on react as you guys will see you know and in this video we'll go deeper into it but this is just to kind of show you guys the overall road map we're going to be looking at when we're talking about front end all right guys so the three most important things guys when you're thinking about front end right you're thinking about the front end view right what you see on the website that includes what that includes html that includes css and that includes javascript and those three are the most important things that you guys need to learn as the base foundation for a frontend developer so guys check this out so stack overflow does surveys every single year on at hundreds of thousands of developers and javascript html css you know are literally always for the past few years have been at the top of the list what can you do with javascript first things is you can build web applications right so web applications include things like guys facebook that's a web app right we can build native apps i don't know if you know tesla the actual app for your ios and android is built with react which is insane right and you can also build server apps so server apps are your backend applications using node.js and those are very popular as well here are the top companies that are actually using javascript so what are these companies here we got facebook microsoft linkedin ebay groupon right tesla netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal insane guys and half of them we already built clones for half of them already so oh yeah so now the most popular frameworks are which ones not we got angular obviously right then we also got view and then we got our favorite one quasi react hey yeah and i think you know what one as you can see from here right a lot of companies are using the all three frameworks are both very popular you got for example angularjs used by companies like the guardian upwork paypal sunny react gs airbnb instagram by ubereats and then ujs alibaba grammarly giblet and guys and so much more that's just the starting of it right which should you choose so when it comes to framework there's a big war between the most loved frameworks the most dreaded and the most wanted under the most wanted you will see my beautiful friend react.js is by far the most wanted angular is a little bit on the downward trend and the view is doing okay the reason for that you guys is angular is a lot more opinionated and it's a framework view is a framework react is actually just a library so it's pretty much like you're just using javascript so it's extremely lightweight and then it's super powerful which is why companies like instagram and facebook are using it so one of the big things guys in react is all about managing data that's you know that's what kind of sets react apart from a lot of these like framework frameworks and it's something called redux and it's a little bit hard to understand but we're going to go through it so let's go ahead to the next thing so redux context api that is when you were able to for example properly you know store data think of it as like you know data a local data of your on your application and then kind of use it throughout your whole app so whenever you change one thing for example on one side of the app right another thing will be able to change as well so it kind of talks in sync with each other as bruce buffer apparently says we have tons of live builds that we've put on youtube and you guys can check them out we actually did a zoom clone build we did spotify clone build with react we built ticktock with react we built youtube clone with react we built tinder with react and we built a bunch of other things like netflix would react right over here and we built instagram with react and a realtime chat app for facebook messenger and just yesterday we built slack realtime chat app with react so guys if you are looking to learn and react you are in the right place or if you're looking to learn just javascript in general you're in the right place so i'm going to share the screen here um look at our subscriber account you guys after we started live
