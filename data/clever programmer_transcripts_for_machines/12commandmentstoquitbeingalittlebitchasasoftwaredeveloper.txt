become a software developer and skill to sixfigure income as a freelancer now Before we jump in I want you to smash that like button so we can crush that YouTube algorithm and get this video out there hit the subscribe button if you yourself want to become a sixfigure freelance developer and let's continue now these 12 commandments that I'm about to share they are hopefully really profound for you I mean this is something that I have spent years curating not all of this is coming from my brain but tons of books that I've read I was inspired on an airplane ride back home from Chicago to LA to LA and on the airplane I decided to ride these because I saw and in one of the Facebook groups for our courses there was somebody who had a really negative mindset and when I saw how they thought and how that person talked it made me realize if a developer has those qualities it's very very difficult for them to succeed or really anybody has those qualities it's really difficult for them to succeed so I wanted to write out 12 commandments that no matter where your life is at if you followed these this would help you tremendously so let's just get straight into it number one read if you don't have a book in mind already to read I recommend reading Millionaire Fastlane for two hours a day starting today it's amazing how much of a profound impact reading can have on your life it has completely changed my life it has helped me do over 1.2 million dollars in the last three years from complete zero and it has an impact on my fitness my mindset really everything so you know whether you want to do audible Kindle do it read number two consumption detox zero garbage n zero shows zero movies you're gonna suffer from withdrawal that's okay a lot of people go through a very terrible experience when they give up their shows and movies because it's something that you love so much even I do but if you really want to have a profound impact on your life this is one area where there's a lot of time that goes into I'll give you an example for it clever programmer and my brother who now has a really amazing channel called Waqas Kazi the cause man and he helps colorist become professional and help freelance helped become freelancers he never would have started his channel because he used to play fifa all the time that was his drug for me it was chess and video games and that stopped me and even TV shows that stopped me from actually creating a lot of amazing things in my life as a developer that might be stopping you from working on your portfolio spending two extra hours a day learning how to code it's so easy to just sit there and waste away two hours it doesn't even feel like anything but remember poor people are cheap with their money rich people are cheap with their time become cheap with your time because time is the only thing in life you'll never get back money you will always get back so take your time seriously number three track time set an alarm every thirty minutes and then just write down what you're doing seems extreme it's meant to be literally take a notepad or something and then just write down exactly what you're doing and all you got to do is just write down one word so if you're watching a movie just say Netflix if you are you know watching a show just say Netflix if you are doing emails or something else or something for entertainment just say entertainment that way after a week is over you can see how the time was spam what buckets and categories don't change anything just spend time and just track it every 30 minutes and write it down you'll be able to look at what percentage of your time went into wasteful things what percentage of your time went into things that helped you create what you will find at the end of the week is maybe there's 10 to 15% of your time being wasted somewhere or and when I say a waste I don't mean like you're spending with your family that's good time what I mean is that it's just being leaked because you're scrolling on Instagram for 3 hours a day very important place to check number for daily outreach manual EDM and reach out to 30 to 50 people per day if you're trying to increase your income as a freelance developer or you're just trying to increase your income with whatever skills that you have you need to be reaching out manually unless you have an audience already like look on my youtube channel I have an audience I have a big email list of people so for me I can I still called outreach for my new business I actually created as tiktok then called outreach to those people and then landed a client from there for $2,000 a month for you if you don't have if you don't do content marketing and you aren't getting inbound leads meaning people coming to you you need to be reaching out at 30 to 50 people a day if you are making less than $4,000 a month or $5,000 a month what are you doing if your goal is seriously to increase your income then that's what you need to be doing 30 to 50 people a day and offering to either teach them coding and charge them 500 dollars a month for four sessions per month or you can help freelance will you reach out to 30 to 50 people ask to intern but if you aren't in doing that and your income isn't going up I mean it's really your fault number five zero ego have an extreme learner attitude what I say is you can have a zero ego or you can have zero profit and if you want to keep your ego guess what you get to keep her debt this is extremely important what I see people doing a lot they'll join a group they'll join a community or they will get a coach or they will or they will find a mentor nearby them in real life you know like let's say you're going to meet up groups people bring their ego with them if you bring your ego you're gonna talk yourself out of opportunity do you know what I do when I'm with somebody who's doing ten million dollars a year or even one you know or even like one or five whatever million dollars if they are somehow ahead of me or peers of me and I can learn from them let me ask you a question well in what situation would they be able to help me more if they'd ask me hey how's your business doing and if I was like oh my god yeah my business is doing amazing it's off the charts versus if I just said I could use help I'm an idiot I'm not doing five million dollars a year that is when they would help me right if I actually keep my ego and I'm trying to be a smartass and I'm like I'm business doing great they will just look at me and go okay your business is doing great go on your way that's not gonna have any impact on my life but if I actually just put my ego away shut the [ __ ] up listen and and be attentive and drop my ego and just say I have no idea how to handle money they will open up and they will tell me hey this is what I do this is exactly what I'm doing at my taxes why don't you talk with my tax guy this is a strategy I use to grow my business that one strategy will help you and in my case helped me to make tens of thousands of dollars just still one sentence so when people are ahead of you it's like ATM machine every word that comes out of their mouth is just free value being thrown at you when you don't shut the [ __ ] up and you talk it's like you're interrupting a free ATM machine just throwing money at you and value at you and you're robbing your ownself number six don't hurt your little brain if somebody is ahead of you and you want to get to that level here's what I want you to do don't hurt your little brain blindly follow being a smartass will keep you broke forever if you spend fifty percent of your time questioning or challenging instead of executing you will slow down your own growth by 50 percent or more I remember when I joined row meets eighties program zero to launch or when I joined some other programs with coaches like Mariah cause or my coach Ron when they would tell me something I would just blindly execute all of that time that I could have spent questioning challenging them coming off like a smartass coming off like I know it all I just shut up and I executed I was ahead than a lot of my peers in the group even in the developer community you know and I was doing a lot of coding I would be ahead of so many developers I would have more projects to show I was already making a higher income but I wouldn't spend time trying to show off in front of them I would just listen to what the instructor would say or I would listen to what the mentor would say and I would act like I was a smallest guy in the room and I'd be like okay him take notes everybody thought that I was either an idiot or I was slow or I was the least successful quite the contrary I was just spending all that time executing and not worrying about how I came off to other people so remember don't hurt your little brain number seven be religious to profit Bader's cool Ian says revenue feeds the ego profit feeds the family know your monthly expenses every single month and go after things that actually make you revenue and ultimately a profit if you can to X your income and it requires you to do a complete 180 from your current plan don't be religious to your plan or to your process be religious to the clients results to what you are offering to the other person sometimes the biggest value I've provided to the people that hired me to actually help them in their coding has actually been I've provided value in their life somehow even above and beyond coding I would always look for ways on what I can actually do better and how I can help them better like one of the clients I've worked with I helped him land a hundred thousand dollars a year contract from a pharmaceutical company right like a hospital so what does that have to do with me talking to him about coding or anything else it does it but I look for where I could provide value and wherever I could provide value I jumped I only care about where I can make a profound impact in my client's life and not what they hired me to do a lot of developers just [ __ ] themselves up even developers I would hire to help me when I was learning they were so religious to their process they're just like nope can't do that language no I cannot do JavaScript I'm just a Python developer even the 30 years of experience they could have picked up JavaScript a lot faster than me and actually taught me as I went through my book or gave me a project or put me on a path or gave me some strategic guidance be religious to profit my friend number eight have a winner attitude this means no bitching no drama no whining no complaining strictly positive attitude so many people spend so much time blaming people having a negative mindset if you have a positive mindset and you just stick through with it difficult things like sitting there trying to code all day and create a project you'll be able to burst through that because at the end of the day you'll just focus on the work that's required and not on all of this happens to me I don't even have time I'm so tired I have no energy how am I gonna be able to do this what's gonna happen in my life [ __ ] that just get it done okay that's it ain't nothing to it to do it thousand commitment Club you can be 100% committed you need to be thousand percent committed to becoming a developer or to becoming a business owner whatever your goal may be if you are flaky and trying to halfass [ __ ] your own goal that's what your money will do to you you will open up your wallet and you'll be like that's weird my money seems to keep flaking on me show up 1000% for what it is that you do when you decide to do it number 10 producer reorientation so I want you to reorient your mind like a producer you know why here's why majority of the people in the world are consumers majority of the people in the world also happened to be broke minority of the world is producers and minority of the people also happened to be wealthy be the 1% be a producer produce one valuable thing every day when you think of consuming and watching stuff think of yourself like you're stealing are you okay with stealing every single day you're taking somebody's stuff and you're just stealing you're sitting there and consuming it and that's all but as a producer you actually provide to the world as the value follows the money follows provide value produce and get in the habit of it make it something more than you produce to get money back make it something that's it's your habit and that's what you just do every single day number eleven accountability and tracking measure and track everything on a daily basis that is important to you I have Excel spreadsheet that I used inspired by Sam ovens and I track my sleep my calories my net worth my income my expenses notes for the day my productivity level all of these things I track every single day day in and day out and then the second step which is important is the accountability I get on a call with one of my closest friends Tenzin the founder of what's dev and we help each other and I ought in his sheet and he ought it's mine and because I respect him and care for him and admire him I don't [ __ ] with him and he doesn't [ __ ] with me and we keep it real and we keep each other on track every single day and we care about each other's goals so for yourself do the same thing a great analogy of how your daily decisions impact your life I found from DJ from MJ DeMarco from Millionaire Fastlane and he says think about your trajectory in life like a golf ball when you take a swing to hit the golf ball if there's a little change in your angle in the degree it won't show much of a difference if you took two strokes and in one you were you hit it at like 45 degree angle and another one you hit it like 75 degree angle in the start as the ball starts to take off the difference between the two hits won't be that much right the two balls will be really close but as it starts to get farther and farther you will see a monumental and exponential difference in the trajectory this is how he says life is if you are 25 today and you start making decisions at a very small level you won't even see a change in your life for example reaching out to 30 people per day trying to get an internship or a freelancing job as a developer by the time you get to 35 you will see the dramatic impact it has made it in your life versus if you chose to never ever ever do that accountability and tracking is one of the most important and it will change the trajectory of your life one percent every single day number 12 I want you to read this every single day I want you to frame this on your wall and I have provided a document written in Google Docs or something like that below this video I want you to screenshot that and actually make it a cover on your phone if you want $20,000 a months or more type of results increasing your income more impact then none of this is optional you need to be doing this on a daily basis if you want to grow as fast as you possibly can these are all things that optimize you as a human being these are not tactics these are not little frameworks these are actually things that change your entire energy and your entire being and the trajectory of your life that's it and to end it here's what I'll leave you with failure is a sweat of success and gotdamn I'm soaking wet MJ DeMarco thanks so much for watching guys if you like this video please smash that like button it helps so damn much especially with YouTube constantly
