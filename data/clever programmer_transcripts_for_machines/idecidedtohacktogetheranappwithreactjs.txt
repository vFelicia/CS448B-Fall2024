okay so here's the problem we have a coding channel with almost a million subscribers and we have a bunch of content creators and we want to get new content creators on there i want to be able to pick commissions of a thousand dollars per 100 000 views per content creator however it's not really easy to track who's making the videos look at all of this we have over 500 videos on this channel so how do we go and identify which video is whose and how much commission do they get if daniel all of his videos rack up a hundred thousand views she should get paid a thousand dollars and same thing with the other people but if we have to manually do all this work with 500 videos that's gonna take forever but knowing that we're all developers in this house i can't help but think gosh there must be a better way so today is a saturday and i thought hey what better way to spend a saturday than coming up with a solution to this problem now there are many ways i can go about solving this problem but honestly one of the first ways that's coming to my mind is maybe i can whip up an app because i can't think of any better way to spend my saturday now for this app i'm thinking we're gonna need a couple of things for example the first thing that comes to my mind is hey let's just throw react.js at it to build the app the other things that i'm thinking are maybe i'm gonna use a youtube api and with that i'm going to pull all the data from our youtube channel straight into this app now something fancy that i would like to implement though i don't know how realistic it would be to use this in this use case but i am thinking hey what's the common thing that we do see that's there and if you look the every video of daniel's has his face on the thumbnail every video of nas has his face on the thumbnail and every video of me has my face on the thumbnail so i'm thinking maybe we can throw some machine learning algorithms at this like a facial recognition to classify which video is whose so then they can get their commission based on that and then after that i don't know i'm kind of stuck myself but i'm thinking i can use firebase if i need to store that data somewhere but as of now honestly i'm thinking react.js from my front end youtube api also to pull all the data and outside of that i mean that's really it now we're also going to need to classify the videos between which videos are nozzes which videos are daniels which videos are mine and maybe i might have to use firebase for that we're just gonna figure that out as we go and i'm just gonna document this here with you and we'll see how much progress we make and maybe by the end of this day i'll fail maybe by the end of this day i'll succeed it's 5 p.m right now on a saturday so let's just freaking go and see what we can do all right so what i'm deciding to do is i'm i kind of spent about 30 minutes to an hour researching between using youtube api or something else and i want to go the route of using youtube api eventually but there's gonna be a ton of boilerplate code required for that so i went through and i looked up and saw if i could use people's already built projects because i hate doing tons of boilerplate code from scratch and there are a couple of projects i came across on github that i could potentially use but i decided right now to hold off and kind of create a mvp like a minimum viable product just so i can get up and running like today rather than tomorrow or the day after that so i'm pausing on grabbing the youtube api for now instead i'm going to make this app work with air table why because it's going to be much easier airtable already comes with a database built in so that's going to avoid me having to use firebase for now so airtable kind of gives me a backend on the fly and it has an api built in so i'll very easily be able to use air table api with my react.js app show all the data work on the front end make sure things are how i want them to be make sure the app is something that i like and then start going the route of making it more robust and starting to use the youtube api and eventually maybe even firebase so good news it's 6 15 p.m and so far i'm able to pull the data from the air table and now let's see how i can actually use it but that's awesome luckily for us airtable has a package that you can install with uh npm so i did npm or yarn add airtable and we got in our project and then they give you the code their documentation is very helpful so i just need my api my base key i also followed a tutorial from codestacker so thank you for your tutorial uh this was very helpful to actually follow for my project so thanks i saw the use effect took it was a smart usage of it so using use effect we're able to retrieve all of the data every time our app refreshes or the page loads and now i'm gonna be in the process of using use state to store that so then i can actually display it on the html of my website so let's code that up now so shout out code stacker thank you for this video that was really valuable able to actually get the data and using the use effect hook i'm able to retrieve it so far and i think i'm going to use you state hook to keep track of the state and then display that data through my html so then you can actually see it on the web page so let's go and code that up right now all right so far it's pretty cool my app can actually pull data completely actually from air table let me grab my table and for example on the right hand side all my videos are sorted by views okay just look from here the disney and the garbage developers one i change my air table here right let's say change it to be um based on which videos got the top sure let's say comments right watch what happens when i hit refresh now it's sorting it by comments though i haven't added comments there so that's a little confusing but look at let's just sort it by views worst videos first okay so let's do that now if i hit refresh boom it's pulling that so 3800 views 8 300 views 17 000 views 32 000 views and so on it's actually looking pretty freaking good and doing a good job so right now it's 7 p.m i'm two hours into my development i mean my front end skills are usually trash but i'm very pleasantly surprised by the fact that i was able to put this thing together you know i try to model the actual youtube studio app and i would say this app right now has a pretty similar feel to the actual youtube studio app but now i want to work on a couple of different things like for example what i would really like to have is right up at the top here i would love to see my total views for the week or the entire month and that kind of gives me a kick in the ass to go right and maybe if i have a goal of like let's say i want to hit 100 000 views this week then maybe there's like a little horizontal bar that might tell me hey you've completed like 75 of that goal keep going with like a little green color that like pops out the other thing i'm thinking of maybe i want to use like react has this great library called react toast notifications so i might i might want to use that where when i achieve something like the toast notifications pop up or like confetti pops up on the screen but i want to keep it clean and like really minimalistic don't want to add too many things to it because it's going to start looking tacky i'm going to keep it minimalistic but something that i can use that drives me to make more content on youtube build better things and it excites me every day when i look at it that's really the goal so next up the next feature i'm gonna add to this is for example do you see how i have 10 000 views here 130 so what i'm going to do is i want to see all the views comments thumbs up thumbs down or at least like views comments and maybe something else kind of like this okay and i want to do that for all the other videos okay so i'm going to work on that now one thing i still complete i don't understand is why it's completely trash on my mobile device on the computer mobile mode it looks perfectly fine but on my phone it it looks like trash all right so right about at this point our app is actually showing the views the amount of subscribers we got from that video and the comments that video generated for engagement i think views is good but i think subscribers is a really strong indicator of truly what is creating brand loyalty and of course engagement is also really really good because like for example this garbage developers video that i made it is very controversial right how it is and how i speak in it and it's very polarizing right so that's why i think the engagement on that is really high on this one i asked people to leave a comment on channel update i was talking about something very personal and i was very vulnerable in that video so this gives me a really good pulse but if i look at this it has the most amount of views in the shortest amount of time i very quickly see man we we need to be going more of the builds route and dropping more bills on the channel and also right at about this point i just committed my code it is currently 7 20 p.m we are two hours and 20 minutes into our session today so i hope you're having fun i sure am right now it is a private repo and one of the big reasons is because i didn't want to figure out the headache with how to add environment variables in react js there is a process to do that but i'm gonna do that later for now i'm just using my um api keys openly in this code so that's why i had to make it private for now all right boys so quick update still working on the app 7 48 pm 2 hours 48 minutes into the session this is what we have so far i have how many views subscribers comments and then also compared to other videos how's this video doing and if it's doing 2x or greater then i'm also throwing in the fire emoji otherwise it's just like straight up you know flat now one thing that was happening was when i was trying to deploy this to versal i was getting an error i don't know maybe one of you might get that error one day or i might get that error later in the future because i know i've had that error in the past how i circumvented that is by doing this so in my build command because it gave me an error with like travis so i just said hey set the c ci to false and then just do npm run build and also in my environment variables i set ci to false false as in this and ci as in ci all caps i got it from a blog post from dev.2 so if you find this helpful this might actually help you in case you were trying to deploy something other than that i'm just gonna get straight back to it i also just made right now i just made my app a little bit more uh error prone so yeah or a little bit more robust because before it would just break if the multiplier wasn't there so right now if a video does not have a multiplier it will instead of breaking let's do that that's good if i go back if i don't have a thumbnail and a refresh it doesn't completely break it just goes uh and gives me like an empty uh thumbnail and the reason why that's happening is um i'm just doing this little check right there okay so that makes sure that that's happening and then yeah and then i've added a bunch of these uh operators your question mark so if it doesn't exist it will not go into the subs so like for example if this one does not have subs if i remove the subs for next gs and gatsby one and i hit refresh it just goes empty on this thing actually let's see if it gives an error it wouldn't have given an error anyway so i guess these question marks are not that helpful let's hit refresh because i think it sends back null anyway so i think that makes it fine it's just that here i do have to do this because it says it cannot read the zeroth property of something that is undefined right so that's why that's there okay let's refresh all things here i've centered aligned everything so it's all centered and nice it still looks like crap on mobile you know that's the only real like bummer right now because i'm trying to deploy it when i go to bed i won't actually be able to use the app from my phone see how it feels right that's the only kind of annoying part other than that i mean it's looking really really good it looks like something i would use just i got to get it working on mobile because on mobile is still all types of mess up there's some bug in my css i don't know what it is if you guys if any one of you is good in css and you can help me find it that'd be great so i'll just share my code here that's my index.css file and then i have my app.css file right there okay this is the entire file so you can pause it and check it and then the last thing this is pretty much my entire the main things that i'm using if you could find the error and help me and drop it in the comments below that would be freaking awesome because then i can move on the next day and start working on this app and making it better and better but other than that i think what i want to do now is add like total views although at the top so i can really easily see how many views i'm at i think that's going to be a pretty exciting thing so let's work on that now all right so that was actually pretty cool i just sat here and worked on something super dope so i'm now able to get total views you can see up here how this is actually happening i am just getting all of the view view records or whatever right that are in my error table and then i'm just calling reduce on that and reducing it basically summing it up this is a cool way of using reduce there's a lot of functional programming principles that are happening here so if you're a beginner intermediate to javascript definitely start using this because people will use tons of for loops and stuff but this is really really cool right i'm mapping and map returns to me an array with all of the numbers so essentially i get back an array of numbers this is a really good um stack overflow answer that you guys can use too i'm getting an array of numbers with this here so this gives me like all the views of uh the views of each video okay and then i'm just calling reduce like this and that essentially gives me back the sum the cumulative value boom like there so reduce is really cool big time functional programming uh benefits that you get from it okay just thought i'd share that another thing i actually want to do is i want to get all the videos from this current month and rack up all of those views so for example now when i refresh you'll notice that it's a 77 000 views which is actually adding up 52 000 plus 17 000 plus 8329 and you'll see why pure javascript skills are actually needed because if we didn't have them we wouldn't even be able to do basic stuff like this that one line is really really sweet if you look here set total views i'm using react use state right use state hook the use date is right there and i'm doing set total views boom and what's cool about that is react essentially waits for airtable to give the data back once airtable gives the data back that's when it dynamically updates the app right over there this is pretty cool so far i mean honestly i'm really excited it's 8 36 p.m and the progress has really really been phenomenal so far like that already just knowing that number this month i'm like wow i'm at 77 000 views how can i get to a hundred thousand views right like but unfortunately april is now over and the way that i made that happen is an air table like kind of like created a filter that just constricts me to these specific dates of april right now for may where am i at well currently for may i'm actually at zero right so i'm going to let me duplicate this i'm going to rename this to may results may videos for my filter i'll just do is on may first on or on or after and it's on or before may 31st cool so we got our may filter set up if i try to use this may videos one the unfortunate thing that's going to be happening is none of those are going to show because there's nothing yet so i'll wait until i publish a video in may and then i'll do that but my goal is to get the results up right because uh looking at this result is uh not very inspiring right because it's 77 000 views but i want to get to 100 000 so disney plus build is kicking ass i'm gonna drop probably in what's the other one i think we're working on clubhouse clubhouse is going to be freaking sick as well honestly the app is looking really really cool and it looks very functional but i'm going to make that 77 000 just a little cleaner and probably more like something that stands out a little bit more here's just a cool tip i have this div right here and i have two images one two and that div so i grabbed the emit so i grabbed the direct child image i grabbed the second child just that and i give it a margin of uh left four so it moved it away from that logo closer to that number so for example if i remove this watch where it goes boom so really pro tip use it and enjoy wow i am so excited right now like my friend and skills are i was just telling my girlfriend this and this app is starting to look good like i'm actually excited about this and one thing huge shout out to my boy lem who works with us at cleverprogrammer and he's actually a designer at our boot camp full stack mastery boot camp that we launched and um i hadn't given the image a height i'd given it a width but i hadn't given it a height that's what was causing the big problems on mobile so finally the mobile version is starting to actually look like something before it was just looking hideous i mean now that i've fixed the image put an image height on here it has kind of like messed up some of the other stuff so i'm gonna fix it i'm gonna get back to working on it but this is amazing progress it's 9 p.m we are about four three hours in i think three hours in or four hours in i lost track but we're about four hours into this and this is looking amazing i'm impressed by my own frontend newly found frontend skills because i'm working on these clones with for you guys man i'm so excited like i'm reaching new levels as a developer that i had not reached before so like this is exciting and to be able to put together something and i know we're gonna be using it one day also this is really exciting um i added commissions so we have views at the top and then right underneath that we got commission so this is gonna be sick i'm excited i'm gonna keep going for now all right check it out this is where we're at so far we got the views and we got how much commission that person is going to make this is just like random numbers right now if i hit refresh watch how that counts up like that and uh amazing library i found is called uh react count up and look at how easy look at how easy that is go to 723 and take 1.7 seconds and all you have to do to install it is yarn add react count up or do npm install react count up so the app right now is looking really good it's completely mobile responsive looks great on the desktop i'm having a lot of fun 9 23 p.m i might stop soon actually wow this was an incredibly fun session i'm so glad that i did this the app is looking so freaking good watch that count up so if you're a person who's using this you can see that commission come through the next few things i think i'm going to work on is i'm going to add a progress bar that's going to be cool so like uh you know content creator like daniel or nas can see where they're at and how far they might be from their commission goals i also want to give it an arcade type of feel where it kind of feels like this 8bit pixelated arcade game and then you have these gamification gamified like icons and badges you unlock so level one level two and you know you get new rank so in the start you're a private on youtube and then you are you know something else on youtube and then you're a colonel and then you're a sergeant and then maybe legendary and i think it would be really cool and they'll gamify content creation because content creation is a hard thing but if you have something fun like this that's kind of addictive and you're like man when i make videos i can see that bar fill up i can see myself leveling up i can unlock a new badge that everybody else can see everybody else gets a notification that like daniel just unlocked this i mean see each other's progress and where they're at and maybe even chat from here so maybe we can add a functionality to chat whoever is live on this app you can chat with each other or maybe a drop in audio or something i don't know yet but so far i love the ui it's so freaking simple the total views are at the top you have the commission right below it i mean it's so simple and elegant and i think friendly user friendly i'm four hours into my session and time just flew by it's 9 39 p.m i want to be doing this a lot more often i had a ton of fun i don't even know where the time went this is phenomenal progress i mean we have a fullon crud functionality right we can create read update and delete stuff we have a beautiful gorgeous front end we're pulling straight from air table we're using react.js we're using a couple of cool libraries that we decided to add in here this was so much fun i i didn't know whether we were going to make any progress or if we were going to fail we're going to suck and this was going made a ton of progress we are making headway this is just day one of this app i'll keep you updated on what happens day two three four five and so forth so thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video definitely smash that like button subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about this app and uh let me know if you have any recommendations or suggestions of what i should add to it how maybe i can gamify it in a more entertaining and in a fun way and uh just let me know if you also enjoyed this video so i'm looking forward to hearing some feedback from you this is it this is your boy cozzy i love your beautiful face and i'll see you in the next video i'm looking forward to hearing some feedback from you this is it this is your boy cozzy i love your beautiful face and i'll see you in the next video you
