was pretty cool i love that okay let's take a look at what you're going to build now this guy's you guys ready to see what you're going to build yeah yeah yeah because you have no idea don't you you have no idea what you're going to build aren't you hey so we thought about this right we thought about this well we thought about this we're like what can we build initially we kind of had a plan uh to build like something else from a different project but that didn't work out we were not allowed to build that one unfortunately uh which is completely okay but instead we decide instead so we went to a different route and we're like you know what what's a really cool landing page that everybody knows what's a cool landing page that you know stands for so much that is very simple for all you guys to build that is very simple for you guys to learn but it's also worth a lot i'm actually very curious what can anybody take a guess in the zoom chat please if you guys take us in zoom chat what company what landing page from what company we're going to build most people say google some say google google facebook amazon tesla okay what else anybody else saw one person said it then one person said it really one person say it okay okay only like one person okay i like it let me see the chat i don't see the chats yet so far let me see oh one person did say a good good good amazon reddit netflix facebook spacex guys we're going to build together today we are bill is that a dremel hold on no no oh that's a laughing sound wait yeah together today we're going to build a ready for this a we're going to build a starbucks wait no oh [ __ ] hold on [ __ ] hold on there we go starbucks clone today guys this starbucks oh look at this guys this is literally what they have for you guys it is one of the most popular pages it is very very simply built it's built with the most latest technologies right and yeah it's good most of the latest technologies and of course um and we're gonna learn how to build it so and then what you're gonna have which you're going to do together guys is very cool you are going to then build this page of course but then i'm going to tell you this imagine that you have your own coffee shop anybody here has ever thought about having like a coffee shop of your own i'm just curious anybody imagine you have your own coffee shop you have this landing page right here that's a coffee shop landing page right transform this starbucks landing page to your own coffee shop landing page you will put your own logo you will create your own company name your coffee name you will create your own images things like that that's gonna be your homeland for the day how cool is that and you will have your own coffee shop landing page how awesome is that huh yeah yeah that's what i'm talking about so what i missed by like what i mean so what are we going to learn html says as a javascript of course as i said yeah it's not a landing page with 2010k yeah who thinks this is cool who loves this who is excited to build a star to a starbucks landing page oh that's what i'm talking about i love it i mean look i love coffee too so you know it just makes sense especially for developers you guys are all coffee drinkers aren't you huh honestly though i'm not a coffee drinker can i be honest with you guys i don't drink coffee i know i know it's like it's like a it's like a i know i know i know i know i know i know but i just don't drink coffee i'm sorry it's just not me i drink tea instead and which i have right here right here actually so there you go yeah i also drink only one cup so so that's nothing so basically the question is are you right at this point are you guys ready put it down in the comments below put it down in the in the zoom chat below are you ready let's go so let's go put your whole heart into it and let's get into it before we do that let's go to some homework submissions let's see what you've got look at these homeworks guys do we have between giovanni we've got dorisa nice job we got robin kevin we got jaylord oh look at that i love the creativity yeah i can read that we got hi i'm albert uh manuel shani look at that and we actually have some a few projects we can show you guys too take a look at as well let me see let me see if i can take us a few parts so we have a few ones here let me see boom boom boom nice this is this is sir hey he did this one let's say he did his own version of portfolio damn this is really cool look at that amazing job on that amazing job on that very very good amazing let me see what else we got uh my computer is like struggling to try and share all this yeah oh my god how are we gonna go through this hopefully i think this one is jaylor it's not let me see who's this one let me see oh jayla oh that looks cool oh yeah got a clean picture my friend i like it like this picture right here is really really love everything about code yes let's go i like that it's really really clean oh look at that look at that some beautiful patches as well oh wow wowed me whoa nice job nice job nice job okay very good see what else we got we got oh come on come on computer you can do it this is where i need like a like a like kind of like a like 18 core cpu or something i don't know i don't know how much of a fast computer i need like it's just crazy look at that oh he says work coming soon i love that i love that touch work coming soon that's really cool i think it's nice yeah that is cool it is cool i like that let me see okay i'm albert okay beautiful we've got ben ben right here let me see ben let me see what you got on here ben this is ben hi i'm ben i'm 14 years old who loves coding what you're fortunate in the house look at all the stuff he's built already he's built a tesla clone the disney clone amazon club oh and now he's gonna build a starbucks sloan let's go that's so cool that's right and then of course let's go ahead and get into this portion we got this specific and then this is who shanny is that is that her name i think okay let's go so it's shanny hi i'm shanny i hope hopefully i'm saying this right i'm a full stock developer oh dang did you already build like a oh is this like a shopping list page oh dang is this like a is it is it a web app or is it like a ios and that's pretty cool work with me start now i love the colors really cool colors nice job yeah me too awesome sweet sweet sweet cool cool cool all right let's go ahead at this point we know we're doing i think we just just get started should we yeah we should we should we should we should guys if there's anything i'm ready hey no no that's not for one more time that's i'm ready let's go all right guys at this point guys very very simple let's go ahead and get started here with us to use everybody here we have this code on their computer yes that was your homework to download the use code of course make sure you have that downloaded very very important all right at this point let's just go ahead and get it get to it all right so a few things are gonna happen with you guys all right okay let's go ahead and open up vs code i'm gonna put up my my chrome here on the left hand side okay and then this is the code that we've i've been writing kind of recently so that's completely okay i'm gonna put down them on my side right here okay jesse beautiful nice nice nice so i'll put the code on myself so i can see it as well beautiful eye awesome sweet okay good all right let me see i'll put it here all right so now let's go ahead and open up vs code i have used code i'm going to do file new window on the vs code portion okay for file new window okay i have my use code right here i'm going to put it on the right hand side take server i don't want to take a server right now obviously no no thank you and let's gonna create a new folder guys okay so i'm gonna open up my finder here i'm gonna go to pro i have a projects folder here and then i have my fiveday bootcamp and then i'm gonna create a new folder and that folder is gonna be called let's just call it a starbucks clone or let's just say coffee shop coffee shop right so because you guys are going to be creating your own coffee shop okay so let's do coffee shop right now all right so we'll create a new folder right here okay beautiful then once we've got that done uh let's go ahead and open this up in file open and let's open this up and let me go to projects here five day bootcamp and let's open this up in vs code okay so just go do file open and and then like i said just open it up right here comprende got it beautiful all right click open nice all right and so guys at this point we have a project open right does everybody is still with me you guys have the project open everything's so good yes well make sure you do that right now make sure you do that right now okay awesome sweet sweet sweet tweet create a new folder and just do file just create a new folder create a new folder a new file open that's all you gotta do file open guys okay file open right here that's pretty much it all right after that what's gonna happen is very simple let's let's go ahead and where's my mouse let's do create a new file so we'll create a new file here this is called index.html so every single guys every every single web page every single web page starts out with what with what what does every single web page start out starts out with well what we have an index.html file is that right yes or no correct comprende good good good good good right now everything in the html file now has a bullet it's called boilerplate code but it's basically like html code that gives the structure okay what is the structure jesse so that structure is of course telling that it's a doctype html at the top so what does that mean right there what does that mean that means we're good that means we're setting up now the html the structure of our app um in this file awesome so what's gonna happen after that so after that i would say do select you know that you're going to be working in the english language so carrot html html right so basically this is saying okay we're going to create an html page that's going to happen here okay right awesome what's next um i think we always start with a head that has certain information regarding this app correct so the head what's inside the head jesse well so meta information metadata it's also called so for example um yeah how do you call it like the char set and http equiv and also the name yeah i'll tell you also let's focus on the title right now so the char said that's all good ah right yeah well i think so meta like but what does what does the header uh give give you guys why do we need the header for what what what is it jesse why do we need the header why do we need this head section well we first of all we also have a body so that's why we need the head okay and what is inside the body jesse well inside the body you have the app all the main your main code the whole structure of what you see in the browser this is what you see correct this is what you see this is the body yeah is what you see on the page for example if you go to starbucks here right the body is this whole thing that's the body guys you got it you guys got it that's the body okay good all right what's next what's next so if you want to go back to head you first need to put in some boilerplate metadata let's do some titles what or the title first so what should we call it guys what's the cool coffee shop name you guys want to do what's the cool coffee shop name anybody got it oh put it in the chat put it in the chat i got a cool coffee shop name i'm curious michael says duncan java java clever coffee shop somehow oh girl clever coffee i like it clever coffee shop yeah like it too clever coffee clever coffee clever they're roast hey let's go i like it everybody loves clever coffee i think that'd be pretty awesome actually if you did that they'd be pretty awesome okay i like that okay sweet sweet sweet sweet so clever coffee is one thing okay okay now let's go ahead and go to this uh clever coffee after the title so this this title right here is gonna be shown right here so the the title that we set here guys just so you know this title is actually going to be the start the title that's right here on the under right here in the body on the top you see that right there that's the title of the tab right that's the actual google google sees as well so that's why so important so that's good so uh besides the title we don't really need much more than that honestly for now for now i think we're good kind of but now let's go through the body and let's see what can we do on the body section right what was doing the body section what do you guys think how are we gonna make this the question we're going to ask ourselves is what are you going to do now like like where do you start out now at this point right where do you start out now at this point who knows the header somebody says the day of the now are good the sections so jesse let's go ahead and divide up this page and hopefully i can because my computer is starting to get slow a little bit okay let's divide up this page okay into small sections okay yeah that's how i also work oh wait work yeah that's a great idea come on right there right there okay so this right here so if we i'm currently about to kind of surround some rectangles so we have this main page right let's divide up a page into sections remember as a coder your job is very simple split things up into small things right into small problems you have a big problem which is create this coffee shop application let's split up into small problems so what's a small small problem here that we see guys what what is it guys what do you guys think navbar good michael yes so navbar is gonna be this the the second one so let's go ahead and select the nav bar that's gonna be one small okay what's the next one what's the next one guys what do you guys think what is it what is it jesse well the announcement bar or i don't know what how you call that but where the announcement is in this case like yeah that means green mint green area okay that's the announcement bar what's next for that one i think that the banner the first banner that first banner okay that's gonna be another section that we have okay what's another another section that we have another section is i would call it like the gallery the first row of the gallery like is it this one right here yeah this section okay that's another section okay so now we got these like look at this right so now we split up our page into three different sections which makes it now a lot easier for us to work with is that correct yes or no right well if you focus on the header you can focus on the bottom section and then the section below that beautiful right if then we even scroll down what's another another section we have here you see these two sections what's the section here what's the section here guys what do you guys think well what what is it we have a section that's right here right that's one section okay right that's one section right here it looks a little bit the same like the gallery but it has text underneath it in the boxes as you can see yeah you can see it's a little bit different now right instead of being left to right we have top to bottom right and it's starting to tell us some give us some hints in terms of how we can name these things right so you can see we have this section right here and then we have this section right here as well boom right right awesome so we got this section what's another session that we might have look at that oh look at that what's another section we have boom oh what should we call is this like um what should we call this section announcement information yeah or like a yeah announcement or inform or news section or something update section maybe the news section maybe this could be the newest section because you know this might change from time and time to time right right right okay and then finally what's the last section we can do what's not another section i would call this i think the footer well are you saying with this one so this could be the footer i think so this portion could probably be the footer right here i feel like yeah that's what it but this portion what would this be right here oh terms of conditions yeah like there's probably like some terms and conditions right these are like some like hidden text that they don't usually tell you about right the small letters that's why it's small the small text in the in the in the what's it called in a in a contract where you like you sign your life away you know i know so that's exactly it somebody said conditional statements i like that i like that so awesome awesome so do you guys see how we just what we just did is we split up this humongous application into small little applications you guys see that yes or no right small little kind of things and so that's where we focus on now so now let's go ahead and actually do that if we're focusing on the html page okay let's let's figure this out all right so in the html page what do you think what do we talk about what is the first session we're going to focus on what is it well first is what the header so let's go ahead and do the header okay let's focus on the header right here okay awesome okay right so the header is gonna basically just this top portion right there right that's that top portion right there right that's this top portion right there okay awesome yeah so before we call that sometimes nav bar but guys for clarification this is the header the header exactly we're not using the network the nav is within the header right and so this is the html exact number is within the header right then what's going to happen so for this header let's go and give it some styling by the way we can actually do some styling right away and check this out let's go ahead and just save this now where do we style things guys who knows where do we style them oh style.css so let's create a new file here and we'll do a style dot css boom it's not a css okay now this is where we just style our components our little html elements right now for our case what's going to happen is of course nothing's going to work right now do you guys agree with me yes or no not this is going to work right now am i right because why because we need to link the style sheet to our html page and how do we do that well we crank create a link lin a style sheet your link so kind of it kind of looks like this yeah yeah a link no i know exactly what you mean style sheet yeah so link real style sheet right and then i'm gonna say href is equal to what jesse um where the location the path of where your style sheet is in your app so in this case we don't have any folder structure but you can just say style.css which is the name of the file exactly so now basically it's just basically about style.css which is right here what we have okay so now if you link this check this out since we linked it if i save this if i go to style the css let's let's focus on the body right so if i do body here okay what do you think is going to focus the body is this body so if i do start to sit and i tell us hey for the body let's do a background color of what blue for now just out of curiosity okay okay we got the style shield open let's actually open this page up now jesse how would you open this page up in order to open a page up you need to have an extension called live server yeah so guys go to extensions okay go to extensions here right right here in uh visual studio code right here so this extension is right here section oh my god my computer is so struggling come on oh my god is the square the square thingies guys uh in the menu bar okay press that one click on this yeah and then you should be able to install it okay right here usually to install right there okay you guys got that give me a thumbs up if you guys see that yes or no everybody yeah yeah yeah yeah good good good good awesome so install that right there live server make sure you install that and then once you've installed it you're pretty much you're good so if i click on this there's a question if you can make the visual studio call screen a little bit bigger you mean like from okay hold on as in like is it like i zoom in i think both both like zooming in and both like a little bit more to the side maybe a little bit okay yeah is that better guys is that better that's perfect people say okay okay thank you awesome sweet okay good awesome sweet so basically now at this point that's what we have okay sweet sweet sweet so now let's go ahead and what we're going to do is right click on his html and then you should have a option here called open with live server right here you guys see that open with live server click on that one and there you go now hey we got a blue background and thank you so much for coming it was a great uh application uh we'll see you guys tomorrow just kidding we'll see you guys sorry about that so yeah so you can see what happened here we just opened up the application in the live server and now we see our in html you see if i change my color here to yellow look at this yellow yellow it becomes yellow right it becomes yellow look at that it becomes just yellow just like that all right that's honestly that's pretty much it so let's go ahead and now make some modifications okay okay okay to this all right so we got the body that's so good now of course we're gonna focus on the header portion the header portion here i want to show you guys just exactly how we're going to do this if i go up to starbucks right here if i click right and i click inspect element this will tell me how they actually do their content let me show this to you if i put this on the bottom side right here look at this this is the key guys that you guys will learn on how to learn on how literally to code i'm not going to lie probably to you yeah literally so check this out i have here my style sheet if i right click inspect them under this on the header inside here what we'll do this will give me okay look at this the global nav wrapper great global gutters some global stuff but most importantly what the tell me look at this it tells me what the box shadow is and it tells me also the height the height of this navigation bar and you can see the height is 101 pixels right there you see that so that means if i go to start the css okay in order for me to target the header what do i say guys here header like this right so that means okay focus on the header and html i'm going to say height is go is it equal to what guys what is it 101 pixels right there 101 pixels right and then what's going to happen is remember this box shadow which i will put you guys in the zoom this box shadow right here this whole box shadow okay i'm gonna copy as it pastes a little in here just so you guys can see it and i'll put it here in the zoom chat as well so you guys can see it too boom boom boom box i put this fire right to see in the zoom it's in the zoom chat guys okay so go ahead and copy that code back now is it possible by the way sorry is it possible do to one plus tab to zoom in on your console even more you could okay perfect yeah thank you sweet sweet sweet sweet now right so now we've done is they did a box shadow okay let's go if i save this let's see what happens here let's go ahead and let me go back to why is i keep showing this thing up i don't want to see this oh come on so if correctly guys we should see now a header with a height of 101 pixel which has like look at that oh there we go boom back shadow now granted it doesn't look as good as i would like it to because the body you see this this thing right here the body by the fold has a margin which pushes the the pushes the whole div outside so if i say margin here 0 check this out guys save it oh you see that you see that check out what happened you see that what just happened really easy right what literally just happened is we literally just went ahead and we just said margin's zero because by default basically the body has a margin which pushes kind of the div you know from the outside from the outside right and so we kind of said margin zero so to now push the dip and now we have a header which is good now next thing let's go ahead and add the logo guys all right it's html now how do we add the logo here guys huh the mermaid how do we add the logo let's go ahead and do this so the first thing i want to show you guys to do is is the following is if we look at the starbucks actually let's just do this i'll logic is local here so let's just do this we'll say here div del class equals logo okay boom the class equals logo all right now of course at davis what is a container class is what will allow us to style this container right that's why now inside the logo what are we gonna do jesse excuse me i didn't i didn't catch the last part of the logo what are we going to do inside of the logo we're gonna use the image and the image needs a source exactly that's why you see src there on line 10 and the source where are we going to get that logo from not good question i have no idea so we'll go to google.com and then we're going to google and we say starbucks starbucks logo right there starbucks logo and there's a bunch of logos you can see if i go to images here there's a bunch of logos the first one comes up right here is this one from wikipedia and all i gotta do if i right click on this i'm gonna do copy link address and i'll give it to you guys here as well in the zoom chat boom right no it looks kind of weird but actually let me see let me make sure it works kind of let me make sure it actually works so guys you can test that it works by doing what nas does now and that's pasting in the link and luckily we did because i don't think it's it's just the image hey there we go so i'll give you guys a new link hold on hold on i know guys i know it's not working but this one should work now so copy image address which is fine copy image address right and then what you guys will do this because it's just paste same adjacent between in this image source okay so the image store this is where you copy the image address right see what they're in the in those little quotes okay okay so good so we've done that portion awesome let's save that and let's see what we did get now at this point clever coffee oh the whole page is literally the starbucks logo oh is she pretty though i know i know i know so so look so look at this point now of course this how do we fix it is the question right that's a good question well there's a few things that needs to happen right the first thing used to happen is if you right click on this specific situation by rightclicking aspect element on this one inspect element on this one well this will show us exactly why is it that it's like that right we have this image but the div is also pretty big well let's go ahead and go to style.css and instead of the css let's do that logo to target our logo uh div and that logo means target the class logo right this is why we did div class and then we say what height is equal to what a hundred percent boom right i know nothing really changes actually but nothing really changed but if i do now that logo and i say image image right and i say here on this one a height of a hundred percent let's see oh you see what just happened so what do we do we gave the container the container which is which is the logo this is the container it's kind of like you know oh look at this i have here who likes here i don't know who anybody likes here uh nuts i guess you like nuts right anybody yeah i mean of course i do too so right so right so inside inside of here are a bunch of nuts right i mean they're empty because i already ate all of them but you get what i'm saying basically basically it's like we're saying here we're constricting the container and then whatever's in here will fit this container does that make sense makes sense comprende comprending because let me say i'm not for coding kyle that's so funny i like it so that's what kinda is happening right here all right awesome but of course we're not gonna stop at that because if i go to starbucks coffee and i look at and i look at my logo look at this this logo is how this is loaded is 51 pixels by 51 pixels because if i look at it you see the top left section you see who says 51 by 51 that's 51 pixels 51 by 51 pixels so let's give this logo instead of a height let's give this logo a height of 51 pixels 51 pixels and a width of 51 pixels compressed guys width okay and then the logo image can be the logo is going to be a height of 100 because it's 100 of what what is it jesse 51 by 51 pixels exactly so now if i go to here wait no that's not the one clever coffee oh you see that let me go yeah now it's not smaller but yet it's not yet it is not still centered so what do we do now this is where we are not going to get so smart guys we need to get smart now because that's it no we're normal playing around no i'm playing around no all right so now if i go to starbucks coffee you know how remember how we divided our application into small components here okay remember how we did the header you know all this kind of stuff right that was here which is great we now need to divide this into even smaller problems right now we're focusing on the header got it let's divide it now into even smaller problems so if i go here here's the header right here look at this right that's the header now what i want you guys to do is what i want us to do is very very very simple i want to divide this into a one actually let me i wanna try something here for a second here if i made this bigger what do you see do you see how this changes do you see how the header is big right here it's big but then we have something in the center that's a lot smaller oh like another you see that container it's like a container it's a container so what do we need to do now at this point is we need to create a container called the header container and we just center it so that means it's not the in this html in the header we say div class is equal to what header dash container and then you have to remove these closing tags and you have to put them inside the logo on the logo portion okay so that means the logo is inside that okay awesome so look now we have a container which is awesome okay good okay container and what makes it this max width because if i right click on this specific situation right and if i look at my specific code here that says actually inside starbucks whoa i know it's crazy huh well look at starbucks right now that's crazy what are you guys seeing look at this max width of 1440 pixels aha you see boom you see so that means if i go to head a container if i go to style the css i'm going to now target the header container dot header dash container container right and i'm going to say max width of 1440 pixels okay great all right max 40 pixels okay great now what i'm gonna do is the following now i'm gonna do it where basically uh i'm gonna send it right now how do i send raise the question very simply i use something called margin zero auto this allows us to send basically basically basically margin this is top bottom margin left right margin is auto margin so it's going to basically push from the sides to center to center this whole div so if i click on this if i click on uh the what's it called our clever coffee look at that hey you see how now this is shifted you see that the logo has shifted now okay nice maybe you could um give some background colors to different ones to the header and to the header container so we can see the difference you know it yellow look you see look you see right there oh it's centered now and if i do now this for example let's just say how good it is do a height of a hundred percent okay boom you see now it's the full height of the the ha that fullon header you guys see that yes or no which is 101 pixel guys okay which is 101 pixels awesome okay okay so that's that okay now sweet now here's my question all right here's my pregunta okay so now up next we divide it into the the header container section jesse right but the thing is now we have two sections here we need to divide it even more even more this is what coding is about it's about dividing those big problems into even smaller problems okay what what is another such that we can divide it into what do you think um good one i think one of those should at least be the nav section well we have the left look at this we have the left section yeah the left or left and right side right section look at that left and right section yeah good right and left menu good so now let's do that so now inside the header container okay inside the header container okay good plus by the way nas before we go into that can you show your screen with the starbucks that we're making this one know the other one are that one because as you can see or maybe you're waiting but the logo is at the top and i think i saw the logo like more in the middle of the header container that's good that's a good point so what now or do you want to do that later we'll do that later okay great so let's go into the left menu and the right menu so div div class let's do left nav we'll do a left navigation okay boom right there okay and then we'll do the right navigation so then and then and then also div class is equal to right dash nav okay now map now navigation okay then this dev div class logo oh [ __ ] no that's not what i want uh diff class logo when i put inside the left navigation okay left navigation right there okay awesome that's that's the div class logo all right so that the left hand on the right now and inside the left now what do we have we have we're gonna inside that we're gonna put the actual logo the starbucks logo and then we're also gonna put the navigation so here's a navigation gonna work like check this out guys i'm gonna say nav this is the html5 component so nav okay and the way you sometimes create these specific menu items right there right all these menu items is through something called a unordered list okay so what does that mean well took this out if i do here ul this is how you specify another list and i say ally right right this is a list item and then inside here i'm going to say menu what's our next menu item guys what is it what is it rewards and what's in the one for that one what is it gift cards more coffee gift gift cards don't give the card like that to nas guys gift cards what's up don't get don't don't give it like oh you can eat cake at starbucks too though that's okay oh really okay that's fine guys by the way if this is too fast don't worry about it guys we have this on youtube so you can also watch this on youtube okay guys if you just keep up as as much as possible i can't do it too slow because they'll be just too too slow i will be here for hours okay for literally 10 hours i understand it's maybe a little bit too fast but try your best you can always rewatch this later on after we're done this is on youtube so don't worry and then there's also a zoom recording that we are of course that's going to happen okay so don't worry about that right let's try your best for now right learning code is a process guys so give yourself time to learn it as well okay good let's go menu rewards gift cards so what are you looking oh look at that looks so hideous ouch ow i know my eyes oh no so look at this you see now we have the logo here which is fine but the menu is on the bottom of it so how do we switch to make sure the menu is on the right side of it what do we do guys what do you guys think what do you guys think we can do well simple we can use display flex now look at this if i right click on this guys let me go and zoom in this for a second here so you guys can see a little bit better okay if i rock this is how is a great way to code if i inspect them on this one you can see here this is div okay right here and so what i'm going to do now at this point is inside the css portion look at this we have the left nav and then we have the right now right left never right now in the left nav i'm going to say this display flex boom everything just went from left to right that's what flex allows us to do flex is an amazing advice to create different structures inside the inside our applications okay okay awesome so that's so good okay that's sweet so now at this point we have this specific portion let's do left nav let's do a height of 100 so the height is 100 okay so the whole it's the whole div now let's also center it now we center it jesse oh how do we center it guys display flex flex wait no flex design hold on flex box blocks you see in flexbox guys if we scroll down you can see we display flex if we want to center it vertically what do we do look at that you see that right there what do we do what do we do guys what do you guys think yeah manuela that's right a line exactly right here we want to center in the center right here okay so that means we're going to do a line item so if i go back to clever coffee and i say here align items center oh look at that look at that guys it is not centering horizontally this is her centering vertical vertically you see that starting vertically okay so i center vertically okay awesome now let's go ahead and take a look at our ul list elements right so we have the logo which is great it's fine but our nav is just wonky okay our name is wonky which is completely fine okay so the first thing i want to target is the unknown list item because um the list you see this list up is disk well if i if i go to the ul if i do list style type and i wait not position nope no no no no no list cells list style style dash type and i say none you see everyone moves those little dots uhhuh i know interesting bullet points are gone exactly those bullet points are exactly that which is exactly what we need am i right okay awesome so we got that portion next up let's go and focus on the actual what the list items the list items so now if i go ahead and go to my let me just see if i go to list i'll tap none if i go okay let me see what else we got we got the nav okay good let's also there's a this ul also has a bunch of margin which i don't like you see how there's a lot of margin top and bottom yeah yeah the orange yeah so margin zero on this one okay so there's no margin and also there's a bunch of padding probably on this ul as well so we'll do padding zero as well hey see that removes it that way okay oop don't want that oh i want that so padding easier you see how we're starting to change things up really quickly right next up let's focus on the list item menus right putting them left to right very simple you see these listed menus hey let's go so is this some annual menus how do we make sure that they are from left to right currently the top to bottom what do we do guys remember this what do we do what do we do what do we do okay i actually go to ul and i say display flex oh you see look at that display flex okay awesome all right next up let's go to this right so display that puts it from left to right that's what display flags always allow us to do all right now let's start individual list items if i go if i look list item if i go to here right i'm going to do a plus class on this one li and then within here here's what i'll say i'm going to say the following i'm going to say text transform to make it uppercased uppercase so now everything is uppercase see that right there beautiful next thing we'll see uhhuh padding dash left is giving to what 24 pixels look at that so we're going to create some padding to find that 24x oh do you guys see how it's starting to form you guys seeing that guys l i stand for list item so this style is applied to each of those things in the left navigation okay so it's applied to menu rewards and gift cards so we only have to say one time hey i want that item to have a padding of 24 pixels and then boom everything moves up mmhmm and then i just just added is something something like this then i did padding left to create some putty on the left inside of it like uh you know as you can see let me see let me show it to you guys you see this padding between every single item right here right you see this padding between here that's the padding and then i said fun to weigh 700 to give it a little more boldness you know because it's bold and then the letter spacing is 0.1 am right so what is basically is a letter spacing okay yes padding is within the item that is right so samir has a question he asked what's the difference between padding and margin good question good question so if i have here let me go write this up if i have here imagine this guys this right here is a box okay right that's a buck it's a div right let's just say it's a div the margin is the space the space right here above it to the left side of it to the right side of it and to the bottom side all right so the d outside of the outside of the box correct right that's the padding right that's oh that's the margin i'm sorry that's the margin margin yeah margin however padding guys is a space within it right here inside the box inside the box you see that it's inside the box that's that is what we call the padding and the reason we write it because for example here for example right sometimes you want to create space outside the box and so i'm just going to create space inside the box you know what i mean yeah because sometimes you want to make the box bigger or you want the inside to not touch the edges of your your edges of your box yeah and sometimes you want the box to move away from something else and that's when you use margin for example right for example if i have this this uh left navigation bar how do i what what do i use in order to push this whole uh logo and everything else to the right side of it because it's all in the end what do i use guys what do you guys think i would use here what would i use tell me what would i use padding i'll use padding look penny left if i want to do that if i do this i'm going to do padding left and i do 10 pixels you see that pushes the everything else to the right you see that that's basically padding is within the box you see that i don't need that right now so i'm going to i'm going to remove that for a second here but look we've got the list okay we've got the list out which is really really cool um at this point we can pretty much just copy towards our install the css and actually use it so let's let's do that right now if i go ahead and make this smaller a little bit okay okay beautiful now let's do the following if i go to my style the css okay i have to do what left now so let's do a left now first so dot left nav so we'll do dot left dash nav okay good all right it's at the left now what do we have we have the following we have these specific items so display flex 100 i'm going to copy and paste this in here okay good right that's going to be inside the left nav then underneath that what else do we have guys what else do we have the ul right so now now how do we target the ul inside the left now what do you guys think how do we do that jesse oh well though i know that the left nav is the parent so first i'm gonna call that one and then i know i wanna target the ul so i'm gonna say space ul yeah it making me go further go now then you can right all right it's inside the nav portion right here ah right the nav yeah okay yeah all right so do that and i'm gonna copy everything that's from here i'm gonna paste in here oop nope that's not right remove that portion the x don't need that okay look at that list style tab anything else are amazing guys anything else besides that i think that's pretty much it right pretty much it just say right so find out no that's it the list item yeah left now the list item of the unordered list well which we did the list out oh the list item good catch yeah catch the eyes jesse nice all right let's go ahead and do left nav now left nav clef okay left nav ui ally you see the way we're targeting css is basically we're going kind of it's kind of like down the tree you know down the tree it's like you playing hide and seek right and you're for example going down one door then another door and another door you know it's like the russian doll you're opening up things up you know you know what i mean i had those as a kid yeah i had those too okay and let's go ahead and copy this specific thing for the ally right here yes okay boom hey let's go so save that okay save that refresh our page oh look at that it's there it's there so now we have to remove we can remove finally this hideous this hideous look for some finally just screw this screw this one for some reason which is very clear though huh makes it very clear i know i don't know right okay so that's all good that's so good awesome oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait things are changing it's all good it's all good can you share the starbucks our site on the left yeah let me go so there you go there's our site guys looking so good looking so good look at that that looks awesome isn't it look it's awesome let me go ahead and put that in the desired ipad too hey beautiful all right i'm gonna put you guys still right here okay there we go awesome sweet all right next up what's next guys what do you guys think next is the next portion we should do what's the next portion the next question guys is we should we could we should definitely change this hideous text right here because it does not match anything that's like right here you see this if i right click on this if i do inspect them on this one guys check this out inspect element okay right if i go to a and if i scroll down look at this if i scroll down right here this will tell me exactly what the font family is look at that oh uh huh pretty cool huh yeah so that means if we go to the body let's go the body right here okay let's change the font family to the following so i'm gonna say the font family is helvetica let me do this right here for you guys so font family and here's gonna be helvetica okay helvetica okay then within that we're gonna do uh font weight is 400 for every single thing so font uh font weight is 400 okay and then finally we're gonna do what let's go ahead and change up the the color the color this is the color of the text jesse am i right yeah for sure let's change the color right here change the color right here boom okay save that all right if i go to now our clever coffee oh it's looking a lot better am i right look at a lot yeah i like it like a lot better that does mean doughnuts like so you can have this font with these colors and this font weight in your the whole body in your whole app but what if like for a separate div or a separate box i could still change the font and give it a specific font properties that i want right so how do you do that i would have to target the font inside of that box correct if i want to change something for example if i want to change for example the the this url like look at this if i do a color here let's just say what i mean yeah hey you see that change the color so now okay awesome so we got that portion okay now let's do this okay you see when i go ahead and go to starbucks if i hover over it's green let's make that work yeah i know cool right i love that that's cool cool so now for example if i do hover over the ls list element let's do this dot left nav let's do this left nav okay hover what is the color here guys what do you guys think is the color here oh it's green but how can we actually find out what the color is you want to you want to see a cool trick guys you guys want to see a cool trick oh nice to actually see what the color is if i i can right click on this specific thing i can do for state i can say force a hover state and look at that now it's green always basically i'm telling the browser to force a hover state on it because now if i look at my css within the starbucks there's our color right boom hey awesome zero zero eight two four these are eight two four eight right there if you could type into zoom chat that'd be great right yeah okay here's our eight two four eight so now that means if i save this if i go grab a coffee oh let's go look at that oh i love it i love it i love it it's so simple but so impactful that's what i always like to do is i want to add a cursor pointer as well so cursor pointer this will give us the little hand so if it looks like it's an actual link you see that right there it's an actual link which is a much better match but than nothing else okay and that's our left nav guys is done look at that our laugh nap is very much gonna it's not at this completely the same but it's very very similar to what we actually want to do so now let's focus on the right navigation portion okay let's focus on the right nap at this point all right now right now let's do it so on the right nav okay what does the right net look like let's go to html on the right now what do we have on the right now guys what do you guys think are you on the right now well we have a few things we have what the store locator jesse am i right the store locator yeah so we have which is yeah i would say that consists also of two things right so just or locator sign in button okay so do div class we'll call the find store section that's gonna be one that okay after that what do we also we have we have the sign in section so div class is equal to sign in okay boom right there and then the final last one is going to be what deal class what join now so dave class join dash now boom right there oh beautiful look at that so find store sign in and join now all right the fine store consists of what what does it consist of i always say an icon and okay text okay so not gonna text now the question because where do we get the icon guys anybody knows where we get the icon anybody know i'm actually wondering what that icon is called put in the comments what do you guys think of that like it comes from a pin huh a pin no font awesome henry you're right my friend oh yeah oh man i love that site so fun awesome is right here guys okay font awesome right here okay beautiful so when awesome allows us to have basically a bunch of icons that's what it does so for example if i search up here if i search um nope that's what i want if i hear if i search what could be called like location icon maybe location let's do location on here okay location scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down oh look at that that looks the same huh right the map marker alt yeah so if i click on this one it will actually tell me what html to use guys check this out right i can do i class i can click on this one and i can paste it right away inside here oh damn it's so powerful and it's very very powerful right and then finally the last thing is going to be what the the text says find a store now for this text we're going to put that into a span like so and then span tag what is the spandex jesse span is basically putting everything together in a sort of section and it's very much used for just text oh i mean it doesn't have like any styling so spent is really nice to wrap something up okay so i spent okay find a store and so now if we go to our clever coffee i mean it looks hideous i mean it looks pretty bad and why why so number one our market is not showing up why is that guys because we need to import the marker section here and i actually i have the import for you guys i got the import from the font also i got it for you guys look at this seems logical right because we're using something else so we have to link it yeah so let's do this right there beautiful oh let's go let's go let's go so this is the link for font awesome right here if i go ahead and go ahead and open this one up font awesome okay and now i will put it for you guys to have it as well yeah i'll give you one second here boom there we go this is the lingrel star issue so just copy all of that and put it into your header guys into the head section right here so save that oh and look at that it shows up right here oh but it shows up right here in the lefthand side but the issue as you can see though is what what do you see guys here look what do you see is this it's on the below the whole thing because if i right click on this left nav if i inspect them on this one right and if i show you kind of how it looks like look at this right here here we have the left nav and the right now the right is on the bottom so how do we make these divs go from left to right guys what do you guys think what do we do oh come on give me the data the flex let's go the flex the flex so i go to header container and i say display flex look at that display flex okay see now find the store is right here which is kind of what we need okay and then how do we put this fine store all the way at the corner on the right hand side well this is what some really handy from display flex something called a justified content and what is called it's called space between you see it spaces things or spaces things out as far as possible so if i go to my clever coffee and i do display facts and i say justify content boom justify content and i say space in between spots between them see find the store is right here that's it that's it and then for the right now right right for the right now what are they gonna do how do i make the right now center everything as well so what i do here also display flex on the right now display flags okay and i'm gonna say here align items center to center it vertically well that doesn't happen but it's okay well let me see find a store oh because i need to find a store i need to make this vertical as well so find a store find store let's do display flex on the store so display flex on the store and also align items align items center a b a vertically centered so there you go so now let's go put this into our style of css inside here so to style the css okay let's go to here okay why don't you change the header contains the change number one so the header container let's go to header container where is it jesse um there okay so we'll say display flexo okay and then we'll say justify content space between okay next up we go to right now right now which is ah let's do the find store section actually i'm curious what that will do so to define store section so again we do what do we target guys find dash store and inside here what do we say display flex right jesse and then what align items center center okay look at that you see right there if i refresh this no that doesn't work out no the reason why is because we also why what is it that we what do you think jesse i think i mean we don't have anything regarding right now do we need to go right now i'm going to say display flex yes because the right nav is the parent component so something should be done with that as well and i say and i say align items center oh there we go beautiful okay nice let's go back down this html guys guys look how we're almost done with the header just the header section is almost pretty much done okay sign in next one is a sign in what do we put the sign in section oh the button the button right so the text goes sign in so let's do sign in button sign in and then we'll go and then we do what join now right yeah join now okay awesome so now for this sign in button what do we do to make this actual button because if i look at it right now let's take a look at everything for a second here if i look at my clever coffee i mean it's pretty bad that's pretty bad would you guys agree with that yeah it's it's pretty bad so um what do you do in that case what do you guys think how do we make these actual buttons guys huh how to make them into buttons well that's also pretty simple if i work like right click on this inspect them look at this i'm literally teaching you guys how to learn from other websites you see so look if this is the button what happens here is they're giving a margin and a padding you see right here padding seven pixels 16 pixels which pushes things to the side and then all they're doing is to give them a border see it border around it so if i go to my sign in section let's go to celestia said i do sign in dot sign dash in okay right and what's done inside here jesse um i think in order to make that button hmm i see something with a border i think yep so let's do it i would do something with border radiate padding padding first as well and then we'll do border as well so padding seven pixels uh seven pixels 16 pixels now what this means is very simple what is this first thing i oh by the oh sorry the first thing i always do mmhmm jesse is make it very visible as in uh give it a funky background color okay let's keep it funky okay let's make it funky funky all right so orange okay right yes so you always have the best color choices i know so just be just because of what's it called because we give it a padding so this padding is this is right here top and bottom padding this is left and right panel it's a shortcut guys okay this is a shortcut right here and then here what do now you can see now it looks more like a what like a button all right but not yet kind of so instead what we're gonna do why is people calling me all the time today what's wrong people nowadays so now i know so now with that said let's do a border let's give it a border one pixel solid okay one pixel solid now there's a border let's now give it a border radius that's radius and we'll say this is 50 pixels oh you see right there now looks like this let's remove this background color we don't need that anymore and now pretty much good look at that look at that guys let's go ahead and give it a uh a font way to give it a little more more boldness so we'll do font dash weight font dash weight and we'll say 600. save that now there's more dust in here and at this point that's honestly pretty much it other things let's maybe let's do a line height line this height and we'll give that a 1.2 okay there we go look at that beautiful right so we've got that portion that's assigned n section now let's focus on the join now section but look at this if i go to my html if i actually go to my startups starbucks the sign in section and the join now are pretty much the same am i right or no in terms of buttons are they the same or not guys what do you guys think they're very much the same the only thing is different is pretty much the background color do you see that yes or no yeah good adrian j fold deepak yes adrian yes good good habib somebody said we are lost so guys guys we if we're lost it's okay just feel free to feel free to rewatch this video after okay okay nice yeah yeah yeah nice we're watching it exactly yes good good good good so good so now if i go to join now i'll go to stylus css instead of me creating another another what another style i say this let's target both this div and this div at the same time so i'm gonna say sign in comma dot join dash now so if i go to starbucks here wait no comma not dot but comma see now they're both buttons look at that except of course we need to change the button for the join now so for the join now button let's do the following dot join now join dash now right we're going to override some of the style for join now i'm going to say what the background color for this one for this one's going to be it's going to be black right here okay and i'm going to say the color for this one is going to be white boom you see how that changed it look at that and now it's looking pretty much dissimilar you see right over there beautiful awesome okay now let's add go ahead and add some margin so i'm gonna say i'm gonna go to sign in okay now if i wanna push if this is the box for me guys this is the box right i'm going to push this join now to the right hand side do i use margin or do i use padding modular padding margin good good good so i'm going to say i'm going to go to sign in now dot sign dash in right and i'm going to say margin where margin right is gonna be 16 pixels oh look at that right what about the fine store what about that one about the fine store extraction i wouldn't want that one to touch to sign in but no so i'm going to say dot find that store actually what we have right there yeah okay fine store and i'm going to give it a margin right of what i'm going to give it a 40 pixel budget right so i'll push it look at that hey beautiful look at that see okay i'm also going to give it a font weight font ways give it the boldness color of 600 beautiful a and i say pretty much at this point right now what about the the actual i um what about the actual icon you see the icon is a i uh tag item you see so if i go to style the css how do i change the icon to make it a little bit bigger because i don't like how it's so small what i do here i do the following i do not find find dash store and i say i target the i icon you see this i uh element yeah i target that one and i say for this one i'm gonna say i'm gonna say what padding right is going to be 8 pixels to give something what would that happen find store yeah there we go awesome i don't say no font size really you can adjust the size of the icon by using the property font size yeah because the icon is basically a text element sick right right so it's not an actual image it's a text element right right and then of course now we have the icon now let's go ahead and take a look at the fine store for the fine store i'm going to do display flex on this one display flex on action number c uh display flex and this one because i want to center it as well so i'm gonna do online items center there we go okay so look at now the fine store is like this it looks pretty dang good let me go inspect them on this one look at that that looks so good guys how do you guys think about you guys think about that that's pretty awesome i would say so no i like it look at this we got the fine store we got the sign in now look at this if i do the signing oh it's starting to look like an actual starbucks thing which is pretty cool oh [ __ ] yeah awesome wow it sounded look like it wow i know so now let's go to this if i go to my starbucks here if i you see when i uh when i hover over this this happens so let's right click on this one let's do four state which one hover okay which will make it show me what is the background color right there look at this this is the background color when you hover on this specific thing so that means if i i'm going to copy this specific background color and i'm going to go back to my code and i'm going to say the following i'll say the following i'm going to say dot join now dot join now and let's say hover on the hover of this okay right there background color border color boom show us show us let's see hold on background color border i'll give it to you guys right there in the chat guys okay okay so there we go so now if i go to my clever coffee and i click hover wait does it does it work oh no it doesn't work did i save it wait a minute i didn't save it there we go so save it first let's refresh it look at that oh it's very subtle though it's very subtle but it's cool it's good i like it i like it so look at that now now look at this we can actually add a small transition to it too if i go to transition you can see if i do for example if i go to my starbucks company here this is the original starbucks company and you look at their thing look at this they have a transition basically now transition is will it gives you like a really nice transition of the text so for a transition i'm going to put that into the join now section i'm going to say transition transition all 0.2 seconds that means if i go to clever coffee let me go ahead look at that it's a very slight transition you see that jesse yeah can you zoom in a little bit more somehow your header got smaller again i think yeah i'll make it bigger once again right right i'm going to do a cursor pointer to make it give it like a hand situation okay and let's do command plus right there wow look at that see hey it's very lightly you guys see that yes or no how cool is that how cool is that huh and then what about the sign input section okay let's go to sign in section sign in has a small small looks like if i do inspect them on the sign in section two okay and i do four state hover for state hover okay four state hover and i say what and i say you can see where is it where's oh look at that background colors right there that's the fourth day when you go back a column this one you see on the hover section right there so now if i go to this one if i go to the hover on the sign in right that sign in sign in hover okay boom background color is this okay yeah so now right there right there uhhuh it's very slight as well let's also add a small transition to it too transition right here sign in hover boom boom boom boom good go to go to go good transition right here and we got oh it's like can you guys see that yes or no it's like yeah it's so slight yeah it's so slight it's so slight like it's barely there but it's but you know sometimes the slightest things that make the biggest difference guys honestly wait i i don't want that wait no i don't want that it's the smallest thing that made any difference okay now there's fine store as well see this fine store it also becomes green expect that one this one do you four state on this one two put this here first and this one too and i say four stay hover as well right there this is the color of course you know you see how this allows us to tell them this is literally us looking into the back end code of starbucks and seeing what the css is guys this is what we're literally doing that's so cool right i know so color right that means on the find store section find source on the find store dot find store hover also hover on this one the color is this one right there and also i'm going to do cursor point on this one cursor pointer to give it a hand type situation so that means let me see oh right there look see guys we have completed the header section of the starburst that's what i'm talking about so guys who's the way i'm curious because i know this might be hard to follow along but there's anybody who's actually following along fully with me anybody here yeah syed and megan so you actually yes carlos yes yes yes i love it those you who can't like i said don't worry about it okay the recording will be on youtube i'm also sending recording to resume so don't you worry about it okay somebody said yep yep yep i try something nope uh it's fast for me guys like i said i can't slow down too too much because then though this will be 10 hours long okay but you can of course you know rewatched it like can you give me the promise for that yeah someone said no but i'm learning a lot beautiful awesome back awesome thank you so look guys this is now literally what you guys got for this if you compared to starbucks like like let me zoom in uh hold on let me zoom in this one for you wait let me go to escape escape full screen i want that do come on what happened sometimes this stuff happens like crazy yeah look at that if i go to zoom in on this one guys look at this i mean it's pretty pretty pretty similar this is ours this is theirs this is ours this is theirs look at that it's really similar yeah exactly exactly so there you go so that's kind of what happens okay let me move that one back said how do you get the bottom section if i do inspect them so right click and back right click on this and do inspect right here if you you need to be on chrome though inspect right here and this allows you to inspect the inside of the basically inside of the actual web page understood comprende got it awesome all right next one let's go ahead and build this announcement section that's right here this announcement section and that's pretty much it so that's a nice next one is this announcement that's right right here all right so let's go ahead and do that okay i'm going to put it to the side beautiful there we go all right so we've got the header we've got that suction section next up is gun suction i didn't even realize that okay then what we're gonna do is now do the announcement but of course this kind of stuff that you think about here is that this is inside a specific div you see how this is actually a wrapper yeah you see this is a wrapper guys yeah and this wrapper that we're going to call this rep we're going to call this rapper the mean rapper main wrapper that's what i'm going to call it the main or the main container is what i want to like to say okay the main container so let's do that underneath now this let's go to inside html we've got the header that's good okay since we got on this point right now now is there possibility for you to share this code and the the css in the zoom chat um pretty hard oh pretty much okay let's continue for me to share this with you guys honestly at this point because like i don't have the code unfortunately like i don't know how to show this you guys this code that's the thing so this is not the main section okay so just follow as i'm trying to say main let's create a div code class container div class is equal to what header dash container okay this could be our container right all right that's with the container now for this container as well it's it's pretty pretty smart or actually not the header but it's just called the main container my bad main container okay main container okay and then inside this main container there's a few sections right what's the first section that we have it's this section what should we call this section what do i call this section let's do section section like this what should we call this section i don't want to say the c word coven the covert section the comment section no we're going to do the let's call the info section for now or announcements okay and now announcements okay you guys like that yeah all good you guys like that good good good announcement section see some cdc announcements okay that's pretty good i like that one okay so announcement section okay nice and then underneath that uh the analysis actually has a few different parts to it what parts does it have here well really there's only one part which is this text right here boom so let's do let's put it into a span tag and the span again allows us to later on actually uh it allows us to what's it called um oh no i don't want that either no no it's not allows us to style this text you see what i mean so i'm gonna copy this text for you guys and i'll put it in here boom that's the text we have okay i'm gonna you guys want me to put in chat as well boom so why why we can all use a div as well why spend so yes we can also we can also use a div oh should uh why did you tell uh i was not sharing my screen the whole time on youtube dang it okay it's fine so it's okay so the whole so basically on what's it called on um what's it called on in a span a span it does not have any block containment spend is just very very much like does not have any styling around it because for example if you have a header you have an h2 and h3 sometimes they have you know their own styling they can margin the padding you see what i mean but spans do not have any margins of padding instead right so that can be the issue which is completely fine okay so now we have a span all right for this analysis what are we going to do with this announcement so let's go to loo to our main container and let's go to what we have right now clever coffee and it looks pretty bad right jesse looks pretty pretty bad looks pretty bad so it's too obvious like this okay yeah so let's give it that nice minty green background yeah and i think we got to do something to make it yeah with the main container exactly so this is where i kind of want to divide our css here because our css right now is everything is inside inside style.css right here but i want to divide it up instead i want to do new file i want to say main.css you see right there just to give it some context so we know where do we go for a different css styling and i'm going to import inside our what inside our link so i'm going to say same thing link rel is equal to what style sheet style sheet oh that's not right stylesheet stylesheet href is equal to what what is it guys main.css boom close it out awesome sweet okay and then inside now now it's my second let's give it that the really green color that's that weird green color i'm not sure that's called but whatever it's called so now let's go back to our uh main.css which is in uh where is it main that's maina css which is right here and we'll do announcements announcements okay announcements i'm gonna say background color is equal to what jesse well actually don't know that minty green that means well one color i haven't seen them into green yet yeah so this one right here d right e eight e3 if you could put that in the chat that'd be great okay so if i go to here you can see right there so now that's the color but of course the issue guys what do we have the issue is it's the full width of the whole thing which we don't want of course right so what do we do instead now very simple look at that instead of this now i say announce and say what is our container i'll continue is the main container so if i go to main.css and i do main container i'm also going to give it a max width so main so dot main dash container right there i'm going to say max width is what max width is what 1440 pixels as well and how do we center this in the center guys who knows how do we center it who knows anybody what is it what is it what is it remember same thing margin exactly margin margin zero auto right there oh hey beautiful you see that's pretty good that's pretty good i like that okay okay that's awesome and so now at this point as well you can you can see how this image i'm not sure if you see this but this image is kind of like not allowing the shadow to go through you guys see that or no or should i zoom in on you yeah you see that zooming in yeah yeah you see how there's no box shadow right here that's something called because of z index so if i go here to the header the header and now where's my header and i say here header and i say z index is equal to 10 watch this now what happens oops so so that's okay so that means i need to give my main container a zenith that's lower so the index is 10 i go to main and i do z index on this one is 1 nothing hmm let me see let me see why is that the case why is that the case why is the box shadow not up for the top but instead it's underneath for some reason anybody know why that's the case let me think here for a second header main container maybe the main let me see the main z index maybe that's minus one for this one it's not really the box is not really showing on top of it that's essentially a portion i don't really know what's the case in that case the index 20 oh that's not really it see i want that i want the box shot to appear above this green thing right so right yeah exactly so there's something uh to fix i'm sure that they have something right there to fix let me see let me inspect them on this one so right here do they haven't used the index or anything like that i really don't know if they do let me see letter spacing let me see no let me see box sizing i don't know letter spacing margin zero auto max with no what about that's the main let me see i'm curious letter spacing minus what about the header maybe that's in the header mode but maybe this one no really no nothing much it's not really showing us how do we make sure that how does this the header beco become above everything else the question yeah well the z next right there is he see this is in z and x3 right there so why is r is not showing up like that let me see let's try it out guys you guys ready let's debug some stuff you guys ready let's do a debugging session no let's do a debugging session together okay let's see let's see what we do here so um our goal right now is very very simple okay i want to have these announcements this main container so for this let's go to announcements here let's make the height here 300 pixels just so we have a little bit larger uh world map okay good next up charles says he found the solution what is it charles he says precision relative on the heart the header let me see relative oh he's right oh dang what since hmm damn you know you're literally yeah learn something new every day always interesting always okay but i just don't know why though i guess the question i'm not sure why though position relative huh relative to what is my question also well a relative is fine but why position relative shows above everything else that i'm not sure about yeah i'm not too sure about so okay thank you charles appreciate that so that means if we go to our header okay let's go to our header here for a second here okay let's go to our header and we need to give the header yes a z index of 100 or let's just say even 10. let's get a position i think because relative has more importance than nonrelative i think maybe that's why yeah yeah yeah yeah that case we don't really need this portion right here as well no we don't no we don't even need this portion as well boom okay good okay i like that thank you so much my friend appreciate that awesome sweet so now we've got the info section now which is awesome let's go ahead and now get into our actual uh our this this weird text right here the announcement section the announcement section exactly so let's give it a height let's give it a high exactly but the way i'm gonna give it a high is a little bit different okay jesse i'm gonna give it a high using padding so here's what i'll do i'll do that announcements i'm gonna remove this for a second here i'm gonna do dot announcements and i'm going to say span right because we're targeting the span which the text right right there it says that's a span and so what i'm going to say is the following i'm going to say padding top padding top 3.2 3.2 rem and then that's really specific bottom 3.2 rem yeah because i copied it from starbucks all right okay so nice can you explain what's rem so rem is basically it's it's relative it's relative to the actual font size of the body basically is what it was doing so if the font of the body is 16 pixels rem is 3.2 times 16 pixels right so we they use rem a lot of times because it's if you make a smaller screen size all you have to do is just decrease the font size of the body and everything else decreases so that's why 3.2 rem is or even like em as well same situation right they're very very very very important parts here inside coding in general so i don't see padding here for a second let me make sure i save this spam did i give it a span why next you know what yeah i did so the reason why right now if i do a padding and nothing's happening it's because it's very simple i need to give uh weird enough i need to give this a display flex because then it will look at that you see then it will actually listen to the padding exactly listen to padding also i'm also going to give the span a max width of 60 percent so max width so that we don't have a double those borders so 60 right there okay beautiful and i'm also going to align this span in the center how do we do that well because we get this display flex what can we do here in that case justify content center right right there see also in the span i'm going to say text the line center here inside the span so text align center oh wow yeah to get everything nicely centered exactly exactly exactly right and then honestly at this point that's pretty much it now let's go ahead and change just simply the color and stuff like that so i'm gonna say for this one i'm gonna say the font size is going to be font their size going to be 19 pixels okay and then i'm going to give it a nice job nice and i'm going to say line height line height is going to be 1.75 again this is coming from directly from starbucks okay and the font weight font weight is gonna be what 500 okay right there right so this is kind of how that's going to work out right there see right there boom right there awesome so like that so it's kind of similar to what starbucks kind of has as well you see right there and now let's go ahead and do the learn more we need to give that also a link as well so let's do go to what is it go to learn more here it's html we have facial covering and let's create a learn more section do i have learned more i do right there i'm gonna click enter and i'm gonna do it click attack in a link so ashraf is equal to so far nothing i'm going to put lauren learn lauren learn more in there okay good awesome so let's go and save that let's look at what clever coffee is and i mean it's pretty bad actually still so it's ugly which is completely fine okay guys all right now at this point let's do the following we need to go ahead and change this link a little bit so let's go ahead and go to our style css and i want to change the a tag in general so i'm going to go to and then change the a tag here let me show you so a i go i go to styles he says and i say the a tab because by default the link a tag is a blue color i said i'm going to say color is equal to just black oh you see guys so this so now we're back at the style.css file which we used um for the header section but it's also we have styling here regarding the body so it means like we have some default css settings in this that's not too much s for me with braces but for in the css file okay and we're setting the styling now default for the link so for all the links in the whole app that's what it means okay exactly exactly awesome guys okay next up so we've got the announcement section by cdc that's all bueno that's all good i don't see an issue with that okay next up let's go ahead and work on these bottom sections this is now gets a little more trickier guys okay this gets a little bit more tougher so let's do that right now okay let's go to this html all right awesome okay awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet and then the sign is in html what what how do you think we want to structure this page because here we have the section for announcements what should be the next section called guys what do you guys think i'm just curious what do you guys think what should be called features top left main body main rewards rewards actually pretty good i actually thought of rewards as well so what i'm going to do i'll create a section here called rewards section and it's called class is equal to rewards rewards right there okay rewards but also i'm going to call a left right side because the reason i'm going left to right because we also have a top bottom section you see right there so i'm going to call it a left dash right dash section right there left right section right now every this left price section what does it have it has two it's split into two sections now at this point okay let's think about this what are the two session is split into what is it jesse what do you guess what do you think so you have this this is this is the left right section okay awesome yeah so on the left of that a text a text box text nice a text and then what's on the right hand side oh some funky star i would say like some image right some image so now if we know that let's create that so i'm going to say div here div class and i'm going to say div class text right yeah and then i'm going to create and then that case deal class what image image right there we go so now we have these two divs right so this is why i always say always draw things out and then you can put that straight into html guys got it straight into html cool so we just drew them out nice div class text diff class image okay now the text what does the text have guys what do you guys think it has text one the header one another header and then what else does it have oh a button a button right so inside the text what we're gonna say let's do and give it an h1 tag and h1 tag and it's going to say free coffee wait there's a free car from starbucks what what am i doing here okay free coffee is a type of way next up we do h3 beautiful and then it says join now to start earning rewards okay that's that one boom right that's h3 and then finally the last thing is gonna be what guys what is it the button yeah let's give it a d of class class and what should we call it guys what do you guys we should call it what should it be funds join now join now join now i should i think okay good good good good good but i actually think we should call that better name cta what do you guys know what cta is call to action call to action why am i doing this because why because we have different ctas call to actions you see these buttons right the same styling just different the different type just different buttons so i'm thinking ahead already at this point okay i'm thinking ahead right to so for me i can reuse the same button as well okay so the classic ta awesome then inside here let's go ahead and we need to create an image inside here now so let's go ahead and do image inside here we'll do create an image image and we'll say source is equal to what what is the source here jesse what do you think jesse um image so copy image address copy link right copy image address boom png and then boom let me put the three guys into into your chats yeah can you check line 51 51 you you what droid now join that's what's up all right so we got a div class image okay that's awesome all right that's good now let's see what we actually got in that case okay let me see what we got in that case so if i go to my my clever coffee that looks bad i figured real bad but hey the image looks kind of cool okay it says overflow hit an image jaylard said so guys this is where now we go back into the spec element and let's see what we can do now at this point i'm going to put this a little bit more to the side now i'm going to loot like a side section here so look at this let's really quickly do this inside our look at this so here i have look at this i have the text on the left and the top and then the image in the bottom right to fix that it's very simple how do i make this from left to right who knows who knows anybody flex that's right so if i go to my left right section i say display flex boom see now what from left to right okay next says flex it baby flex it baby let's go so now okay how do i give it every single section a specific width a a half width and half height what do you guys think well i do with 50 on this one on this one okay and then i do width 50 on the image so look width 50 on the image see right there so now this is right here is 50 as you can see let me go ahead and say this this right now is 50 at this point and this is kind of 50 but it's not there yet i need some help i need some help which is fine technically it's 50 it's just not showing the 100 percent of it exactly exactly so to fix that it's going to be pretty pretty simple actually to fix this specific uh section all right guys look at that let's come and look at the image here so fifty percent of the image well if we simply now just go to the image i'm i'm gonna go to specific image and i'm gonna give this image a 420 pixels let's do this class image and i'm going to say height oh 420 pixels boom damn look at that see then i go to the image and i say height also 420 pixels oh okay not not quite there not quite there right what i want right it's completely fine i actually know it is quite there actually i was saying but i also wondering how come you now did 420 pixels two times while before you set the height of the parent at 100 and then the image on a specific amount of i think you're right we just did a hundred percent there you go there we go see that's how we do it jesse let's see that's how we roll that's how we do it how we roll right so height but let me see so you see at this height of 420 pixels let me see if i right click split them on this one it kind of the height decreases depending on the image so um oh so we'll see i think for now we'll just keep it 420 pixels for now yeah we'll keep it at that for now and then we'll see how we change it later on okay right right by the way guys show in the chat a little bit how amazing of a job nas is doing oh hey let's go which is gracias but it's great great awesome all right so let's see next up guys we got the left right section okay we need to create some specific spacing from the top the bottom so let's go back to our announcement section and let's do margin bottom on the announcement section okay so the margin bottom 32 pixels so announcements we'll do margin bottom margin bottom margin dash bottom what is it 32 pixels boom you see that gives us some space exactly nice let's now look at our the text section you see this text section now has a few different things h1 h3 and a div right how do we center those two specific things guys what do you guys think how do we send them vertically what do you guys think display flex my friends always display flex so if i go do this i do display flex on this one you can see it goes from left to right you see display flex always makes it go from left to right but i can change that i can do flex direction column and that makes it go from top to bottom you see that's it right yeah but now of course now what do we do how do we center it horizontally so first i'm going to do justify content well center which will center it actually vertically and then i will do online items align items center center boom right there see also yeah exactly also i'm going to remove all these hideous margins that are in here too i don't really don't like these margins of the the margins of the eight ones and the paragraph guys yeah i just i just hate that i just hate that stuff okay awesome next up what i want to do as well is let's go ahead to margin zero let's add a background color so you can see if i right click on this specific thing there is a background color on this whole div no this one this one this one here there's the color right here let me give you guys in the chat boom f1 f8 f6 good good good good awesome i'll do it nice nice nice nice so now it's the one i already put in the chat thank you okay thank you let's go with the clever coffee grab a couple photo for the win all right let's go and then for the text portion we do background color that's not gonna color as you can see now now we have a nice background color look at that it starts starting to kind of look pretty good guys what do you guys think right i guess you think it's starting to look pretty good i think so i think so awesome all right so now all we got to do now is we have all this stuff let's actually take this to our style of css ready for this let's do it so if we know i have this let's go to our main.css this is why we're doing the css for this one and then on the announcement section right we do margin bottom 32 pixels right here that's what we did right here okay so we say margin bottom margin dash bottom 32 pixels okay awesome okay then we go to the rewards section okay on the left right side let's do display flex and on the left right section so i'm going to say left dot left dash right dash section this is going to target what div the left right section div right and i'm going to say display flex on this one okay next up let's do target the left right section text you see this text right here so i'm going to say left left right section let's say dot text and how do we target this jesse i wasn't paying attention because i was paying attention to the chat all good oh good so we got the text i'm gonna copy and paste all of this specific stuff look at that right and then of course if we go to our tucker our image now so we say the left right section do that image okay same thing right we're gonna do the width fifty percent high of 120 pixels right there wait for uh good good good awesome and then the text is also with 30 as you guys know already at this point and then the height of the image now how do we how do we target on the image guys what do you guys think how do we take only the image left right section and we say what image right there see image inside that and here i say height of 100 height 100 beautiful nice that's it look at that okay that's it so now if i go and save this save this let's go back to our console let's refresh our thingy the bob oh nice let's remove all these margins that are here so we'll do margin zero on the h1 tag guys put it in h you put in the comments how are we gonna target only the h1 give me give me give me the that little thing what is it how do we target each one tell me put it to me in the comments how do we target that no not just not just like that give me some some tree traversal stuff everybody just freeze they're thinking they're going to w3schools.com right now no no no okay so nice nice nice nice nice oh good a good discounted for my ipad for some reason so good for some reason my apples connect sometimes boom nice good left right good good good nice job guys good job good job i like that answer i like that and that's a good answer guys yes left right section with that portion awesome i like that okay so that means now let me go ahead and put this in here okay good awesome sweet yes good good so now we do left right section we do actually i'm gonna do like this i'm gonna do dot text dot text h1 nice and then i'm gonna say the following margin zero how do we also target the the how do we also target the h3 also dot text h3 right and so now if we look at i see there's a lot of all these margins are gone pretty much which is good okay now we can add our own little margins which is a much much better now so now if i go do that let's do let's also do font weight of 400 just to give it a font weight on these all of these ones font weight or 400 good now there's a little more font here which is all i which i like a lot and then for the each one let's do dot text h1 let's do margin bottom bottom 24 pixels okay awesome yes you see that that pushed a little bit away and then let's do for the other one for the h3 same thing let's do that text that text h3 good then we'll do uh margin bottom 32 pixels margin dash bottom 32 pixels right so that one the join now boom we'll go yes you see how starting to play out yes i know i like it i like it like i like it okay so now let's go and do this and then for the h3 let's do a font size of 19 pixels it's a little bit more viewable okay i like it and then honestly that's that's pretty pretty much it let's let's do a max well actually no i don't think we're good with that one actually so i don't want that at this point so and then let's focus on the image which you already have done which is we do if we give it a width of 80 percent at this point guys let's focus on the join now button all right same button as we've done before remember the sign in button same situation similar situation okay looks very very similar as this button just a different background color so now let's do that okay one other thing i forgot to tell you guys is for the text let's give it a color as well because the color is different so if i right click on this color you see it's not black anymore it's like a greenish color look at that ah yeah you see if i look at it the color here you see it's like it's a greenish color see that right there so how do i target all the text within that well i just go to the text section right here and i say right there color is this that's it you see now my clever coffee all my color is gonna be the greenish color it makes sense comprende good next up is let's add a padding because if i make this really small you guys will see that it's gonna hit the wall you see and i don't like that it's pretty bad like it's that's pretty pretty pretty pretty bad so we don't want that so that means what i'll do is i'll do a padding here and i'll give it a padding for this situation here so i'm gonna say padding and then the top bottom padding is gonna be 32 pixels left and right is going to be 48 pixels and then 48 pixels okay look at that it's starting to look so good i like it i like it i like it like a lot nice okay good good good all right beautiful next up let's go ahead and uh let's do that let me see okay i like that okay beautiful font size okay at this point but it's pretty pretty much done let me see if i refresh this where are we at basically basically we're supposed to be all right let's go to our what's it called to our uh button the what button that join the button so we'll do ct how do we target the cta guys let me know in the comments below how many let me know in the zoom chat how do we to the cta section what do we do c t h what do we do guys who knows what else well it's a diff class right so we'll do yeah that tech well okay good go go so that yes good good that text that cta perfect yes perfect yes yes yes exactly so what we get the point you don't have to spam the chat please yeah please don't i get it all right awesome so now the cta let's also give us some padding that's also just i did the last time for the cta i'm gonna do padding top padding that's gonna be that's gonna be 7 pixels and then 16 pixels right here okay now you don't see it yet let's get a border border one pixel solid okay okay oh look at that you see it right there boom now oh yeah yeah button okay next up let's go ahead and do a border radius radius just like before we do 50 pixels for the radius that's increase the curvature guys okay and then we'll go ahead and add in the color let's do it let's change the color for this one so color is gonna be this hashtag or pound one one e three nine three two right there right there okay awesome that's that color okay sweet sweet sweet sweet let's do a font weight of 600 to get a little more boldness nice look at that all right let's do a cursive pointer so we can actually hover over it properly cursor pointer because you see now there's a hand if i hover over this if i save this right here now there's a button now it feels like a button you see that right there before it was just like a mouse pointer yeah but now it's pretty good which i like all right awesome sweet next up let's go ahead and do a hover statement so how do you do give me a css for the hover stick guys give me a css for the hover state guys tell me how do you how did you hover on this dot text dot what that cta however by the way people are asking why are you first saying dot text in front of that cta because because if i go to html it's all inside the text class right because maybe i might want to use this div somewhere outside of here and it might have a different styling you see that uhhuh guys i want to target the cta only within the text section got it yeah that specific cta but still with the same styling from other cities exactly that's what allows us to do that okay make sense right right right yeah that makes sense makes total sense okay awesome that's good good question though good question so mainly css okay awesome sweet i like that so now that's pretty good let's do a hover state for this on the hover this hover the state let's go ahead and see what it does what happens if i inspect them on this one inspect element same thing guys you know the drill right for state right click for state hover boom this gives us the background color oh right there see oh this is too easy starbucks you made it too easy for us you made it too easy for starbucks okay right there so that means if i hover over this the background color changes to this one right there okay awesome yeah exactly and then what we'll do is let's do a transition to get it give it some more fluid more transition which is a little bit more smoother mmhmm 0.2 seconds and then ease just so you guys know the way this works is very simple you see that the transition so if i go ahead and zoom in on this one so mr man so you guys can see it see it's very slight right you see that it's a very slight this is what i like about this page actually is that it's so simple but there's those little slight touches that make it so good right so what this right here is this is what are you transitioning for how many seconds and then what transition type are you using in our case it's just the ease transition or which is usually everything so everything meaning we're transitioning the background color the color the way that there's a width of changes anything basically see what i mean so if i do here and i say width width 300 pixels it will transition and you will see it look let me see i mean maybe not we saw it did you see it yeah yeah ah it's kind of it's okay i think i need to change the padding on this one in that case hold on let me see so padding padding uh some pixels if i do if i do like 48 pixels left and right then that will transition let me see right but it's a really good way to show how transition yeah whoa guys look see if i do 0.2 seconds look at this okay let's see it that's pretty cool actually it's actually pretty cool i kind of like that it's a very common feature on a website actually guys so this is how you make that zoom effect basically right i kind of like that actually mc you guys like that should we keep that in there what do you guys think yeah give me a thumbs up or thumbs down thumbs up and thumbs up yes everybody yes yes yes okay all right okay i kind of like that okay okay it doesn't work that fast but we get it it's nice all right you guys get the point all right so look at this point we're done with this section but here's the cool the reason why we were so smart about our css because now what is the next section guys it's this section now this section is very similar to the other section except what what changes here guys what do you guys think what changes here um different image different well not just that but also the image was here but now it's actually just here on the left hand side yeah and the text is actually just simply here right here you see that right there the text is here while everything else in the left side you see that so with that said if i go to my initial html let's be smart about this in this html okay here's my html okay good here's my section for this rewards i'm going to copy this left section fully literally i'm going to copy this left section and i'll paste it in there okay what should we call this guys now this should be called i'm going to call this chill section because it says delightfully chill okay i like that chill section chill section right right so if i save this of course if i go to my clever coffee you see now we have two of the same things which is fine okay but look if i now simply just change up in my div where the text is you see let me see look at this i'm gonna put now the text in the second text boom there we go now simple as that this is why you have to be smart sometimes beforehand before you do a lot of all this coding make sense comprende yeah exactly exactly so so this point what do we do now right at this point of course we need to change the image now so let's change the image to this image i'm going to copy image address for this one i'm going to change this image address to this one hold on let me change the image on this one let me go ahead and change it ah where is it okay boom this is the image jammers now so it's a new image now let's see oh let's go let's go okay beautiful and of course i'm gonna give you guys damage as well right there that's the image right there see the jpeg oh it looks like charles already got it for you guys yeah charles on the money today let's go charles is focused i like it okay also what changes here guys the text also changes so delightfully chill so so for the each one we have what it says delightfully chill now right the the like the league chill right and then the second one is going to be this one so refresh your day with the bright tropical flavors of our star drinks kiwi star food shorebox refreshers i didn't know you became a voice actor i know i'm multiple things oh that's for sure that's for sure so we got that okay and now we go to the order ice beverage now we say older ice beverage here in the cta okay so now instead of this one we do order iced beverage okay my friends should we talk like this the whole time huh uh huh do you guys want me to talk about this some people actually say yes okay all right guys so at this point we've got the order ice beverage no no let's say this in here okay no no good good i'll say no too but the chat also mainly says no oh come on you guys don't like this come on scoop come on oh come on be nice guys yeah it means be nice like like the real knives all right so now look delightfully chill awesome okay i like that okay good now that what we want to do let's go ahead and add a margin to the bottom so you can see that there's a margin between these specific sections you see that there's a margin right here how do we make that margin work well that's pretty simple actually the margin kind of kind of comes from a let me see where the margin is left right section margin but yeah so left right section let's do margin bottom 32 pixels so let me do yeah yep so if i'm going to do a stylus csx css yeah and if i just yell that to the announcement section guys so that's why between the announcements and the first uh rewards section we also have that space so we're going to be applying that same thing now too yeah sorry section and we'll do margin bottom here margin bottom bottom and then we'll do 32 pixels so if i go to my clever coffee right there see now we have some spacing around this right here let me go clear this out nice and now we have some spacing which is good okay awesome we got a space here which is good which is good i like that okay awesome and then let's now change this hideous uh thing that just happened with the image right because we have a height a fixed height which is not good of course um so what do we do with that that's a good question how do we make that work huh very simple okay let's look at this what happened what needs to happen here in spectrum on this one okay inspect element this one okay inspect them on this one okay let's go to our look at this um let me go make this a little bit larger so that you guys can see that okay let's do left right section which is fine image should be 50 but it's not which is okay right and then this is for some reason is more than 50 which is i'm not sure that's the case as well but that's okay we can fix that in a second here don't worry about that guys um i think the best way actually to fix this would actually be the following look at this guys here's a really cool hack i want you guys to think about the left and right section are both display flex if i do this if i say flex one and i say here flex one damn it didn't work okay let's see what else can we do uh that didn't work let's see because i was so confident that one [Laughter] well usually you're right about these things to be honest so okay 50 hold on let me go over here 50 no lex 1 flex 1 display flex so what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to give it create an equal distribution of the left is equally distributed to the right section okay i think because it has something to do with the with the image i think honestly i think because the image so let's do with 100 on this one okay which is fine okay is that equal distributed by the way on the bottom section right i think it is right yeah i think it is actually hold on height 100 but if i go to my let's just change it up for this image so i'm going to say width okay is that equal distribution or no what do you guys think is it because i feel like it is if i do flex one for 20 let me see let me see 420. this is this is actually equal you see that right there this r is actually equal starbucks yeah that's actually that makes yeah that makes sense okay good good good that makes sense okay okay that makes sense okay i like that let me see so if i increase that it's still the same okay that's good that's good oh it's good i like it so let me go back to color coffee oh yeah so that means actually this needs to be fixed partially this is the wrong one right here this is the wrong one this is the right one actually partially okay oh mmhmm so now let me shoot this if i do the following um i mean what are they trying to do here they're trying to do with 50 100 percent this is fine let's do this let me try this case okay guys okay so let me remove with and with the phillips on this one i'm gonna give it a flex one instead lex one i'm gonna give this a flex one as well on the image so flex on the image so flex on what is can you swamp dudes can you explain what flex one does jesse so flex mode guys if you use display flex basically with flex 1 you're saying okay that item can take up all of the space that is left within the section to which display flex is applied i know that sounds really strange you can look up more information at the complete guide of like on css flexbox from csx tricks it's a really good one but that's how that works okay exactly so not only can you say flex by the way one stands sort of 400 percent because you can also give something a flex of 0.6 okay guys um let me see so now if i go to my this image let me go let me go to this left right section for 20 420 wait what how come this is 420 and then that's also for 20 but yeah it doesn't match what's in the bottom section the hell what's wrong with this thing hold on this is 420 that's 420 wait no this is 555. hold on 585 okay how about this this is 59 85 what the hell flex start let me see flex looks like sucks flex flex flex flex this is really good debugging i like it this is like us thinking about it okay let me see what's the best thing about this to be honest guys a lot of people are worried that they're not following fast enough or don't know what to do when being stuck and i told them listen 90 of the time when you're a developer you're sometimes stuck in code and actually us solving this now is what a real developer does so guys this is a real life case real simulation of how developers work okay so why should learn because you're about to see how nas saw something okay so wait shut up so okay so what the first i want to see is the following turn this out guys so um the one thing i want to make sure that we have is we need to give it a starting starting width so we need to do like a flex to flex bases okay it can be length okay so let's do flat space in this case okay so let's do image we'll do okay so i got this okay so we'll do so in the image section let me see here the image says and we'll do flex basis here let's give this a width of of of 100 as well okay let's do a lex let me see um flex basis flex basis that's going to be um no image no hold on they should be 50 right here lex i think i should i should refresh this thing come on let me see i mean that kind of worked though let me see here for a second okay that kind of worked the 49 for no that's not it 49 45. no text see so we'll do flex bases on this one so what flex basis does is that gives us a direct proportion you're saying that the basis of this text is fifty percent okay that's what you're saying however fifty percent of what in this case of the following right yeah together flex space is fifty percent of this one too all right let's see this oh okay why is it still not fully centered my my am i like delusional right now i feel like it's centered right right or no the image looks a little bit smaller how many pixel is it yeah but is it the center what do you guys think the texas is this sexy centered let me see so height damn this is like making something 50 is really hard i guess that's the case huh huh let's see a width of 100 let me see uh a hundred percent okay let's do position relative on this one okay so that's kind of there though it's kind of there though it's just weird because of the padding inside it so yeah if i remove this padding you see the pending is already removed no no oh you removed it okay look at that just dead yeah yeah yeah this is good you see it's better i know why damn this always comes to play so what did you learn as so look so look you see how when i do padding you see how it it makes things kind of like shift here's why because by default there's a box styling so look at this if i go to here if i right click on this and i inspect that on this one this is from a form this is from starbucks coffee guys from starbucks okay this is a really good learning opportunity for you guys check this out i want you guys to listen to this carefully okay so sometimes i myself forget about this specific section so look this is right here is exactly 472 pixels and so is down you see they're both equal 50 exactly right the reason why i got screwed up is because of the because of the width and the padding because why it's actually because of the box sizing so look if i go to a box this is the interesting thing oh it always scrolls up guys always so we could right okay yeah yeah so there is a look at this uh let me show you the hope that there's a better one so look there's a content box and there's a border box so a box size and basically if i say width 50 the problem is the fact that when i do a padding right it screws up the whole box right versus if i say with fifty percent that's only going to be like that's gonna discount the padding right because of by default i think it's by default it's this by default i'm not sure what the default is but i think the default is this one right but if i say border box it's actually gonna def when i say 50 it's going to include the padding inside of it as well that's the interesting thing right so in here if i say 50 it's going to be like okay great with 50 percent but the padding is going to make it larger because the padding is extra spacing but if yeah so now guys this is this is the holy grail right here this is the holy grail and you guys will realize this look at this if i go to style that css let's do this i'm going to say this star everything box sizing and i'm going to say order order box this thing is what screws up literally everybody and look at that guys oh exactly you see that right there just a hint for you whenever you're building a project box sizing border box just keep it to your liking just to make that use always do this now what do you know do you guys know what this star is who knows what this star means anybody what does a star mean what is this yes yes there is a universal selector it's a universal exactly it's a universal selected that's what the star means okay guys it's a universal selector guys okay exactly beautiful nice job nice job on that one yes so that means that means select all elements and give them a box as an imported box that's literally that's literally all it means guys that's that's pretty much beautiful so now if that's fixed look at that see that literally fixed all of our problems right that literally fixed all of our problems that you guys had so now all i got to do now let me go ahead and how can i no how can i um no i'm gonna just how can i no okay there we go thank god all right so that literally affects all the problems if i refresh this fully okay that's fine okay good good good now i go back to my this image because i want to make sure this image is a full width god people are calling me all day today the hell i don't want this okay so a height of 124 let's remove this height forget this height fully okay never mind forget this height for this one let's do [Laughter] um that's so funny i want to give this image this image like this it's 50 good why is it that this height of sun changes happens here yeah instead because i'm going to give this image a with a 50 look width hey let's go you see right there this is what just changed yes exactly beautiful awesome i like that and this image let's do display flex on this one yes beautiful i love that so here's what we just did okay basically here's what we just did i just want to give you guys guys some context okay i said we had we had this image right here this div and we had this height which was great and it was lit the thing is it was limiting the image because i didn't i want basically here's what i want if i have this height right it's static that means that if i increase this the height you see how the images stretch you see that you see how the image do you guys see how the images are stretching you see that yes or no well yeah and that's yeah i can prevent that from happening because if i remove this height right and instead all what i do is i as i allow it to change the height because i say the width is always a hundred percent of this div and the hype will automatically change based on that because the aspect ratio changes so if i do this now you see this this image made it became bigger and so this image the high chance automatically that's the cool part right there so now let's make that change inside oh my god this just look at oh and now it's like this lilies will make oh that's so good guys so good that's great so good so now if we go back to our what do we change let's go back to our main.css right uh let's go back to our what do we change the image right so left right section image where's the left right section image where is it you guys learning you guys learning some fun things you guys liking this guys you guys liking this stuff yeah display flex on this one because display flex allows it to be more good good good i like it yep yeah very nice let's go to image here and instead of um having an image be a height of 100 let's do the image is going to be width of 100 that's going to be the big difference you see so the width changes based on the thing so let me go back to here and now let me refresh this again boom right there look at that you see and now it seems a lot a lot more playful right okay next let's do the h3 you see this h3 it's not centered as well so let's go ahead and center this one too so we'll do center on this one so dot text h3 will do text align center okay awesome nice i like that and then of course we need to ch we need to change this uh font as well and here's the font and i'll give you guys how this because it looks it's it's a little bit it's trust me it's it's interesting yeah so here for this specific one to make this happen let me go ahead and put this to the left hand side you guys can see that okay good see ah looking so good now guys look at this oh i love it so for this specific one how do we target only this specific section i want you guys to put in the chat or put it in the comments uh in the in the zoom chat how do we talk only hey i actually don't think they do because here's why because here's why i'm going to do instead of doing text i'm going to do that chill that text each one oh so it's specifically just the tactical for this chill section section exactly right the chill section so i'm gonna say font dash wait here i'm going to say 700 okay i'm gonna do line height okay of 1.2 look at that it's starting to change you see that right there all right let's do the next one let's do a font size this is actually one font size of literally 50 pixels guys uh probably probably lesser probably smaller it's a bit too big i mean i mean we can do actually and then text align center here text align center on the text h1 so do text align center you see things that are uncommon between everything i put them just simply in text text each one things are specific to chill i put them inside the chill section so for example the common situation they'll have is text align center to keep them centered you see rightfully yeah but when you yeah but when you want to specifically target something within a certain sec section you just target the section first how to target the the parent section first to tell exactly where to go yeah exactly yeah that's why you have to think ahead guys mmhmm awesome okay good good guys this is a lot of work just so you guys know there's a lot of work we'll be doing all right next up let's go ahead and change the this specific section i want to change up this specific section uh this actually kind of looks like uh the chill text let me see uh let's also do chill text each one i'll do letter spacing as well come on letter spacing we'll do eight pixels so if i go to clara coffee actually clever coffee sounds pretty cool really enough it does i know right would be cool though to just drink coffee and become clever why not become get clever guys that chill then dot text let's focus on the h3 now right and here we'll do what we'll do font size size 24 pixels save that oh right and the thing we need to do a as well is some kind of a line height because the line height is not the best here so we'll go to starbucks here what is the line height of this one so if i inspect them on this one you see i inspect element font size 24 pixels for this one you see this fine size 24 pixels let's look at the line height and sometimes the line i can simply get it by going to compute it i scroll down and i go to line height 36 pixels right here see line height 1.5 that's it right there so i hear i say text h3 and i say line height line height no not line style line height line height 1.5 so if i go to my starbucks cutter coffee hey guys look at that oh oh wow i know it's looking really good now i love it all right we also need to change but immediately change this color because it's not green anymore this background color is different guys remember this background color is different so let me go let me go go to the background color we have here the background color here is different so it's this one this background color actually let me give you guys this in the zoom chat okay beautiful that's the background color i'm gonna put that in there so you guys can all have it let me go finish this up bomb and then we're gonna put this on guys what do you guys think the chill section right the chill section is different the chill that text section correct the chill text that chill that text right and the background color is not this one so now if i go to here cloud coffee oh look at that oh uh huh look at that guys how you like you guys liking this guys look at this so beautiful manuel says that's awesome lucas llamo adriana yes jawad okay i think fantastic yeah looking really really good guys look at this oh wow oh how dope is this i love it love it i love it it says guys this is so cool all right i don't know if that we're almost done i mean let me look we got this section this section uh we might do this section maybe i'll leave someone for homework for you to do and then we have the footer section we'll have the footer section as well so we don't have many searches to go we have these now sessions to go pretty much and that's pretty much it okay all right cool next up so let's go ahead and now go to the next section which is going to be these top bottoms this is the this is going to be the harder one guys now you get ready for this you guys ready strap on put your seatbelt on hold on my leg my leg is hurting me hold on oh my god guys if you're ready please say it in the chat okay let's bring back some energy maybe play some music no no honestly i kind of like i like kind of like how chill it is you guys like how chill it is right now but need too much energy right now no i think we're good right am i good [Laughter] so she's like i mean you can just do some chill music hey so awesome let's do this guys all right we got this section clever chill music clever chill music in the house gonna order up gonna coat it up gonna have fun easy as that let's go exactly all right beautiful all right next one so we got this portion let's go to this portion now this porsche is going to be a little difficult different guys okay we've got the left right section which looks really good by the way so good nice job on that one uh the next section is gonna be the okay so we got the left and right section now the next is gonna be let me look at my look at my uh cheat sheet here because i have my tshirt here as well all right trust me i got you my i got my cheat sheets as well guys trust me all right next one is gonna be what well we have a section but it has two what what should we call what you guys should what should we call this section if this section was left and right this one what should we call this section guys what do you guys think what do you guys think what is it left left chill section left left chills grid yes oh come on guys yeah good job top and bottom section there we go so let's do create a section for this one another section okay section boom right there all right let's create a top and bottom section so we'll do section right here and inside this section there's two top and bottom this is one div class is equal to top dash bottom dash section okay right there and then the last one's gonna be and then there's one other one right here div class also top dash bottom dash section boom right there you see okay there we go and then these ones now have their own little containers okay have their own little containers so on this one let's create a section container div class div class i'm going to say is equal to section container foam right there okay and sending this one div class section that's container good right there okay so now we have left section and then the right section okay and of course these ones you can see also have what they have the what they have the class image and the class text so really i can literally copy this whole thing inside here and just paste it guys that's the cool part so if i have this look at this i just do image boom boom boom so if i could power this let me see let me save this just happen okay okay i got in here let's do in here too okay save that see so now i have look the top bottom section also has image and text same thing with this one image and text except the delay dial from top to bottom instead of left to right so if i save that right again i literally copied the image and text from the top section and just put it inside the section container you see right there that's all i did let's refresh it here oh god that looks hideous which is great like like a tropical smoothie in your face good question we have two top bottom sections so won't the code confuse the two no it won't it really doesn't matter you can have as many top boundaries as you want that's the interesting thing right so okay now look let's inspect them on this one watch the magic happen guys literally magic is about to happen look at this we have one top bottom section we have another type of section and there are kind of more one is here or one is the bottom you see that good question how do we make them left to right what do you guys think do you guys think display flex baby let's go display okay now you see it's kind of not there but don't worry about it we got this covered because why because we can do with right so look at this i can do this type of section i can make this one a width of 50 so let's do width of 50 for this one a and then i can do it with 30 for the second one width or 50 boom okay awesome so now we get these okay also looks hideous but don't don't worry about it we got you we got you guys got you okay so now we got this section okay great awesome now you see the issue we have now though is that if we go to our session container we have the image right there at the top which is pretty pretty damn large and i like that one i have the text at the bottom just fine as well right so let's do this let's do session container which is the whole thing the whole thinking about let's make this one also a display flex okay okay but here's the issue now you see it's left to right how to make it tap the bottom legs direction column because the default direction of display flex is always from left to right right guys exactly exactly now for this image right here let's make this image a width of 100 percent see there we go see what we just did guys simple as that yeah because look guys look if you look at the the css go ahead you can see there the top top bottom section 50 then the child within that has images with hundred percent and within that the image itself also has a hundred percent yeah so which is exactly so this is the with yeah sorry jesse go ahead no it only stretched out until that fifty percent of the parent exactly exactly right and this is the image of course right so there you go guys we've been coding for the past three hours just so you guys know three hours we're coming back to you if you're still in this call and having fun and coding with us okay keep going i mean i mean this is fun for me i i mean honestly yeah for me too oh i'm just enjoying this okay let's do it sorry i'm eating something a little bit too so am i okay i'm good next up text how should we do this also display on this one display flash on this one right well flash direction right flattering column okay good of course and then let's do this and then do uh let's um well it's already centered partially that's good let's go to ct8 look at this cta uh we'll fix that later actually i need to fix that in a bit cta you see how stretched out how do we how do you guys think we prevent the cda from being stretched out i'm just curious just just curiosity from you guys what do you guys think anybody know padding actually not not necessarily nope nope not with not box not auto nope nope nope nope nope are all wrong so how do we make that work well very simple so first first sorry when you talk all the time are you okay i am now okay i'm good now okay good so now let's go to holy moly hopefully i don't die no don't die okay so now let's do you see you need to do this playflex in the section so do section under display display flex on this one good next up um top bottom section needs to be needs to be with 50 so we'll do dot top dash bottom dash section okay that's 50 so that's width or 50 percent good next up sasha container that session container dash container also display flex so try to try to keep up with me as fast as possible guys at this point because we've done the changes i'm just applying them like direction column column okay next right next one is going to be the image so we'll do a dot image so a dot image within what a top bottom section so we'll do this we'll do we'll do a dot top bottom section dot image okay and we'll say what width width of 100 good and then let's target the actual image within that so we'll say dot um image now should dot top bottom section dot image that image and we'll say what we'll say image now so we're talking adjust the image now and we'll say what also with 100 right okay good okay good next up the text let's go to the text one so do dot dot top bottom section dot text good and we'll say here display flex like so and we'll save like directional column beautiful awesome sweet sweet sweet good good and so now if we save this all we should technically see two amazing images that look like this that awesome that's pretty cool huh pretty cool huh look at that awesome sweet so that's that's working pretty well now here's my question the ct8 uh it's fully shorter it's horrible i i'm sure you don't like it either i don't like it either now before we do i should do i know so i know i'm sorry this is just this is what i love about code guys it looks so ugly in the beginning but after a few tips and tricks you know you can make it look really really good right so let's just keep going where did my piece go oh there it is okay good i just i don't know what just happened here that was weird anyways it's okay we're back it's all right it's all right it's all right that's right all right we're live we're still live we're still alive guys right we're still alive hopefully nobody nobody's uh we're good no we're still alive we're like first part question right let's now now take this number one let's copy this image address let's switch out the image address in here okay so i'm gonna do a little bit bigger in here so you guys see it so again the top bottom section is this is the first top of the section so let's go ahead and switch out this one this image so hold on boom command v you guys want the link in the in the chat yeah about if he gets in the chat good boom boom boom right there awesome sweet sweet sweet good good good good good nice nice nice nice awesome good good nice if that's working that's all working very well um you got you guys got the image yes next up image is the ubereats one so copy image address here next one let's go to copy and paste into this image so we know what image we're working with let's save that good let's see what we got so far oh that was not bad look at that okay now let's fix this hideous order ice beverage thing or this hideous button so here's the thing guys the reason why it's being stretched out because by by default we have flex direction column okay and so what flax direction column does to us is very simply is flux direction column literally is like saying you know give the full width but the height now can be different right so what can we do is very simple look check this out guys i can do span guys span order iced beverage look at this actually here's a better way of doing this okay here's about doing this you guys ready for this my friends are you guys ready check this out if i simply just put a e cta container guys if all i do is just put a div class and i just say cta container container because the container is though it's going to expand but the other thing is not going to expand so whatever i got to say here for example just say this is this is um uber eats whatever it's gonna be right if i just do it like this come on x boom right there right if i just do that we're pretty much golden guys why oh because here's the the container is going to expand but the thing inside here is not going to expand so here's what i'm trying to say if i refresh this let me see oh [ __ ] i was wrong oh damn okay let's continue on i'm just kidding actually i actually know how to fix it inspect element you do i do how so because why look we have cta container right here you see this it's the full width at the bottom you guess i guess copying with me razor you still you copy what i'm saying yeah you're copying copy oh good so if i look at the bottom section see it's the full width right here right so if i click on the cta container it's the full width but the really cool thing about display flex is it doesn't do forward so look if i do this if i do ct contain and i say display flex oh look at that see it's not full with anymore look at that guys see no more full width all i gotta say now display flex i do like this online item center and then i do justify content center to center them both vertically and horizontally and boom right there overeats just like that see that jesse so all i gotta do is put it in the container and the container now has it's like for example every single container has its own virtual reality no little that's how i think about it right it has its own version right that's the really cool part about it and so it can control the virtual reality in whichever way you want so if i do now if i if i create a ct container i'm going to copy this all this kind of stuff which is great okay let's go ahead and copy this let's put it into our our cta container style so let's go to style here oh now let's go to main.css actually here okay dot cta container oh okay good display flex line on the center good good good good just go ahead and save this save this i'm just gonna be good nice good nice see this has to take him but this does not so that means me to [ __ ] ticketing around that too so let's put a cta container here mmhmm uhhuh html same thing cta container let's put it around this cta boom let's put this inside the cta container let's close up this dip wow and then bada boom bada bang and then by the boom save it boom order ice beverage is now just simply centered you see that's it yes simple as that so i think that's pretty cool guys what do you guys think it's pretty awesome right that's pretty pretty awesome okay good so we got that portion let's go ahead and do this now let's go to our starbucks looks like this starbucks now you see how there's you see how there's space in between this space right here you guys see that check this out you guys are going to be blown away by this how do we do this look at this so the cool thing about this one is the following is basically i'm going to add a margin to the right side of this in a margin to the left side of this and literally that's it so look look we have the section container you see this that envelops everything else now there's the top bottom section there's two top bottom sections you see that guys right there one and then two how do i only tell one bottom section to do margin right and then another bottom section to do margin left what do you guys think by the way guys yes this code will be pushed to github at the end of this session this code will push the github so don't worry about it okay nicer yes we get an id you're right and that's the rule that's correct but i'm gonna go fancy with this one i'm gonna say this oh i'm gonna say that top bottom section let's say first child oops that means of all top bottom sections within this app we are going to be targeting the first one one margin right 16 pixels look at this and then do uh but not not that one i'm going to say uh that's actually continued with it the second container within this one so i'm gonna say the first child top bottom section and then section container within that and then say margin right and then same thing for this one i'm going to say the bottom section but i'm going to say last child last challenge dot section container boom see margin left now 16 pixels ready save this check this out oh look at that you see the space right there that's so beautiful my friends there we go okay next up we're sucking so close this actually guys i will have you actually finish this section by yourself this section is going to be done by you guys this portion right here so make sure you guys pay attention because this is uh going to be done by you it's very similar to a lot of stuff that we've done so the one for this after this is we're going to focus on the photo after this in a second here okay all right next up let's focus on this green portion so inspect them on this one let's get the background color for this e this one look at that that's the background color right here okay d e 4 e 9 e2 you can see that right there so that means we're going to focus on what that's we're going to focus on the top bottom section the text of the topic so top bottom section dot text right right and that's the bigger color so if i go to here nope that's not it oh let's go all those almost almost almost almost almost don't worry i'm almost there you see these images you see how there's a weird um if you don't know if you guys can see that like a very small spacing you mean or right here yeah yeah yeah so what do you think it will fix that too what do you think we'll fix that guys what do you think we'll fix it well you probably know this point it's uh nope it's flex because here's the thing the image inside the image container display flex makes the div surround the content that's the interesting thing so if i do dot top bottom section and i say bottom section i say dot image right that's the image container and i say display flex i don't know why this playback is so powerful but look it removed the space boom see that's it guys just be like literally flex on everything guys that's that should be the goal on everything that's really good baby flex and everything so look we're like very very close guys it looks looking so so good so so so good nice job on this so far by the way okay let's now focus on this h1 right here which is really cool so let's do this h1 i'm gonna focus on the h1 that's here so let's do h1 here let me see inspect them on this one let's see what kind of font size is on here on this one h1 font size 24 pixels okay font size 24 pixels and then what is the font weight on this one font weight is going to be probably i'm not sure let me see what does it find the weight for pixels finally four hundred see right there right there so 24 pixels the font was 400 so let's do this so let's do okay the top bottom section top of the section we'll do dot text and we'll do h1 on this one and we'll say uh we'll say what font size 24 pixels okay fonts at 24 pixels let me go on my actually whatever pixels okay we'll do font weight 400 come on font weight 400 okay and then we'll do let's do margin bottom 24 pixels give some spacing as well let's see what we got so far nice okay well done did that change anything or no i hope it did did it i don't know to be honest you have to scroll down a little bit and pick up easy as that i think i need to change that portion okay let's change that the text inside here inside the likely chill to change that so we'll say on this one command v save that yeah that's actually that's pretty good right there yep wait hold on that's that's actual page i was also like well yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah so we're not we're we're kind of there right we're kind of there let's go back again floating into summer like let's copy this one and then change it to for the uber section okay let's copy that one you guys could just go to starbucks.com and just change it yourselves uh like copy the actual text so just open the app as well all right let's go to here okay refresh your day with a bright sunshiny day all right what yeah i know we showing your robot to sing c pick i know right so then we do on here our cta is seek pick up options right so see pick up options okay and then keep the lady back vibes going oh [ __ ] this is good this is some good text yep get the laid back vibes going i like it next one so we're gonna keep that at that nice boom so today guys we're focusing a lot on the html css tomorrow we're focusing a lot on javascript guys tomorrow okay and this is gonna be order now actually order now save that beautiful all right let's go ahead and continue on so we're going to save this let's go to clever coffee clever copy for the save oh it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there oh i know we need to add some more padding and spacing but look it's kind of there nice okay next up uh i need to go ahead and add some padding on this one so inspect them on this one okay so there's a some really nice padding area right here actually so nice padding right here oh yeah padding you see this so computed so good padding left and right 24 pixels bottom is 32 pixels you see that yeah so let's do uh that's the text option so let's do mine that css okay so we'll do we'll do here padding what was the left and right section heading left was what so left was 24 right was 24 as well and the bottom was 32. paying this right and then uh rise 24 yeah yeah yeah correct and then bottom yes 32 nice let's see i need to save this actually first probably okay got it got it now let's add some paint to the top i think this needs to be something in the top section too because i think it's a little bit too too crowded right here yeah yeah i think so too i don't like that let me see so was spam where is that that thingy oh there it is did you did you see any bedding i don't know oh yeah yeah yeah eight pixels so we'll say padding top is gonna be eight pixels as well so pettington here padding top job is going to be eight pixels guys make sense okay all right sweet sweet that looks good that's pretty good i like okay next one let's go and look at this one let's suspect them on this one let's change the text on here okay guys because i'm gonna make sure it's pretty good okay all right so let's see so the the text on this one is uh actually on here actually you see that's like the line height is a lot different now at this point there's a lot more line height and so i want to make sure that it's pretty much the same okay so this is this the thing let's do the a tag right here so many width is 35 pixels no it's not that this one right here this one right there so let's do font size 19 pixels that's that's part one line high one point seven five mmhmm what else might have point seven five max max which is max width is like like it's like some some really weird max width which is really interesting and four hundred okay awesome so let's do this line high 1.75 fonts font size 19 pixels so let's let's try it like let's change the on our side okay so that means that our the h3 section right which is the where where's our h3 so top bottom section top bottom section okay dot text okay and then h3 and it's going to be what font size what is it 19 pixels okay and then what and then line height what is it one point seven five nice okay good let's go back to our club there we go okay now also it's starting to look much better much better i like it it's still not kind of there i don't kind of like how it's still not kind of there but how we can get it there is very simple because again this is a different font right so that's why but most importantly what's going on here is that we need um to actually have no idea we need to do well what do you mean i kind of do though actually huh so can i do it yet i was about to say yeah so okay so we got that we got that we got that we got this order that's all good i like that that looks pretty good as well floating to summer like there's a little i think he needs more padding from the top as well top i think he's be like 12 but 12 pixels for some reason there's two it's too way too close okay i like that that's a little better now a16 okay i like that i like that good good good good all right i like that next one is gonna be we got the section line height okay i think it's actually pretty good it looks really good looks really good guys oh the color needs to change ah yeah see okay let me see the color on this one so if i go to the color here right click inspect them on this one the color is gonna be what come on yeah i know the color that's the color right there oh one e three nine three two so we'll do tablets as a text and then we'll do color there's this color let's go back to clever coffee nice that's good i like that okay let's actually actually make this height as well uh a constant height because right now you can see this height changes and i don't like that so this height right now is 231 pixels and then what is the constant height for this thing that's the interesting thing right so the constant height for this thing is going to be just curious here what do they do for this height did they give it a specific height i'm guessing i'm just curious here let's check it out i don't really see i don't really think they give it a specific height i think just they just give it a padding which is really weird but then it would be different because the text has a different size as well i don't know let's see font size 1.6 rem okay height hundred percent no it's not that one height is 224 pixels which is yeah i'm not sure how they getting the height to be all the same the height changes though actually i think actually it does actually well it actually okay yeah i know yeah yeah i get it i get it i now get it now guys here's the cool thing i want you guys to pay attention to this really quickly okay so the highlight is different but the thing is what's happening here is that these divs are the same height because of flex so look if i go to clever coffee here which is such a good name by the way oh my god okay so for the club of coffee here let me go ahead and put this on the center in this section okay look are you guys ready for this you guys ready my friends look at this no it's not about any any penny bottles no it's about flex so look it's actually container top bottom section so you see the top bottom section is a full height you see that but the such container is right here but this for some reason is not the full height because why i need to give this if display flex2 so display flex on the display flex okay let's play flags look at this display flex okay good now such a container is full height too which is fine really fine look our display flex on this one of course we know this one okay but if i do here look this text i do flex grow boom you see so we'll always be the same height as these will always be the same height no matter what but the other text does not have a flex grow right or does it no it will oh wait this is actually container yeah yeah so look the top bottom section is now display flex which is good okay so let's do that look guys so the top bottom section is now display uh display flex so let's do this the top bottom section where is it do i just have the top on the sections anywhere here or no i don't think i do bottom section display flex okay this is so cool guys by the way okay and then of course we're gonna do the following which is gonna be uh and then we've got the text within the tablet so we'll do let's see the text yeah okay okay okay so we'll do text yeah i just want to do just that text because i want to apply it to everything right mmhmm to the top to the top almost there oh no you actually know what to do i'm gonna do this okay legs grow yeah one at the top bottom check yeah yeah yeah are you ready for this my friends look at this clever coffee is underway because we're out here let's go look at that guys see i know it's a little bit different here but that's just part of that's part of the game sometimes right like like here they're not even i mean they're kind of the same here but if i scroll if i make it smaller you see order now is now in this different position you see position but for us look at that it's pretty good i think we might have changed the i think this order now is a big bigger button though i feel like this font size of this one's a little bigger though which i just don't like it's all about the details guys all about the details uh let me see what is the font size for this one margin top that's fine font size font size font size font size anybody see font size here fun family 16 pixels okay so one size 16 pixels that means okay so let's see font size on the top in the text section if i go to here ah nothing really changing anything honestly that's fine i think it's because we're like not fully zoomed in i think it's because i think because on starbucks i'm very much zoomed in i think am i yeah i am yeah so there you go that's see if i make it smaller it's a little bit different now you see that guys that's why okay there we go there we go whoop whoopty there we go okay awesome let's add a margin bottom to the top bottom section as well so let's do that section the top bottom side let's do a margin bottom the top of the section let's do margin bottom 32 pixels two actually no uh no we need to add it to the section thing top bottom no no to the section container you mean or no that's right margin bottom 32 pixels yeah i think so too let's hey beautiful awesome guys now let's continue on i will let you guys do this portion by yourselves okay for now i think for us let's just figure out the um the last which is the footer guys guys look at this look how much we've done this point we're almost almost almost almost done that's gonna be so close and then you guys will have your uh fullon starbucks landing page just so so good okay right right right i think they also can by the way that footer or that how to say terms of condition section they can do that by themselves too i mean it looks really simple okay yeah so are we going to start with the section about us careers and that yeah that's the one so oh okay yeah yeah yeah let's do it let's go ahead and create a footer now so let's go to mouth okay i have the main section now let's do footer look at that right there see create a photo now save that now okay good so a footer let's look at how they do in here look at this guys it's all a bunch of divs you see a bunch of a bunch of bunch of this look at that that's a bunch of those that's it honestly look at this guys okay we have this div right here so there's a there's a one big div and there's a margin okay i like it there's one big con footer oh see look they also use for look guys lily's like they're trying to copy us you know what i mean am i right yes for sure of course so at this point let's see what we've got okay we've got the footer guys okay we have our container which is cool and then within that we have small little dips one div one div one div one div okay i like it so and then within those divs we have the heading the h3 and there's oh and there's a list element look at that see and then list elements that sound familiar let's make it happen i think we got this guys you guys ready for this are you guys ready for this i'm not yeah i don't know i don't see anything in the chat that they're ready or something so yeah yeah no oh oh they're ready let's go beautiful yes thank you guys yes yes yes yes yes they're still ready they're still here till the end okay let's make that footer so let's do this this footer now has a footer container deal class folder container container okay okay and then let's see this div right here okay let's see you see that there's a small shadow which i really like let me see the shadow shadow shadow shadow where are you i'm trying to find the shadow no not here that's for sure maybe here on the footer let me see oh there's a box shot look at that whoa although it looks very familiar to the shadow that we use for the header but it's not the exact same huh i mean i said d background beat isn't cool but not intrusive awesome glad you guys are liking it i like it dude you guys are liking it it's like very like it feels very like i'm in a future future right now oh you're doing kung fu in the future yeah that's my that's my new hobby guys for sure okay so folders next up let's go to let's go save this and we should now create a new css style for the footer so new css will do footer.css okay okay let's also link that inside html how do we do that guys tell me down the comment below in the in the zoom chat below zoom chat below i'll do a link rel style she good and i will do ahref is equal to what footer.css boom beautiful nice good good good job when you're out i see you guys everybody yes good i see you guys beautiful nice job okay now we got the footage css now let's do a footer let's give this a that box shadow which is really cool all right let's see we got so far backshot does not exist which is pretty cool i think yeah just fine so now first on below the reason why doesn't exist because the floor does not have any height right so if i give this a height though if i get a height let's just say you know 200 pixels then it will exist then see now exist you see right there the phone now exists which is really good okay it looks so good guys oh wow yeah looks so good i like it okay inside the footer let's now create that let's now use that footer container because the photocontainer now needs to have some i'm guessing padding if i look right click the spell expecting this element you guys can see that this has like a specific margin what is it where is it i mean let me show you padding top padding bottom so we'll do padding 24 pixels zero so let's do that so we'll do um footer footer we'll do padding heading 24 pixels zero now anybody knows what is the shortcut for this who can tell what the shortcut is for this in the zoom chat the faster the the better what is it what does this mean good job robin yes this first number is top and bottom just remember this first number is the vertical one the sample second number is the horizontal one guys okay that's what that means okay awesome okay see that and then look at this now so then we have diff container and that one has a a padding of 40 pixels on the left in the right hand side you see um so now we do dot footer dash container okay and we say um padding zero but what was it left right side what was it just you remember 40 40 pixel comma 40 pixels so now we say the top and bottom for the 4k is zero but left and right is 40. same exact difference okay yeah and you're using it now in different um this because guys look at that shadow line in the starbucks website it's not touching the edge as you can see that's why there with the icons there no that's good these elements are here so so what should we call this we should call this a what should we call this i'm just curious um link click container links links container let's call it like this let's go like this so when you're inside hit the photo container we'll do this dave class links container container container and all right funny and there's multiple of them guys okay there's multiple links containers in this here okay and every link container has what same styling it has a header so look at that there's the h3 header right here see h3 so we can say h3 inside here h3 that has the about us section for example okay and underneath that we have the ul list elements okay that's where it says our heritage heritage okay okay we have our coffee okay stories and news right so it just kind of keeps going on so i'm i'm not keep going past and pasting pacing so for example right our coffee stories and news stories and news right next one's going to be what investor relations okay then we have policies and standards i'm typing up the second the other sections thank you and then ask me that's that's pretty much it we'll keep it at that for now for that first section nice good i like it so our hair use our coffee stores and news nice relations policies and standards which i like okay now that being said let's create another one so we'll do same thing but let's do another uh section this section is not going to be what is it careers if anybody wants to work at a starbucks there we go okay culture and values oh wait i wish i had this typed out before yeah i have it in your slack uh questions how do i get them a slack oh i'll put it in zoom chat yeah be great okay inclusion diversity do you have it yeah thank you jesse of course wait copy this okay good so we got that portion all right so one two three four five one two three four five good and let's do a third one social impact so we'll do like this social impact let's do another one did you have the social impact on jesse no not yet but i'll make it social impact you just go ahead with the display flex and the okay the styling okay great yep yep so now okay let's go to style so now we have all these different things guys all right let's go to clever coffee let's see what we got so far in that case oh yeah that looks sexy that looks so good let's go that looks so good it doesn't it guys aren't you on my side okay
