for you what do you feel like have been some of your like biggest losses or biggest regrets well i have a lot of losses but i don't really have regrets because like everything even the things that were difficult i think you know i learned something from them i got something out of it yeah most recently you know i had this company legal tech company called atrium we raised 75 million dollars didn't really work out spend most of the money return some of it it's kind of like a fiery crater in the ground right like a startup and obviously that's a lot of money right like 25 mil so what happens when you lose that money like for a normal person to understand like you lose relationships and friendships over that does it have you know more consequences luckily i was very supported by our investors and they were like it's okay and like you know people who are good technology investors know it's a numbers game and they're investing in a portfolio and some of them aren't going to work out you know through that difficulty you know in the difficult experience i actually learned a lot of the practices i'm talking to you about now like how to live my joy every day and like just how to focus on the intrinsic motivations instead of the extrinsic and so for me it was valuable you know even the things that like are difficult that are that are tough or you know end up being valuable
