top five programming languages for you to learn in 2023 to get a job without needing a college degree I do these videos every few years and they get millions of views and you guys seem to love them so here we go again we're going to be ranking these languages on three main factors number one the time it takes even for an absolute beginner to learn and build real world projects number two salary and the demand for this programming language number three productivity or the development cost and time so let's just get straight into it number five Java so object oriented programming language is best known for Android application development so anytime you see an Android and there are apps on there you know that they were built with Java Java is used on over three billion devices worldwide including mobile phones tablets laptops and desktops Java has a large and active community of over 9 million developers if you ever need help or your loss will always be able to find help Java is also known for its right once run everywhere philosophy which essentially means any machine that has a Java virtual machine installed on there can run Java the one con I would say with Java is that learning curve is harder have to learn classes you have to learn objectoriented programming my personal opinion is functional programming is much easier to learn and it's the way moving forward so if you're a complete beginner it'll take you longer to learn Java than other programming languages and the average salary of a Java developer is a hundred and seven thousand dollars per year number four Swift swift is best known for building iOS or iPhone applications when you think anything Apple MacBook iMac iPad an iPhone all of those devices the apps that are built on them are built using the programming language called Swift if you've ever wanted to be in the app store and have your apps and be able to make recurring income from the apps and you want it to ever be a mobile developer or mobile game developer or whatnot Swift is a programming language that you're like looking for when it comes to the iPhone world games like Clash of Clans or Angry Birds Flappy Bird all of those famous games that you might have played on an iPhone those were made with Swift swift is used by some of the biggest companies in the world for example Uber app that you know Lyft Facebook Instagram Airbnb or LinkedIn all of those apps that are on your devices they're built with swift con is I would say a bit similar to Java where it is a little bit more difficult for a complete absolute beginner to learn because now you have mobile development involved the average salary of a swift developer is a hundred and nineteen thousand dollars per year according to ZipRecruiter number three solidity it's best used and known for the ability to develop on the blockchain being able to make smart contract or dapps which stand for decentralized applications some of the biggest companies in the world are using solidity for example Twitter is using it for their nft functionality so you could actually add an nft AS your profile picture coinbase uses it openc is using it to be able to buy or sell or auction your nfts and Reddit is also using solidity you use solidity to primarily write code or write apps on the ethereum blockchain the programming syntax of this programming language is similar to that of java where it is mostly an objectoriented programming language a funny story I just want to share with you one of my friends Nas he has experience doing software development for multiple years so I'm going to add that disclaimer in there that he switched over spent a couple of months learning solidity and then he actually ended up starting to make twenty to thirty thousand dollars a month Landing clients for whom he would build projects using solidity so the salary you could make with it is definitely very high and very different than some of the other programming languages because something that's new and it's very needed in the cryptocurrency world the average salary of a developer is a hundred and fifty six thousand dollars a year but again like I said the drawback of it is the difficulty and the complexity of learning it if you could overcome that and yes you do create a pretty big opportunity for yourself number two python python is one of my most favorite programming languages that this was the programming language I used to start my Learning Journey it's by far one of the easiest programming languages and out of all the ones I'll list today it's definitely the easiest so the learning curve for a complete beginner is very low and you can learn it it reads like English it's beautiful to look at and then the opportunity for developers is great the job market is great the types of jobs that you would be doing as a python developer would be along the lines of machine learning data science analytics you could do web development with it as well those are the types of routes that you would likely go if you went down the route of python and some of the biggest companies use Python Google Dropbox or uh Netflix YouTube Instagram any other big companies use Python and the average salary of a python developer is a hundred and seventeen thousand dollars according to indeed.com and number one JavaScript not to be confused with Java this programming language is used pretty much on every single website on the planet all web apps are built using JavaScript YouTube Facebook Instagram all the big ones so for example if you're on YouTube and you click that like button that functionality is added using JavaScript if you are on spotify's website and you click the play button that's powered by JavaScript the sound that you hear is powered by JavaScript so pretty much everything that you use and interact with you click on a website and a drop down menu pops up that's JavaScript the type of roles you could expect as a JavaScript developer are frontend developer or a full stack developer imagine you're a developer at Netflix and then you're building out their mobile platform or you're building out their web platform or all of the tiles and beautiful visuals are showing up or the animations are showing up or when you click that button you hear the you know the Netflix sound that plays JavaScript is also one of the easiest programming languages to learn now I think now more than before because of how much functional programming they're now integrating into JavaScript it's becoming really easy to read and write and becoming really high levels especially if you look at the new JavaScript es6 syntax basically if you don't know that means that's okay all that means is it's now very easy to use average salary of a JavaScript developer according to indeed.com is a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars per year and one of the biggest reasons I recommend for you to learn it is the Opportunities Unlimited pretty much in any field with JavaScript it's the fastest growing and the biggest most popular programming language with the biggest community in the world so to break into the industry whereas for example say python with data science or machine learning that might take you years but with full stack development you could get in within six months nine months and before people start bashing me on this video which is so annoying what I will say is in my opinion because I've personally done this I did it with python within a couple of months I learned web development and I was able to get a job as a python web developer for making six figures per year within my first three to six months of learning to code but again massive disclaimer for people start whining and crying in the comments section is I was coding for 12 to 15 hours per day that's why I was able to get there that fast most people will not be able to do that I was able to just work from home be supported with my parents and then just code up the whole time but I think that if I were to do it again I would do it with JavaScript just because of the growth and the opportunity that exists with it now within three to six months of you going all in it's very possible you could get your first job not making a hundred thousand dollars but you might be making sixty seventy thousand dollars a year there are people who get 200 and again those are some statistical anomalies this is my experience after being in the industry for over eight years teaching millions of students how to code having thousands and thousands of students get jobs as Developers for example take Ali who started working with us and within a couple of months from not knowing anything she learned JavaScript and then went on to get her first job making 90 000 dollars per year take Frank Ramos who shot up his salary 200 000 per year or Devin gray who landed a job at PayPal one of my students actually just recently ran into I was at a conference at vid Summit and he told me a crazy story of how he went from being completely homeless to getting a job at Google within four months after he started watching my coding tutorials and learning JavaScript this is why I'm recommending you start with JavaScript because it's worked with so many students and if you want to be able to learn it at even a faster Pace I do have a coaching program that you could sign up for link is in the description below get on a call with my team apply for it we'll give you a ton of value and if it's a good fit I'll let you know and if it's not I'll also let you know regardless you'll leave a ton of value even after that if you decide it's not for you I have hundreds of hours of free training material online you are welcome to use and master JavaScript I hope you enjoyed this video peace
