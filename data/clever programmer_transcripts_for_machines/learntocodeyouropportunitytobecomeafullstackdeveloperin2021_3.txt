and this is kazi and this is your day one of the boot camp guys they won the boot camp so excited to have you here we are going to be talking about the opportunity to become uh a developer in 2021 we've got there's plenty of opportunity if you're looking to make the career switch and you're thinking about becoming a developer now is the time because it's never been better to become a developer as the world is shifting into development as we go forward so tune in there's going to be a lot of value for you here and with that said what do we got now should we jump in let's jump in let's go ahead and have your screen share what you got and then we'll be able to see everybody okay awesome sweet let's go ahead all right guys so let's go here and uh just want to make sure you guys are able to see this clearly right day one your opportunity to become a developer you guys can all see this yep beautiful yeah let's start let's start rocking and rolling in that case all right hopefully you guys are ready i am um and let's go so a couple of things that i want you guys to do here that are on please guys it's time to focus so do me a favor and for now everybody just mute yourselves just because we don't want any sounds coming in and distracting anybody else that's actually trying to learn thank you guys who've brought a notebook or something to write with if you want to just go quickly grab something to write with preferably if it's you know paper it's going to be better so for example ron fernandez and john velasco you guys got notebooks something to write with that's great that way you're not going to get distracted if you're using your phone yeah um so just make sure put your phone and do not disturb have something to write with this is the time to do that and just to let you guys know this is the five day boot camp for those of you who are currently on youtube if you want to join the five day bootcamp the link is down below we have an amazing community as you can see right now that's uh that's on here on the facebook group and everybody's going to join in help each other out and are there here to kickstart their careers developers and actually just learn and just have a lot of fun yes absolutely and just so you guys know what's coming up ahead today i'm just going to show it real quick for you guys so um that's weird i don't know why my yeah click on the click on the what's it called the three buttons that the uh it's on your keyboard you see that it's up top near the brightness to the right weird all good all good okay so let's let's keep going i don't know why that didn't work that's odd but mainly the main things we're we're going to be covering okay i'm just going to draw it with this it's going to look crappier but that's okay it's going to get the point across so um basically one thing we're going to be discussing today is the agenda that we have for you over the next coming days okay excuse my handwriting it looks like a fiveyearold whatever um okay so we're gonna talk about what what's the agenda what are we gonna be covering in the next five days okay because the next five days are going to be really intense and so today we're going to talk about the opportunity starting tomorrow you're going to start building projects with javascript okay so day two we're going to build a startup landing page day three what are we going to build now day three we are good game which is going to be a lot of fun and then finally day four we're going to build a sas product business kind of like you know that you know like a lot of sas products like indeed.com and so forth and so we'll be able to build that together with with javascript yeah for example a product a slack is a sas product discord is a sas product so you need when you work at those companies you need to know how to build those types of landing pages that's what you're gonna get paid for so we're gonna be doing that on day two three and four so it's gonna be a lot of coding and um it's gonna get more intense okay but even if you're a beginner it's all good we're gonna give you all the resources and help you need okay another important thing for you guys to know if you listen to this and you guys pay attention you work hard and you submit your portfolios or the homework that we ask of you nas and i are personally going to take our time or people from our team are personally going to take their time and we're also going to give you video feedback and video review okay not every single person is going to get that so just be aware of that guys we're a very small team okay so it takes time and effort so if some of you we too please don't be upset about that but we'll try to do our best to get to as many people as possible does that make sense we do our best guys honestly so yeah just be patient with us right but the same time just also help the other community as well be nice to the community let's make sure that we have clean comments in you know this whole uh five day boot camp and let's make sure that we just you know communicate connect if you're like working hard you're engaging you're active we see you working hard even on calls like if i see you're actually paying attention and doing all this stuff we want to take and review your projects does that make sense okay so people who are participating really well we want to give you feedback if you don't care and you're like disengaged you're not participating in the community you don't even have your camera on then when you're working you're kind of we're not going to review your projects okay so those are a couple of things to understand uh we're going to talk about the opportunity that exists for developers because that's something really important and we want you guys to be able to see that um within this opportunity of course we're going to talk to you about what technologies you need to learn okay so should you be learning javascript should you be learning react first should you be learning mongodb so what types of things should be learning okay and also like what types of job opportunities and how how much salary is paid for those all right and then uh lastly one of the things we're going to talk about is um of course your roadmap okay so we're going to kind of build your personal plan of attack for becoming a developer and then at the end we're going to go over homework okay so this is just a rough outline of what we're going to be covering cool awesome so that's sweet can you show this like can you show the slides my friend uh yes you and there we go there we go all right so quick question guys who would like a free portfolio to put all of the projects that you're going to be building here in the next five days okay just a raise of hands if this is something that's exciting for you beautiful beautiful anna's excited give that to me nice so yeah we're gonna give you a full portfolio for this and give you all access to it okay so simply you can just click it and copy it it's yours all right and then we have prizes too depending on the participation and the level of effort and work you guys are putting in so we're gonna have one lucky winner who's going to win our coding boot camp full stack mastery okay so there's gonna be one person that wins that it's an eight month long program where if you think you're going to get value in five days you know imagine the value you'd get in eight months working with with me my team and uh what we're gonna offer you is going to be absolutely bananas and then number two and three you get access to our courses okay so uh if you guys want to connect with us on social media on instagram you guys can uh tag us all right at cleverkozy and we'd be happy to repost um all of your stuff okay so this is what it is or you can tag nas or jesse these are the three cool all right so let's keep moving um this wouldn't happen guys without a big team that we have so please give a moment of like a little golf clap okay you don't have to do a crazy clump a little crosstalk for the whole team because they do put in a lot of effort and hard work and without this amazing team this wouldn't be possible yeah there's a lot that goes behind the scenes that sometimes you guys don't see honestly and so yeah to make it happen everybody's working really really hard and you and just let you guys know you will probably be contacted by one of these team members right to engage right to go ahead and give you feedback on your project so so let you know between everybody on here you will probably contacted by them okay yeah redian nice to see you here hopefully your youtube videos are doing well all right let's keep going um so here are your instructors okay this is me i'm quasi the guy drinking the coffee here um you know i hate to say any of this because it sounds douchey but um i i work really really hard and i figured out how to be making a hundred thousand dollar a year income while i was going to college and i was doing that from development working remotely at this point i've had the privilege to teach lots and lots of students i mean you know just to give you guys a little bit i started because i was like really dumb and coding was really hard for me to learn and i was like failing math classes and the way that instructors taught me just didn't work for me at all so i'm like screw this and i started learning it in my own way and started getting mentorship to learn it in my own way and then i started getting good picking up the skills and i was just obsessed with coding so i was coding like 10 to 15 hours a day and then within like three to six months i started actually working with clients and landing clients but a lot of it came from obsession and i just want to emphasize the amount of hard work and uh you know not really you know i'm smart but i'm not that smart i just work really really freaking hard so that's that's where i make it up uh so you know now we have a youtube channel that's almost about to hit a million subscribers i'm super excited about and i want to just take all of the things that we're learning and i want to share that with you guys is that okay with you guys is that cool can i get a hands up for that yeah everybody beautiful here is my my friend nas hey hey how's it going guys this is nas and of course me some of you might know me as the instructor at you know multiple courses you know i'm on youtube as well but just in general kind of came from ukraine originally you know and uh have been they have given the chance to interview at many different companies around google to volunteer to twitter and so forth and at this point i've been coding for the last probably 10 years at this point right start off coding when i was in high school and kind of moved up to then you know go to college of course and i moved up to then uh you know work at different companies big companies small companies and now here i am teaching you guys how to do the same yeah i mean guys it's really a blessing to have a person like nas working alongside you he's one of the best problem solvers and thinkers i've ever come across in the world of software development and i know many developers i have friends who are like you know work the smartest people working at google working on some of the hardest problems and even with that i say what i say about nas so it's it's it's amazing to have him on here we're lucky to have him on this team and if you guys are here and you're participating really take value out of everything he's saying okay guys cool all right let's keep going awesome jessie she's an amazing instructor she's also going to be part of this uh boot camp you guys are going to see her on day two three and four and she's an amazing instructor for our coding bootcamp that we have and just to share with you guys right also for you guys to start making the connections like depending on what jobs you guys are currently doing and and maybe just drop it in the chat below as well what types of jobs are you guys doing okay so like what's your current but think about from her perspective right she was doing uh tax law that has nothing to do with software development yeah she was able to make that switch so if you're thinking about switching your career and going from your current job to a new job it's possible for you okay and she also loves coffee and uh anime i like anime too anybody else here likes anime i've never been i've never been a big fan of some reason yeah we should have a lot of people so we have people who are doing lots of uh wow brilliant i love anime nice i know death note i watched uh uh attack on titan that was a lot of fun big naruto fan awesome ending all right so now let's take a look at what you guys are going to be building so i apologize guys because we have so much information and value we want to share we're probably going to be going at a little faster pace is that cool with you guys okay we're going to be kind of like going fast all right so so have your if you guys want to screenshot it with your computer or just take notes just be prepared to go fast and stay on pace because there might be some slides you see that we're just going to keep going faster through them okay so one project you guys are going to be building is a startup landing page that's going to be worth 10k or more you guys are going to be building a rock paper scissors game using advanced javascript and you guys are going to be building a sas product with esx javascript okay so when i say sas product think of like you know what slack looks and feels like think of what discord looks and feels like okay so those are sas products that are successful so imagine basically building three project guys in these next five days and then putting them on your portfolio to be able to showcase to you know uh potential employers potential you know uh you know maybe freelancing projects and so forth yeah there's a lot of opportunity we're gonna have a lot of fun as well yeah and the job of projects that go on your portfolio is get recruiters attention that's pretty much the number one job of your portfolio then once they bring you in the rest is up to them okay but that gets you most of the times in the door and gets you we want to help you with okay and this is our goal is that your portfolio looks great okay so for example here's a portfolio one of our students he has instagram clone built a blogging app built he has multiple different projects that he's built this is actually david yeah who who was one of our students yeah and now he's working with us all right um so now the question is hopefully you guys are ready to to get going and uh you know hopefully you guys are ready to bring it your all all right bring your a game bring your energy of course and bring attention guys and most importantly bring time into this okay these next five days are going to take up a lot of time so make sure you put a lot of effort into this because this is going to be probably the most one of the most important things you learn yeah and it matters right so everybody who's sitting there prepared like i see jessica simpson she's sitting in a good posture she has her pen it looks like she's going to take notes can it matters right so like actually being prepared for this and kind of bringing your heart and energy you're going to retain a lot of information if you're kicking back you're just like sleeping you're not at home or in a good spot you're not gonna take away a lot out of this okay so that's important for you to know i see back she's got her notebook already ready and she's somewhere in hawaii as well so that's pretty cool yeah i love that that's absolutely amazing okay so let's go boot campers and let's get going and thank you guys for doing so many amazing posts like the engagement was crazy insane in this challenge like all of you guys went absolutely bananas so you we had like ashley make a post and she's like hey i'm from london by the way any other people here from london or uk it's kind of cool but it seems like she's complaining like hey it's university and things like that like the way that she was learning is boring do any of you guys resonate with that has like boring instructors or you just fi found learning boring i've i've had instructors who literally just go to like you know presentation just read off presentation literally and that's literally all they do nothing else abigail you know albert albert lives in los angeles hey what's going on maybe when we're doing the challenge in person next month hopefully albert can join oh another uk student abigail that's awesome lucas is in virginia cool wesley and it just goes on and on like you guys went absolutely crazy just know that we love your engagement we're reading all the comments we're doing our best to reply to almost all of you okay so it really that connection to us really matters yeah and keep the engagement up guys very very important okay this is how you connect with other people and it's also how we connect with you yep absolutely so this is the plan for the next five days day one today we're gonna talk about your opportunity to become a developer day two we're gonna build that landing page day three we're gonna build a game with javascript day four we're gonna work on the sas product and then day five we're gonna build your ultimate developer roadmap to become a full stack developer so what that basically means is we're going to give you all the technology all the tools you need so you're not learning like a million different things that are not actually helping you in your career cool and uh today we're going to be making making sure that you learn the opportunity and we're gonna kind of unravel some of the myths around becoming a developer okay so let's deep dive into building your personal roadmap all right let's see and what what we want to do is let's actually figure out why you want to become a developer because that's a good question that's because a lot of people you know you know think about this and actually they go into this for the wrong reason that's something that we see a lot a lot in people yes so here's what we want you guys to write down in the zoom chat right now what are three things that are actually more important to you than money yeah all right if you want to succeed in becoming a developer this is really the only way where you know what is more important to you than money because if that's the only reason you're doing it then that's you're not going to actually go really far with it okay so i want to start seeing what are your guys's three reasons so we have alex sanderson says knowledge stability and family memory says stability having fun family friends and health immanuel is helping people with technology charles says skill education and travel i like that that's really good set my own schedule build cool stuff rajesh's knowledge individuality jessica simon says creativity these are absolutely incredible answers wow happiness awesome family family helping my family wow okay so you guys are starting to see the trend with the other people hopefully maybe you're seeing it resonate a little bit with you as well but family is definitely an important thing that that a lot of you guys are saying learning the skill is important to you it seems like and of course the opportunity to have freedom and kind of you know either choose your own schedule or be or work from wherever you want okay so those are a couple of things you guys said none of them are wrong it's just what is important to you okay so remember those three things you said because you're gonna that's going to help craft what type of role you look for when you're becoming a developer okay and now let's maybe just talk about what can making money as a developer help you achieve in your life okay so quickly just give me if you were making a decent amount of money what can that help you do more okay what can that help you with in your life buy a house stability education uh give my daughter oh it's moving so fast i love this pay off debt oh wow there's so much insane help my daughter with school pay your student loans i love that give my wife and son a good life and for those of you on youtube as well make sure you guys to comment that down below as well i'm really curious to see what you guys are saying too rediane just wants to buy cars nothing wrong with that either house and travel i love that travel is not a bad thing nothing's wrong with that guys no judgment here so that's totally okay give mother a good life that's pretty cool i like that satisfaction discover the world that's right my girlfriend why do you need money to marry your girlfriend i mean you know weddings are not cheap okay fair enough i love this so this is this is really good because i want you guys to know what's important to you because you need three reasons why you're gonna code even if you didn't get paid right and then it's also good to know why you need the money if you did get if you were making money getting paid to code okay so that's absolutely great now let's quickly figure out your income goals as we keep going okay so how much income do you want to make per month all right so the reason why i ask this question is it determines a lot like for example maybe some of you might not need to make that much money some some of you may be happy with making two thousand dollars a month and what that might allow you to do is code parttime work remotely be a freelancer or some of you might be like hey i want to be making five seven thousand ten thousand dollars a month and i wanna be working at a big company and i'm okay working 40 hours a week and i'm okay there none of those are wrong okay because you can learn a lot from working at big companies and working fulltime so what is your income goal that's important for you to know yeah and it's 12k a month wow eight to 10k 5k 10k a month 10k a month 2k 75k a month holy molly 75k a year right okay somebody said 20k a month these are some good numbers yeah just don't don't be unrealistic guys right you know don't say it like you know i want to make a million a month right it's very important i've had people say that right so want to be realistic with it as well yeah yeah he's not saying don't be optimistic yeah it means be realistic because you can't take 20 steps on a la you know at once you kind of go you got to go to level one level two so if you can prove you can make a hundred dollars with coding then yes you're more likely to then make a thousand dollars a month with coding okay so a lot of you i saw 5k 10k a month that's that's a pretty good range to be thinking about all right and then the last thing you know we want to ask you guys is are you you know do you want to do freelancing with with development or do you see more working fulltime okay so freelancing just party at the bottom i love that so yeah i mean both again both are really really good both are solid we just decided to put like random funny photos here but which one do you want to do fulltime fulltime fulltime so which one you you did guys which one did you do we should almost have a poll for that that's actually cool um what i did actually mostly freelancing with with software development personally yeah i mean i did full time i did freelancing but i kind of did both right though i know personally i mean i did enjoy both myself right um yeah i don't know i think it's really cool to experience you know the freelancer side and the fulltime side and then you kind of kind of see which which side is for you because i'll be honest with you you know not eat not like freelancing might not be your thing or fulltime might not be your thing you know right yeah so it's definitely good cool to experience both because with freelancing for example you have to deal with a lot more instability not knowing when you're going to have work next and a lot of those things right with full time you have job security you don't have to worry about where you're going to get work from or paid from next month but freelancing if you were working on one type of project you didn't like it you can quickly pick another client and work on a completely different thing tomorrow so again both are both are good personally i think that if you could get into full time my recommendation would be to try to break into full time just because you're gonna learn so freaking much and you will get mentorship there you will have some other developers that can teach you so from just a skill perspective charles like for example how you said number one is skill for you right just from a skill perspective alone it's killer opportunity where you can pick up so much all right so again web developer growth is a lot right so why it depends which which one you want to get into but we like talking about web development because because it's it is a faster growing than almost any other industry because even for example think of somebody that wants to do data science right maybe they're just like in this 12 growth that they're doing data science even they at some point need to learn web development because then somebody needs to take that data and those and those graphs and put them online right like it can't just live on a freaking pdf what are you gonna print it out you know so like even when stack overflow comes up with your service somebody needs to actually visualize those graphs and put them on the web so at some point that same data scientist is going to need some web development skills so why we like web development a lot is you can become a web developer or you can break out into other into other verticals like data science and still be still be great does that make sense guys okay and when i say data science just so everybody has an understanding i'm talking about like ai type of stuff right so there's the web development world and then there's the ai world okay so for example selfdriving cars is ai selfcheckout that that's happening around the world is is ai so even if you wanted to do that i think it would serve you to have web development experience so let's keep going here and the opportunity for becoming a developer is a lot okay so a lot right now yeah and it's growing constantly and the amount of um students that a computer science you know universities are able to pump out it's about like 400 000 per year but the demand is about 1.4 million or more jobs which means that the amount of students is not meeting the needs for the overall jobs and so what happens it will happen is when you have more demand than supply what do what what do you think guys what happens usually when there's more demand versus supply what happens very simple what happens is higher pay exactly right so a lot of people that this is where basically the the income increases keeps increasing keeps increasing and we'll see later on that over the years the income has increased you know and for developer jobs you know what i mean yeah so you know even if you want to start off with maybe let's say you want to do software development but then maybe later you can think about launching your own company like a sas product or something like that right damn zach got excited about that i see that's what zac is on nice so if your goal is that that's totally great because it plays out in the long run because most of the world is moving towards technology right so even if it's not tomorrow or next year or in three years how about in the next seven years 10 years because software development isn't going anywhere and for you to know this is a skill and even if you had people working under you if you knew the skill of software development you could make better hires that then work on your software okay so those are a couple of things to keep in mind it doesn't always mean you're permanently just going to be an employee even though that's pretty freaking great okay so there's a big gap and uh you know i don't know if we have those slides here but let's keep going and a lot of you know even here by definition you can't have a million more people here that are getting these degrees but they're still getting jobs which by definition means that majority of the people without degrees are actually getting software developer jobs and this is where a lot of companies sound to realize that right that it takes a long time for people to get through a degree and so a lot of people companies are starting to remove then yes the necessity for a degree instead of like basically looking more so at your experience right and what you can do and just in general just do you know how to code right or have you have you built projects and not necessarily just just like what you know from a degree that's it it's a game of skill yeah software development is a game of skill just like charles like you uh you you stream apex right you play a video game that's a game of skill if you were to join a league nobody gives a crap about your certification or a degree that you might have they just see your skill level in the game now don't don't get me wrong if there's a data science job you're going to they probably might care about you having a degree but like even elon musk says i don't give a damn about your degree i actually care about your skill level as a software developer so with software development because there's so much new technology and new things happening all the time you most of the times just need to have a skill and a way to prove that you have that skill so either you could rely on an 80 000 piece of paper or you could rely on just good projects on your freaking portfolio that we're going to give you in this boot camp how does that sound okay it works all right so let's keep going um software engineer salaries in the us now on the left hand side right oh are those my drawings never went away can you remember honest yeah awesome okay cool cool so here you have javascript right 112 dollars a year salary and then you all have all these other languages and and all languages are great but they're for different things yeah we got ios as well after sign the android though ios they are higher paying there's a lot less demand for it right so for ios basically this is when you're talking about this you're talking about like developing for iphone yeah for like literally iphone apps and of course the developing android apps as well yeah so for example here the cool thing about web development it helps you branch out and it has principles that play out in every other industry yeah that is meaning that if you learn web development and you learn how to do how do i talk to my database how do i build a user interface how do i what what i'm good right you guys can hear me yeah you're good okay cool so if i do all that i can still apply in the future and like pick up iphone skills iphone development skills ios development skills okay i can still pick up python and learn data science and stuff like that so what's important for you to understand is you're not alienating any other opportunities when you start with web development as a matter of fact they are complementary and often needed when you jump into other fields it makes sense or here for example when you learn javascript right there's a lot of opportunity around right around you learn react native which is from javascript and then being able to build applications for ios and for android at the same time yeah yeah so let's keep going all right now remote work during covet has increased a lot how many people experience a lot of different types of things in their heads and in job in the world last year like was last year kind of tricky and difficult for you guys yeah raise your hand with together it was for me yeah it was a really everybody's like oh you're filled with turmoil and unexpected events and it's like what the heck is going on right i'm like can you please just return to normal come on yeah but one something that interesting that happened with it within that is things changed and i believe a lot of things changed permanently too so now companies were forced to start thinking about how to work with talent remotely and then they made that shift from going from physical offices often to remote offices and some of some huge companies liked it so much they want to keep things that way even yeah it makes it easier for everybody like they actually found that focus increases a lot and and their efficiency has increased a lot because there's so much more focus on just a doing portion instead of doing a bunch of meetings so raise your hand raise your hand here guys i'm just curious who here loves to do remote work who here would love to do remote work everybody look at that look at that oh my god it just keeps going keeps going so the remote work portion just only increase and increase because really in the development world what do you need to do work what just your laptop pretty much is here nice hi nice to see you yeah and she would agree right like you need you preferably i'd like to have a monitor with my laptop okay preferably i'd have to have a nice setup when i'm coding so but even with that said you know you could work you can work i could have a nice setup at home as well so yeah a lot of what you need to do you are able to do it remotely i think you know for people it'll be always a split like sometimes i like to go into office to work sometimes i like to work from uh home what's more important is that i have the option of choosing both okay and what i want to share with you guys is that when you're doing development and you learn the skill you will have an option of choosing both okay that's one important thing to keep in mind so for those of you guys who are maybe doing stuff that's really hard takes all your time you're like man i just want to be with family more okay and i want to be either around my kids or around my girlfriend or wife whatever this gives you the opportunity to be able to do that or maybe you want to travel you know who knows yeah oh yeah now the world is opening up travel is the thing finally yeah yeah all right so let's now get into more like technical stuff as well right like for example why do we why why javascript why is this language actually helpful and why a couple of reasons all right first of all javascript is actually one of the most common and most used languages around the world for developers so you can see here on the left hand side all right it's one of the most powerful languages and and in a big picture perspective everything is from javascript okay so like if i just if i get out of here if i get out of this slide and i and i go to youtube you know all of this all of everything that you see here is javascript yeah i mean basically the whole the whole world wide web is built on javascript guys yeah when i click history or when i click this even when i hover my mouse and all this stuff is happening and what happens when i click live what happens when i click chess this is all javascript right when i go on instagram this isn't just like weird stuff that we're nerding out and talking about this is real stuff that's happening right now when i hit the play button there's a javascript video player that loads like literally every single thing that's online has javascript for those of you who are killing on zoom and you guys are watching this right and zoom through the web version of zoom that's also using javascript youtube you're watching on youtube what is that javascript guys right so that platoon that's a software somebody made and sold it to google for a billion dollars right and that software uses a lot of javascript so that's why these skills matter yeah all right so let's keep going and uh here is you know again another survey by stack overflow where javascript is clearly the number one and then for in terms of web frameworks and you guys should write this down as well if hopefully you're taking notes but in terms of learning frameworks we recommend that you learn react okay you don't have to learn it right away but put it on your roadmap to learning because it is hot right now and it's going to continue being hot and facebook started using it you guys saw facebook's ui change right like you guys saw facebook change a lot right where it used to kind of look like trash a few years ago now they did their ui update and looks cool and looks awesome they're using react and facebook actually created react for internal use and then they're like wait why don't we just open source this and they did and the whole world is like hey we want to start using react and then instagram jumped on it and a lot of other big companies are now jumping on it okay so a good one good tool to to learn about now another thing we want to touch base on is what can you actually do with javascript so top tech companies are using javascript so facebook linkedin microsoft ebay tesla groupon netflix all these companies have used or used javascript in some way or some shape okay and when it comes to types of web apps you can build here are the types of web apps you can actually build with javascript okay so on the left hand side you have facebook and that's built with javascript and react okay in the middle you have a server app which is you know netflix probably a lot by the way show of hands how many people here have a netflix account oh yeah probably everybody wow that's awesome that's super cool so netflix uses javascript okay and then even ios android apps use it to a certain extent so these are all types of things you can build with them okay and there are tons of myths of becoming a developer such as do i need to have a degree to get a job as a developer uh the answer is you know hold on let's see if uh i'm just gonna do stuff on the fly hopefully that's that's okay with you guys let's see uh if this video is there okay i'll let i'll let my my friend elon say some of this stuff now i do have to share it where i share my sound too um no no it's all good it's almost like you are you doing a road caster just stream it to world castle your sound should be on road caster that's it okay okay that's the one that's it no i don't hear your road caster sound i think you might have sound source on it bro college degree there we go now i can hear you the it's not it's it there's no need even to have a college degree okay at all or even high school the um i mean if somebody graduated from a great university that may be an indeed that may be an indication that they will be oh wait i can't show it for too long because copyright oh yeah yeah be careful oh yeah i remember it on the fly but i will share this part bill gates larry ellison steve jobs these guys didn't graduate from college but if you had a chance to hire them of course that would be a good idea i love that yeah yeah i love this guy so of course you know not everybody's bill gates or steve jobs or elon musk but also what's important to understand is that it's not always needed and elon is like elon is now the tony stark of real world right he's the real life iron man so when he does it sends it sets trends right like when apple and iphone does it sets trends when i apple is like hey now laptops are not going to have disk trays anymore disk trays are gone like no computer comes with that anymore right now apple is like usb c is the and then like android and everybody's like oh no offense to anybody who's using android here but like i'm sure things are gonna start changing to that direction right so when elon says things like that a lot of companies are like okay maybe there's different criteria we need to hire people on and maybe a boarding algorithm isn't the answer maybe we should look at their skills okay and maybe we should look past pieces of papers so a lot of modern tech companies that's what they do now okay so um yeah don't confuse schooling with education i like that and the coolest thing i think is to take away from this as well is like a lot of you guys think hey you know what nothing guys want certificates you want certificates you want to see certificates right oh nas i got an html set certificate you know i'm like great but do you have knowledge to actually build this kind of stuff right so what i think is we're trying to get from here is this it's not about degree a certificate it's about what you know and what you can do that's it yeah absolutely i didn't go to harvard but the people that work for me did um yeah yeah yeah so salary outlook you have a good salary outlook as we start to go into 2021 2022 average salaries for software developers is something that's increasing um you know but again the what this also means is as time progresses you also need to start developing a stronger and stronger skill level okay if you have a stronger skill level then you can be getting paid higher income okay but when you start as a junior developer and you're completely starting out it might be a little bit lower than this right but then you can work your way up to this okay and software engineer salaries at these are software engineers saw uh salaries at tesla and this is for entry level entrylevel people so literally beginners guys like if you're a beginner this is what what they're looking to give you biscuit if you look at those companies yeah so i'm just going to say that you have to there's you're still skilled and you're good at what you do and you know a lot of things if you don't know how to write code they're not going to give you the job but like if you're in a junior level developer this is actually what they will start you off with if they accept you yeah yeah yeah yeah cool so let's keep going you know uh your boy me uh i did drop out of college i was going i was going to college for two years and i was going to community college as well as saving money and then i was going to uic university of illinois in chicago i don't know if any of you guys have gone there anybody is from chicago at all um shout so shout out to chicago but my professor came up to me and i remember at that time i was already i had other developers even working for me and we were working for uh we were building this crm for a company and i was getting paid quite a bit you know um about like ten thousand dollars a month so i was on track to hit a hundred thousand dollars that year and my professor came up to me and he was like he started asking me for career advice and when he did that that was the cue for me and i was like okay maybe maybe this is the time to drop out of college and so i took one semester off and i was like if things don't work out i'll go back but then that's really when this started taking off and i just because i i was able to just go all in okay like can you focus your camera your camera's on focus for a second here okay there we go now you're good beautiful okay beautiful uh we have jesse who went from being a tax law consultant to a full stack developer and uh this is nasa's this is my friend yeah my friend robert and he's actually one of my first mentors and i actually literally met him by by going to a kuwaiti computing club and there he was actually building a startup company together with his friend steve and lilly joined him and he is now kind of he's built you can see trandala which was the starter company that was part of with them at the bottom and then he literally got a job at quickenload which is a work he's working right now and he's actually a lead developer there and he does not know how to have no degree he did go start going to college literally his first two years and then just dropped out he's like i don't need this so there you go yeah and this is what the career ladder looks like for you so if you want to become a software developer this is really what's happening you start off with being a junior software engineer or junior software developer that's your first title right your junior developer and then from there you go to a senior software developer third step up you become a lead developer where you're actually coordinating work within teams and sometimes you still write a code and sometimes you also become managers sometimes you either be a lead developer or you get to the managerial role technical architect where you're then actually focusing on designing systems here you become a team lead or a software development manager also what nas was talking about and here you're actually looking at projects and teams and you have power to hire and fire their developers and then the the final step is becoming a cto so that's a chief technology officer right so then you're actually managing the entire organization's technical needs and also from here you can either continue working at that company you'd go to different companies at higher paying jobs or if you wanted to it would also be a good time to maybe even look into developing something of your own because at this point you have tons of experience tons of knowledge okay all right now what's the first step that you should take what do you need to do to pass the interview how do you get noticed and so let's start actually going through and talking about these things okay before we we address all of those types of things cure is just one truth okay so for everybody who's a beginner and doesn't have a job right now as a software developer and doesn't have so much experience i want you guys to spend all your time learning the skills of coding it it takes a lot of time to really sharpen your skill set and actually get really really good at this but please spend majority of your time actually learning how to code all right just being competent in what you in what you guys in this field right right competency is what gives you confidence competency is what gives the opportunity now for those of you who don't know what competence is right because some of you guys might not know confidence is just you know the actual skill and you're being good at it because that's what people pay for my right yeah and confidence comes from competence okay so the more competent you are the more confident you are going to be you've probably experienced this in your life right when you guys are talking about a subject you don't know anything about you're like oh you have no idea what the hell to say but then if somebody's talking about things that you're good at or things you're passionate about all of a sudden your demeanor changes your posture changes the way your speaking changes you're like let me actually tell you how this is done and it's and it's not just random confidence that you just mustered out of nowhere it's because you're competing that skill you know what you're talking about okay so you know like i'm bad at construction and putting things together at diy stuff i'm like crap you know i'm garbage at that i'm like no don't talk to me somebody asked me a question i'm like oh i don't even know how to freaking tie a knot i don't know what's going on here but then like somebody wants to talk to me about chess and i'm super confident i'm like let me tell you about this you know everything changes and i'm talking about that yeah so because we we've had some people and without naming any names but where nas interviewed um you know interviewed uh her and she just didn't have any technical skills you know it was really really really bad like really bad and i think what happened in that case was like she had a great personality really high energy a wonderful person but i think the problem that happened was she'd heard that soft skills are really important and i think she kind of like went overboard with it meaning like she spent all her time making connections making relationships um meetings with people knowing everybody in the tech world interviewing sending hundreds of job offers but everybody that interviewed her just said that your technical skills are just not good yeah because like yeah i could hire somebody who's a great person but if your skills are just not there what am i hiring you for you know yeah like if that's that's that's the most important thing like like it or not and if you could combine both soft skills and technical skills this is where you become so in demand that people will literally throw money at you like there's literally companies that would that will fight for you i've had that happen from multiple companies where you know if you're really good and they really want you they'll just they'll just keep like okay we'll raise this up where is this up and like this is where you'll be able to get like big raises i went to a company where i started off making seventy thousand dollars and then within within literally six months i was able to get a razor for 80k right and so forth and so forth right yeah and there you go so yeah the skills will at the end of the day speak louder than everything else so one thing is you know just understand that the hours of you coding will lead to good to great results the difference is in the hours that you put in okay yes there are smarter strategies there's this and that but the hours are going to be you're defining you know part of your success so this is why this day boot camp guys how many hours are you going to put in into coding for these my five days let us know down in the comments below that's actually a great question yeah that's actually a great question 30 hours holy are you asking per day or the whole no no the whole five day boot camp okay yeah 10 hours per day 40 hours 50 hours holy moly sister per day 60 hour that you put in is for yourself so like if you put in overtime that's for yourself you know if you don't like if you put in two hours to me that just tells me you value yourself very poorly because you're well you see what i'm saying you're like hey i'm only going to invest two hours into this thing that's going to be my career into something that i'm going to be loving and doing for a longer period of my life you know if you're gonna do one to two hours don't do it at all all right um because the reason why i'm saying that i'm saying it from a really good place in my heart because it's not gonna work out if you want to do like this very small number of hours and then think you're going to succeed that's not going to happen because other software developers that are trying to learn they're going to keep putting in four or five hours and they're just going to beat you it doesn't matter even if you're smart or intelligent if somebody just keeps putting in more work than you on a regular basis they're just going to be better than you they're going to beat you you're going to go to an interview they're going to get the job and you're going to go home with the fact that you're like i had great worklife balance and i only did one hour of coding every day yeah no it's not gonna happen guys so like i don't discourage worklife balance i'm also not pro hustle you know just go crazy but i think that if you want to be great at something you do have to get a little obsessive at times and there's nothing wrong with that okay still sleep on time i still sleep and get my good sleep but every thought that comes out of my mind is about clever programmer is about how we can get you guys a better experience because let's be honest nobody else is doing events like these no all right and the reason why these are happening and why they're so good that we put together for you guys is because this is all we do and this is our entire focus and we're obsessed at 2 a.m i'm sending nas messages about how we can make it better or what we can do to better have better engagement with you guys even before this we were having arguments with like how can we actually give you guys video feedback on your freaking things and and we're like that's probably not going to be able to happen we have so many people i'm like let's we were like let's come up with a win it's obsession right it's like obsession to what you're trying to do that helps you get great results we're not a normal group of people we're not a worklife balanced group of people you know so our job here if you want to go be happy go to therapy it's brilliant but if you want to get good that's what we're here for we will do the work to make you happy too but we want to look at you like an engine you come to us how can we finetune you make you badass at software development and make you go get that job does that make sense that's what we're here for and especially in your younger years as you guys are starting this has been the best time to put as much time as possible as you're starting out inside development and i will tell you it's at some point it does get easier right and then maybe you will have more time for your family and stuff like that right um but yeah and yeah and don't let age be a barrier because wherever you start you will be completely good like yeah average age of a software developer when this start in us is like 34 or 37 okay if you start later than that it doesn't mean you can't pick it up if you start earlier than that doesn't mean you can't pick it up jack ma decided to launch his business when he was like 50 and he created alibaba and it became a billion dollar business so we literally have students here in the you know in our boot camp in our community who are 49 55 years old and they're starting their first careers in top development and have already have gone jobs is pretty insane yes okay so don't let those things discourage you whether some people are like i'm too young or i'm too old i'm like no you're just looking for excuses okay you you can do this all right the only thing that's going to happen between you going from 60 years old to 61 is you're going to go from 60 to 61 without being a software developer exactly or if you actually learn it you can be a software developer at 61 okay so it's doable just make sure the big butt there okay um is put in the work and it's doable okay it's not rocket science because i admit rocket science is pretty hard but software development is learnable a very very very learnable skill okay it just requires you to put in time and effort wait i just want to mention richard otis i love how you're watching this with your kid and just just you guys both are just smiling i love that that's actually great oldschool shitty here [Laughter] okay so let's keep going all right now in terms of how do you learn to code there are many ways you guys can learn to code you know for example you guys are here at the event just make sure you go all in okay obsession in my opinion is really the only way to learn because the people that i see dilly dallying the mo the ones that it takes the longest to like do this in these weird hour blocks or some type of weird schedule type of thing just i know if you have family and you have all this you don't have the luxury to go for 10 hours or 15 hours but whatever time you have just put all of that in okay like look let me let me tell you guys this right you guys don't put instagram youtube and whatsapp and all of these apps on a calendar yet all of you find a way to spend 30 hours 30 minutes or an hour or two or three hours a day to use those apps on facebook or instagram anything else it's not on your calendar so with coding find a way where it's fun for you where it doesn't feel like pulling teeth where you don't have to put schedules and reminders make it so you immerse in it so what i would recommend is that when when you're in this boot camp everything you should be eating and breathing should be around coding you have free time and you want to relax great watch a documentary on um on linustor vaults okay he created linux oh okay that's cool awesome so like watch stuff around coding okay watch stuff around software development use that time to be entertained yet inspire yourself because look you can't just start eating broccoli right you can you can't go from like eating garbage food and candy to all of a sudden eating broccoli 24 7. but what you can do is you can trick yourself and eat healthier candy okay eat healthier ice cream which tastes just as good as the crappy ice cream all right so go watch entertaining videos that talk about coding and software development so you're excited about doing it so that's what i would recommend work on all the stuff that you have in here and then the rest of the time play with it watch videos watch content immerse yourself where this is your life this is the new you okay and if you're here break through like literally have almost an identity level change okay who here would be excited if you left and you're just you're loving software development who would be excited about that change in you and you created and you've created those amazing projects at this point and now you're gonna see where you the potential is guys yeah there's so much potential so much absolutely okay so that's really in my mind how you learn to code in a really fast amount of time okay if you put 30 minute blocks you could do that for five years and you're gonna have a great thing going but you're not gonna be a great software developer okay so try to find ways where you could maximize it on each day and still get good sleep still get good food and still find a way i'm not asking you to kill yourself what i'm asking is use your time effectively i promise you there's two hours a day that are just being wasted into garbage if you focused that effectively on learning coding or doing some coding you wouldn't even need more time okay like how is elon musk running 20 different companies one launches rocket ships the other one is building a tunnel and like solving the traffic problem you know and then i don't know what other stuff that he's doing is crazy stuff he doesn't have more time than you or me no no no he's just being a lot more effective with his time and like and like and i want to give you guys a story guys like we have a student by the name of huda for example right and i'll get really good take this with two minutes right we have the student name huda she's in our booth camp and she lives in iran so for her actually you know the time for her for the coaching calls are very very late her coaching call time is 3 a.m in the morning but guess what it doesn't really matter for her because she still gets up at 3 in the morning she has three kids right she has a husband and and so forth she gets up at three a.m she learns with us literally for three hours per day from 3 a.m till about 6 a.m and after 6 a.m she gets up to then take her kids to school and after school after she leaves her kids at school then she comes back and then she also does homework and of course other things so right even though yes yes it's hard for her and yes she has to do this kind of stuff but the things that she already has done is amazing she's probably one of the hardest working people that i know just in general and so i want you guys to remember huda like when you think about any excuses that you might have and think about you know what i can learn this no matter what i have students who currently are doing truck driving anybody hear a truck driver by any chance anybody here truck driver anybody let me see in the chat if you guys are don't worry if you're not no worries but yeah for anybody who is a truck driver somebody said forklift driver yeah we have truck drivers who literally you know stop at truck stops just go ahead and learn with us it's crazy right it's all possible it's just you got to put the time into it that's it yeah absolutely yeah it's it's that that time component is really important and what i want to really emphasize is work hard to find that passion component because when you become passionate about it you just do this all the time like i don't need to think about clever programmer in time blocks and time portions because i love doing it my problem is the opposite of most people's problems people are like how do i stop procrastinating how do i you know put in the work how do i do all this my problem is the opposite my girlfriend can't it's hard for her to get me away from work like on a saturday or a sunday on my free day i just walked into nasa's office and i worked there this last sunday because i was like i was excited and and amberly she was like i think i'm gonna go do this other thing and i was sitting there i'm like what should i do i'm like i have the whole day to myself i'm gonna go to the office it's like the best thing i could do so find a way to build passion around it you know that's why i say be around the people that are in the community watch stuff around software development when you have that passion and excitement for it the rest of it becomes a lot easier you will just find a way to automatically put in the work agreed agreed okay now you know of course setting a goal for yourself is an important thing okay and and having realistic expectations so for example longterm goal for you would be hey i want to become a fullstack developer within the next one to five years that raise your hand that's your longterm goal here raising that's your longterm goal okay i like it if you have a if you have a different longterm goal let us know down and down the comments below yeah super curious yeah one to five years not too long so i'm saying we have steven says i'm in uh tutorial right now a lot of students are machine learning startup nice samir luna says i want to create something to better help the the foster care system wow that's awesome okay what's an sde software development something already sde software development engineering i don't know uh already a software development engineer got it yeah okay great so these are amazing goals that you guys are sharing yeah i think that realistically speaking you can become a pretty damn good developer within one to five years it takes a lot of work and if you really get committed you can definitely get a job within your first year so within the 12 months like for me i got my first job within the 12 months i had my first paying clients three months in and then six months in i had bigger paying clients i'm also obsessive and i was doing it like crazy but i think most people if you focus put in the hours you it's very possible for you to be able to get a job within your first 12 months okay and then shortterm goal you know also understand what's your shortterm goal so for example instead of learning five different types of things maybe make it something simple i want to just learn the fundamentals of javascript and then just go hard at that and master it okay so write it down maybe even have a timeline a rough timeline around it of what your goal is and what you're looking to do okay it could be even like build a todo app by myself by next week yeah all right yeah so there could be those are some simple ideas for you maybe after you're done with this boot camp maybe your goal can be within two days after the boot camp build the rock paper scissors app or that sas product that i built but from scratch by yourself four days five days yeah yeah and one thing we'll encourage you guys as you guys go into this kind of stuff is you know within the rock paper scissors game any of these other projects that you guys are building with us is to always you know try to test things out by yourself and even add extra features right and then after this boot camp your goal should be one on the goal i never learn how to build this can i now build it by yourself by myself and that's it and literally do it that way because yeah i probably believe that raise your hand if you feel right now you feel like you're having a hard time building stuff by yourself like you're watching tutorials and you can do them yeah look at that look at everybody's hands go up yeah you're not the only ones guys we here at clever program we talk to a lot of students hundreds of students on a daily basis and it's the same situation every single time you guys are going to tutorials but yet you do not know how to build stuff fully by yourself so what needs to happen what needs to change what do you guys think let me know let us know in the comments below one is to change for you to change that habit for something for something to happen let me know but yeah we can continue on building things solo discipline small passion to get it done damn it nice yeah all right um so you know if you guys want to plan things and put them just one recommendation we have for you is if you guys you know i don't know if you guys know notion or not but if any of you guys familiar with notion just raise your hand slightly no all good all good so notion is a really just good productivity tool it's free and it helps you basically write down your plans put together timelines whatever you kind of want to do all in one place so give it a shot it works for some people and i i recommend you know if you need something that helps you with planning this could be a really good tool that you could use okay so give it a shot and maybe a notion you can have when you're planning to do what okay and put your learning plan in here might be a good idea to do that just gonna quickly lay out seven most important habits that we notice that people who succeed or students who succeed and go and get a job as a developer and we just wanted to lay them out for you here okay and some of them that i want to highlight out of all of these are um so i'm going to start off with just this for now okay so hard work and patience when i say hard work honestly i feel really guilty saying that because it's weird but i kind of you know just honest truth i feel like kind of suck at hard work nas is extremely good at hard work um because for me what it feels like i just get so obsessed that it doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like work anymore at all and it literally feels like i'm playing a game and then i can just go through it and and even if i have to do it obsessively or for long term to me it doesn't really feel like work when i do things um why is that why is that i think that when i went to school i developed a i went to this like weird school when i was young and i developed this thing where i um because they took a lot of things from you and they restricted a lot of things and it was very like it was really disciplinary and i started hating doing things that i hated like really like most people probably are like i'll just wash the dishes it doesn't feel that bad or i'll do this other thing it doesn't feel that bad for me i started hating things with the passion that didn't like so much that now when i do things that i don't like it like kills my soul from the inside it like burns wow so um it made me wanna really focus on things i enjoy doing and then within that i found that when something is really enjoyable for me and it's fun and i like it and it's aligned with me i can go through tremendous amount of work and it doesn't feel like i worked it's almost like i wake up from it and i'm like what the hell just happened what did i just do probably some of you might have experienced that yeah right like for example you'll leave that if you guys went to college and you or or you know maybe think back to when you were a student you left your final exam all the way until the last freaking day to study right who did that who did that here i sure as heck did it so but then all of a sudden you look back and you're like damn man that was sick i was like a superhuman how did i pull that off that was crazy so when you kind of are aligned and you're excited about things and you enjoyed them you know personally that's what it feels like for me but i just want to say that hard work and having patience is a key component okay so for me how i played it is i'll give you guys my workbook okay my recipe and nas laughs at me but i'm gonna share this with you but like for me patience is a really key thing and patience comes from expectation so when you have really high expectations you're really impatient with yourself you'll be really hard on yourself and also i think a lot of sense of loss great stems from having poor expectations all right so for example when i started coding i'm like in five years i'll have a job the first year i'm just supposed to suck not have a job constantly lose but i worked my ass off and i learned like crazy okay and then i'm like whatever happens happens if i get a job within the five years it's just a bonus so like in my mind i'm never losing i'm always winning every day even if i don't get a job for the five years i'm winning um even when i started clever programmer it started off like i i remember i got on a call with my friend tenzin and i'm like i want to fail the only thing i want to work on this year is fail 10 business ideas that's my only goal for this year work on 10 things that i'm going to fail and then i start a clever programmer and it succeeded and it became it became good um and it was like hey this is just a bonus this is this is great so why i'm sharing this with you guys is if you set your expectations right and you're not like i need a job within the next month you play that long game but you work your ass off now you'll also have this weird thing called happiness and peace along the way yeah okay see this is this is where i get a little bit even different sometimes you know because like for me this is where like kazi like we got these two different personalities in a way where kaizen like always looks like the worst case scenario you're not working but like always like you know what if i just get this i'll be fine right for me it's like i always said these crazy crazy things like guys i'm going to do this we're going to do this like for me if i was that position i'd be like okay i gotta have a job literally one year gotta get there you know like what can i do right but from that even so as as i've gotten older i realized how much of that is not so much important like yes that personality has gotten to where i am today right but i've also realized that that's not a necessity personality right like yes i want to push hard and go hard all the time and that's really good and that can really get you to a lot of places um at the same time you i kind of realized that i need to learn to almost kind of like step back and let things happen for you you know weirdly enough right and like instead of having this crazy expectations which i still sometimes do and i still like to push myself towards them i am a lot more relaxed knowing that you know what if i don't hit that somehow i know i'll hit it either later or some or something else might hit as well so i think that's the most important thing is i don't like bog myself down because that's what i used to do i used to literally punish myself for not knowing hey you know what oh i didn't get an a on this test or you know what i didn't do this or i don't have a job yet like what's going on with me yeah and that wasn't so pretty honestly so yeah now it does definitely change that though i'm still working on it yeah so just two perspectives from two different people take what you value throw away what isn't valuable for you um but i think that's kind of what i want to share from d7 of course the other ones are important like taking initiative of course you have to be good at learning a lot because with development all those things change but you know this is this is the reason i see a lot of people quit having bad expectations and they go i'm gonna do two hours of coding and by the sixth month i'll have a job and then that leads to unhappiness and i see lots of people quit out of this career if you flip it it will make you really happy um and you will actually get through a lot of the crappy things that you need to get through okay so beautiful let's keep on going um so um yeah if you get angry and you're coding and things don't work sometimes there's one solution is to break your computer the second solution is to you know um which what i prefer when i'm playing chess is for me i will like actually go for a walk or other ones are all google and stack overflow which is actually what i do that's usually the best answer yeah so because yeah like start off of course when things don't work one of the things that i want to just tell you guys is you have to become ninjas at googling googling is yours going to be the way to solve problems it's your superpower yeah and you'll build a pattern recognition experience with how to understand the problems because for me for me it literally took a few years to be able to actually understand the answers that i would see on stack overflow like for the first couple of years with software development when i would see answers on stack overflow they would never make any sense to me and i'm like i don't understand how to fix this but just googling random things that would help me kind of start getting into the right place okay of course you can also ask your question but so let me just start with this google stack overflow but one thing i'd recommend is those two ways are generally what i consider lazy ways of thinking because you want somebody else you want to outsource your thinking to somebody else which i think is fine if you're an experienced software developer because you shouldn't have to think all the freaking time but i think when you're new use these as learning opportunities so before you go to other people and go hey daddy can you please help me lift this grocery bag or this weight it's too heavy for me i think stop and flex your own thinking muscles first okay do as far as possible right yes and we're not here trying to say that you know what you can't ask questions that's not what we're trying to say here at all instead what we're trying to say here is like hey just give yourself time to figure the solution yeah because crazy enough actually in the process of figuring out a solution is what where you learn the most like you go from one thing to another thing and what's gonna happen is you're building out patterns around coding right and after that for example let's say as you're researching you realize there was something else that you might have been missing the whole time like oh dang this is interesting yeah and so that's where really enough your brain is going to pick up more things than just by you coding because the thing is a lot of students that we have sometimes you guys potentially just you try to get the answer too fast yeah that's one thing that's another thing that comes with patience which is like you'll run into a problem and almost like you get some level of anxiety not knowing the answer and you want to get it really really really fast and so then you will go and ask that question to somebody or get on a call with somebody and you know this is going to sound weird but like i don't know if this is true i'm not a scientist and i haven't done research on this but i generally feel like people who ask too many questions generally don't do well in those particular industries and the reason why i say this is i think what's actually happening is either they're not designed for this industry and maybe something else might be better for them maybe they're more communic social people maybe they would be better working as a team manager for a software development company communicating with everybody but i think what they're what is happening there is they're outsourcing their thinking so they're being lazy thinkers okay and one thing you definitely have to make sure you get good at as a software developer is the more you put your thinking under tension just like being a bodybuilder right when you put your muscle under tension the longer you put it for under tension the more your muscle is gonna grow yep so with software development it's all about thinking it's not about you knowing tools it's not about you doing things quickly it's about your ability to think and the more time you could put your brain what's up think and problem solve i'm just gonna say yeah think and problem solve and the more time you can put your brain under tension your brain actually will physically expand okay brains physically expand when they actually do the brain analysis and like that they even found that the taxi drivers in uk because they have to memorize so much about how the roads and the traffic works they actually have bigger brains physically so it's a muscle but it takes time and those moments where you feel pain and you're like man i just want to know the answer i want to get to the answer under that stress is where you become a really strong software developer yeah because like i said it just like cause you're saying just repeat like yeah brain is a muscle it grows as you build it this is why and even in these situations right the most important here is not the fact that you're learning javascript the most important thing here is now you're learning html or css the most important thing that you're learning is problem solving and it's thinking when you have a bug in front of you and you can't solve it or it's when you have a feature to build and you really just don't know how to go about it it's like you're trying to figure it out this is where you're building that brain so we want you guys to encourage that these next five days we encourage you literally challenge yourself as much as possible and you will find some amazing amazing results from that yeah and let me tell you something where your brain will try to trick you when you get stuck in a problem your brain will tell you and your brain is completely blank okay so i think you guys might have experienced that right where you run into has that ever happened to you guys where you guys run into a problem and then you're trying to think of a solution your brain is literally blank yeah colors are blocking your child said green right colors like you're like hey i'm literally not making any progress so your brain will actually trick you and your brain will say neo you're not making any progress so why don't you just look up the answer because you're not making any progress anyway and that's a trap that's a trap because your brain wants to survive because it knows if it thinks more it's more work your body doesn't want to do more work your body just wants to survive for a longer period of time another day you're still a biological creature that that has a primary function of survival so your brain will literally try not to do work and trick you like you know like you don't need to think about this there's google ah somebody has the answer it's like a crack addict that just needs another like fix so what you need to do at that point is ignore that voice of your brain and just chill like go go for a walk the tricky thing is sometimes at least for my brain i'll spend 30 minutes or 40 minutes and i have made no forward progress and then all of a sudden things starts clicking in a weird way yeah so i think sometimes that part is important like to not look at the answer and just get in the flow of it even if it takes you four hours of being unproductive it's going to actually help you at the end of the day yeah really enough yeah um all right because like there's some people who are like nas and this guy's either developed a really strong system for problem solving or probably is a little gifted as well but like he immediately's brain is like thinking of the way to solve the problem and he'll like start breaking it down for me my brain will be blank for like 30 minutes to an hour and then things will start coming in and then i'm like all right here we go it takes me time you know okay cool so full stack developer there are a lot of things that means it's a big term but generally what what what's happening is is these three things here okay other things can be of course a part of it too let me clear this and let me just draw with my other one okay but it's these three things here so when you when you hear full stack developer i want you to think front end back end database okay and database generally i even consider database to be part of back end okay so really when you when you hear a full stack i just want you to think front end and back end that's all okay these are the only two things i want you to think about all right when i when i say front end it's clicking but all the stuff that looks pretty and does stuff that you see with your eyes it's the view one what's up it's the view guys it's what you see on facebook what you see on instagram when you go on there it's what you're seeing right here right when you're on youtube or you're on zoom it's coaches yes yeah the user interface and all of that so for example what nas is saying is they could have had the videos in like excel type of thing where when you type in a search it's just an excel document with the list of videos right and you read the names and you click on the one that you like but then they decided hey instead of showing the view in that way how about actually we show thumbnails of the video in a way where it looks more clickable and friendly yeah would you would you guys agree that'd be that that's a lot better is that better or not yeah yeah so the ui okay and the design that's more frontend when when we talk about backend it's more about for example how exactly is youtube able to handle billion gigabytes of new storage that's being uploaded to their website yeah that's interesting right yeah because your google drive can't do that no right where where am i going to store it like if i gave you okay if i gave you a billion gigabytes of footage where exactly are you going to store it what would you do with it like i'm just curious someone said the cloud where would you go with that well it'd be crazy right and if you um so that's just a simple example then what if you have a million people streaming what if you have one person streaming at a time okay you solve that that's great but if you have 100 people streaming at the same time you solve that that's great what if you have a billion people streaming at the same time ooh that's an interesting problem so back end okay that's that stuff is back in and it's equally if not more important yeah it's kind of what it's the things you don't see that's the hard work right uh you know when you for example log into facebook guys right and you put in your username username and password where do you think that username password goes to what do you guys think well a database it goes to database it goes to the backend right it goes to an api that they have right then the api checks the back end says hey is this guy real or not if he's not he's like oh no this guy's not real right it's a thormann error but if he's real okay all right let's go ahead and log him in and actually showcase watch and then give him all the information about himself who here knows about popular ugly websites does anybody here know any popular ugly websites let us know in the comments i'm curious well there used to be reddit there's craigslist and craigslist right but even even reddit has changed their ui now okay and i think craigslist might soon or maybe it's just craigslist i really doubt i really thought they're gonna change anything yeah that might that might never change there yeah so not many websites are gonna continue to be that ugly okay but i'm sure they have really good back ends but they don't have a good front end okay and now they're working on their front end as well because they're losing viewers and users and they're like okay let's do this okay all right um in terms of somebody saying no okay i'll go go good okay okay cool so in terms of technologies you guys need to learn okay um you'll need to know html you'll need to know css okay this is this right here is html this is css and javascript okay so these three if there's something for you guys to focus on this is what i would focus on for a while pick up react later but just keep in mind react is a baby of javascript okay javascript is the dad react is the baby so learn these first and then react is going to be easier cool and then you can also learn a firebase which is a database okay and that's where you can actually store stuff so that's going to be helpful when you're making apps where you have other users that can log in log out you have user authentication um things like that okay yeah i want to launch a poll here guys which one would you want to do front end backend or full stack i'm really curious here let me know that's so cool i love the poll yeah damn we have 200 and almost we have 300 people just answered the poll right now that's pretty fast like guys even this whole poll right if you think about it which portion is the view of the front end which portion is the front end right which person's the front end well it's what is the u actually seen right the question and you've been able to answer it and then which portion is the back end it's which one where where the poll is being stored well yes the poll being stored and where you you guys are actually being being able to when you answer the poll it's storing your answer in the database that's it wow we almost got 400 responses yeah that is phenomenal to the poll so yeah so it looks like 290 of you said you want to become full stack developers okay we're sharing the results now 36 said you you know nine percent says back end 19 said front end and 73 of you said full stack development so you know um with full stack you know both front end and back end and what's amazing about that is that it makes you really uh valuable at your company which means you're probably going to be if if this happened god forbid this happens but you're going to be the last person that's fired because you're needed you're like needed needed right um just because it makes you so versatile all right but both of these other options if you chose front end and back end they're not wrong either they're great and there are plenty of people making a lot of money doing either of those okay so both of those are valuable awesome thanks for sharing guys now html css and javascript here's how you guys should think about it right html is just a skeleton okay html is pretty much when you like when you don't have any clothes on you're just this html structure all right it's like your bones basically yeah css is when you put on makeup when you put on clothes when you get ready right that's your that's the style like that i look good exactly so when you go to a website that doesn't have css those websites are absolutely hideous okay unlike you you're beautiful even with but no makeup on anything because you're here and we love you [Laughter] don't let anybody else tell you otherwise but for but for um websites when they don't have css they are they're awful to look at they're not pleasant you guys know what i'm talking about those css like or those uh you guys have seen like these university professors always post homework and it's always on like these ugliest websites you've ever seen um that's just with html okay and then javascript adds action to the thing it has the funkiness the funkiness of you being able to dance and the you know to think and to do all these other different things that's right so like when you actually click a button what happens you know how does a video load oh when i'm on youtube and i hit that thumbs up button it turns blue interesting okay those are all things happening with javascript cool so html is basically if you guys want to write this down as well if you know it that's that's great but this is what makes a page work it's the structure of a page okay this is what really bare bone html looks like and this html if you wrote this you would have a page or a website that's actually running or doing something okay uh one good place i recommend you guys go to if you want to just write random code and have fun stack blitz is a phenomenal resource and you can go here and do stuff so i'm gonna i'm just gonna choose i'm gonna go to stack blitz and i'm just gonna choose html javascript css boom right there you guys can see my screen cool so i'm just gonna choose index.html here all right that'd be great what's up if you can zoom in on that that'll be great oh just comment there we go nice okay great so i'm here right now if i add in other stuff onto this page let's just say i write okay i don't want to sign in leave me alone so let's just say i write a h2 and i say hello ron all of a sudden i have hello ron mmhmm okay uh let's go now which portion is that guys what he's doing right now which portion is that let us know in the comments below which i don't know what that question means as an is this is this the html the css or is the javascript ah okay got it yeah so yeah which one is this am i working what am i working on here beautiful everybody's saying html exactly nice wow good smart crowd i love it thank you guys so yeah this is the html portion right and now if i make it h6 it'll become much smaller okay now if i was to change the color of this uh that would be what portion if i just asked you guys right now if i was to change the color of hello charles to to something else green some good answers out here good nice to have david nice css exactly that would be the styling good job so at a very basic level that's effectively what's happening okay so let's keep going on with our presentation and remember you can use the stack blitz resource it's awesome it's free it's epic gets you up and running super quick all right css you can use you can learn how to use different layouts flexbox responsive design media query so for example when i go on youtube these guys might actually be using flexbox to show their videos in a specific way okay so like for example the first row has three four five six videos right the next row also has six videos in this row essex they might be using flexbox to uh display it where there's like this little gap in between these videos here um it's laid out in this perfect like line here like this right a row so that's an example of flexbox let's go cool let's keep going and and by the way now if you ever want to show something to just let me know i can i'll stop my screen sure and you can do it too okay i'll keep going that's all good so let's go so and this is what css looks like so css will look like this where you're styling things you're targeting a certain block you're giving it a certain color okay so for example if we go back to this let's see maybe i can go to my style css let's look at this one right this is h6 so maybe i can go here and go hey also h6 save cool and can i give it um let's see if i give it a different color all of a sudden it's all green okay so it's really simple how it allows you to be able to play with it and you know change things cool and of course you can get more complex with it and do fancier things with it right here you have hover oh i could point on it and then it turns red fancy okay when it comes to go ahead now you want to talk about this so what do you need to know when you learn javascript yeah so for jaw so click on that again so the javascript comes up i think nice awesome so for the javascript portion guys what we really want to focus on is not so much just done basically learning a lot of complex things instead we want to focus on on learning the basic things right so for example here what we got is data types so one of the things right so guys what are the what are some data data types do we have let me know in the comments below well what do we know we know there's like variables right there's like you know an integer there's strings right there's objects there's arrays there's booleans all those are data types it's kind of like you need to know how to use them because you know each one provides you with a different solution each one allows you to do different things right if you want to have a data type for example hey is this user logged in or not what kind of data data type would you use oh that's a good one huh yeah yeah that's a that's a good one which one would you guys use if the user is logged in or not there's some good answers yeah like kind of like victor said yeah you use a boolean right what did which did the type would you use for example if you wanted to um have a list of for example names right and you want to be able to list them out what data would you use yeah correct and array right or what data would you use to for example to describe a user describe the use that's currently logged into facebook what data would you use yeah that's right exactly like an object right so this is where you guys need to learn all these different things so you can properly use them because sometimes when i talk to students you guys have no idea what that is instead you just kind of like oh yeah i get i get i get it you know here is his hand right yeah yeah i get it now they exist but like and which points i use it well you got to know when to use them next thing is of course functions es6 and us7 so with functions what's a function guys who knows what a function is anybody what's a function hector knows well a function is basically something that allows you to take a piece of your piece of code right and to store it and basically to create a reusable piece of code so for example let's say i have a piece of code for logging for logging you in right facebook has a piece of code for logging you in whenever you click the login button what do you think it will call what function what function the login function exactly let's say you guys want to go let's say let's talk take me for example as a person i want to go for a run what internal tools inside me is a person do i have to go for a run and what do i activate right what is it your legs right your arms all your muscles it's like it's like almost like a reusable function right do you know exactly what you need to activate in order to go for a run it's the same thing here next up dom manipulation now dom manipulation is very interesting because what do you see on there right in terms of a landing page when you go on any website let's say google.com or facebook.com you see a page right but what happens when you for example what happens when you for example a new post gets gets picked up right what happens then or for example you're on youtube right now right and let's just say that you right now for example you go to let's see subscriptions or originals let's say you click on originals click on originals there we go so you can see the left side bar stayed the same right while the right section of this page changed that's funny so what happened was basically we manipulate the dom which is the document object model which is what the page is it's the structure of the page and you said basically when you clicked on originals what do we say hey you know what the left sidebar stays the same we don't change the left sidebar look but the right section of the sidebar changes the content that's called down manipulation next up is going to be what scope so scope i won't go too much deeper but scope is basically where what scope is like kind of like um you have an access to something only within certain parts of the application right for example your password would you want your application to have access that password or no probably not because of safety reasons yeah probably not so we give your password only access to certain parts of the application potentially right that's scope next thing data structures data structures are freaking cool because a lot of people go ah boring but when you think about the boring company by elon musk that is using tons okay so also when you go on google that search engine is using data structures and algorithms if i told you for you know make a search engine you would need to use data structures and algorithms a lot of times there's binary trees there's stacks there's cues there's linked lists and the sad part about you guys or about a lot of students is they don't know what those are yeah they escape through them and in order for you guys because because everything else sounds fancier and much more fun you know this is like eating broccoli like nobody wants to eat broccoli that's a good that's a good thing our job is to make a cake shove broccoli inside of it and just like force feed it to you you know like here so that you think the escape but it's actually broccoli underneath the cake you know yeah yeah it's like a fake painting of a cake right but we know it's good for you right so that's the most important thing [Laughter] right it's like and like apis are the next thing up which are going to be important for you guys to actually learn all right so that was my timer guys i have to run uh nas is going to be with you for the rest of the time you guys have been absolutely amazing thank you guys so much so far but guys there's still a lot more left okay so right now is not the time to leave right now is actually the time to buckle in even harder okay because there's gonna be amazing things now's gonna be sharing with you guys just wanna say love you guys and uh keep crushing it okay keep going guys yep let's do it let's do it awesome sweet awesome thanks quasi they're like love you too [Laughter] all right guys awesome sweet so you guys still see uh the page everything right you guys see every everything correct yes beautiful sweet sweet sweet wait so kaza you can actually now go if you need to leave skype you can feel free to leave skype i got myself on here you got everybody see is the screen yes yes all good give me a thumbs up guys all good beautiful thank you thank you thank you so currently we're killing what we're adding where did we get to guys let me see where did we get to well where we're at right now is we're currently on this side my right yep let's go ahead and click on this specific section so you guys can see beautiful sweet all right cool so this is where we're at right now right you guys are of course and this is an example of course of javascript as we see right now right what we have right now is we have this right here is what this is an object or this is actually an array right and then this right here is what this is an object right here this section okay all right and of course this right here is kind of like a filter function that that's being used right that's javascript so so what do we have here okay let's talk about some frameworks because javascript and html and css oh great they're kind of like the bare bones right it's kind of like when you're building a house guys what do you build first what do you build first what do you build first tell me what do you guys think in the given tell me the chat where it gets built first in terms of house the foundation correct and so really the javascript html the css what those are is those are just simply the foundations right but we need to build stuff on top of that for that for you to be fully useful this is where we go get into frameworks this is something that we'll explain here in this specific presentation okay well the most on the popular frameworks we have here are number one angular anybody know angler here raise your hand yeah good good good okay okay that's one next one we know is called view anybody know what view is ujs beautiful beautiful and then the third one we got is react and this one is tom tom tom this one is the best one or that that's the one that we like the most [Laughter] right now you might be asking yourself a question of like why is react so cool why react in general both of these frameworks are really good both are amazing right in terms of what they do and what they allow you to do the thing however is that we've realized is that look at the companies are currently using all these different frameworks so what do we have react.js right used by airbnb by instagram uber eats you know dropbox you know and so forth angularjs upwork paypal sony right so still pretty very much useful am i right correct however what should you i choose which one would you choose guys let me know in the comments in the in the zoom chat below i'm very curious which one would you choose react react react angular react react holy moly dang okay okay i like it i like it i like him a lot of react people so the reason why we just say react is because why this really is called a stack overflow survey that stack gorflow does every single year and they found out that react.js is one of the top ones out there right it's being used by a lot a lot of companies you know year in and year out you know it's a v and it's a really enough it's actually a lot more efficient and real life is actually it's a lot more faster than any of these other frameworks and it's because this is called a library while this is called a framework anybody anybody know the difference between a library and a framework here who knows anybody spelling victor says that's funny that's i mean that's pretty good so framework versus a library which one so library is a collection of tools chanda says embedded with frameworks okay a firmware has certain user specifications somebody says what else library connection collection of code library so good question so a library is basically a library is more bare bones so a bare bones built built built on bare bones javascript and and it gives right and it gives you a lot gives you a lot of basically room to play so it's a lot very flexible what does that mean basically it's using very much javascript underneath the hood yes but it's really built on javascript versus angular is basically you are limited limited to functionalities that it has functionalities that it has it's kind of like it's kind of like the mac os system or the you know the windows system right we're limited to the functionality that this has right so that's kind of where our frame will really come in right we're very limited but by what functionalities those mac os system and they give us you guys understand that yes or no raise your hand with me right versus a library it's almost kind of like linux more so i would say it's got the closest one it's like linux a library is where you can actually build things on top of it you can build other things on top of react gs because it's using more more bare bones right so this is where uh react.js is actually kind of winning because it's very much bare bones and so it's a lot more efficient and look at that here's some downloads per year some more data for you on the downloads per year section you can see for example react is very much going up up and up and up the whole time look at that it's pretty cool hey so that means that react for the win all right so top ten companies using javascript of course we got linkedin very important company we got facebook we got microsoft we got ebay tesla groupon netflix google uber tinder airbnb paypal anybody using these companies of course of course and guys all these companies are the ones that are using javascript using these technologies like angular like react.js like you know like vue okay so here are some now resources resources that we will be using to learn okay all right so let me go ahead and go more reasons to learn front end we have companies like free code camp of course right amazing resources for you guys to learn you know there's free cold camp anybody here use learning free from free code camp anybody here nice nice good good good yourself front end mentor anybody has learned here from front and mentor so fundamental is not so much about learning coding but it's so much they have basically beautiful projects for you guys to do who here has trouble with projects anybody like trouble with the like basically trying to figure out what products to build well these guys actually will be the solution for you these guys right here find a mentor these guys for the mentor they have amazing products though they are designed for you all you have to do is build them and they're beautiful looking beautiful looking okay beautiful looking awesome and of course we have youtube so on youtube we have of course a few things so if you go to clubprogrammer.com on youtube um let me go ahead if you join our community there oh wait wait wait wait so if you go to youtube for example we have a lot of courses for example like we have an html cross course for beginners right here we have a css course course for beginners right here and so forth okay so a lot a lot of technologies you can learn from youtube as well let me go wait next community okay so guys at this point this has been our presentation on your opportunity to become a developer guys who is excited for your opportunity to become developer who's excited for you guys to learn this to become developers for you guys to build amazing projects and to land those jobs that you guys want to oh my god you guys are covering my screen holy moly if only you guys saw my screen i've been saying i love it i love it i love the energy you guys have i'm gonna go into q a here in a second so you guys can ask any questions we'll go one by one okay and hit the bell icon but before that i want you guys to take out a piece of paper okay everybody here please take out a piece of paper and pen all right or if you guys use your phone to screenshot that'd be great too you guys can use your phone take a picture so because of course this is a fiveday bootcamp this is our first day right now so we want you to give you guys homework every single day we will have homework for you understood comprende yes can i get a thumbs up hey can i get a thumbs up hey can i get a thumbs up yeah there you go that's what i'm talking about i love it shitlana's like yes thumbs up so here's your homework number one is we want you to go ahead and download visual studio code right here very very important okay so download videos to the code this is what you will be coding in okay download visual studio code get to know how to use it right maybe create a new project create a new file right figure that out this is what you'll be using basically guys tomorrow after that build your own portfolio website so guys we are going to be giving you a portfolio website look at this if i go ahead and look at this one look at that this is a portfolio website that will be giving you to use fully like you have the fullon project for yourself you can use this for companies you can use this for you know portfolio on linkedin pretty much anywhere and look at how good it looks look at that you can you got your skill sets right here you guys can talk about of course you've got your projects which is these are the projects you'll be able to put on for yourself right here of course right uh after that what else you got well you might have you know kind of like what you do maybe you're maybe you're teaching maybe you're coaching then maybe you have look at that it's dave by the way he's actually he's he actually works with us um you know you basically just kind of basically put out who you are so guys how awesome is this how awesome is this that you get your own fullon portfolio that looks so good you don't really have to worry about all you have to do is just change the content yeah you guys like it yes yes nice i love it i love it i love it beautiful let's continue on okay all right next up is gonna be here's your homework at this point wait let me go ahead how do i here's where this point is so the number one thing is going to happen the following first thing is download the portfolio website which is this one okay and the link guys we will have uh the link in the facebook post but feel free to screenshot this right now okay so number one download your portfolio very important okay number two watch how to use a portfolio video that's number two okay that's also so we will show you how to use it how to use it how to upload it how to actually make it live all of that and then finally number three run the portfolio locally on your computer right now when you're when you when you're running your preferred locally what you want to do is first is update your profile photo so the profile photo that's in there is this one of course you guys don't want to be david here david you know you guys want to be yourselves i'm guessing right right am i am i right right so you want to do that of course and then update your experience section so any section you want to change on here just going to change it you know you know change your skill sets change your skill sets in here gonna change your projects change your projects in here right um go ahead and just modify the content and guys be creative with it this is the start of your journey this is where you now showcase what you can potentially do you start learning so if you want to change the theme of how this looks like do that you want to change the colors do that the more creative you're going to get the more you'll learn and the more you stand out so who here is gonna get created who here is gonna try and change things up on their portfolio everybody hey beautiful that's what i like to see now really important what i want you guys to do is of course screenshot your portfolio make a screenshot of your portfolio okay like a screenshot upload a z comment in the homework post on facebook okay very important so i'll put as a comment in the homework post on facebook so we will make a homework post on facebook okay and what we want you guys to do is to comment down below basically just your portfolio and showcase exactly what you've done not only will you get to inspire others but you also get to showcase like what you know and so you get to connect with other people as well does that make sense comprende comprende good good good good good and then finally the last thing that i want you to want you guys to do is the following submit your homework on ear table for us to give you a review of your or for your homework so that's it submit the screenshot to an airtable link again this airtable link will provide you guys in the homework post on facebook all right you we will also send out an email so make sure you guys click on the air table link and then provide your home post and it kind of looks like this it'll look a little like this kind of like this right so you can see right here day one homework submissions your name your email your phone number your screenshot uh and your your deploy url if you deployed it online does that make sense everybody yeah good good good good awesome sweet other than that that's pretty much it right now everybody right now i want you guys to go ahead and take a screenshot of this or use your phone to take a picture take a picture of you guys so you guys know it of course we'll make the homework post for you but you know for now i would say just just take a screenshot so you guys have

that it it was giving me a little bit of trouble um in this course are we going to become hello i'm sorry about that can you your cat is eating you yeah i know this sucks um in this course are we going to be covering git uh so we won't be covering git specifically but we'll be using git to kind of like you guys will see me doing like a push and a pull you guys will see me committing things so but i won't be forcing you guys so much into learning get so much focus on more so on like the javascript side the html side and the windows projects okay awesome thank you so much you got it awesome any more questions let's see who else we got who else gavin go ahead my friend i just had a question um about um when you say launch do you mean using netlify or heroku yeah yeah you can you get you could you can use nullify heroic creators just can put your project live okay for us to see and that's pretty much it and then um for the project section do you just want us to leave it blank or if for some of us that don't have projects yeah if you don't have projects feel free just leave a blank honestly if you don't have any projects yeah don't worry yeah if you don't you probably just leave it blank okay but the other the other skill sets you can use you can you can just put on there you know and i mean yes at the end of this basically you will be able to put your three brothers that you will build so at the end of all this and then you'll be able to put the actual projects you know uh that will be building this fiveday bootcamp understand got it awesome sweet cool cool any more questions let me see who else ron how are you doing my friend let me see ron let me see well yeah go ahead hi ron hey how you doing um you know this is my first time like entering into uh software programming and okay now it's uh i know with the projects everything's coming and there some people here know a little bit what to do you know um based on the project and the homework that we're gonna do the html is like would you recommend us uh you know going over the videos first before you go and start tackling on that homework yeah i mean i mean uh you mean like the portfolio homework is that what you're talking about right yeah because we have to like uh change it up do something because i'm i'm like all ready to go and do this that's awesome i love it i love it honestly i think just just kind of throw yourself into it perish like like really enough what's gonna happen is that when you throw yourself into it and you just kind of like um you know you kind of see things and you see challenges in front of you you're going to work backwards you know what i mean so you're going to see oh oh dang okay how do i start to start up this project well then you're going to go on google search up how do i start this project and then you get the answers so you'll be working backwards biscuit the whole time like doing like reverse engineering exactly exactly which is the fun part of it uh just in general as well yeah yeah i'm i'm an industrial designer by trade okay sorry a lot of little manufacturing portion so i i know what you're saying like you know thinking backwards and going sideways that's cool and so and so why you want to get into coding is that right yeah definitely that's awesome that's awesome and so like have you got us on community and things like that um say that again have you put yourself on the community are you in our community yeah yeah yeah i'm already part of it yeah beautiful beautiful cool cool yeah yeah cause i i started going doing the entering in the route of a software qa mmhmm the engineering so like doing more of the end away and then even working my way up to going to do being developing you know nice so that's like probably the next round so wait i'm curious why switch why why why the whole switch i'm just curious um industrial design i mean this is uh i love it but at the same time it's like you know i feel like i'm not doing a lot of good and creating things so like i want to do something like i that's going to last put my stamp on it like really hard you know i feel like you know with with the software like i could create something new and it's going to go like it's going to go viral or just stay static or i'll be able to help out yeah be better you know so that's honestly the best part to all of you guys the best part about coin that i personally find is like it's like basically like the way i think of ourselves as developers is literally inventors like i think of us as inventors i'm not gonna lie you know kind of like einstein level you know which is crazy right but yeah if you think about it yes you're not creating any hardware per se here but if you have an idea and you create a software that can help a lot of people yes you're taking an idea from your head and you're putting into for people to use yeah exactly like that's awesome am i right yeah right i mean that that's that's what you have to think about i mean as a designer i'm always thinking like oh how am i gonna make this better for this person and what i want to do for this yeah exactly well i take the same concept i'm thinking like hey you know what in software yeah how do you how are they going to approach it how they're going to look at it how they're going to like go around it i love it i just ask questions so that's good well it's problem solving that's probably it's it's all promising and it's honestly it's the most fun right so i think yeah if that's what if that's what you like ron i think uh you're in a good position you're in a good position to learn at this point now you just need to put in a lot of work and learning and you will get to it right and most importantly just don't let anything else stop you no i mean with the community and i think i see everyone here that's awesome that wants to do something you know we'll all be friends and you know definitely be like working all together probably you know i love that love yeah we'll go together guys make connections guys most importantly is if you're on this facebook community like use this community right get together get to know each other as you guys are counting together get to know each other and you guys will see a big big big difference all right hey nah thank you again thank you my friend all right you got it my friend okay i'll see you later okay well i'll see you tomorrow let me in pst well i see you tomorrow right yeah yeah good good good good awesome sweet all right let's go ahead next up who's got a question uh jeffrey hello how are you my friend uh i just want to know but i think i got it where the youtube site was what's up you i just want to know the youtube oh where the youtube was the youtube recording yeah yeah just go to youtube and go to clever clever and then type in clever programmer okay and then you'll see that video there okay okay understand awesome sweet all right next question we got joseph hello my friend go ahead hi joseph hey sorry about that oh so how um how creative can we get with this i mean i've been doing you guys tutorials since back on the uh disney clone oh wow really yeah i've done them all back since you started with the todo app nice it's uh react and i actually uh went to boot camp for react but unfortunately there's a lot of things you're not uh trained for you're not you're throwing a bunch of things i come from an engineering background so you're throwing a bunch of things and it's like here do this and then how do you get around per se a lot of companies want a bachelor's degree and where i'm at in florida that's like the big staple that i'm the big big brick wall i'm smacking into that's hard and like how do i push past that like whenever i follow you up with one you guys provided which is a lot better than the one i designed how do you going forward how do you push past that with that mindset is what my question is so good question i think basically i'm going to read it what you're asking right so you're asking me basically right you're currently in florida and you're trying to figure out uh kind of like a lot of companies you're saying that are asking for a bachelor's degree and of course you're in an engineering background right now and what do you do right now in terms of engineering at beckham um i haven't done anything with six years i'm actually disabled now oh so i stepped away from yeah so i programmed uh roughly 7 a.m to 2 a.m so i'm always programming wow i'm always doing something wow and i have the technical knowledge but i want to go your you kind of you you've i've mainly followed you and i you've kind of inspired me a lot because i want to go to the freelance route and i want to go and i don't know how to get there okay that's why i came to you guys for that road map how do i get there and avoid the corporate aspect yeah so of course so i am so one video you should watch is i had on youtube and write this down there's a video on youtube that i i did with blake connolly and um and he is a ceo of a freelancing software agency uh basically and he's only 20 23 years old and yeah only 23 years old and he's still a sub agency and a million dollars off their agency which is crazy and he started off literally with like um he started out with you know just kind of doing small projects by himself um he started i was just doing some upworks and freelancing projects building really low not making a lot of money initially but as he got more reviews as he got more you know as he got more experience he was able to rack up his price to this point i mean he's charging over a hundred dollars per hour and you know some of his projects are worth you know uh a few hundred thousand dollars right when he's working with the team okay because i asked sex i'm sure there are others amongst the other 200 or so of us that are here that probably think the same thing and i've done uh i've been stuck in tutorial health for about five years and it's that's where why i've come to this boot camp cause i wanna see if i can connect the dots to break free from that yeah because tutorial health if a lot of you guys don't know it some of you don't it's it's a nasty cycle it's a nasty cycle oils and you're trying to build stuff on your own but you may lack the either the creativity or you like the direction to get those tutorials or to make your own things and it's not easy i mean i still find myself i i'll design something on paper and i'm like well let me go throw it in figma let me go throw it in adobe xd let me figure out and then you'll get stuck and that's why i'm that's why i came here because i want to see in the next five days can i do your three projects on my own and see you know how do i get there that's why i thought i would ask you it's why i kind of dropped in here today was that was like i'm gonna ask dad if he knows how to make that dot is so let me ask you this question like what kind of like what kind of things have you learned before like what kind of fundamentals do you know um i started with c sharp okay i worked my way up through javascript html5 css3 bootstrap material ui into react uh es6 7 8 9 and 10. okay and i've worked my way through uh i didn't learn data and algorithms okay unfortunately so joseph i if i if i were to here to ask you one question if i told you right now joseph can you for example if i was to give you a javascript problem and i asked you hey can you for me um merge if i give you two arrays in javascript one array call a one array called b and they both had numbers in them if i could talk to create a function for me to merge them together would you be able to do it yeah you you would look through both of them and you would merge them as the final product you would print them out as a final in a third uh object you would create a third uh variable to merge those two into one how using that okay so okay so use the loop and then what would you do you would map through a and you would map through b so you use a for loop you use a for loop and you'd say four uh iss and five uh i plus plus if that one you'd use a map function you you would map through it and then you would add it you would print that out add those add that variable to the next function with a another for loop using the variable k and so on and you print those both out with uh console log uh i plus k or whatever variable you assigned those two for loops too so then so you're kind of there but you're kind of there but um in the in the actual response what you would do and you're really close is you said loop through through the first frame and loop through a second array really what you would do is you look to the first array and you do use a dot push to push to another variable that you just created right let's just say the variable is called c and you do that push from first array to another another to that c uh variable and then you look at the second array b and you'll do a dot push from that array to then the c as well yeah okay no to the same to the same to the same c array right so that's how you merge them together you just print out c which can change both of them exactly exactly so that that's where i missed the push part you see someone's almost no you're really close so i think what where you're lacking right now is you're very close to kind of like what what you know you build a lot of projects you're liking some of the most fundamentals right yes you do need to know some um some what's it called some um algorithms algorithms and data structures right but that's mostly if you if you were to get a job at a company if you're if that's not your goal and you just want to go to freelancer route which i will tell you is not going to be easy right huh i don't expect you yeah it's not going to be i'd rather i'd rather earn that paycheck like like uh connolly's case where i start small and work my way up to where i can say hey i am but let me ask you a question let me question why are you so afraid to work in a company being disabled um one of my things is i don't deal well with uh being micromanaged and so a lot of the companies i've worked for at my age i'm 37 so when i was just still young i yeah oh thanks a lot when i was younger in my early 20s i actually had a job in the engineering firm and when i lost that job i got this big chip on my shoulder that i couldn't come overcome so i went through a bunch of jobs after that as a freelancer that i ended up not knowing then that i didn't like working for other people in corporations because i had no say i had no presence i was just a monkey monkey see monkey do and that's what i felt and so to go the freelance route would be i would have that sense of individuality that sense of control mmhmm and say hey hey nas i want to do this project for you cool let's let let's talk about it you know let's let's get this project done whereas you're telling me what you want i give you what you want but you don't hold all the power in that relationship it's a given time yeah and a corporation it's not really so much that when you're the new man on totem pole yeah you're you're expected to do with very little say so and that's what what is it what what's the most thing what's the most and this is for anybody here i'm very curious actually anybody here who's currently in in the zoom what's the most important what's the most important thing for you in terms of work hold on you're muted i can't hear you sorry my my shut off for me it's the freedom to again like how you and uh qazi started out it's the freedom to set my own projects to set my own rates to have that freedom where i control how much i want to work i want to work 60 hours a week cool i have the project signed up i can do that but i have the will the the freedom to decide and if a company comes along and says hey i want to offer you 100 grand a year i know i'm worth that i have the backing with all the projects i've done on say upwork and whatnot as a freelancer whereas right now i have no experience and a lot of times a lot of these companies are calling me up and i kid you not anybody in the zoo i've had plenty of people call me up off of linkedin i've got over 900 connections on linkedin and i have recruiters calling me every other day saying hey i have this i have uh i have this javascript uh full stack developer job i have this react developer job a remote so and they'll call me and say hey i have the senior developer job this junior developer job whatever but once they hear i don't have a degree and i don't have any experience goodbye it's not i see what you mean i see what you mean so degree and experience i think so look yes the degree portion is sometimes hard for but these companies right but what i'll tell you is that for example for me at this point i don't put my degree on the resume right right i've got i've got the experience the one year the one the first job experience at wherever i am right and then now it doesn't really matter what kind of it doesn't really matter what kind of experience what degree you have for you what i think is happening here is you're looking for the wrong jobs you're looking for you're looking for the wrong jobs so i think what you could do is yes you can start doing freelancing and you can you can go that route that is correct you should go that route and then um try to pursue that route right the second round that you should go through though is actually going to be is actually the route with one finding companies that are more so on the startup side because those companies give you a lot more freedom and those companies give you uh don't really care about about the degrees at all they give zero shits about that no i'm not kidding you i'm not they really don't care what degree you have or not they just want somebody to help them out and actually build stuff and on top of that you have a lot more leverage and a lot more freedom to build things that you want because your say has a lot in in that startup company's coming to you with yeah i need you to do for me exactly not oh you're just a part of the team exactly you're you're expendable even if that means that you wrote for free for a little bit like joseph you have to be open to that because i know you haven't worked for the past what i think you said six years or something right yeah you have to be open to even you know what hey guys i'll work for free for you for a little bit well i'm actually volunteering with inkscape right now beautiful so and they've already said you know they want to talk to me about an apprenticeship which is great and all but django is not my forte but i don't mind learning it and i'm open to giving up my time i'm okay with that yeah it's just i don't want to be taken advantage of yeah i get it i totally i totally get that and this is where this is where you learn how to set your boundaries and this is where you keep your options open because i still plan on finishing ul's boot camp for the five days i mean i still want to do it anyways yeah just more experience yeah and the homework gives me something to do yeah but how do you and i'm sure the other the other one in the zoom might see it as well but how do you avoid getting hit with uh learning a million things at once like for a lot of people who don't know programming html css javascript those are fundamentals yeah how do you not get sucked into we're gonna learn uh react we're gonna learn python we're gonna learn django we're gonna learn you focus on one you focus on one well it's but it's really not it's just discipline it's discipline well it's literally just discipline because joseph the thing is oh yeah if i was to give you tips i would give you a tip but the thing is like for example the tip for you would be like to find somebody who keeps you accountable may that be a mentor or somebody else cause somebody people do need for that right but it depends on how good you are with money like do you like for example if you can't spend money yourself and you can find a mentor that will keep you kind of make sure that you don't sway outside the box and that's maybe something you need even that's more or less like if you were to say hey joe i need a i need a html website by tomorrow morning at 11am you know and you you call me at 10 o'clock are you done yet or if i get stuck i can talk to you see that's what i'm looking for is more of a mentor but i haven't found anything i mean yeah i mean that's that's that's the hardest thing yes like without you trying to really talk about the opportunity of you know within how working or within clever programmer right which is that's what we do help our students with because i'm not trying to sell you on that that's part of one right though though you know like yes so we do offer that ability right of course especially as we get towards the end the boot camp we'll talk about that but yeah for those people who do need some little more discipline this is where you might need somebody somebody else's help right and if you think that you know what i can't afford somebody else's help then you just need to sit your butt down and write down things and just do it yeah that's that's that's a lot of people probably can relate to that yes honestly other than tutorial hell i'd say and maybe i'm wrong i'd say that's the hardest thing that really is the discipline this is this is where you know a mentor is so important and a structure right like for example when later on when we talk about the boot camp that we have for example you guys are able to potentially potentially join yes the thing that a lot of our students are requiring when they join is a structure right you right now go from the tour tutorial because there's a bunch of like tutorials and you know you don't really know what your structure is you don't have a problem roadmap am i right yep exactly yep so go ahead even with the boot camp it's still and i'm sure i think gavin's still in here and there's a few others that are in boot camps like flat iron or whatnot unfortunately even my own a lot of them were uh you're on your own pretty much that's unfortunate if you were like parttime basically you watch your videos you do this stuff on your own time and or or if you were fulltime you had to look up everything and it's all things you could have done without going to the boot camp yeah and that's where a lot of us are a lot of us grad your stuff no i get it i get it yeah this is where it you know you have to find the right opportunity and you're the right person to get you you just need to keep searching like well sorry sorry to bug you with a with a loaded question i'm sure everybody else has other questions yeah yeah no no it's not just more important no no no no other question is more important i think these are all good questions that definitely relate to a lot of people right i think you know the answer to this question is just simply like we just need to get started discipline get really disciplined and don't let yourself get swayed by other focuses right oh this is view just oh it's so good oh english is so good no if your focus is front development with javascript and react gs you stay focused on that and only that right if you find something exactly if you find something where you have a structure right a structure where they give you structure and you have to follow it follow that right so if you have the ability to invest yourself to do that do that right that's what i'm doing right now is i'm trying to sit down and uh like my wife would tell me is that i'm always doing what everybody else wants me to do and now i'm just going to sit down and do what i want to do become selfish yeah that's what she's basically saying be selfish and do the projects you want to do the way you want to do them yep exactly somebody will come along exactly and say hey i saw your projects what do you do i like that exactly that's it anyway i'll let you get back to the questions awesome joseph awesome thanks so thank you so much my friend okay i'll see you tomorrow yes see you tomorrow i love the npc okay all right well dude beautiful okay crush it again byebye all right awesome who's next guys who's next who was another question i think we had hi azam how you doing yo what's up yo what's up how are you doing my friend do you remember me from the last bootcamp i remember you how are you going awesome i actually completed my portfolio nice you did awesome sweet sweet sweet that's really cool do you have any questions for me my friend uh not really any questions okay can i should i drop the link in the chat you got your portfolio yeah drop the link in chat sure sure sure yeah is that trash firebase link gotcha gotcha oh good oh good yeah that's really cool i remember you from the last time that's really awesome we have a and how old are you again say get a song eight years old this guy has built so many products now at this point it's insane that's awesome that's awesome i love that did you drop did you drop the link or no yeah i'm i didn't drop it yet wait wait a second i just need to validate the link i'll go sorry i'll check everything before so see if it's right and i'll get to you guys and i'll get to all your questions as well guys okay and guys of course if you ever want a question of course feel free to raise your hand or put in the zoom chat if you if you have a question for me okay and i'll be able to get you and if you do have a question make sure your camera's turned on because i don't want to talk and i want to like you know it gets weird when you're just talking to a black box you know i dropped the link so it only goes to you so you'll have it in the chat i don't see it my friend oh it's like oh it's like that link okay let me see can i use that link you don't have to copy paste it in your browser let me see maybe we see you see it it's kind of there but it's also kind of broken so how does it look does it i think it's taking a while to load it's telling me how to load i mean i have like i have like a lightning fast computer so i i popped i popped over my brother boom i literally that's awesome that's awesome yeah for some reason i might have said that's not loading very much i don't know we might want to check that but yeah i want i think check that out and then and then we'll be able to get back to you next time okay but in the meantime just want to get to it anybody has a question okay yeah i even did algorithms like nice algorithm yeah then like i tried quick sort and then literally i i literally was just starting the loop and literally i filled yeah so the first thing i did was a bubble store algorithm in python and then i went on free code camp uhhuh i tried to and then it said told me you need to implement it in javascript i'm like oh my god i tried it i was like i was like this should work i i run the tests guess what only one of them all the touch pads nice that's awesome that's awesome that's awesome well keep trying okay keep keep working it okay my friend okay awesome good job azam keep doing keep do what you're doing i love it okay awesome who else has got another question guys okay let me see who's got back how are you doing my how are you doing back wait now hold on there's hold on i'm trying to click on it go ahead back you got it how do i what's wrong i can't hear you hello can you hear me yeah now you're good go ahead you can talk now i can barely i can barely hear you you got some weird sound like are you somewhere outside or no no oh now i can hear you there we go can you hear me now yeah i can hear you okay there we go it must have been my headphones okay it's so adorable do you need to know like ux ui design as a full stock developer do you need to no you really don't you don't you don't need that does not need to be your fullon priority um though as you start to build more applications you start to get much better at it because as a front developer you actually will be working a lot with with ui ux designers and so you will start to get a hunch of these ui ux designs right um and start to get more understanding like okay well this looks good and this looks good and this looks good um so most of the time what happens is you'll have a design in front of you and then you'll be able to ha and you'll have to know how to make it uh real basically on the web page does that make sense yeah awesome i've been like phoned a couple of things but i've not designed is just it's not my thing no don't worry about it if you focus on just taking any design and then building it you're good all right all right i like it i like it beautiful awesome nice question hector how are you doing how are you my friend hey uh i was wondering oh shoot what's up forgot my question it's all good happened come back to me in a bit all right all right all right all right i'll come back in a second here are you sure you can think about it for a second here no wait did you get it uh i remembered it last second okay so it are you if we get into the eight month program or would you help us find a job afterwards yes yes oh you would yep that that's what we do is we and we we actually partner up with uh with recruiting agencies to help you with that oh oh that's really nice all right yeah thank you make sense awesome awesome and what do you do right now hector uh right now i'm just saving up money to go to college i already graduated high school in 2020. nice but i have to take a gap year because i'm i'm not that rich so gosh i got you okay oh good i'm good and so you're not are you working anywhere right now or no at all i took a parttime job in order to save up money a little bit yeah nice that's good that's good that's good and so you know do you want to go fully to college or you kind of want to go a different route well i'm kind of exploring my options college is an option but again it's expensive so if i can find a way around that okay and just like get a job like straight up with that okay i'll take anything really all right awesome well i'm excited to have you here hopefully we'll see you in the boot camp okay thank you okay my friend good next question let's see who else got a question heber hi haber how are you doing wait wait there's so many people wait there we go add me to a spotlight too where am i where is nas did anybody see where i am okay thank you all right go ahead hubbard i can't hear you though no i can't hear you no change your microphone maybe no can't hear you can you guess here there we go nice awesome okay awesome sweet all right so i got a question so this um the five days that we're doing right so i'm also on your clever programming where i'm in front of the dashboard learning web development by building projects nice what do you think i should focus more on the five days or that or do i do it simultaneously as well wait what dashboard where are you at what do you mean um the clever programming site um um where it says uh learn web development by building oh there there no focus focus focus on focus on the 5day boot camp for now okay okay got it right and then of course and then later on you can focus on the learned uh by building projects okay cool so that's afterwards basically yeah right i mean you can i mean for some people they do it during they do it at the same time because like that learn development building projects has some good substance to it has really good like basic fundamentals you guys will get to learn right and so for example if you're waiting right now for tomorrow just go through a few videos and yes do them yeah yeah uh it looks interesting i already have um some um experience when it comes to that i actually took a boot camp literally a couple months ago really wasn't it wasn't quite what i was looking for why is that why is that um i just feel like it wasn't like it was the passion wasn't there but the instructor oh yeah yeah that that that's always that's always what gets you huh i felt like i was inside a college class yeah just lecturing but they weren't really answering the question gotcha yes giving this a go you know yeah i know are you currently working anywhere or no oh yeah i'm an assistant manager at olson so oh okay okay okay so your assistant manager and then why do you want to get to coding curious yeah it's always been my passion honestly really yeah creating something out of nothing i was a big tron fan i was younger trona fan that you said yeah tron have you seen the movie tron but the original i've seen the movie tron yeah yeah yeah so i was a big fan about that so that's something i always dreamed of doing and at the beginning when i first went to college because i dropped out of college i was majoring on life science my mother was a doctor in her country so it's something that i just wanted to do just to make it happen but that's my passion so just dropped out focus on what i'm working on right now and i told me i told myself that once i save money i'm going to go back to what i'm really passionate about i mean you can tell like i've been pranked out i love that i love the stuff behind your thing yeah so you know it's something that i really am looking forward to so i'm excited about this that's cool that's cool well i'm excited to have you here and then i'm sure you'll learn a lot of things here okay yeah yeah thank you man okay and i'll see you tomorrow 11am okay sure beautiful all right byebye all right next one who we got ma suhami is that right go ahead wait go ahead my friend hey guys hi how are you doing good doing how are you i'm fine uh i have a question that uh where can i deploy my website securely without paying any money uh netlify sorry can you natalify netflix i'll put in the chat okay so net le phi let me see i'll put you guys in the in the yeah another fight is going to be a good one for you guys okay thank you and the other question is if i join a 8month course then what i have to pay for that how much we'll talk more about that kind of uh you know we'll talk more about that on sunday for now so just stay focused on the bootcamp and then just take a look at kind of like if it's the right uh term for you okay um okay that's fine and if uh you told that that you guys will help us uh to get job after that good campaign but if uh i moved to canada or other country then are you guys still are you currently in usa or where are you at right now yes right now i'm in usa california but in 2022 i may be in canada maybe in canada okay so you might be in canada that doesn't matter that doesn't matter we we have students who are in london we have students who are in canada we have students who are in iran and we help them good to get jobs through there yeah yeah it doesn't matter as long as the most important thing is for to teach your skills and then and then the jobs will kind of kind of come through you i mean and of course through us by helping you um but yeah most important is going to be the skills that you get to learn and then of course we'll help you get the job and what do you what do you currently do uh i actually i'm an intern as a software developer in my startup company really yeah that's awesome and so and so like what do you do there like a front developer backing developer or what um the angular developer even using a file is for authentication and doing a google cloud for deploying websites that's cool that's cool that's awesome i'm just curious why did you think that you what was the goal to join like an eight month course what was the goal for that i want to become a full step developer okay and uh as i'm literally i i did a frontend developer for four months four years but i think it is just a few things to become a great it's not my career right i want to become a full tech developer front end it's nothing for me like i i'm thinking okay i like it yeah i think what you're doing right now is great is you start out with the front end and so like the next step for you to learn in the back is going to be like the back end so it's like to makes you like a fullon false developer so i think you're in a really good path uh and of course you already have a startup job which is great that's actually how i started at a startup company and then so the opportunity there at that point it's just pretty pretty amazing yeah but did you guys told in the uh in the class that javascript is very important yeah i think i'm still lagging in javascript even after having your four years of experience wow four years what are you doing here i'm just kidding just for friends gotcha still i'm thinking i'm not a pro in javascript i love it i love it that's awesome well i'm happy to have you you have an amazing smile and it looks like you have to make an amazing energy okay yeah just enjoy it be in the community and we'll see you tomorrow at 11 right beautiful awesome thank you all right next one go ahead and help me out with who's next let me see who else we got let me go here uh who's got yo dave dave go ahead dave dave leck let's see if we can spot feel free to unmute yourself go ahead hi david how you doing you had a question for me well i just wanted to say hello and enjoyed all your videos here and uh um learning a lot in full stack mastery beautiful beautiful what kind of project you're building right now um i'm still working on that project we talked about oh that project nice nice nice nice he's building a crossword plot no not a crossover is it critical what is it called crosstalk advanced connect advanced connect which is like a big crossword uh what's it called puzzle it's like a tic tac toe but you have to connect x amount of pieces in yeah in line it's built all in react but in the same sense it'll have chat and it allows up to like x amount of players and the person who creates that game will set the options and boundaries for that game that's awesome i love it i love it i love it that's really cool yeah i mean keep doing that we would love to see it in the boot camp at some point here or in this even in this koni bootcamp okay but at the same time i just got done with that hard part of postdeck mastery by the way no oh really yep let's go over to the we're over to the fun part now oh okay the react.js portion yep yeah yeah you just got done with the fundamentals that's awesome yeah for sure for sure yeah just so you guys know dave luck is actually in the full semester here but uh in the booth game here and uh yeah been developed for how many years now you are uh 20 10 years with the web but i am still learning a lot even as a experienced developer there's stuff in there that i haven't even heard of before that i'm learning about that's good i'm happy to hear that i'm happy to hear that awesome dave i'm gonna go give uh some other people who are even you know to ask questions okay but thank you so much for jumping on okay yep thank you dave bye bye all right who's next all right lewis how are you doing my friend hello hold on let me go ahead and let you unmute yourself go ahead my bad oh good good who are you doing good how are you yeah i'm doing well being in new york and uh you're in new york yeah i'm in queensland i'm actually about 60 minutes away from jfk oh they i love that okay okay okay awesome so what's your question my friend so i just had a quick question right because i i mean i did a lot of vmware support uh cisco uh domain deployment and support but never kind of worked on on the software side right software development on it so but that's always something that had me interested um so i'm kind of starting up right now so what are some of the things that uh i would need to kind of look at in order for me to uh get better at uh understanding and doing things yeah from scratch because that's one of the things like a lot of people uh doing projects from scratch it's a little bit of a problem but yeah i love baseball right and and we do have a site for the team but it's very basic and so one of the things that i was i wanted to do was basically look at code and basically update the site to look and feel better have better functionality and uh so so what are some of the things that uh i could do in order to improve myself uh you know to move forward okay good question good question so let me first ask you this question like why why do you want it back in to go into coding because when i brought you what did you say you were doing right now um i was doing a lot of uh vmware and do you work at a company do you work for a company right now uh no they all the jobs they move them out to either texas india or uk and i was not moving out there oh wow that's because i have family i mean i well i have one kid already out of college but my daughter still has two more years of college so i i opted to take a package instead so i wanted to do this because it gives me a lot more flexibility as far as where i can work with i can work from anywhere yeah i do something like this i love you know technology but this is something that i think anybody can do from anywhere it doesn't matter where you live right so it gives you more uh that time for you to spend with your family but also you know do the things that you like to do and that's something that i love to do that's right and it will give me a lot more freedom and you know i could just retire now but i can't just sit home uh you're antsy you're antsy you're like i can't say it i need something to do right so and that's something that's interesting and you know i love baseball and i wanted to kind of help the team to even improve the site nice how it looks and and you know start working on different projects moving forward okay but that's one of the things that i wanted to do and i want to get really good at it um i do have a lot of time on my hands so i can so one of the things i want is more or less have an idea what things i can i can focus on to to get better at it and move forward from there so so good question i think i think for you to number one is i think you're in a good place right now with for example even kind of being in this community right where we'll give you we will give you some structure around you know these next five days but after these next five days um i think if you're going to focus on the front end for example then yes you want to focus on for example these technologies like like html like css and javascript most importantly what you want to focus on is learning those kind of fundamental parts of the coding portion right so you kind of want to get yourself really really good with you know different types of you know problems that you that come with you know with coding right now the question might be okay where do i see those problems or where did i get those problems right a few things the way you get those problems is actually by for example just kind of how you said looking at the project that you had which is your baseball project right and actually looking to fix it right and figure out how to do it you know like this the learning process here is almost like have havoc a little bit here sometimes you know sometimes it's not doesn't have to be so structured it doesn't have to be so point by point by point instead it's sometimes can be more on the side of okay i have a problem ahead of me let's figure out what how do i get how do i solve it so for example yeah go ahead no no go ahead so so for example in your case if you for example have a website in front of you and you're like okay well i'm gonna update it here's my process how would you i would look like edit like that i would say okay so how do i want to update how do i want to update my site so the first question i'll ask myself how do i want to update my site right and i will literally draw out things that i want to change to it i will draw or literally take a piece of paper now draw it out in terms of how do i want it to change how do i want it to look like okay right so that'll be the first step i would take okay that gives me some visual around what needs to happen okay then the second thing that i would do after that point is okay so i've got that visual now at this point i would actually i don't know where your site is for example loaded my goal next goal would be okay how can i get a hold of that site and how can i get a hold of that code right instead of my next task okay so my next step is like okay well i've got this website that's currently there where can i see the code that's your task number two my test number three at that point okay great so now do i have that what do i need to do where in the code or how do i need to change it up in terms of the code on the coding portion now this is where you might be stuck am i right yes okay so now at this point where okay you have to there's two steps the first step is that you just kind of divide your little problem into small pieces and you think and you ask yourself the questions okay okay let's just say you need to change the header right you figure out okay how do i change the header in a website so you go to google okay creating a header and a website you type in creating header for a website and you start to see code you start to see people doing different types of headers right right right you start to see different examples and you implement that right that's your first pathway so kind of like more so backtracking right you have the problem or you're trying to go backtrack from it the second pathway is okay i see what i need to do i'm going to give it a pause and instead i'm going to learn some basic things around coding so maybe i would go to free code camp and i'll learn some basic html some basic css and some basic javascript okay because there are pathways to that right and then at that point what i might do is maybe after that what i might do also is maybe i might at the same time i might join a five day coding bootcamp which you are in right now and so now i'm going to try and apply those skills to my html css skills to javascript right right i'll now learn how to create a simple website or apply those skills sorry apply those skills to the website not javascript but go to the website so now maybe you'll learn how to build a few projects with me right now it's time to apply that knowledge towards other things by yourself i gotcha and so that's the process i would take make sense thank you that makes sense makes sense thanks thanks a lot for the uh the explanation i think you know putting a big problem into into small pieces yeah it is uh it becomes easier to um actually uh correct 100 100 literally just like whenever i one of the biggest things that i know as a good developer that uh like my strength my strength as a developer is being able to take a big plot problem and then split up into multiple pieces thank you that's a lot of people are struggling with guys a lot of you people on zoom right now on youtube that's your struggle right but that's actually a biggest game changer for any developer like i have managers who would come to me like jonas can you come you know can you come into the room because there's a bunch of these you know uh business people and and even developers and nobody knows how to solve something that's because you guys are looking too much from a higher point of view and this is one humongous problem it's like for example if you were to build a building if you're building a building and all you saw was just a huge building you need to build people like holy how am i supposed to do this true but versus if you were to build a building you you start out from okay well let's first build the structure of the building the foundation be beside behind the layer last time build the beams okay then let's go ahead and build the walls around it right and then we can build the things on the inside right so like it's it becomes a lot easier right right so that's i want to think of this that's how you think of coding as well cool cool awesome lewis thank you much okay awesome louis well i'll see you tomorrow at 11am psc okay indeed we'll be there okay byebye have a good day byebye thanks next up let's see uh alex go ahead what's up nice little bit over facebook all right man all right oh yeah alex alex bishop as a right yeah hey let's go okay awesome man so i got some questions and i know uh we can't cover everything in five days obviously of course not are we going to go over like algorithms and uh algorithms and uh like database stuff and stuff like that or so yes we will call it that's going to be in like the we will cover databases so the data structures that's an eight month course okay but we will cover some databases because again it's really hard to just to cover all of that in these these next few these next five you know these next four days you know or even the three days of coding it's really hard to do that um right but we will cover like for example data structures like arrays and objects and we will cover databases like firebase as well it's cool makes sense and then yeah so most importantly i think you'll just see the possibilities that you can have with coding and then you'll be able to actually build something fully by yourself as well to be like oh i can actually do this you know what i mean so you kind of you kind of you kind of see in the big picture and then we'll step back and be like okay let's make this big picture so solid and let's start building those building blocks one by one sounds good man sounds good sounds good to me awesome where you where are you from alex i'm in jersey you're in jersey really well so many people from new york and new jersey i don't know what what are you guys all doing here i understand like so many students are from that from that side you know yeah man yeah man all right you know we're all trying to make it over there and what are you currently doing how it's going jacob what are you currently doing i'm a volunteer firefighter and i uh oh yeah that's right yeah you're a firefighter right and so you want to eat why did you want to switch the career uh it's dangerous work for one um two like it like i said before like it's not really thoughtprovoking work it's kind of just like you do the same thing over and over uh you are solving problems but you know it's kind of like it's in a different sense and yeah you know i i kind of prefer this kind of stuff um you know i've tried to do my own like small projects and stuff like that gotcha and uh yeah man it's pretty that's cool so so what was the what's the reason now to get into coding um well like i said i like to build my own projects uh i have like a lot of ideas um i'm also uh an entrepreneur like i run like a stock market group oh no way really yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm going to stock market as well oh okay yeah cool yeah one thing to make a lot of money is uh algorithmic platforms oh i just said you know um that are like even you buy and sell signals like something i want to build on my own because you get a quote from some of these places they're charging you like 25 000 for a project like that you're kidding really yeah man yeah it's expensive so uh yeah that's basically kind of what what i'm looking at like my own like my own projects and working you know fulltime job so that's awesome that's sweet oh well you know i'm pumped to have you here you know i think it's really cool that you're doing this the fact that you're putting the time into it and you're working hard towards it i'm excited to see what you do in these next three days give it your all and show me what you got serious awesome all right alex i'll see you tomorrow at 11 okay see you then okay byebye okay next up let me see uh let's see let's see raising your hand for quite a while now go ahead hey how you doing doing good how are you my friend i'm good i'm good but wait guys as you as you guys come up just uh say where you're from and then say your question okay go ahead okay so i leave in um elgin illinois like chicago area okay yeah so um i'm a college student uh community college uh um like i wanna i wanna get a bachelor's degree in computer science but i currently work out of where so like i i don't really like it and uh wait hold on hold on hold on hold on uh how do i remove share screen thank you okay thank you all right go ahead abe yeah like i said um i currently work at a warehouse and i don't really like it and uh towards the fall semester i want to i don't want to work at a warehouse anymore probably do like some freelancing so i could focus more on school because i have like a sponsorship right now for school so well i just need sponsorship from where sponsorship from where oh i have uh i have someone from my um because i'm muslim so like there's a man at my masjid and my musk was trying to sponsor me for school so uh but i need time like to study so i don't want to like spend because i work eight hours so i don't want to do that anymore so i've been i've been studying on my own i i think i'm pretty good at html and css but like the javascript is just giving me like a little bit yeah this is this is and then it's okay so okay awesome so what's your question what do you want to know so first of all is like this homeworks like so according to what uh is it cassie was saying yeah like all we just have to do is change the the picture and um and uh and and like the skill right yeah the skills and the picture and any other information that pertain more so to you oh okay and another thing is like with this with this five because i'm just trying to get some practice in okay you know maybe maybe see if i could understand javascript more because i'm currently learning from like a book okay this book right here it's not a bad book actually yeah like it's it's pretty good and but but it's boring i i'm kind of and another thing is i'm kind of scared like i don't know should i say scared or i'm like maybe when i'm done i might not be there or when i'm done with the book because i already finished up to like almost 400 pages but then it's like i don't know i'm trying to get some practice in with you guys so i don't know do you think i'm gonna be like okay with this by by this five days like if i put into work and then get some practice in or let me ask this question right so it's what you're looking for is just permission right do you believe that you'll you'll learn or that you will be okay uh that's the thing i don't know i think i think if i put in more work like if i put in a lot of work yeah like nothing is impossible of course there you go there's your answer does your answer there really my friend yes at the end these five days you will have three projects all they're going to use html css and javascript and so yes of course you'll be a lot better but it doesn't stop there right well a lot you got a lot of you guys need to understand is it's is that you cannot um you cannot rely on html css somebody calling what is this what's the name that's not me it's not you okay at the time please record your message and if that's recording press one for more options so um but yeah i think html css should not be your focus right now yeah i know that's what i'm saying like javascript is where i'm having like problems so i'm guessing if i could like get some things from this 5d well yes of course plus did you get the free course that we have if you when you join or no uh no so we basically when you join we get a you get a 11hour course that that's that's part of it as well right so if you don't i think are you in our texting community uh texan yeah i think i got a message from you get a message okay awesome so make sure there and just say hey can i get the course as well um okay my most important thing for you guys is going to be the following you you need to take every single project that we currently give you and modify it and then learn how to modify it right right your yes you'll build three projects but it's not gonna stop there that's not the only thing you need to do then you need to go back and learn the fundamentals and start doing projects for yourself so one of the biggest things that i think you can do after this korean boot camp right is actually going to be to is actually going to be hey you know what um let me think of a project that i can build by myself like what's a project that can help other people that you have always wanted to do any idea potentially have i mean i was thinking of getting like a website for my barber i just for who for my barber for your barber i get my yeah bro there you go no that's perfect go up to your barber and say hey you know what i got i'm learning how to code can i build a website for you like how much purpose would that give you yeah i'm just yeah i'm trying to get something real you know what i'm saying and if i could get from there maybe just like i know a couple restaurants around me that don't have a website as well and i was just looking up something and it says like just just make it for him and just tell him you know what i'm saying so i don't know be like yo you know i'll get give me some free haircuts and i'll build your website you know okay so i also i also heard like uh i think one of the guys you spoke to i forgot his name he was talking about something and then you told him to like pause for a little bit and then focus more on this fiveday coding bootcamp is that is that the 11hour course you were talking yeah that's the one i was talking about yeah oh okay okay okay oh did you say like i would get a text or what do i have yeah just text us the number that we texted you text says hey can i get access to the course okay okay thank you thanks a lot awesome that's my question i really appreciate like i'm really pumped i really want to get into this that's awesome i'm watching you guys video even with uh with the other guy from the uk i forgot his name uh sunny um yeah sunny i watch his videos as well i don't put along but usually like when i'm at work i'm just thinking about it and just watching these videos well i want to make sure guys don't it's not just about the watching just co actually do code along okay very important no matter who you're watching him or us or any other channel code along right because you can't drive a car but listening how to drive a car you can't learn how to drive a car if you just listen if somebody tells you okay now you gotta turn the wheel you know to left like it doesn't work that way you know like that's because i'm focusing more on the book and i just watch that while i'm at work or something just to engage my mind but you know i don't want to be all around the place like that's good that's good that's good too so if you're focusing on that book then focus on the book yeah if that's good too i see what you mean if you're focused on the book then yeah focus on the book and then of course you know you can sway a little bit for example if you're on this fiveday coding bootcamp where you're learning javascript html css it's a good avenue because you're now going way too far i lost the book right now i'm gonna i'm gonna put the book away for now okay i feel i have a good feeling about this to be honest good awesome well well let's see what you got i'm really excited for you to build these next three projects and just have fun and i'll i'll see what you got for the for the projects and how your skills are okay awesome okay have a good day i'll see you tomorrow at 11am okay all right next question neo hi again uh so i was just wondering i was looking at the facebook group i can't find the post for where we're submitting so amanov a month who's actually in here he's gonna as soon as we get off this call he's gonna he's gonna make the post okay okay awesome to submit it it's on uh air air table so there will be a link you guys will submit the link to there and then you guys will also post it as a facebook comment okay so there will be a post so and then in that facebook account just uh make it make a facebook come underneath that post okay guys okay make sense um so and then uh so the link to air table will also be on facebook right yes okay perfect yes awesome cool all right next up we have joseph hi joseph how you doing doing good how are you good good i'm from california oh no way okay let's go california i have like one question um okay do we have to use you guys project a portfolio project if you already have one mate cause i've been coding bootcamp right now no it's fine that's fine no it's fine if you if you have another portfolio just use that one it's all just for anybody who doesn't have a portfolio okay yeah that was the only cool question awesome sweet and what how how long you been cutting now um since march well i started in 2019 but i stopped cuz that kid and then um i started this bootcamp in march and then i had to graduate from the front end next month and then back in august oh dang that's sweet that's weird that's sweet and so what do you currently do all right now just i'm getting unemployment so i just like every day i'm coding for like 15 hours a day you know hey that's what i'm talking about i'm staying busy that's good and what are you like what do you know so far um i know bootstrap react uh react native um do you know javascript oh yeah javascript yeah okay i'm like yes you jump you jump like you know okay i still wanna you know progress in javascript because like like the promises are kind of tricky a little bit mmhmm so what else what else is tricky for you i'm just curious like what what else do you know for example did crazy data structures like linked lists and stacks and queues uh no see they didn't go over that everything would just be like from free code camp or like something else i'm doing stuff like that if i told you about the project joseph from scratch can you build it um i might be able to okay in advance yeah yeah focus on that okay joseph focus on that okay don't get too caught up in the fancy fancy react.js react native stuff you shouldn't even be doing regulator right now i don't really like reactivated yeah i don't like it at all you shouldn't even be doing it you you honestly should be focusing more so on the fundamentals and actually building stuff for yourself yeah i've been building i built a a weather app by myself and uh okay on todo list all through react nice and right now i'm working like on an informational website react nice and you're selected and you fully came up with this with the idea and you fully put them over yourself and you're just copying good that's awesome yeah it's good good good yeah and that gives you a good track good okay okay yeah awesome any other questions for me um i'm probably looking to get in the into the eight month uh boot camp as well i want to keep going you know keep going i love that i love that awesome well we'll see you throughout these next four days and yeah

wow wow yeah okay nice yeah yeah i appreciate it yeah you got him a friend what are you where are you currently at where are you from um from toronto toronto all day and then what do you currently do uh right now i'm just um like working at a warehouse i'm just trying to like it's not really a career you know it's just kind of to get by but my main focus right now is to get into this um web development gotcha gotcha and then why why so i'm curious why so um i've been like uh ever since 2019 i kind of like i i found out about like qazi and i've been like seeing the python videos and stuff and just like just seeing how that's where the world's going right now like with the future like everything's kind of going on the web and like especially with like this corona stuff like everyone's working from home so it's just like i feel like it's like one of the most valuable skills to like you know for the for the present and the future right now right do you like let me ask you this like so okay so it's it's good for the future like do you enjoy it yeah like i enjoy like um because i spend a lot of time on the computer anyway so uhhuh it's like um like i like the like creative aspect of it where it's like you know you could use your imagination and like kind of just um like put put your thoughts onto like a computer basically into action pretty much okay that's cool that's awesome well i'm happy to have you here hope you enjoy these next these next four days and build some amazing projects my friend okay definitely definitely thank you all right and i can see you tomorrow 11 and pst okay sounds good all right sweet all right next one let's see holly hi holly hi hi how are you doing hello um good um yeah um i'm from melbourne australia australia no way yeah my actual my coach is from australia actually okay go ahead um so yeah my questions is like um i i feel like all the information is um on the facebook group and i've been like trying to join for quite a couple of times and i don't know why it's not been approved then you mentioned um i think with hobby previously okay the text message as well okay i tried to send text messages like i don't get any response either okay is it is it because i sent from an office's number not a us number i don't i don't know honestly but yeah if you're in the facebook group amano can you help out and just approve holly that'll be great yeah yeah because i'm just like there's a lot of information in the group and kind of missing out with whatever yeah yeah she has been doing because i think that's gonna be the main channel okay okay awesome yeah definitely yeah i think we'll be able to help you out i just will prove you okay okay great awesome any other questions um maybe it's just about the javascript um is that any particular like like i know there's a lot of kind of javascript so which one that we go to it like hidden first and what's gonna be like the next one i think i think for you the most important thing is i just focus just on the first javascript just like a javascript itself html css the other stuff like regis just keep that on the focus for later okay okay and molly holly what do you what do you currently do i'm actually a python developer wait what yeah i'm a python developer but you know python when we do front end stuff we just for me myself i just use like a ginger template so i'd like to upskill myself okay um for javascript skill so you know i can i can be like a truly full stack okay and so do you currently have a job as a python developer yeah i work fulltime so i kind of like challenged myself to try to join with this one i know you guys face in your ass when we started it was like 4 00 am here so i try like okay i'll wake up early for the next one i can make it work um right but then another thing the good thing is because you guys like at the other side of the world like it's not within my working hour yeah yeah yeah that's true after we finish this call i'll jump right into my my my work as well but luckily like my work is fully remote so it's good i guess i just need to manage my time awesome well well i'm excited to have you here to build some projects okay yeah awesome holly thank you so much we'll have a good day i'll see you tomorrow 11 a.m okay yeah byebye cheers awesome up next who else we got we got robbie go ahead wait aren't you charles wait wait that's robbie never mind robbie hi hi robbie hey how's it going uh i'm from florida uh i have a just a couple quick questions about the uh the eighth month uh boot camp okay um eight months is obviously a lot of time yes uh it's six to eight months okay cool is that something that you need to like dedicate like fulltime hours to like go to is it like a 40hour kind of week kind of thing how does it work so uh for the for that one basically no you don't you do not need to dedicate uh 40 hours uh actually about 80 of our current students have a fulltime job and so you probably will be dedicated time basically about 20 hours of work a week and it's mostly time after your work so do you currently have a fulltime job right now yeah i work fulltime and i'm i'm technically working now you're working where what's your current job i do tech support tax support oh yeah okay i remember that yeah that's right um so yeah like for example for example our coaching calls that in this the the six to eight months boot camp the goal is for students who are people who currently have have a job right so the goal for that will be you'll be joining coaching calls after 5 pm pst which what time zone are you in eastern eastern so your time will actually be 8 p.m okay and it's about like you'll be having around four coaching calls a week okay okay okay does that make sense yeah that makes sense my only other question was i see that there is financing available which is fantastic do you guys also take like fafsa or any kind of federal aid we don't do unfortunately we don't i wish we did you know but no boot camp is able to do that because they're not like university you know for the university so uh we just kind of you know we just kind of teach you the things that you should learn that's it you know so yeah yeah gotcha well that was it for me i appreciate it awesome thank you robbie have yourself a good ever so good day and we'll see you tomorrow right yes sir i'll be there all right awesome we'll see you tomorrow all right next up let me see who's next who's next uh any other anybody had any questions any questions uh let me see let me see keep going keep going all right cool cool cool cool we have we have ahmed how are you doing my friend hello hello oh yo wait no hold on what you want i'll call you on your next okay you're on ahmed hi hi almond how are you doing how's everything uh just i have to ask you first uh am i allowed at this video call because um uh actually i'm from lebanon and i had to turn on the vpn so oh yeah i know i know i know how that works out yeah yeah i get it okay hello oh no am i am i allowed or should i leave no you're allowed why because the zoom is not letting me letting me in oh really really no it's all good just stay on it's fine okay and uh i was very excited i i submitted like to the facebook group like for five uh for four to five times and uh unfortunately i'm not getting accepted okay okay well uh i think maybe uh um can help us out okay okay um my first question is i really want to know what's my what's my what's my level like i the the main the main purpose for getting me in in javascript is i i like very much to solve problems and one of the problems that i solved is that i i did i did a tool that evaluate all the courses in in my university because the the university i'm in can't let you show your grades in in your courses unless you evaluate all the courses really yes and to evaluate all the courses it takes a lot a lot a lot of time wow that's crazy i like like like imagine you're registered for eight courses and you have to evaluate all the courses too to see your grades that's not fair yeah that's crazy i i i made a tool uh that that makes you evaluate all the courses in like seconds like if you if you don't like the course you you registered just like but number one and the javascript will evaluate all the courses when the instructors know i know about it they said what did you do what did you do with the with the system i didn't do anything the chrome just did google chrome that's funny they thought like i i just want to know what what's my level um i i did i did i did like five to six to six to six projects um one of the one with john so look your level your level is still junior level but you're on a good junior level so you're a good junior level developer right now you'll become more advanced as you actually work at a company okay okay great okay got it so right now you're junior level but you've got some really solid knowledge and so for you getting the job we wouldn't be that bad uh okay uh i'm uh i'm a computer science undergraduate i uh i still have like one year until i graduate okay that's fine that's fine yeah that's fine i mean just keep searching for job and so forth okay okay great like uh if i if i go on with your course like the eight months the eight months course i'm in lebanon um how can i get how can i benefit from it like of course it can benefit i can benefit a lot from its knowledge but how can i get like jobs abroad abroad well okay so for one thing is abroad jobs is is i know for example you know it might be harder for you for example because you're in different country right here's what i'll tell you though right is nowadays because because of the internet right because of what you know it's really just comes down to your skills right a lot of companies are searching for remote work you know and even for example right now temporarily you try to do freelance work which you still can right no matter where you're from you can find those jobs you see what i mean and for there are a lot of companies who are just hiring you know outside outside for example people people you know uh you know from other countries right doesn't really matter as long as you have good skills but i i know it's i know unfortunately the way the world is is it is harder for those who are outside like us or outside you know these these countries and i totally get it and i wish it was different um i think in your terms it's just going to be basically you trying even harder to get those to get jobs as freelancing jobs just to get jobs even in either in your country or to get jobs that are remote work you know in other countries does that make sense yes should i focus a lot like on linkedin yes of course focus on linkedin most importantly focus on building your skills on building my skills and do you think i should go through a tutorial once and i should go i should go on my own yeah the building projects 100 100 building projects and then at that point start doing linkedin and then you should be doing like some freelance work right now as well create a uh create your own portfolio on freelancer or somewhere else and start start doing a work through there okay okay thank you okay awesome thank you ahmed have yourself a good day we'll see you tomorrow at 11 okay all right awesome okay okay cool cool sweet next one yolan hi ewan how are you doing hi i'm doing good okay you had a question for me where are you from yes um canada oh a lot of you are from canada hey let's go canada oh canada go ahead i can't hear you you're muted i think you muted your mic no i can't hear my friend something happened where your headphones just got screwed up sorry i can't hear you know no can't hear you all good how about this just come back in a second here okay fix your microphone and the media will take someone else neal yeah another question neil a lot of questions huh yeah well i wanted to ask you i see that uh music hardware in the background are you a music producer this yeah well or maybe that's not me i'm a parttime dj parttime developer now i'm just kidding well no it's because like for example when i coach or when i do these live calls right i do these things right and i control this and i did we have podcasts of course and so it allows me to do a lot of controlling a lot of that stuff but if i say that the funniest say do i do this right or if i for example you know what i do like podcasts hey what's up everybody hope you guys are in the mail this is nas and today we are having a coding show on clubhouse let's go and get started right so it's like it's yeah it's basically allows me to do a lot of youtube stuff and uh just have fun with it that's awesome what's that thing called it's called road caster pro okay yeah road caster pro check it out it's really really cool it's like you can do podcasts and it's kind of connected to your computer it's a lot of fun i love it that's sick awesome cool neil is that your correction cool awesome right next up uh derek go ahead hi derek how are you doing my friend hold on um hear me now yeah yeah i can hear you what's up wow man this cp team is so awesome the whole team rafi sonny all y'all but what's cool um i learned the um algorithms back in the early the early 1980s from a book called c brian kernerjee and dennis ritchie okay you learned uh linked lists um the bubble sort oh the good stuff huh so i've been out of programming then i got into basic i made the pacman game in 1983. nice i love it uhhuh right then i got no hardware i was doing i'm right now fix computers right now but um i've been doing javascript websites for 20 years whoa a lot right i mean from the php to the asp to java um uh my sql database but the question was concerning databasing i've watched you and um sonny and y'all um uh qazi on the back end using firebase i heard about google firebase well actually um i got an angular a little while ago but i got out of angular it was too too hectic at the angular angle okay okay but when i seen you what guys um do react i fell in love with react nice because i'm a job a javascript neck i like nice but for the databasing um could you recommend or not i mean not recommend the mongodb on the back end and also what about the um node server with um express is that relevant right now because i see you build some sites without node and express and uh mongodb i mean i guess firebase has everything right for the back end backing packing services right yeah well let me ask that question really simple yeah mongodb and node are very very popular languages and frameworks and you should learn them period right yep we use fibers because it's also very easy right and it's very simple and it gets the point across but like it or not mongodb and you know mongodb and for example and node.js if you look at indeed.com if you look at the jobs and what they're looking for they're still one of the most popular jobs like they still very much need it wow great great great great got it and where are you from dave where you from by the way i'm not from um d.c oh dc washington d.c nice next connections capital right very nice and one other quick question um um um your your course coming up for the eight months course yeah um how can you uh er er enroll to the course i mean like so how do you how can your roles are very easy right basically this is like this is going to be your test these next few days so on sunday you guys will get the chance to enroll and apply okay great there's an application process and then we go through the application process and we see you know not everybody gets in right but we go to the application process and basically and then we we see kind of how you guys do and so forth and then and then we kind of let you uh come in okay great great sounds good sounds great okay awesome my friend okay cool and then so what do you currently have a job or you currently work or not right now i got my own business i do computer i'm an it net where i do computer repairs nice i build websites i mean basic websites i mean many front end not not too much back in but you know um and that's basically it you know nice and what and what and what's your goal and what's your goal with what's your goal with coding i guess or with full stack development well basically i'm trying to get into react so i can do the four stack but um eventually i want to get into mobile app development nice i did start off with native script but if you know about uh a native script um mobile app development it's kind of like a hybrid similar to react native and everything right a lot of javascript mmhmm i gotcha i know i was talking about okay right right so i guess i'm trying to get into mobile app development probably by next by 2022. okay okay dang that's awesome that's awesome i mean yeah there's this world is very much is going very high on the mobile development side and there's a lot of demand for it as well now with the mobile apps um you know there's two platforms apple and android yes and on one side you have java that is what it is swift right right right swift right but what about the react native it's more of a hybrid between both of them so react react native react natively uses javascript to basically create both for both android and for ios so yes right now there's a lot of possibilities around it for example there's other applications that are actually built with react native like i don't know if you guys know but the tesla application which i even have on my side right that itself is like built with react native wow yeah amazing amazing yeah so so definitely definitely look uh look into that one and then um there's just there's a lot of possibilities and it's because josh is becoming so so so much more um popular right it's getting a lot a lot stronger as well and so that actually allows us that allows these these you know you know uh what's it called devices to actually run them and so at some point i definitely foresee a future where all your apps are actually built in javascript right i mean a javascript is everywhere i mean anytime you have a web it's everywhere yeah exactly exactly right so and one last question i guess your course i missed your course last year i was very busy the profit with javascript okay i mean it's um that course are still available is it what the javascript yeah it's still available it's still available 100 so how can we find um i found that link um on your page go to go to cleverprogram.com and there will be a link over there okay great okay good okay just scroll down and then i mean amanda thank you if you could put the link down in the in the chat that'll be great okay great sounds good nice awesome thank you derek cp number one thank you let's go awesome guys hey saeed i like it guys with this one guys this has been a lot a lot a lot of fun guys um there's a lot of q a you guys love these q and a sessions yeah a lot of q and a sessions no hi get a question and one last question yeah what's the question but um make sure to unmute yourself okay okay can you hear me yeah i can hear you i have a disability and i haven't worked for 20 years okay how will i get hooked up with um not an internship but an apprenticeship so how do you open the apprenticeship um well that really depends on like what you're looking for so i think in your case it will actually be for example it'll just be contacting companies honestly like content companies like for example content companies and there's it just asks if you can do an internship with them internship or an apprenticeship like for you either through that or a lot of are you anywhere near for example a college campus yeah yeah a lot of accomplished campuses here have like those career what's it called those career um career days right you know what i'm talking about yeah everything yeah i wish college college campus has a career day definitely go the career day and see if you can throw potentially if you can just if you could just start to network with people most importantly back what you need to do right now is start networking may that be through online or on purpose or in person without with other people um in the development community okay okay check out meetups.com meetups.com no one down here involving you're in kentucky well there's right now medium.com with online online videos.com so you can you can meet people online huh not even online but i guess i could do it myself yeah yeah even online like meetups.com yeah like go to meetups.com and then actually find meetups in san francisco but they are online hey let's go by the way but yes awesome okay do that okay that's awesome awesome thank you one more quick one yeah what's up like the fundamentals of javascript right i got html css the next step would be javascript yes that's the most important one that's the most important one along with a lot of others yes all right got it i like your energy back all right awesome guys at that point that's pretty much it from me for those of you on youtube guys thank you so wait thank you so much for watching those are on youtube wait what's up one more one more okay you on okay go ahead you want can you help me yourself now hold on let me let me let me show you hold on let me get your mute go ahead i knew yourself hello yes go ahead hi um i just wanted to ask what i should learn next because i have learned html css and javascript i also learned react and i don't know like what's the next step so i want to know what i should learn next to become like a full stack how old are you right now oh i'm 12. i like it so look you don't need to learn more things next what you should be doing right now is building more projects okay okay forget just practice what you pre what you learn right now with react.js with javascript and actually like like let me ask you a question like why are you encoding um i'm coding because it's it's fun i like doing it and also yeah i really like doing it and it's fun that's good so how about this how about you build some fun projects have fun with it okay okay build some fun projects and then let's see what that leads you maybe that will lead to something else who knows maybe that'll lead to machine learning who knows but but build some fun projects and then just keep exploring you at the age of 12 those of you guys are eight years old 12 years old you guys are in the perfect phase you guys are living your parents home you don't have to pay for anything you get food thrown at you right you know what i mean so like enjoy this time and honestly just have fun and build some amazing projects by yourself fully and like
