what's up guys this is Kazi from clever programmer comm hopefully this is working we'll find out shortly capture device alright can I fix the screen size okay alright hey guys what's up so hopefully this chat is working I can see the chat I can speak with you guys wow the the caption is working alive I think I just saw that the caption is working live what's up Ali's in what is a polo Yasin what is up mic Matich what is up Richard hello hello everyone this is really great Cinna gaming hub O'Day what's up Fahim err font Thank You gaming hub hi so yeah one of the things that I want to figure out is what type of content do you guys want to see on this channel more of and I just wanted to have like a openended discussion because I don't think I've ever really done that before and I also love connecting with everybody from this platform if there is anybody who wants to message me on IG I would love to get on a live video call with you so you guys can like message me directly on my Instagram which is clever cause II and that way I can actually do even a live Q&A so if you have a question for me it's almost like how Gary Vee or somebody would just have a Q&A segment this way I can't actually speak with you directly which would be super super cool because YouTube doesn't allow me to speak directly with you alright Mike says watching from Michigan cool Tanvir we need your life story make videos in selenium automation using Python okay that's great I can do something along those lines because the the problem that's happening is I like I like coding I'm not spending a lot of time coding anymore most of my time is actually spent sharing freelancing knowledge with people software development like that's actually the stuff that I really enjoy doing I still like coding but because I have to run clever programmer make content for you guys work with Aaron and Frankie and Rachel and the whole team in general it makes it really tough for me to find time to code and if I find time to code for myself then it's really hard to then also make content for you guys and what would help you the most because I also think about it like this yes I can make content on technical coding but then I'm also not sure how much that helps you because there's so much technical training out there online like there's you to me there's Udacity there's Pluralsight there's Coursera there's team treehouse it's like millions of resources with technical trainings but I feel like a lot of people are not talking about how freelancing works and how you can actually use Craigslist or how can you use platforms likewise ant or people per hour or code mentor so those are some of the things that I'm thinking about and that's kind of those are the kind of the things I want to have a discussion around give me one second guys Aaron is here from the camera to see if we get any good clips okay easy okay I'm gonna check IG guys I'm gonna check my Instagram my Instagram is clever cause II clever cause II that's my Instagram so if anybody wants a video call with me you can message me there right now and okay yeah because if you message me here then we can actually even get on a call all right let's see what's going on how do you get coaching clients online so that's a really great question just please be a little bit careful that's a really great question there are a lot of online platforms so for example I'll just share my screen with you guys there we go so you could go to platforms like Craigslist okay or you could go to platforms like wise aunt okay this is this is where everybody from India complains that they don't have why is that in their country so just find the equivalent like people per hour as an equivalent or code mentor IO as an equivalent or up work works for you like it works for everyone Fiverr works for everyone Fiverr com okay so before you're from another country and you start complaining which is my least favorite part of any piece of content that I make I always get complaints from Pakistan India Russia that doesn't work in our country yes just Google like its equivalent so whatever is the equivalent networks right so here Fiverr will work for you as well probably Craigslist works for you but if you're in the u.s. you should use something like wisent and you will get so many people from here like if I go to and I type in Python and I click get help you will see people charging seventy five dollars an hour forty dollars an hour Alexander's charging fifty nine Jeff for charging fifty Jeanne Benoit who I have actually worked with he's my facebook friend as well he charges hundred and sixty dollars an hour so really it stretches from 35 260 to beyond and you can be you can have like three to six months of experience and you can jump on this platform and be charging thirty five to fifty an hour you don't need twenty of experience like if I have 20 years of experience I'd be charging two to three hundred dollars an hour and you could charge that there's just some people choose to charge a little bit lower but like you know thirty an hour so wise aunt is a great platform take lessons is another great platform has a pretty good platform to yeah just between wise and and take lessons like I skills my income to like eighty to ninety thousand dollars a year like these two platforms literally these two and then you add in Craigslist into the mix and then you go next level so really like there are a lot of these platforms let's just do the marketing for you for you to teach somebody coding or for you to actually yeah for you to teach somebody coding or you could take it to the next level meaning you can do freelancing here as well let me go back and stop that and jump back on okay let's see what is happening so that hopefully answers your question technical Faraz be motivated says I'm a JavaScript developer should I join this course this course is a lot about freelancing like I know it's called earn 1k wit Python but there's actually there's a little bit of technical training but honestly mostly is how to freelance so that's really the main thing so if you are interested in freelancing then join this course if you're not interested in freelancing then no don't join this course rushing off says do we need prior Python skills foreign one Cawood Python you don't it like helps you build on the whether you're beginner or intermediate or advanced it's just focus on the soft skills for freelancing okay I did yes because then only you can give services to your clients cool easy says yes apart from why is going to take lessons because they're not for foreigners oh yeah he's so sweet there you go there you go cool Aegeus says you're also freelancer or not so yeah I'm a freelance I was a freelancer now am I pretty much run a business but you have to think about what makes a freelancer good it's to be able to get and retain clients so I used to have one client two clients at a time for clients 15 clients now that I'm running an online business I have over 3,600 3,600 clients or 3,600 Plus customers so now I'm able to take that freelancing skill and scale it across and that's what you know I'm doing in my business want a video call with you what to include in bio and on these platforms in bio you can include really it it depends like on to you so for example I have students from clever programmer so I'll just I'll share with you guys some of their profiles okay all right so here we go I will share my screen cool all right so here I have the student Jessie Springer here's her like take lessons profile and again you can have a pretty similar profile depent doesn't really matter that much so you got this profile right here you could take a picture of it or grab the URL whatever and you can look at this profile this profile has been working pretty well for her we have another student if I can find him KC to have his profile I don't have his profile right here okay so that's not a problem but yeah she got her Jessie also got a client from wisent which was pretty cool so this is a testimonial that she ended up getting from it and another one of the students from clever programmer she made this post awhile ago she's like she started tutoring using wise aunt and she ended up landing her first session in 72 hours so it really depends on what skill level you're at like if you are a beginner intermediate advanced that matters because if you have no skills right now then it's really hard for you to teach somebody coding but even if you have three months of experience you have a lot of people that are behind you then you can teach them you you you so let me get out of here let's go back to obs pop this open all right let's I'm gonna go look at your guys this chat now okay data science yeah if you're good in math Python doesn't matter yeah any language is good for you if you're a beginner up work is tougher I would go to wise and take lessons and start from there people per hour or whatever like the alternatives in other countries okay thank you Sina first thing love your videos yeah that could be cool making a project becoming a freelancer mean could take you from a few months to a few years depends oh really and what's going on my man yeah I think I'm gonna be doing more videos on my personal I'm starting like a personal brand on Rafa Kazi and so I'm gonna be doing a lot more business related videos on that channel because when I started posting them here they just were not performing well at all because most people here are not really most people that clever programmer are really interested in business are more interested in Python and freelancing so I'm gonna make this channel more specific to that but more like personal brand Rafa Kazi content I'm gonna be talking about like making my first million dollars I'm doing a series on that I am talking I'm gonna talk about like how I grew and skilled my business I'm gonna talk about how I actually worked on clever programmer and taught people at scale and everything so the content and my personal brand is gonna be more business related and I'm gonna talk about like how a lot of other developers are killing it too because the teaching industry is really huge so like john sonmez from simpleprogrammer.com all on udemy is doing really well and CEA's dojo and suraj Raval and shawn something and coding phase and the list of coding celebrities and people who are teaching coding online it's just massive now you know before it used to be just like the new Boston and that was kind of it and now it's just so many people it's insane yeah easy thank you bro yeah I'm not I'm almost there easy almost there so I'm making a series called road to my first million and I like we as a whole company are very close you know we have very small profit margin but cuz we just invest in the whole business like constantly I have a team of people we're creating content so the expenses are also really high like over like $30,000 a month in expenses so it's pretty intense but we're focus just all on growth we're keeping no profit we're just reinvesting back into the business and like growing it the name of the new channel will just be Rafa Kazi I think I still haven't made the channel yet and hey what's up Nicolas how's it going oh people are messaging me on Instagram let's see okay I'm gonna start getting on a few calls so somebody is I'm getting on a call with a Hellmuth Feroz he deemed me on Instagram so I'm just hitting him up if he doesn't pick up then we're gonna move on to the next person he didn't join okay let's go to Hari all Hildur says I'm currently working at McDonald's while I'm studying but I would really like to freelance or teach programming on the side you're helping me so much with that yeah perfect can you jump on a call with me or Lillian you can message me like I would like to get on a call with Hildur and/or Willian so again Instagram is clever cause II you can DM me there but yeah that's really smart man how you're working in McDonald's and then you're you're studying and then you're also trying to like freelance you can you can be using those platforms that I showed you and you can be earning a good income on the side like you can be earning a really good income you know you definitely one to two thousand dollars like that's not that hard you can grind you get one client they'll you like let's just say you landed one client for $35 an hour and then you just work your way up you know I'll open up Google Docs and let's just let's just [ __ ] talk let's just talk through some of the math so freelancing software I'm gonna sing math alright so I'll share my screen here I'll zoom in so you guys can see okay so let's say you get okay like that you get one client at $35 an hour okay whoops okay let's let's even be more conservative let's just say $25 an hour people on wise and take lessons all these platforms charge higher again if you're in a different country just please dude do the if you're another country like I'll just make a note if you are not in United States just Google equivalent platforms and convert the dollars into your own currency okay so for example like $25 an hour might you might have difficulty charging that another country if you're working with the local person and you're not working with somebody from the US so then just do whatever is like gonna be good income for you like I know for if I know that my cousin's indifferent like in Pakistan literally make like 200 dollars a month and they're super happy so just do the math and then convert it I'm just gonna speak for the US market okay like my whole talk is gonna be specific so then convert it into your own thing all right so if you are doing if you have a client and you're making $25 an hour from one client and you can you call him or something he keeps calling me okay so let's say you're doing 25 an hour now for hours so like let's say you have four sessions so one session you get paid 25 right $25 cool now generally what I like to do is I like to do like like one and a half session so if I'm working with the client instead of doing like doing 25 I'll do one one and a half session like one session but make it one and a half hour long so each of my sessions teaching someone coding would be 1.5 hours okay and really what that means is that means I'll also I can charge them a little bit higher so I might charge them like let's just say you can charge them 35 okay so for 1.5 hours you might charge them 35 you might give them a little bit of a discount you know okay so this is what you're charging one client now generally you meet with each client once a week so if you meet them 4x a month that's tell you five times four that's a hundred and forty dollars from one client okay 140 times 12 that's gonna be over the course of a year so one client is four for one year okay okay so now I know a lot of you guys are going to college and or a lot of you have to like pay off the college debt it's such a easy way to do this guys it's such an easy way to pay off your college debt another thing I want to mention is well I pretty much got a master's education without paying for it like I went to Oakton Community College but I got a masters education because I had a client John Navarro if I can find his profile in LinkedIn this was the client that I was working with one on one and you can see him on LinkedIn right here and I started working with him and he was going for his Masters of Science in analytics so he was going to school in Chicago as well because I was teaching him coding and he was paying me for it I was getting his education because every time he had a project he would share it with me so then I could work on it and try to help him he learned it on his own I didn't do the work for him but I helped him through the process okay so that's kind of the main thing I want you to get out of it like your you're getting an education as well when you're teaching other people and you can save a lot of money potentially like if you're getting a master's education the master's education you know might be worth 50 K plus and if you're just teaching somebody they're literally paying you like how absurd is that they're literally paying you to get a masters education so that's pretty crazy to me okay so one client for you is 140 right if you scale that up and how it just depends it's just up to you if you scale that up to ten clients right or you increase the number of hours that you're putting in with each client like sometimes you'll have a client and you can put in two to three hours at a time with them so you're charging them fifty or seventyfive or a hundred dollars per session right so then you have a little bit more leverage but in this case if you have let's say five clients that will be 700 a month and it'll also be oops 1688 now this is just like okay so like this is a pretty good side hustle you know you can from just a few clients you could be scaling into eight thousand four hundred dollars a year but if you now start playing with the levers where you're charging a lot more hourly and then you're doing a lot more hours and then you have a bunch of clients now you start getting into levers where you can be really scaling your income but honestly for most of you guys if you're even bringing in five to eight thousand dollars on the side extra in a whole year alright let's just say in a whole year you're bringing that that's pretty damn good and you don't have to drive to drive uber to make your money you are making your income while working on the most on the most important skill which is gonna be one coding and two freelancing so those are like the most important skills I guess right so you're getting two really amazing things out of it which to me is really fascinating because if I'm improving in both at the same time that's really amazing right and bonus is bonus is you're getting a free slot free education because you'll have clients we're going to coding boot camps like you left clients are going to dev bootcamp you're have client who are going to what is it coding dojo you'll have clients for going to a fullstack Academy like all those big boot camps you know coding food camps right thankful you'll get clients from thankful you get clients from coding dojo if I were you guys I would be actually in a coding boot like if you want to be smart what I would do is this I've been I've actually joined thankful I've been through their boot camp but it's a pretty cool boot camp but what I would literally do is I would join the boot camp thankful pay it's like five hundred dollars a month or something okay I would join the coding boot camp thankful then I would just help everyone wherever I could and then I would just land clients from within it from thankful like you'll get really highquality clients and you know they're they have the money to pay you because otherwise they can't join the program think for thankful all right so that's just one example of being creative but if you don't even want to be creative you're on wise and just apply like to 20 to 50 people a day if you started doing that you're gonna see good results let me come back and just see where everybody's at okay Wow okay could you do a video on how to get the best freelance jobs yeah I've done some videos around that I have some videos around that for sure online uhhuh huh Tony sue says stalking you before I sleep perfect always could always go on google hangout or such yeah oh really and I yeah I'm not sure how to get you to call on my phone wondering here's a good thing that we can do I think I think this is pretty smart so I'll try this give me a second I'll do this I have a good idea I'm gonna get a link for you guys where you can actually leave me a voice message and then I can answer that for you and also turn it into a podcast which is pretty cool so like provide valued a lot of people at scale and then people will also get to hear your voice but yeah hopefully I'll be able to figure out how this thing works okay all right so here it is I'm gonna drop this link in the chat here it is leave me a voice message so I just dropped a link you can actually leave me a voice message there and if you leave me a voice message there you can kind of ask me whatever type of question you want businessrelated or coding related and I will try it my best to answer it for you and it'll turn into a podcast which is gonna be pretty dope the page is gonna look something like this it'll look something like this and then I think you just kind of pick your pick your mic and then you just hit start recording now all right William Kurt says hey how's it going working at Walmart but would like to learn to code in freelance I would also like to do some work for your guys company to work for an experienced developer teacher is worth it awesome if you want to work for us William like definitely send us an email or message me on Instagram like just connect with me one on one that'd be the best and then I'll jump on a call with you yeah so learning to code freelance it's a very important skill my man it's gonna be really helpful if you get down both of the skills by teaching it you don't have to be like super experienced you can start teaching it like kind of right away so I think you're gonna win if you do that I want to share an idea with you guys one of the things I'm really interested in doing is I want to do a live almost like a television type of coding show so what that means is and I don't mean like live isn't on YouTube that would be cool too like I would I think I would like to do that but what I mean is like a documentary series where any of you guys come in to Los Angeles where Matt and for the first few people I'll offer like a free boot camp and I actually might do that for a lot of people so I'll just be like complimentary the only thing is that I'll record it with my team and so we'll document the entire experience but it'll be me working with you in person on teaching you coding skills and also helping you with freelancing so you'll kind of get the best of the both worlds hopefully and we'll work together on things so I think that could be something really really dope I've had this idea my friend Adil helped me come with that come up with it and then I wanted to just run it by you guys and ask you what do you think is this something that we should do is it something I should actually do yeah and yeah if you guys come to like you know later what I'm gonna be doing is like creating application form for everybody to apply and then like anybody who wants to be a contestant on the show can apply and then once they're selected they get to come in and work with me for like again I won't charge them and we just work like allin we go all in and then work together on it I think that could be something really cool okay which course should take shady yeah tons of online Python courses my man if you just google it on YouTube I have a free course as well you can take that it's really good they're a good place to find practice projects yep mic practice projects if you go to my Python course on YouTube it's pretty good to start off with same answer for you Salman Ahmad how to improve your coding seal without freelance saying polo again free courses on YouTube a spirited how many time will it take to earn 1k for a complete beginner it really depends in my new course I say it can take you six weeks or more but if you're you really grind hard you don't have to be in my program you can just grind out hard apply to these platforms put your head down in code and it's yeah it's very possible for you to be on your path to earn 1k even if you don't earn 1k in this first six weeks you can get your first client in that time Tony sue okay awesome my man like if you want to do it let's do it like send me I need like send me your ticket details to Los Angeles and I think you set somewhere around July something anytime after July 25th is fine and you can come in for two to three days and we'll kind of go from there but I think it'd be phenomenal but again you guys have to afford like the flight you'll have to pay for your stay like hotel you'll have to pay for like you know all your own expenses you'll have to pay for all of your own expenses but outside of that I would love to just work with you in person and if you're like an incredibly qualified applicant and maybe we can have an exception but if you as long as you cover your expenses you'll be golden like the only person eyes I said could come and work for me work with me and I'll actually pay for their expenses was I went to Chicago just recently and I ran into a clever programmer fan and I ran into him in person he's 16 years old and his little brother is 10 years old and they watched clever programmer content like every day and they're coding and they're hustlers and they're starting their own YouTube channel and then I met them it was amazing and then I met their parents that was amazing and then I was like you know what if you guys come in I will do it for free for you guys like I'll pay for your expense for staying here and everything and then I'll actually help you guys so those kids were really really phenomenal easy says that's phenomenal great idea getting ideas raw from the people at your boot camp yeah man I just really want to connect with everybody that's in the community like it just feels weird like I realized that I don't want to make content and put it out there when I don't actually get that like I want to meet you guys in person and that gives me just so much oxygen in so much life like every time I do a group coaching call or I get to speak with you guys in person or one on one or in a group whatever it may be but that interaction is amazing like right now this is great too cuz you're able to chat with me but it's so much better if I can just speak with you in person and the more in person the better so like my dream is to actually host a live event in LA make it free for everyone and then no matter where you guys come in from it's just a free event whether it's one day two to three days I want to just go all in and like teach you guys the coding skills freelancing the skills in like really go hard and like I mean in my [ __ ] like that's my zone of genius you know so nan I just go hard and I have my whole team to support you guys as well and everybody on my team is a [ __ ] genius you know these guys are much smarter than I am so that would be phenomenal that's something I really want to do and the more live connection I feel from the people is just unbelievable cuz internet makes us like really fake reality where things are views and likes and subscriber counts and I just don't feel it and it doesn't make me want to like do anything but the more I feel like the energy the more amazing it is the more exciting it is and the more I want to do and I want to help out in any way or shape or form that I can tony soo cool once you mark it down send me the in send me the picture of the flight ticket booked all right if you do that today even better so then I can lock it down in my calendar but if you don't do it today we won't lock it down in the calendar so if you're coming in July 27th send me the freaking thing DM me on IG or something I know you're in our new course so you can even share with me there but that's awesome and we'll we'll document that journey like this I wanna I want to go deeper because I'm kind of tired of making like top floor programming languages to learn top three programming languages to learn like top six programming languages to learn to get a freelancing job without a college degree and it's like I that type of content like it kills my soul a little bit every time because it's something that like so surfacelevel that it's not exciting there's no depth to it but then it'll go and get two million people into the world of programming versus you know just because of how algorithms work sometimes versus like some of my deepest content that actually takes our team months to make and you know I bring in like a decade of experience into something and I just go allin and that will get like about 1500 views and max out and so then it's a mixture of how deep do I want to go how wide and then how wide and right now I want to find that balance but even if I keep creating content that's like more to just reach out to more people in general I want to have a way to reach out to you guys for like actually here and you care for this and I care for you and you care for me like I want to be here with you and go as like take it a lot deeper you know so that deep level is what I really really that I want to bring to this you know cuz I think that's just that was just missing there was just width in it but it's it was hot and yeah so that's kind of what I'm excited about easy awesome just sent a voice message cool I'll take a look at that William says did it okay cool William that's awesome I'll take uh let me see if those voice messages are if I can listen to them from my computer or I think I have to login from my phone so let me actually login from my phone and and hear those and maybe I can just answer those voice messages for you guys like right now so let me just take a look at that okay podcast logout login cool podcast oops that wasn't it sorry guys just give me one second I think this will be some good stuff in these voice messages and I think it'll bring value to everyone here um why aren't you checking voice message yeah I'm going to check to frighten how gaming hub damn eric says damn I'm at work replay hey Eric Eric Williams that's a very interesting way of spelling Eric by the way what's there behind you on the board just business stuff we're focusing on a lot of growth so we're running ads now and we're doing all kinds of stuff to like really because we've been grinding forever so now we want to make sure the content actually gets seen and people people get value from it and all of that okay now I'm here now I just have to see you where the heck are the voice messages okay I see the voice messages okay guys so here is the so here's a message from easy I'll play it and then I'll answer it for you when it comes to ask me coming to code like what are you doing like on find solutions like in coding problems I'm what you call Stack Overflow or like platforms like that to actually solve your coding problems that too busy with it like it's really frustrating you spend so much time trying to get answers to something that you're stuck on yep what do you do then yeah yeah that was a very easy question I love that so I will create the podcast and answer it live at the same time so that'll actually be really really cool and then once the podcast is out by the way the podcast is called clever programmer so I'm starting up the podcast too and so I'll answer the question here and in the podcast as well so let's just do it at the same time question was what do you do when you run into a coding problem and you can't solve it and if you run if you stack overflow it or github it or whatever Google it and in any way clora none of those platforms actually help you out and you're kind of stuck what do you do is then that's a phenomenal question and here's what you do you go to up work or you go to Fiverr or you go to code mentor and you pay somebody to help you now let me explain it's not the first thing that you do alright the first thing that you do is you actually work hard on that problem I'm assuming you already have done that you spend hours and hours on that problem you try to solve it take a walk that helps a lot to like clearing your brain out I spend a lot of time on that go and ask your peer group for help sometimes the problem that you get stuck into there's um but if you spend a lot of time and a lot of energy and you are just stuck and I'm talking like you have tried ok I'm talking you spent eight hours and you couldn't figure it out at some point there's is a huge diminishing return that ends up happening and it's really really detrimental to just kind of stick through it because after a certain point you're not learning anything for example let's say that the pygame package that you installed or the anaconda you were trying to install the Jupiter Python notebook and it just wasn't working or you try to install and a lot of people who code you know this problem you try to pip install a goddamn package and it just doesn't install and it just doesn't work that is a type of problem that is not very helpful for you to actually get past and solve and work through and just crying through you're not gonna have this big learning advantage from it what's actually a lot better at a certain point is just to hire somebody to explain it to you because I remember I had this one PI game I was trying to make the PI game module work for like a year and a half no coding tutorial taught me none of the environment things things that I did work it just wouldn't install on my Apple computer in my Linux and no matter what I did so after one and a half year of trying finally I went to this one meetup or somebody was like much better than I was and just helped me install it right away and make it work in the first try and I what I realized was I didn't learn so much from them installing it it was just a stupid thing I was stuck on it was just stopping my growth for no reason at all so the reason why I mention go to a teacher and have them teach you like on a platform a platform like take lessons why is that literally pay them because you can ask them to teach it to you in a way where you learned so don't tell them like don't just give me the answer make me work for and understand so little bail give you enough clues and point you in the right direction so you can still have that mental breakthrough but saves you a lot of time this is very very important because the common problem ice like look if you want to become a developer and you want to go the traditional route whether you want a freelance or you want to do fulltime right if you want to go the traditional routes it's gonna take you like three years to get your first job that's on average what it takes most people two to three years four years maybe if you want to save your time and get there faster well what you do right now let's say you have zero experience so you're at the bottom another person has let's say ten years of experience once you start paying that person to help you you start you start giving them some of your money and then you start improving your skill a lot faster then if you just kept that money saved for yourself you're leveraging time and money and you're making a tradeoff because money is a replenishable resource time isn't so I what I did is every money that I made from chests so I would teach chess for fifty dollars an hour thirtyfive dollars an hour I you know worked my way up you know just to prove to people like my not prove but like it's it's kind of cool I feel like so if I go to chess tastic I have this whole brand around chess and you know I've been coaching I was coaching for five years a website I have a blog I have like bunch of students that I worked with and they got trophies and all that [ __ ] which is super cool I've handled I've handled a class of 60 kids for eight hours a day for two months in the summer and it was kids from six years old to 12 10 or something like that and I have a youtube around this too I have a YouTube channel around chest anyways back to my thing so what I would do is everything that I learned from chess and all the money that I was making from my chest the $50 I would make I would pay a developer $25 to teach me for that one hour then I started thinking of it like every time I charge a client $50 that's two hours that's one hour of my time and if I hire a developer at $25 an hour to teach me coding that's two hours of a professional developers time so everyone our of my time I bought 2 hours of a professional developers time then when I increase my hourly rate to say $75 an hour for every 1 hour of my time I got 3 hours of a developer's time you see this way I was able to leverage time and money on the arbitrage of underpriced knowledge and I would just massively scale my skill set in a much quicker time that's why I was able to start landing jobs in 3 months to 6 months time of me starting to code this is why like I don't think a lot of people understand this but I started teaching I started learning coding in to2015 started working in 2015 started scaling it with freelancing in 2016 2017 I started clever programmer and that blew up and then this is 2019 now I've been working on that so I've only like I had very little coding experience except by spending a lot of time into coding and then leveraging all my money from chess and transferring it to get coding skills from professional developers who taught me laser sharp precise skills that I needed I was able to improve faster than most people so one to two years of my coding time is equal to most developers like five to eight years like literally five to eight years so that is what I would say if you can't find the answer on Stack Overflow you hire someone to help you and help you with the breakthrough that's the answer okay so we got Easy's question we got the answer that's pretty dope it's gonna be going to alright hopefully that was helpful easy so I'm just going through the comments what's going on epic ode says it sounds really good really good idea great great I love epi I love your support epic ode that's really awesome I always see you my man thank you so much mind over matter if you're looking for new content may be a good idea to do web interviews of different people every week you could also talk about other tips mindovermatter that's phenomenal by the way if anybody wants to help out like we literally have a job position open for people who want to help out to like help us land interviews with people like and I know almost everyone would love to do an interview with our platform and I want to put that content out for you guys as well so like if any of you guys want to reach out to like somebody from Google Netflix or any company or any developers you have around you and put them in touch with us I will interview them or if you are yourself a developer I would want to interview and you put you on the platform and have your voice heard so mind over matter that's a great idea okay what is also going on okay I'm going through the messages easy says yeah I totally get what you're saying about the videos you make on top for programming languages and top freelancing jobs I was addicted to those for the most part yeah easy like we all are and that's why I make that content but it's not the content I believe in the most you know so I know like we make that content but then I want to make like this I'm actually enjoying it way more than almost anything that I do okay mr. Shiv Prasad says one Django framework arrest framework and ten project great Samir's where are you now I'm in California Hollywood yep the garyvee video was cool easy says then I started looking for jobs and yeah it's different when you have to compete for work I'm building websites just to strengthen my skills yeah when you have to compete for work it's definitely hard but you can really stand out if you know how to bring people value you know and you have you demonstrate it to them so you can stand out with that yeah smart to build websites to strengthen your skills as well yeah easy Europe that's right you are now famous my man you're live we had your voice message heard okay easy that's a sexy accent by the way Hildur says sure yeah train up your Python skills establish a base of operations shortterm gain cool I think I'm not moving fast enough sorry guys Kazi I'm watching your videos for a while I want to do coding and stuff but I waste my time and watching anime and games I want your advice to do something in earning real life really want help I mean yeah my friend Tenzin from woods dev watched 700 episodes of Naruto in the last seven days it happens to us man but you got to get around you got to get the [ __ ] out of there bro like you whatever environment you're in that's something is wrong you gotta get into an environment what is up Aaron so nice to see you bro thank you bro I'm live right now yep I'll make I'll take some food too that's great thank you alright so yeah if program and like you really got us get out of that environment go to friends and people who are doing stuff in your life once you build that momentum of doing stuff you'll win ok you got it but usually got to build a momentum of actually doing stuff and getting addicted to the doing it's a lot of fun like I'm addicted to the doing that's why I just don't stop cool Eric Williams says I stepped out of work real quick bro I love the video did about your lifestyle with programming hella motivation while I'm grinding I'm a computer coding also I'm working at building my network with other programmers and potential job opportunities in LinkedIn yo Eric that is super smart my man yeah that's super super smart bro like reaching out to people on LinkedIn is so powerful and just people don't get it like I will show you guys it's really really cool and I don't even take that much advantage of it but I think everybody in here should so like go to LinkedIn type in Python alright and you will literally find people around here okay look at this advanced Python people results for Python and you start getting like results let's go see all and let's just go through some of this okay here is Matthew para Python and JavaScript developer and you can just hit you can eat so now let's click on his profile and let's see he's a freelance Python developer exactly where most people want to be take your web application of the next level with Django platform cool capable of developing and maintaining web backend awesome great worked as a JavaScript freelance developer so doing both at the same time JavaScript and Python cool okay he's done some stuff with video too so I'm looking for something relevant to speak to him on so my okay so you get a few messages that are free and then after that you got to pay but I honestly think like it's so worth even paying for this because you can just message this person like just last week I messaged this person and she's a Python and Django developer and I was actually on one of these live group calls and I just reached out to her and I was like Hello a rocklike Python and Django developer web developer freelance selfemployed so I'm like I was showing everybody in the group that it's really easy and then I just hit connect and then I sent her a message and then I just said right here I was like hey just scrolling through and saw that you went to dev bootcamp that's pretty epic I have a few friends that went to that boot camp I'm becoming a Python Django developer myself I'm curious what made you go there I'd love to chat and hear your story do you have five minutes to chat okay so easy and then she's like what she responded literally that same minute which is crazy and she goes sure are you in Chicago so I wasn't in I wasn't in Chicago at the time I was in LA but guys it's like really easy it's really powerful you can connect with people who are literally doing the jobs that you want to do and then you can just reach out to them and then you can start working with them or you can literally like like would you like do you know how amazing it would be to grab a coffee with people who are developers and just build relationships with them and not even ask for anything in return that's the biggest mistake most people make your to need like a lot of people come off to needy and too desperate so if you meet these people without that weird neediness and desperation and you just like build relationships with developers and if you're creative you can even start like a podcast for developers but let's not get that creative let's just say you want to do something like simple like freelancing you build a relationships with these people you'll know exactly what kind of jobs you have to would you you know exactly what kind of skills you have to develop you under start to understand exactly what type of skills you need to actually succeed and you they can actually put you in those jobs and help you get those internships so let's get out of here go back so I think it's very very powerful guys like super powerful I can't emphasize it enough funky says profitable programmer 3.0 so yeah profitable programmer right now we're in the 2.0 version and that program is between 400 to 500 dollars just depends when you join that program sometimes we have a good pricing for it going otherwise it's gonna be 500 so yeah okay eric says network with other programmers and potential job opportunities LinkedIn Eric that's just so smart my man you like most people are just not on that they don't understand the power of LinkedIn and building those relationships cool what else we got Eric yeah I can reach out to people awesome Thank You dev dungeon if you can be interviewed message me on instagram please so my Instagram is clever cause E and DM me there and give me context because I'll forget who you are so message me and say like interview as for a develop as a developer and then I'll interview you and we'll share your story on this channel or if you know developers you can put me in touch would that'd be great yeah Hildur yeah you started teaching Python you're gonna see yourself growing from just even teaching it so that's powerful like you're currently in the Opie part of Python even though it's free yeah you're gonna grow a lot my man's got to come back to YouTube no Tenzin is not here with me he's in Chicago but he'll be here July 10th through 14th for my birthday see na if you don't know anything about coding where would you start from I would start from a free coding course online and then go from there Tony that's good advice cool okay Osama says a video on nodejs it's more trendy cool that could be fun yeah scene developer how to contact you either email or message on Instagram okay and I'm gonna see what other I think we got some other voice messages too so I'll take a look at what other voice messages have we gotten William sent a message online but I'm trying to see that what I've been doing is not really something just totally interested in but from just watching my videos and hearing you talk about different things I think coding has a great interest and for me and I believe like as long as I keep following some routines that you guys are playing online so I kind of want to be taking I guess as a student and looking into more as a professor or instructor because honestly I feel like you're probably better than some people they do have as trying to teach it and the different universities and colleges and stuff so I plan to keep in touch and just follow you know the things that you guys got and hopefully become like a mastermind at that it I think it just cut off William okay so I just cut off but okay so William thanks for that yeah we're putting in we're grinding a lot and I do want to turn it into a mastermind I want to start off by doing boot camps with you guys I think that would be phenomenal that would be like one of my favorite things to do let me add this to the podcast as well add message to the thing and then I'll go and record my voice cool so yeah like turning it into a mastermind would actually be really unbelievable turning it into a bootcamp that I do live would you guys would be amazing anything where it's live and I want to connect with you and we can connect oneonone or in person would just be phenomenal so that's really where I want to take clever programmer to and I'm gonna start like pretty soon sending out applications for people to actually book an event and come out to LA and do something live here cuz that would be just like the most unbelievable goal all right let's see if we have another question and yeah guys so I dropped that link earlier for anchor I'll drop it again and you can drop me your question right there let's see if we're getting bunch of messages okay that was awesome question we're gonna answer it right now okay so Philip Eldin aka Hilda in the live chat asked I am trying to make my dreams come true I'm currently working at McDonald's how can I increase and get more side income and then ultimately not depend on my parents Hildur phenomenal question my man look I think you're doing a lot of things right you're already working and trying to earn an income you're already studying I remember from your comments earlier again I would emphasize you need to start going on those platforms I keep mentioning about wise ant take lessons Craigslist people per hour up work freelancer Fiverr whatever they are like make profiles on all of them it'll take you 45 minutes to make profiles on all of them and so that will be like the most profitable 45 minutes of your life you know or if not of your life then definitely you know important to help you boost up your side income and then reaching out on those platforms on a daily basis because I'm telling you my man it's not as hard as people make it out to be if you learn some skills like your three to six months of actual coding skills and you've put your nose to the grindstone and you put in the work you actually work hard you will succeed you will be able to help everyone who is behind you who has one month of experience in two months and three months and four months you'll be able to help them all you really need to be just one step ahead of the other person in the movie catch me you can't catch me if you can which I think is based on true events this one guy was teaching this I think what is it sociology right he's teaching like sociology class an advanced one which he didn't know about and he was replacing he was trying to fake act like this big professor and nobody caught him ever and he taught the entire semester there and he wasn't the real professor and when they asked him like how were you able to get away with that how did you do that he said I was I always just read one page ahead of the students and then I would teach that as a lesson that is usually what teaching can be if you are it doesn't mean Europe you have to be a fraud it just means that if you're ahead one step ahead you're actually even more relevant to the person who's behind you because you know the mistakes they make you know what they feel and you just learned it yourself so you might actually be the best teacher my teacher who was the best teacher for me in chess he actually sucked in chess I became better than him after one month but he was actually the most amazing teacher because he inspired me to become an incredible incredible chess player you know I'm top 1% now in a very short amount of time in the world so that's what I would say like really really like learn those skills really well and then once you learn the skills teach and teaching will help you boost up your side income and you will be able to make one to two thousand dollars extra in month a month if not more in income and then yeah you don't have to because if you're taking an income from your parents you'll have to do what they're saying as well so if you start making your own income you can then start to make your own decisions you can still you can still love your parents and you can still make them really happy but you have to make your own decisions if I was getting money from my parents I wouldn't be able to make the decision to drop out of college to go all in too clever programmer and to start this company and just our teaching coding at scale but because I was making my own money I was able to make my own decision because if I took the hell it would be my L it would be my loss and it would have nothing to do with my parents so you have to own up to that responsibility so you know you really want to make it come true bro start hustling grinding build the thing on those platforms this way you only be improving your coding skills you'll be making an income you'll be and you'll be like freelancing okay and you're getting education at the same time that's what I would say for you bro okay um hey cause you know my long comments yep brilliant wouldn't be sure I could make a short video getting to the point would need time to go over it right now I'm a bit just got fired for working 24/7 or iliyan yeah you don't need to make a video of what you can do a voice message just like they did and also can you guys actually hear the voice message when I play it from the phone all right so Hildur nice that was a great question my man cool great okay guys I think this game gives me some ideas and in terms of making new content I think interviews would be really really helpful okay perfect you guys can hear it so I think interviews with developers would be really helpful I want to do so Nick Rodriguez this will be on my podcast I'll drop the link to my podcast and you guys can get this podcast on Spotify or kind of wherever you want so I'll drop that pot whoops whoa whoa I wonder where my livestream went did it just vanish I mean I know I know guys I'm still alive but um I just can't see where it is so let me go and take a look at that damn okay I can see the chat now so yeah I'll drop that in the comments below there we there we go okay sorry about that guys what oh Jesus I keep doing this thing where it keeps popping me out of it okay I will just drop this here and just hit enter Podcast there so this is the podcast I have dropped a link and you can you guys can sign up for the podcast or whatever it's on I I think it's on iTunes and Spotify and Google and whatever is the best platform that you use so those questions that I'm answering will be on that podcast and you guys can can hear them there so there you go love your videos Thank You Jeremy board I appreciate it okay your thought Nathaniel says maybe your thought process of solving problems better you're solving real world problems like in projects or they're serious stuff okay great I'll document something on that Frankie we can work on a project where I am actually doing a coding project and we can document it like a vlog style so yeah so maybe it might even take a few days but I think it might actually make for good content all right oh really and you get you got your Instagram let me see if anybody has any other questions or they dropped in okay okay guys awesome I think this was great it gives me a good idea for where to focus I'm gonna do I'm gonna do definitely interviews I will do coding shows I think even going live once a week could be really great while making the podcast from that and answering your guys's questions on a weekly basis would be awesome I'll have Instagram Facebook and YouTube up I'm thinking Saturday 12 p.m. Los Angeles time would be a great time for that so I'm gonna start doing that I want to connect with you guys a lot more on a weekly basis and try to help out and drop as much freelancing advice as I can my goal is to help you guys really start your freelance and careers and start making that income on the side and boost it up anyways that's it guys thank you so much my course earn 1k with Python is also now gonna be closing in just a few days in like three days so if you're on my mailing list consider joining that program other than that thank you guys I love your face this is gauzy and i'll see you in the next video
