Two questions. Why are you so beautiful and what the heck was I just talking about? Today we're gonna learn how to install Python in less than five minutes. So let's get started. (crackling) Okay, so the first thing you have to do is open a new tab in Chrome or Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. Go to your web browser, type in Python 3 download. Simple as that. Click the first thing that your eye can see or can't see. That's how fast you should be clicking. And instead of Python 2.7, let's go to the latest version and install Python 3.51. You get this download bar at the bottom here, click continue, continue, continue, agree, right? You can read those licenses, but just do it. And simply hit install. So I'm gonna hit install, I'm gonna type in my password, let's wait for the install. Alright, so our download was successful. Move to trash. Alright, after you're done installing it, I want you to do something simple and look for an app called idle. You should now have it, and effectively here, you should be able to run your Python code. Let's try five plus five, boom! It's giving us something. 10 times 20, yes. X is equal to five, x times five, 25. It's working. Print "Hello". It's all working. Amazing, we're up and running, you guys, in just, I don't know, less than five minutes. Let us simply type in our terminal. If you're sitting on Mac, you would nee to type in term like this, hit enter, and you should come to this screen and if you type in Python, it should now be running your Python as well, and you should be able to just type your code in here. So, this is how you install Python and I will see you in the next video.
