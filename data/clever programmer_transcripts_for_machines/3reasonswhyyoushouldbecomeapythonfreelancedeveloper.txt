about three reasons why you should become a Python freelancer or a Python developer and let's hope that there are no more technical issues because we've been having technical issues for the last hour and the dashboard isn't loading and we sincerely hope that things don't crash but if they don't crash we're gonna be good to go okay okay we're alive you've got nine people on so far hopefully that increases a little bit awesome great and if the audio is working and you can just let us know that the audio is working that would be phenomenal so let's talk about why somebody should become a Python freelancer why do you think in mmm why should I stop in the world that's why the best job in the world what else that's a pretty big leap that's a good client I'd rather be like you know like a celebrity or something actually I would um I mean like any freelancer of course you have your own time you can work on your own time you can work from wherever you want why Kino I mean only like software freelancers alike or like online freelancers can work from wherever they want like you're just a free doctor in general sometimes you have to you're still like location about though because your developer plus a freelancer like that combination you can work from wherever you want whenever you want and the pay's I keep read that good and if I want to like coding is fun and like a badass or a half the time yeah okay hopefully these works so let's write some of these down okay so is he gonna let me write out there or do I just start typing okay there we go all right so let's let's change the size to make it like size 22 okay so why become a developer especially by becoming all over China's policy sparking yeah well use the bunch popped up we're at 44 here oh wow you hello yep it's picking up okay great so the audio is back hello testing testing beautiful make sure you're in the camera so yeah just lean in and type all right see what's okay okay perfect sounds great sounds great where is the laptop right here sorry guys just setting a few things up so then the rest of the livestream can hopefully run a little bit smoothly all right so hopefully you guys can see me right now completely and can hear me completely so that would be great needed anymore awesome so for me the started was all about like income incoming income like that was my biggest goal right I would know they heard from the beginning they just weren't hearing for a little bit audience back beautiful okay thank you guys so for me it was like okay how much money do developers or Python developers make and I would I would look up things and I'd be like okay according to guru or Dax comm what are they making so all right average Python developer salary in the US and why is Python so popular the average Python developer salary in the US is 110 thousand dollars a year according to guru New York and California have the highest Python developer salary of 100 $22,000 200 $21,000 accordingly let's see if it's showing the correct thing great and then according to indeed the average Python programmer salary is 123 thousand dollars a year okay and these regions in the US are high colorcoded by a salary so the purple you are the less income you make and apparently this is not even 90 K this is just less than $90 Oklahoma makes less than $90 so you have Oklahoma here then the other ones you got 90 to 100 K range the yellow ones are 100 110 K and then the green ones like California Washington New York and Virginia are the hundred and 10k plus range basically no matter what yeah Python trends in 2019 and does it continue to be one of the hottest skill and I think they stole this from me actually yeah because I was the original one who I mean okay they could have not stolen it from me you know but my ego is coming in and I'm like because I did create a webinar once and I had this so Python is definitely one of the most wanted languages and this is according to a Stack Overflow post so it's not something that we're kind of coming up with here but Stack Overflow saves engineers all throughout the world billions of engineering hours which is very very helpful and according to them they're like hey you should probably learn Python because it's the most wanted or one of the most wanted ones the most yeah that looks actually fascinating what the hell yeah so they have all these programming languages starting from COBOL and I think that's all the way down here so binary there yeah so it's like more supplies all at the bottom and more demand as at the top so so the redder so it's like python is kind of getting in the redder area over here right yeah source dice another way to see the progress of Python is to study the pie pole popularity of programming language index there's also the Toby index which monitors the frequency of searches for different programming language tutorials in 2019 Python became the most popular programming language to learn showing an almost 17% growth over the last five years we probably had yeah I think so yeah we got a chunk of that yearling then Marsh jumped on it then everybody else jumped on it but okay look python trends or no not google trends right right yeah so last time I had it and we had JavaScript let's type in Python so I'm gonna search for programming language not just a search term the search term is a snake could be Python so we're gonna do a programming language and then we'll add in JavaScript here and if you look at the two over let's say deal interest and then over time it grew more and more and more interest and now it actually has a greater interest according to Google Trends and as a programming language okay see I think might actually be more popular but let's see let's see maybe it's not a lot of operating systems and lowlevel stuff is based see I mean Python is based on C C's not coming up plus me so we can look up C++ but see oh god wait on there put lifetime I wanted I'm curious cuz like a long time ago like 2004 maybe C++ was winning at the beginning Java Scott was killing it into the new Python is wait what other language II I mean Ruby might have more I mean actually I don't I don't think Ruby has Wow Wow okay let's look at Java oh my face is blocking a lot of it it's up there it's Java is fighting with JavaScript okay did I hide it I think I did finally right yo what's up Zaki yeah bottom right is yeah guys this is live what's up Shara's Anil Zaki fella Leo damn Leo why do you have so much hate against technically now all like hate comments and stuff like don't show them yeah oh dude I almost holy crap feel this I feel like I have the biggest paper cut that's ready to be feel it freaks they should freak me out man what happened how I like the craziest paper cut so that's kind of what's going on on this end right like you look at the trends now so you know the trends tell you a lot so you know let's go back and and I think the reason for that is Python just is so versatile you know like you can do web developer getting there's more and more businesses over time so there needs to be more web developers you can do machine learning with it and big data and there's more and more of that coming up as we go into the future and it's not gonna slow down and Python is a very very popular language if not the most popular for that it might be some like weird convoluted languages but I mean Python like you got like a lot of machine learning libraries and open some open source libraries for like doing this machine learning and big data kind of stuff so it's good for that and it's very easy to learn it's just it's just the most wellrounded language pretty much yeah right so you can you you can't while you can't do mobile right but what you would do with something like Python is for example if I wanted to build a iOS app I would use the Django like REST API and using that I wouldn't build the mobile app yeah because it actually turns out pretty nicely that's the mutable web apps yeah because then it works on any toys yeah and I would use the Django REST API to make the backend and then I would just use flutter to create the frontend yeah and it would just query my API for all the data that it needs code daddy's list right yeah but we didn't news one yeah we didn't use flutter yeah but we did we also didn't create like a Django rest framework but like a HD I think yeah if we did create an API then we could use flutter or whatever we wanted right so the the Django backend is pretty awesome so like for example while I can't exactly do mobile development but if you use the backend then it then it can do mobile you know maybe true I mean if you if you keep it separated it's easier to be more tailored because you can have like one mobile version and one native version but you can't say anything there we go okay okay guys everybody keep the chat clean cuz we're gonna block your face okay can you make an ecommerce website or an says so but ecommerce website yeah absolutely so let's talk about it right a commerce website with Python so can you make an ecommerce website with Python is there a website emoji we have so can you make an ecommerce website with Python you absolutely can it's let's talk about what are the things that you need to make a ecommerce website so what is something that you need well you're gonna need the backend to hold all of like the product data and the images and the prices and all that kind of stuff yeah Amit course back back you need a backend which we can build with Python what else do we need so we need a we need a check how about like a addtocart type of functionality Oh like that kind of stuff like even getting even more yeah so we can do product listings yeah so like a list of products and on the back end you're gonna be need to be able to create an account you need to be able to accept payments what else we don't need the communication so like a regular regular websites like regular ecommerce websites you know there look through the products you Add to Cart there are already services for that you're not gonna create that from scratch so we can do product listings we can create an account payments cart what other things that we need to care about we're building ecommerce website security secure payments creating accounts securely other people can't log into your account and delete your listings right so an ecommerce website with Python well can we make product listings using Python yeah yeah so for some of this stuff you're gonna need HTML CSS for some stuff you might even need JavaScript but I'm all for most of this if you use Django you can actually build it the reason why we're fans of Python is because if it's flexibility not necessarily we're religious to it you know if it stops being practical I'm gonna stop talking about Python and I'm gonna be talking about the next programming language so we can do all of these things that you see here with Python so I will and and so yeah you can definitely build an app with you can definitely build an app with Python okay look at ecommerce website okay okay Zacky says I'm quite confused on how you're supposed to store account data and a webs in a database I usually just hash them is there a better approach so Zacky one thing I recommend in how do you use account data or how do you store people user data like how to store user data what I recommend for this is in Django try to use the builtin user model and try to use those builtin models as much as you can because they allow you to store that data without you having to do much and they do it securely so they'll they will hash the the passwords and everything for you and they will do a lot of those things automatically and then extend it as needed and that should do a pretty good job of keeping the data of user secure yeah tracking exactly or in yet tracking customer location is definitely helpful as well volume is is the volume low guys we can definitely turn it up yes hello hey guys hey hello hello okay so I think that should be enough to explode your ears rating the red stop chain development I am opting for blockchain to hold on I don't like this one okay also considering payments is it better to just interact with Visa or MasterCard API or should I use in middleware libraries such as stripe so for okay so when it comes to oh by the way we have our profitable programmer courses available we just opened it actually a few days ago and will be closing it when like two days three years in 17 hours okay so the early bird pricing ends for the profile programmer of course today at midnight so if any of you are interested in joining profitable programmer definitely check it out can you drop the link in the chat so people can see it and then we'll drop in the description too if you're watching this afterwards right I'll just put here to join profit oh yeah you can pin it no option okay can you add it to the description of the chat probably not right you know what's funny is it says excellent connection and even with a dotter laptop it never said excellent connection I've never seen that okay so if you're using how alright I'm just gonna write that right here let's see earlybird ends tonight yeah in like 17 hours yeah so if you if you want you can definitely look into this program or think about joining it but let's continue with everything we're talking about here so how do you actually so we've talked about how to store D how to store user data let's talk about how to accept payments in your Python app and really yes you could use middleware yes you could use the visa card and the MasterCard API but don't because that's why one of the best you know merchants ever were built was built which is stripe so use stripe and use PayPal API or something or oh yeah of course just put it in there yeah I've never actually used specifically stripe API so I have so like you have a stripe Python API right and so you just choose which one you want Python no just go okay and it's as simple as this to charge somebody right so you can charge a card it asks for some kind of specific you know key you give it API key and then you can save that charge so a specific charge ID and then there you go okay and that's how simple it is to get started with it I am actually using a stripe API for one of the apps I've built we just got 40 something I don't know what that is it's a thunderbolt currency the Superman currency okay so okay so what's 40 rupees I think that's 4 cents right 40 cents thank you so much I appreciate like really appreciate it thank you thank you that's amazing ok so let me continue thank you for that Nitin all right let's see what is happening yeah if you so if you don't have interested in coding then don't do anything with coding like stare oh wow chat revenue 56 cents it says right there dang I love that thank you guys ok so what's happening here I'm gonna go through some previous questions yeah there's actually I think you should think of so Abdul Salam says I think you should think of coding languages as tools some tools will be better at doing things than other tools just use what fits the screw head yeah so a lot of what you can think about when it comes to programming languages is that there are tools designed to help you ok it's not it's not that you have to be religious to one programming language it's more about okay figure out what's the tool that helps you what's something that helps you go farther maybe like for example if I'm building an applet Python but then I need to do mobile development right I might actually build that app out on my phone and then from my phone I can't be using Python so I'll build it using flutter right if I have to make my apps frontend really really good and make it really fast and have like capability to do Ajax and do all this stuff like I'm gonna use react or I'm gonna use something like JavaScript to maybe improve the interface so I'm not really religious to what programming language I use I try to use whatever is needed to do the job I just prefer I just prefer to be using Python wherever I can okay so hopefully that answers that question Pat ya pandas is a library yeah right so a data yeah it's you it's hard I mean you can use pandas with Django you know to do data analysis both yeah okay after learning object oriented programming and python cool projects woodtick inter is it good to jump to web development majang go yeah for sure so if you are doing if you did object oriented programming right object oriented programming and you know the answer is yes you should because objectoriented programming is really really like local development is really really good to get you the principles of how development works without having to deal with the complexity of the internet because you're not like if you're doing local development you're not worrying about hey like is my request working is my network working you're only yeah you know you're only what it's very you full control and everything's selfcontained in its own and safe environment yeah yeah there's no exactly there's no other environment affecting you it's everything is selfcontained so yeah we got a deal with this yeah and so this is the main thing when it comes to local development or just purely doing something on your desktop working with the web development so definitely take it one step at a time if you can Oh Kevin Roman is asking if you join the course in pay huh yeah so if you if you join the profitable programmer course it's 60 day money back but don't like don't jump in with the bad attitude because you won't do well so if you're gonna jump in like jump in fully on and and for in order for you to get a refund like you have to actually show you we're putting in work and week zero week one week two week three yeah because otherwise there will be no refund if you don't do the work like if you jump in just to like because some people will try to do that right they'll jump in to just look at the course or download the material so then they can use it for free and then they're like okay then they also get a refund on that and so we don't encourage those people to come in we encourage people who are serious about growing their business their income because otherwise don't jump in it's not helpful for you okay so what other question Zacky says i've seen that you learn libraries quite fast such as flutter do you do you just read the docs or what do you do I mean to be honest like I it's a mixture of a few things so one I just go through the basic tutorials of learning what I'm like I'm just you know like for example Oh Jango I went through the documentation what I did they have a tutorial there yeah so I followed a tutorial like a course or like an actual course yeah I followed a course and then I built the app that that person who's like what's his name coding for entrepreneur yeah he has really great courses on this on Jango and then I just followed his tutorials and then I went off and built my own stuff from his yeah that's the most important thing yeah like you can start on one spot like I think we you would start on one spot just to like get your feet wet but then after that like don't get something tutorial purgatory like trial codes like your own idea and then play around and figure it out yourself like piece by piece instead of just finally copying code off of a video and pasting it in and feeling good about yourself because you will learn that way but not nearly as fast as if you just like oh I have this idea like oh I want to integrate this into this ecommerce website payment thing well I want to make it secure you just look into it and you figure it out because that's actually what it's gonna be like when you're working on a real job you're gonna want to whatever your client is needing and asking for they're gonna be telling you they're gonna have a long list of things and you're gonna go through it and there's not gonna be a tutorial for you to go watch that exact project you gotta learn how to figure it out yourself so try to call with your own ideas that you enjoy that are like fun right and so yeah if you are building out like your own projects from following other people's tutorial that's one of the best ways to learn the new library or the new framework or whatever it is you're trying to learn I try to follow a tutorial that's very easy to follow and then I try to go and stem off from there my own thing so for example for flutter I was just using their their main tutorial which is on their platform so what you know and I was just following it literally from hearing gets started I made sure I set everything up I mean the amount of skill it takes just to install flutter and like start coding on it is actually remarkable like you I just I feel like so many people especially if you're new to coding like 99% of the people will fail and won't even get past like hello world on flutter really mmhmm like just to get it started just to get it installed just to get it like working get everything set up it just takes so much effort but Python is like right and I and I wish repli'd has something on flutter because repli'd is great but I don't think they have I don't think they have anything on flutter no don't they even have stuff on react they got stuck on know I guess stuff on no GS but they don't have flutter yet so I will how do I learn frameworks okay that's mainly that's mainly what I do okay guys I'm a freelancer in a completely different field that's fun and rewarding sometimes but I just feel like I'm ready to try something new a question is it too late to start in your 30s almond ass so it depends but we have like us are our student his name is Donnie and he's always gonna be too late and it's always that extent reason for almost whatever it is that you do will always be there but if you if you want to put into perspective you know somebody who's 15 doesn't start like I remember I didn't want to start working out at 15 because I thought it was too late cuz there were kids who are working on since 12 and they were already so much better athletically than I was so at 15 I didn't work out I was the same way actually yeah yeah my friends working out for three years like I'm so skinny and then like 17 18 19 you finally start in the gym and then you're like at some point like you know the hodgetwins you got yeah I don't know if you guys are filming with the fitness but there's these two guys called the hodgetwins they're super funny they're Fitness guys and they're super jacked they didn't start working out until they're like 24 but now they're like 30 and like ripped as hell yep I didn't know that I didn't know that they didn't start working out till they're 24 or like some I don't know the exact number but it's a surprising age you would like I assume they started when they're like 18 yeah when did the Hodge Tunes start I'm video there these are the guys to million subscribers we got two new yeah they're doing like comedy shows now cuz they're funny Kevin Hodge think of them as a Blair Witch Project of the fitness world that's funny yeah back workout routine okay I can't see oh there 42 now yeah lift smart not big yeah so it depends when do use when you start it's a good question to think about but most important is like income from it would it be worth it for you would you enjoy it that's the question you should ask yourself and if you would then it's worth it to actually jump on and start on this right then you should go and jump on and be like I'm gonna start coding now and by the time 31 32 33 I will have this skill because the alternative is that you just won't have to skill right is it too late yeah too late to become unstoppable over by 33 but not by 35 exactly so it's too late if you think it is it's also not too late if you don't think it is so thinking three to fiveyear terms you're very young 30 is very very young because you could be 40 and you still have another lifetime ahead of you another 40 years another 40 years ahead of you you know so it's not late at all passive income with Python making licensed softwares where this one anyways to make passive income with Python making licensed software's writing blogs yes there's ways to make quote unquote passive income with everything except what you think about is passive income is not passive income so there is no such thing as passive income and the reason why I see that is because people think passive income is equal to easy income and there's no such thing as this it's it doesn't exist there's no because I mean if you're talking about making a license to offer essentially you're talking about almost like a SAS so if we're building a software as a service with Python there's no passive in it like you're gonna build it you're gonna be updating it and then you're gonna be doing it over and over again it's very rare that you actually build something that generates some kind of real income that's actually useful right like technically talks about some software that he's built but he made he makes such little money from it it's might as well have not built it in the first place yeah he created like some kind of like photography like stitching thing and then it brings in like how much does it bring in time like not as much as you would think yeah I I can't remember it exactly but this was like three years ago right so let's see contrary so there's some so yeah I don't know does he have it in because I don't to go through the whole video panel opps right there yeah yeah so panel apps is one tool that he's built there's some other tool and then I'm not exactly sure what this is image details I think it's panel apps images like you can how much earnings he gets yeah people can like input their like a video or something and then it spits out an image of that video into image form so yeah upload a video and then it just gives you back an image right yeah so you can like if you again if you build a lot of these applications even this application that he's built with panel apps or whatever it is like you're not actually making that much income without having to do any work at all like you have to update it you have to make sure that it's running you have to make sure it's something that people are using and if somebody else makes that's the same thing that you're looking to build well then you're not gonna get paid for what it is that you have right so there isn't any kind of passive as in you do it and then you're just kind of out but for sure you can build licensed software right like JetBrains makes PyCharm and I use pycharm and I pay JetBrains for the service of PyCharm and then lots of companies purchase pycharm and use it as well oh hi Isabelle sang hi yeah she's on Team clever programmers volume is still too low huh I don't believe I'll be on their side yeah it's probably check your mic or something Matt I mean your your headphones whatever your speakers yeah better to store right now with Python thanks for answering yep you got it right so I'm also a Jenga developer without a degree so yeah you it could be helpful for you but if you are trying to do freelancing and you're trying to become a software developer it's not necessary like experience experience Trump's degree no matter what it's it's just because your degree could give you experience that's like right and like resources but I mean you can get it from anywhere so it doesn't really matter if you have a degree right if you have the experience in the knowledge in the last two years I just broke 1 million dollars in the last two and a half years and I don't have a college degree so I'm I have a very bad GP I had a bad GP in Oakton community college I had a 2.0 GPA in Oakland Community College I got a 19 on my CT a lot of my friends around me were like yo even monkeys would get a big break $1,000,000 in the last two and a half years and you know if you look at the timeline 2015 I learned how to code 2014 I learned how to code then 2015 I was making about sixty to seventy thousand dollars in a year then twenty you know twenty sixteen I made let me let me write this down I guess so 2015 learned 2014 learned coding 2015 did about 60 K something like that 60 k TK something like that 2016 I did a hundred and four K at that year and then 2017 I did 211 K about 2018 350 K and then 2019 we've already done turn fifty K and we're probably on track for five four hundred five hundred maybe but we'll see so on track for you know four hundred K plus right so if you just actually add up the last two and a half years that's over a million dollars but it all started from learning the skill of coding so I learned to code and then I started making income now I don't have a college degree I am NOT planning on getting a college degree but I just know that I have a goal I have a vision and then I just execute on it you know so when it comes to like I learned the skill set of coding and the first things that helped me make my income were you know first I made my income from teaching coding and that helped me get to about 80 K close to 80 K year and then the second thing was freelance with code and that helped me get to 100k plus a year and then it was I realized that there's so much demand for coding and then I started teaching coding and so that could be the next step for somebody who's wants to become a developer right you could first learn coding then you could teach it to other people and charge for it then you can freelance with coding and then you could actually teach coding at scale right so teach coding online is what helped me scale to over 300 K plus a year so because if you're teaching coding online and you're helping other people become freelancers and other people become developers well you're helping many many different people throughout the world and so then it only makes sense that you're making a higher income and you have a bigger impact in the world you make more income and you have bigger impact but you know it's if I go here all started in 2014 with me learning to code you know as it's it's it's that were should anyone registered to teach coding and how yeah so there are lots of different platforms you could be using right you could be using up work or wise aunt or take lessons and those are all platforms you could use to register and apply and those are those are great ok those are great platforms you got a bro to do freelance without davina Python did you web dev just yeah learn Python and Django start there yeah start with Python and Django and then you'll be well on track she's yeah team member and a regular spectator how to turn ideas into realworld applications well you want to code something up and then you want to make it you know coded like I don't know what I don't know what that means you code it and then it's in real world you know yes I think I think you should take your idea and define it in how it could be coded like if you're gonna do this thing that does this crazy thing blah blah will like break it down into pieces and then implement all those pieces like I mean you could you can pretty much implemented you're not gonna like program like the Ironman suit or something but just write applications I mean just break it down into parts and then go from there bringing out the smallest parts possible so like we said with the ecommerce website like oh how do I make ecommerce website okay well then break that down into like you need to be able to see images you know prices to handle payments to handle security and privacy how like accounts and logging in stuff just like amazon.com like think like look at amazon.com yeah it's just as simple as that alright so that is it guys for us for today I'd definitely consider jumping into the program profitable programmer the earlybird is ending tonight so if you have any questions you can email or ask and we will try to answer it for you you can I'm staying a little bit away from Instagram for just a little bit so probably now gonna be there that much but yeah definitely email at support a clever programmer calm the link is gonna be in the description or somewhere for the profitable programmer course I mean if you're interested in it I'm sure you'll figure out how to find it but definitely jump in the program or at least look at the page to see if it's a good fit for you but price of this program is gonna be going up tonight by $100 so don't wait like if you want to get your career started if you want to grow your income as a freelancer as a developer then this is gonna be a great program for you and with that said this is cozy this is Erin we love your face and we'll see you in the next video
