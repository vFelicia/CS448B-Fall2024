stop being a little if you yourself want to become a six figure freelance developer daily Outreach manually DM and reach out to 30 to 50 people per day if you're trying to increase your income as a freelance developer or you're just trying to increase your income whatever skills that you have you need to be reaching out manually unless you have an audience already like look on my YouTube channel I have an audience I have a big email list of people for me I still call that reach for my new business I actually created a tick tock and cold Outreach to those people and then landed a client from there for two thousand dollars a month if you are making less than four thousand dollars a month or five thousand dollars a month what are you doing if your goal is seriously to increase your income then that's what you need to be doing and offering to either teach them coding and charge them 500 a month for four sessions per month or you can help freelance ask to enter But if you aren't doing that and your income isn't going up I mean it's really your fault
