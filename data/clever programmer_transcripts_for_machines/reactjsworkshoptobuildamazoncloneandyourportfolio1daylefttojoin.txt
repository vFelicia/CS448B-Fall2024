going to be coaching you and we're going to be building some amazing things and you're going to be learning some amazing things oh you have no idea we are going to be building an amazon clone we are going to be making your own portfolio so you will have not only a project done but you will also have your portfolio with that project in it we'll show you how to build that application from scratch and this is going to be a zoom call so we're going to be interfacing with each other live you're going to have chance to do a q a nas and i were sitting down and we thought hey let's build this event we were actually literally at a park just a few minutes ago and we thought how about let's make a workshop that gives you massive value so we decided to book a full threeday event where we build these epic projects put them on your portfolio and in the past a lot of our students have actually gotten jobs just by having these on their portfolios exactly exactly and so you if you think about it it's an immersive experience live event just like kazu said fully unzoomed so not only do we get to fully see your face which is going to be amazing and you get to see our face but also what do they get to do quasi they also get to ask questions that's right so you get to talk with us now on day one what's important for you to know is you're going to be learning the opportunity that exists for developers in 2021 and how the lockdowns has affected it or not and then on day one what else are we going to do we're also going to be building the part one of the amazon clones so in day one it's if you're for seven hours pretty much straight here the first three hours is just what kaza said is the opportunity to become a developer and then you'll get a break and then right away we'll get into building our epic project and for day two day two we're going to be working on the amazon project as well as we're going to build out your portfolio so we can actually put your amazon project inside of that portfolio that's going to be sick and again also about seven hours of the whole day make sure you're ready for this one make sure you bring some good water with you you know good water yeah book out make sure you book out the day and the calendar and remember guys there's no replay for this this is going to be a live experience you can't just watch it later so bring it all you got because these three days can transform your entire life as they have for so many of our other students that we've put on this page below oh you have no idea and finally guys for day three what are we going to be doing we're going to be actually doing a few cool things one is you're going to be learning how this one developer we won't tell you who it is made over 300 000 in actually under three years with javascript we're actually going to be launching our clever programmer online coding boot camp let's go this is a 12 month online coding bootcamp with four immersive retreats this is absolutely the first time we'll be launching this so you don't want to miss out on this and after that we're going to be bringing on some students who have gone on to absolutely crush it with javascript and you know i've landed tons of jobs yeah so you know students who have went from zero to fifty thousand dollars or students who went from forty to ninety six thousand dollars or students who went from 130 to 170 000 a year and the the amazing part is those students will actually be part of this challenge as well so you'll get to ask what them questions and maybe get some feedback or you know uh get some knowledge on what you as well need to do to be at that level too so don't miss out on this opportunity the students who join will be the first ones to know how the online coding bootcamp for clever programmer works we're so freaking excited oh yeah no idea that to you and share with you everything that we have put together and how much heart and soul and energy is going to go into this so massive massive value for you in those three days along with you being the first few people who actually get to see the online coding bootcamp and how that would work and the online workshop as we're doing right now yep yeah so this workshop also is going to be the first live workshop that we've ever done because up until now we've done it on facebook groups and facebook live or youtube live but the problem with that is it's all online and you can interact with us people talk with us in the comments people post you know notes or maybe we have a slack community but we've never had a facetoface zoom collaboration where you can work with us you can also break off into groups and pair program yeah that is absolutely new and we definitely never had these intensive full six to eight hour day workshops where we just build out the entire thing together and i think the best part about this is the twoweek communication because not only are we communicating to you but you get the chance to communicate to us directly over these coaching calls right so you get to ask any questions if you like really are stuck like oh nas or kazi i really can't do this or if we're all hyped up we get to go all high pop get hyped up together we all get to dance together as well and so it's gonna be very immersive amazing experience uh probably something you haven't seen before so make sure you join join this experience um for the next for those three days and trust me you do not want to miss out so guys the dates are december 18th through 20th 10 a.m to 6 p.m pacific which is los
