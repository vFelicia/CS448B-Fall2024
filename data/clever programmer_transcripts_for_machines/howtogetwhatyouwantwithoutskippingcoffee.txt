hey guys what's up this is Cassie from clever programmer calm and this is so something really exciting happened today this is Tenzin by the way guys Tenzin his channel is called what's dev comm which you guys should also check out he's doing he's doing really cool I didn't stop here look at how nice he says he's doing really cool like web development stuff HTML so some of you guys who want to do some frontend that's a good place to check it out but one thing I wanted to tell you guys is we like we're pretty much almost like business partners so we actually got the office here yeah we got and his mom just came recently and you got this awesome buddy yeah so we got the office and we were like trying to figure out everybody was laughing at us that we made that decision because they're like you guys are crazy tarded yeah we're dumb and we're gonna like lose our money always yeah but one great amazing thing that happened is so like we've been coming to the office and I'm working on my YouTube videos and my channel Tenzin is working on his YouTube videos his channel my channel is nonexistent at this point day one yeah 22 subs 24 dude oh yeah yeah and that's exciting I mean that such as how it is in the start but I you guys should definitely go and subscribe to the channel but one thing I wanted to say was one really huge thing happened today where we first of all we already got like some like one of the things was we wanted to generate enough income so our office was affordable because the office money that we were paying was really eating into our finances like I was hurting us but our entire goal was not to like cut coffee we didn't want to like cut our stuff that we did like even right now we're gonna go play outside like some snooker then we're gonna go outside and that's someplace nice and grab some food before we actually part ways but our goal was not to like lower standard of life but what we wanted to do was find a way to earn enough income so the office gets paid off like it's not about your expense it's about your return on investment right so or or your the money that you're getting back ultimately at the end of the day so it wasn't about the expense that we were putting into the office it was like what kind of productivity levels that could give us and what kind of business it could give us and now the whole time we were thinking if there was one client or one way we could do to just get enough money to pay off the office that would be like the ultimate goal and if we can get a client or multiple clients who could help us pay off every month of the office that we have to pay the office has just negated and then we can focus on everything that's important things so now the biggest thing that happened which is on I can't curse believable is that we have gotten multiple clients but just one of those clients is going to be helping us pay what we're basically gonna be running Facebook campaigns for them and doing like targeted ads targeted marketing and that's gonna generate enough income to go over well over for the office each month that's right just one coin and we're done okay so all it takes is one that's right and and and now we just focus on other things we don't have to worry about our office anymore we just focus on other things but that's how it is for lots of the things that we do like we might get a service like leadpages con with just $97 a month or I might get a service like he has a service for teachable I have a service for teachable and we're paying X amount of dollars per month but we're never trying to cut our coffees to make money for it each time we get a new client or like okay that's the one that's gonna be there right he's gonna cover it right like the phone bill like powder per month it's never how do I cut start down on my coffee or my double shot and yeah double no white mocha we just get a client we're like okay that's this client is paying for Netflix this client is paying for whatever and your clients could be big clients or they could be just private lessons and that's you can be flexible with it just as long as you can offer value to somebody else and then figure out what you can charge them but if you bring value to other people it's like we're programmers we're not Facebook campaign runners but like we need business so we will learn new different things and then we will work for people so we can generate enough income to survive and then do the things that we want to do which is for me my business club or program or the channel for him it's you know similar to similar things so focus on increasing your income because there's a limit to how much you can cut but there's no limit to how much you can earn so yeah just wanted to fill you guys in and let you guys know what's going on with our lives and where we are at and now we're gonna go eat and play some snooker kick some ass that's right all right thank you guys so much for watching hopefully that gave you an idea that sparked an idea in your head don't be just so focused on one thing that you do learn more skills don't worry so much about like crazy ly specializing though it's helpful but you know be adaptable like don't be one of those people who just put all their time and energy into one thing and then become obsolete you know be adaptable and yeah that's it all right guys take care love you guys love your faces off and we and I will see you in the next video buhbye own
