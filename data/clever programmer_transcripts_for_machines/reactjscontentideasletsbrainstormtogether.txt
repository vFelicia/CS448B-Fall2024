how's it going this is your boy qazi from cleverprogrammer.com i really hope that you guys are excited because we're going to be doing a lot of brainstorming and coming up with ideas together today and learning some react.js today i have the privilege to be here with what's up everybody this is uh this is david from cover programmer and i had some echo going on but i'm super excited to get the get on this journey so let's go let's go is your echo good now yep yeah yeah awesome so super super sick i'm excited to be doing these again with you guys and we're going to be doing a lot more of these and get back in the flow but what i want to talk to you guys about is a few things so few important things so one let me actually go like this right so a few important things one is we want to come up with some amazing ideas to actually build uh react projects on and what you guys are trying to learn because there's a lot of things that we want to teach but we want to make sure these are things that you want to learn so for example we're thinking about technologies like next js do you want to see projects with next do you want to see projects with gatsby do you want to see do you want to see us talk about server side or clientside rendering do you want to see us talk more about firebase and authentication there are a lot of ways we can go but it's important that we get your feedback on it what do you think about that david yes 100 i think we are 100 uh about for you guys and we work for you so we would really really appreciate whatever feedback you guys have and just deliver on the content that you think would be valuable for you yeah so whatever is up let's get it yeah so one thing i want to do is i actually want to go on to youtube and see also like be able to connect with the live stream and see what's going on because i forgot to open that up normally i open that up right away so we'll have that up and running just so we can see everybody that's in here welcome welcome everybody so freaking nice to have you guys here and it's really nice to be able to do this again yo what's up akash yo lucas what's going on abhishek says server side rendering abhishek says apis okay server side rendering good morning all right it seems like a lot of people are interested in node okay nice yeah yeah go i'm going sorry yeah i was just gonna say that it seems like a lot of people are actually interested in learning about um learning about server side yes yeah yeah i saw a few nodes node.js's and i also saw react with typescript so that's good yeah okay let me see am i all right when i go on this yep my screen is looking beautiful okay so maybe some laps so okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna you guys are gonna code along with us or just watch us code and make some stuff and then as we do that keep typing your ideas uh in here and if you could actually type in as a youtube comment that would be really phenomenal because um then the top voted comments we can just easily see what you guys are looking for or david we can make like a little form and they can submit their whatever i think even easier is to put our instagram handle on the screen and then just have people vms how about that that's not that becomes like then we have to go through all of them i want it in a way where we can easily see you know what i mean like what ideas they like the best we have some people saying um node and apis yeah we have more node jwt and aws lamba lambda nice okay okay let's uh we got a ton of django projects okay okay or we have one person who's telling who's like kind of django projects so let's just let's just while we sit here and chat let's build something and work on this together with them so like people can learn some skills as well and just have fun so one of the things i see a lot that happen in interviews and even a lot of the interviews i'm conducting is i'm checking for your skills obviously with like algorithms i'm also checking your skills and how you deal with apis api is like one of the common things interviewers are going to check you on and it's also one of the most important parts of your job so yes 100 it's probably good that you should know about them and are comfortable with them yeah so yeah like apis are so powerful like you don't have to code up all those kind of stuff you just like api and that's that's it works right so let's uh create react app and let's create a react app here so i'm going to remove this file because react at will complain if you have a file let's try it now okay cool so it should be working and then let's open up chrome bring that also i just made a super quick form on to so that you guys can actually submit so i will drop it in the chat right now so bang just guys go ahead uh check out that link i'll drop it like two or three times in there so you guys can actually see it and just drop whatever technology or something you guys are interested in and then we can like see it okay oh that's smart that's really really smart awesome let me actually click on that so we can show it to people yeah that's a really good way yeah exactly that's so simple i love it so guys yeah just go here to this form uh the url is right there i mean hopefully it's in the youtube description or in the comments add it to the youtube description if you could please okay and just drop in like what are you interested in right so it's like next js is it typescript is it um you know it's you want to see airbnb clone um whatsapp clone you know uh what discord clone a lot of them we've already done tesla clone um so it's it's not just clones but it's also like what types of projects do you want to see what type of tech stack do you want to see do you want to see payment authentication in there do you want to see stripe do you want to see you know different types of back ends like mongodb versus what what else like some people yeah firebase just a comparison of all the databases right awesome so that's right there for you guys check it out whenever you want david i was going to tell you actually one thing that's super cool that i found is called uh json placeholder.typeycode do you know about this not really so um what's super cool about this website is you can go and get fake apis that you can like request right away bang yes that's good so for teaching people this is really really helpful so for example if we want people to get more comfortable with apis and how they work let's say i want to get this post i want to get all of the posts right so let's say that i'm here on this and it has a bunch of posts it seems like it has a hundred posts on here right so if i want to be able to get all of these hundred posts let's go inside of our app.js and uh what we'll do is i'll do yarn start so we'll whip this app up real quick and i want you guys to get a lot of practice with these things because the more practice you get the better you're gonna become at it exactly it's all about the reps cool so we got this and if i make it smaller david is it still easy for you to be able to see my screen uh quickly check can you guys still read my code easily yeah i think it's good okay awesome so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and you know when i'm reading data from an api request there are simple ways to do it and one of the ways is really easy to just write fetch and then call your whatever you have uh so let's let me get my url this one right there yeah so that's the first thing i want to do and then i can just do that then and chain it with things okay exactly so here let's see i think that's one of the things they also that's the thing that i always like i have a code where i have all these fat stuff yeah and i always just copy paste that thing i can't remember this let me go like this inspect and let's see what we get back so right now we're getting you might want to move us from the corner of the screen because it literally covers oh my bad yeah boom oh yeah there we go and just zoom in a bit onto my code or what oh oh in the in the comments on the on the console yeah cool boom that's lit all right dang so what what what did we get back here we got some promised state from this but if i actually want to get data from it in real time i think you need to return it i need to return it but also one thing i want to show here for everybody here is because it's a promise you don't want to call it after you you know you get the data back from it because you're not getting the data back you get the promise back and you print it out so where you actually want to add your console log statement is right here oh yeah yeah and we're gonna remove the initial console log statement because we don't we don't need that anymore so here's our fetch request and let's see what we get back what is it giving me cool so we have we have a lot of our results in here like every single thing that we wanted we're getting that back right you see that zero we got post one we got post two so all the posts that we actually need we're able to get back and another thing if you guys are having trouble coming up with this this place can also be a good place for you to go to to just get that initial thing so boom right like yeah type that right so if you can't remember you can go here and get that like initial request so i'm just gonna do post still because i don't want to do the todo's and let's see what it uh gets us back let's hit refresh boom so i got an array with 100 items and what are those items all those i think user yeah yep we have user and then uh we have a post from each person so 100 posts bang yeah and sick how many users do we have actually if you actually look we have i only see ones and twos so user id if you see user ids they actually go from one to ten so there are a hundred basically what this is telling us there's a hundred posts made by ten users you see what i'm saying david yeah yeah oh i need to crank up the resolution resolution how is my screen uh i don't know uh i was watching in a youtube and i was just uh at 480p uhhuh but now it's now it's good okay now now i see everything try to watch it from ecam instead of zoom because or i'm sorry because instead of youtube because you're not going to see it in real time oh that's right you'll be like 40 seconds behind everything all right so i want to ask everybody who's here live who feels comfortable being able to fetch data from an api if you don't feel comfortable you should work you should practice it okay i highly recommend that and somebody's saying something really smart abishik says qazi i think you should use use effect because that's what's happening when the page first loads up so good so whenever you guys are doing these types of api requests it's a good idea to use usefx so it only fires off once so david is writing the import statement for is it use effect that's correct cool yeah and then what we'll do is we'll take we'll make a use effect and i'm just gonna close it here and we'll give it a second argument of empty give it an empty dependency yeah but you need to rub yes well i thought it was like a one line implicit return type of action going on but all good cool that's why that's why you should use es7 snippets boom so there we go now it's looking good we have it firing off it only fires off once because of use effect and it's showing up okay so we have all of the 100 posts now if we wanted to we could take the post and we could show it off on the screen so where do you want to go from here david do you want to take these posts and start showing them on the screen i think we could do that yeah in some sort of a table way or i just want to i just want to show it like almost like an interview okay so imagine i'm interviewing you so let's just do like a live interview between you and me okay ouch so let's say that i want you to i want you to just um show me the title of each post and just like throw it on the screen i i don't care about styling or anything i just want you to like splat the title on the screen okay so what i will definitely do is i will create a use state over here on the top because i want to save it somewhere obviously so use state first i need to import it if i learn how to type and now i will just say const and how should i call it um maybe data yeah yeah yeah i'll call it data and then i'll have a set data by the way somebody somebody wrote a pretty awesome comment that said um whoa hold on hold on somebody donated your first donation yeah so we got our first donation thank you so much for that thank you so much really appreciate it and here's a really cool comment so by vocal and vocal says i just started learning react two days ago i'm a larval developer and i went to a job interview and i was asked to write react code i was stunned anyways i decided to start learning react yes let's go i'm so happy that you started learning react okay great that happens a lot guys people are gonna ask you to see your skills so many people are gonna come to you in interviews and ask to see your skills that have you code from scratch so really important exactly you're able to do that and yeah jump on in you're in the right place so keep going david so you got your you got your um using hooks here yes i just declared this hook over here and what i will do is i will add uh the set data over here so i'll just make it a twoliner thing yeah like that and what i will do like after i console logged it i will set the data to j uh and i will throw in json so if i see the correct data happening in the console i will have the correct data in uh in the data hook yeah so as soon as we see this data it seems like you're um you're storing it in data right that's correct exactly that's correct got it okay and next up what i will do is i'll actually get rid of oh no i'll make a line uh after this link in the learn react one and i will just add a p tag hold on no uh before i do that i will because i'm using jsx uh i will start typing in javascript inside of this why don't you remove the entire um react logo and everything do you want to do that or no uh you could leave it if i actually want i actually want to keep the logo but everything else can go okay cool i like the logo me too me too i like the way it looks yeah and i'll just type in data map and can you please open up the console so i can see exactly what are the um fields in there uh okay cool you have access to my local host but okay got it oh yeah all right so there these are the fields this is what it looks like okay so because i say data.map i will get back some sort of item and i want to start working with that item and because you asked only for the title i will just add the p tag now the p that comes and i will just throw in uh the item dot title i think let's try that out oh [ __ ] bang all right nice well let's give it up for am i hired hold on hey nice okay so you're not hired you're not gonna be hired yet i still have i still will have more questions for you as we keep going along today and i don't get it but what i but what i would say is okay nice job so it seems like you're taking the titles of each post and you're printing it out now what i would like to see is something like this okay so um can i see all of these posts like so so for example i want to see it's a post uh one like that and then post two and post three and so on you see what i'm saying so it should say all the way up to post 100 like that okay um so because we have an id in there which actually indicates uh the number of the post i will use that and what i will do is inside of the p tag i will actually just for styling's sake i will add a strong tag and that was a post and then i'll just throw in the item dot id i think yes and a colon and yeah there you go okay good nice i'm getting all of them give me the emoji you know i like my finger pointing emoji forget about that colon it's too professional for us so okay what kind of image do you want rocket no no no the finger pointing the pointing the finger to the right the one i had okay nice rocket point right yeah that's the one let's see it nice okay clean there we go awesome so we have we have all the titles going on right we have all the titles going on so this is something that in interviews they'll commonly ask you to be able to do guys you would be so surprised how many people fail at this like you will be so surprised how many developers who are working with react apparently for a year and have been doing more or more and went to a boot camp and paid 15 000 can't do something like this like they'll see this and that's like they'll crumble under the pressure or whatever it is but like they won't be able to do something like this now regardless of whether it's because you're scared or because you lack the skill to be able to do this both of them are just as bad so you're gonna need to get used to it and get used to that skill of being able to do it under pressure yeah marla gaming says this is basic isn't it i mean it pretty much is but the reality is that we've interviewed so many people and literally people were failing at this yes so yeah that's it yeah go ahead yeah yeah and just wanted to throw in a an advice to anybody who who actually feel feels like this could be challenging at this point like you saw what i did i was commenting on what i was doing and that actually bought me a little bit of time to think over what i will be doing next and that also gives the interviewer a view of what is going on inside of your head and if if you're going the wrong direction they might might help you because why not yeah that's that's that's pretty important what you just said because if you don't talk out loud it hurts you more than it helps you because exactly i'm gonna be on your side as an interviewer as long as i can hear your thought process i will help you out and you know go along the way because if you're let's say that you know that you have to sum an array right exactly yeah and let's say that you don't remember what the function is called in javascript because in python it's just the function is called sum but in javascript it's like math.sum yeah so if you don't i don't know yeah are you asking no i'm telling you that's what it's called the javascript is called math.sum that's the function for summing an array right right you just do mat that sum and you call it an array you following me so far yeah yeah well what i'm saying is let's just say that like you um you've you forgot what the term for it was now if you're quiet and you're not talking out loud i have no idea what you're looking for so as an interviewer i can't really help you with anything but if you were talking out loud and you're like okay so at this point i need to sum an array and oh man i can't remember the function to sum an array in javascript if you say that out loud now i might just actually tell you oh yeah the syntax for it is math.sum with javascript to do it yeah so or they might just tell you like bro use google and that's something that you wouldn't think of during an interview i guess yeah that's something let me see what we got yeah buddy guys this is gonna be exciting because we're gonna start doing a lot more lives and another thing i wanted to tell you is we're also gonna be doing a challenge for react js this month and this challenge is going to be really really crazy and in the upcoming days we're going to be building some big projects too so like for example uh if you guys have ever wanted to see the amazon clone with redux implemented you're going to be able to see that if you wanted to see airbnb with redux you're going to be able to see that so we're going to be working on some really epic projects along the upcoming days and today we wanted to engage with you and start getting your feedback on like what type of content you're looking for and what you're interested in as well and that's why we created a forum uh where you guys can go and actually type in what it is that you are interested in looking for so here's the form all right that's the url go there type in and let us know what it is what are the things that you're excited about what type of technology you're excited about the more of these we get that's the type of stuff we're gonna make content on so you're gonna you wanna see some banger ass content pop it in here we're gonna make it because you know we deliver all right exactly we already have 20 submissions so that's amazing wow keep it going keep it going this is awesome jonathan says just wanted to say um let me read it here so you guys can see my face he says uh oh let's bring this here too you want to say i found your channel i'm almost done with build slack clone video i managed to follow along and customize that myself learn so much thank you for your efforts beautiful day that's what's up hey that's awesome let's go hey amanita is here let's go let's go modest hey um marlega says is redux overkill for hobby projects i would say yes for 100 for squad hold on i would also say that oh sorry okay okay okay okay so i would say if you're building just for the sake of building stuff and to have fun and to learn redux i would say it's an amazing stuff and to just put it onto portfolio and then you can show that okay i can work with redux that is a really that's a really good point so if you want to add it to your portfolio and you want to learn it so that you could do it for a company later yes absolutely learn it but if you're doing it for a freelance project or a hobby project and you're not doing it for a purpose of learning you're using it for a purpose of building something that's not necessary at all i would highly recommend to not work and use redux because dan abramoff the creator of redux wrote five to ten pieces of articles on like why you should not use redux when to use redux when to not use redux read those what you're gonna find out is that it's really good for mediumsized to largesized applications the boilerplate for simple projects is not that helpful ben ayowa who's another youtuber he made a video called why no longer use redux and in that video he actually talked about that instead of redux and redux saga and redux forms he changed his stack completely what he switched to is he switched to formic formik for forms it's supposed to make your tears go away and all the frustration that comes around forms and he switched from redux to unstated which is a state management library but it makes managing states so easy that you don't even see that you're managing state it literally feels like you're just using hooks and it allows you to manage a global state of your application so maybe for your hobby projects a good stack for you can be formic and unstated um this is a recommendation from ben a watt so wow i didn't even know about these it's amazing yeah so let's see where your projects are the easier you can go back to it later hold on let me um take this thing and move it over real quick so i can show everybody all right so here's so formic build react build forms and react without the so this is so formic is going to make your forms really easy and then you got all the code right here for the form and super super simple looking form i mean this is probably the easiest form you'll ever see and then wait what do they actually have uh do they have uh form validation by the time kaz is searching on the page just quick question drop it in the chat please if you guys are interested in building some sort of project with this because i actually got hyped with formic yeah oh yeah 4mx is sick all right so this is really good now the other thing is unstated okay so let's go here they have our actual website front stated let's click here all right so here's unstated states so simple it goes without saying okay it's so simple they didn't even build a website for it yeah so um what they say is this okay is this better than is unstated better than redux by the way um david clip this part out what i'm about to say right now because this could be a great video with this title okay sounds good okay is unstated better than redux uh it's smaller 40 times smaller it's faster componentize the problem performance it's easier to learn you already will have uh to know react hooks in context just use them to rock it's easier to integrate integrate one component at a time and easily integrate with every react library it's easier to test it's easier to type check its minimal is just react this is how you install it and you guys can see that the usage of it looks simple and uh you know here you're making a container which is kind of like a you know it sounds like a redux store and uh you got your initial state and you're using hooks instead of using stores and reducers and middleware and utilities and all of that so much much much simpler at least in my opinion dang that's so cool yeah so if you want to use it for yourself i think it's a really good idea 100 like definitely have redux on your portfolio if you know it yeah but like for hobby projects forget about that hey yeah for sure let's see what people are saying uhhuh someone wants to build an operating system react hook forms for the when julio says let's see react hook arms performant and excellent easy to validate oh [ __ ] they're like 17 000 uh stars that's dope take a look at four make two and see if you still like these better if you still like these better then definitely go with them go with this that looks pretty dope too yeah they're fun i like their front end that they did for this they did a great job yeah oh [ __ ] look at that look at that touched feels will display here touched oh [ __ ] if i touch mobile number they'll show me dang damn that's pretty cool hosted on versal and versailles is amazing for hosting i'm like such a such a huge fan performance is an important aspect of using terms of building you will have the ability to subscribe to individual input changes without rerendering the entire form watching damn for marketing that's really really good okay this is a really good find thank you for that i appreciate that uh bishal says i use formic yup for form validation hey let's go got some people in here who know what they're talking about that's what's up let's go uhhuh nice i'm a complete beginner by the way still struggling don't worry like literally join these sessions and just make a habit yes of yourself coding every single day two hours i know you have two hours like screw watching movies and netflix yeah spend some time coding every single day you'll become so good you'll become you'll enjoy it and yeah i mean those are two most important things you just get in the habit of it by doing it then you'll hopefully start enjoying it exactly and by the way we have almost 30 submissions for the forum guys it is down below in the description one simple question nothing crazy whatever you want us to build for you i'll drop it there can you send me the form in chat david so i can see where it is oh yeah uh is it in a base shared with us or no um not yet i just made it up quickly myself cool just send it to me yeah i'll lead you to it bam invite by link the use of java and react together we'll not show probably java and react together but we might at some point show python and react together that would be sick yeah cause i know a lot of people love the idea of that yeah just sent you the uh airtable invitation on skype okay let's so you can join hey oh wow yes we got so many stuff yep so thank you guys you guys are making your submissions i'm loving that really really appreciate those so we got people saying typescript uh next.js apis blog with mern react redux okay data science with python charts nice web development okay beautiful aws paypal api is a good one yeah disney oh disney clone yo we should make disney clone with netcast that is hot hot hot that is fire everyone i think we actually have it some in some kind of planning so it's kind of in the works okay cool yeah cause i was gonna say this dope uh robin hood clone but done correctly with bang because we had a lot of technical difficulties on that one i mean robin hood has a probably a good amount of difficulties so we we maybe should just go with weeble all right cool let's see we got django tutorials i think they will do well too let's see what else typescript realtime apis okay how to make code editor headless ecommerce yeah so i was actually looking into this too a lot which is um like strappy and sanity i o are great headless cms platforms and you can use that to create a react type of uh store so yeah i think this could be this could be actually a good one and then it's good projects to put on your resume as well machine learning using css what the [ __ ] [Laughter] i mean we could we could actually go into firebase machine learning because it has that yeah fine yeah yeah we could definitely do that uhhuh making life easy okay damn people who [ __ ] competitions on prize website making life easy speed reader okay so like an extension or something like that next just search kit app base okay can you pimp my website i like that let's see i think that would be a cool series to do as well like pimp people's sides oh [ __ ] this is legit dang and his whole sit on full on ecommerce something and host it on versailles i like it yeah yo what is this this is a nice project gears of war let's go i have respect for this man now this is dope dude nice work on this who is this sammy good job comment leave a leave a comment in the in youtube damn draw guys go go to this form and drop your thing the form is in the description now right david uh yes that is correct but i'll just go ahead and drop it to um oh react native clones that would bang comparison price website yeah i'll just spam the chat with the airtable link so guys just use that and just submit login and registration authentication users yo we got sami in the chat where does he go bro where is he i don't see him oh he is i'm here hey let's go yo sami nice job that website is looking cool amazing um awesome so i think today david let's keep it short it's already 6 30 p.m here i just wanted to come in and check in and have like a i want to get in a flow where we can do these lives and get a touch point with the whole community and all of you guys as much as we can throughout the week i mean the goal would be to get it down to daily you know would you guys like that by the way if we were to do something like this daily or as close to daily as possible let us know drop it in the comments oh yeah like just some having fun sessions yeah just coding up some stuff yeah and then i mean yeah there are going to be a lot of times we're going to be a lot more intense where we're going to be coding up full on projects from scratch so we already have some projects in the pipelines like uh we have a crazy airbnb project that i was already showing so we're gonna we're gonna build that and then also build amazon from the ground up but using redux yeah everybody's dropping yes daily yes yes did it with search kit okay bang like when you say search kit you mean like um oh you use this thing okay cool there's something called uh reactive something too look at that it's called a reactive search yeah this one so check this one out too because this one is really good as well but i mean hold on search mate bro you're not sharing your screen by the way oh my bad my bad my bad my bad so there's uh this which you guys can wow check out reactive search and it's like point and click and it gives you ui from point and click gives you a full on ui but it's like fast as [ __ ] ui it's full react ui as well um so that's what i love about that one and then this is the one that he recommended search kit so let's see out of the box components okay cool oh so it seems like you use the an out of the box component for it dope oh okay their github is popping too nice so yeah they're both going to be really good so you can try out either either one i like reactive search because i don't want to sit down and write elastic search code um so by pointing and clicking and making and it's super super helpful guys kazi is the laziest coeditor ever yeah and outside of that for search you guys should really look into using algolia this is fast as hell and it's just so powerful dang ai powered [ __ ] twitch is their customer apparently bang damn all right awesome well with that said thank you guys so much for jumping on thank you bye um muhammad says thank you so much clever programmer team because of your react.js videos help me and i got a job finally as a full stack developer yo let's go where's my hold on where the hell are my air horns that's not it that's not it either hey let's go that's what i meant to do there we are what was that horn i don't know man it's like you know when when the guy is going to nursery school on his threewheeler and like yeah i had some weird ones starting to come up thank you guys for mentoring boom i mean got a job as a react js developer yo that's fantastic that's so amazing to hear that's so cool it makes me super happy awesome all right so that's it david any last words from you i really enjoyed it i'm super excited uh of what's coming up next i think if we actually really do it yeah like real frequently i think this is gonna be amazing me too i'm excited awesome well that's it guys thank you guys so much for coming we appreciate you this is your boy kazi here today with david and what's going on we will see you see you in the next video peace you
