live what is up everybody today we are building look at this a gmail clone using react js check this out in this gmail clone literally what's going to happen is it's an exact replica of a gym account that you see right here this right here right there right which you see is a gmail gmail directly from google correct but here this right here is a gmail that we just built and that you're going to build using react.js how cool is that welcome welcome everybody hope you're doing amazing this is nas and i'm today here with david here and hope you guys are super excited to learn how to build this gmail clone with react.js and styled components which is a brand new addition to this channel exactly exactly welcome welcome guys so let's go ahead and get started with this is the gmail clone that we will be building just so you guys know as you guys are coming in all right i hope you're pumped let's get this day started because i am excited to be doing this with you i hope you're just excited as i am are you ready bro i'm excited are you ready let's go so look at this guys for those who have not seen this gmail home look at this this is our gmail clone that we have built and we're going to build this in a few different parts this is go ahead right here is part one but we'll be building basically the logic right here the logic for the view you can see this logic for the view today we're going to be building the view then part two we're gonna be building more complicated things like for example you've been able to click on the email and actually send an email if you want to right to go to click on start snooze sent and to be able to be actually to be able to see the different types of emails right it's going to be a humongous project we're going to have a lot of fun with it so get your butt strapped get ready because this is how we're going to do am i right hey exactly by the time we finish up why do i hear myself okay cool guys so okay this is the gmail clone just so you guys know right here let me see it's a gmail clone right here the you be uh let me see let me see let me tune this down for you this is the gmail that we are currently have like you see for example it's david he just sent me an email this is gmail on the wheel we're building by the way you're good can you hear me yes i can yes okay good good just making sure that everything is all right all right guys so let's get this day started okay first things first that you need to go ahead and do is very simple as you know in any time when you do when you start a project what we need to do of course is going to be what david so step number one obviously is setting up a react.js app and you can do that by just uh creating a new folder and typing in whatever nas is typing on the screen so npx create dash react dash app and gmail clone exactly so that will pretty much go ahead spin up a brand new react app for you a template react app with the usual blue background that nice little react logo in the center going around so that's amazing okay awesome sweet sweet so this is what you want to do so mpxg react app gmail.com that's your first step that you want to go ahead and get started with right open up terminal of course that's the goal here now once you've done that let me actually i mean i can basically just do it with you but we've already done it for with you we've already done it basically so let's say i have a terminal right here let me go ahead and clear this part out i only do you simply for example let me go ahead and zoom in here so you can see my cell you can see how it's better right there so we'll see for example npx right mpx create dash react dash app right and then you say gmail clone right there so that's what you want to say exactly now granted you are there's some things you need to do you need to have things like for example you need to have things like npm installed no that's really important so i mean npm node.js right here you need to have all those installed does that make sense yes yes yes 100 okay i'm just looking at the comments okay everything is up and running amazing guys so we have a lot of people coming in guys smash that like button that is the number one way you can get started as a developer no other youtubers does it like you guys do thank you so much appreciate all your amazing comments guys you guys are always the best as you know as you know okay beautiful cool so let me actually see if i can see the column can i see the comments and you actually in here let me see uh yes oh i'm seeing the comments oh look at this i see the comments yo oh i can't even put them on here superb let's go amazing clever programmer thank you so much you are superb that's awesome that's awesome so i'm always happy happy happy to hear that okay let me go ahead hi somebody said hi hi what's up hey what's up how are you doing i hope you're doing great all right so uh really simple as in that case let's get into it so we said npx create tab that's gonna be your first step and as you see right here we've already done this and we have our project right here right we have our project right here that yeah right here so let's go ahead and close this up and this project contains a few different things contains an app.js file contains over index.js file this for instags file is our starter file right here guys right that's our starter file so just remember that this starter file is basically where we blind our app this is called the binder app right here this app do something called the root now the root right here is when you go to app.js look at this actually when you go to let me see let me see when you go to public and you go to instahtml you see how it says div id root so any html is actually the html file that your browser your browser watches right your browser is the what loads the html file but when you go to dvd root you see this is wd root what happens then is the inside js we have something called get element by id as you might know that is by at this point it will actually get the element and then react binds that element that div to the actual react app that's how it works like how cool is that huh i think that's pretty damn cool right i didn't actually know that you didn't know that yeah i mean i was just doing all these react stuff yeah yeah yeah well there you go for those of you who don't know that is this is this is how react kind of works right it binds it through through here and of course we have jsx to actually make stuff a lot easier for us now what we have here this is our app.js file if we go ahead and actually let me go ahead and open up the terminal i will go right click open integrate and integrate terminal inside this terminal a few things going to happen i'm going to say i'm going to say npm no npm npm start right that's what i'm going to say pmstart that should start our application for us uh would you like to you running up another port i will say yes you most likely will not have that that option or that issue but just keep that in mind cool and we have ourselves let's go how about that there we go that's what i'm talking about exactly exactly and of course guys of course guys very important now by the way do we have we don't have a link to anywhere right now where i don't have a link to our challenge do we below yes we do by the way guys really really quickly really quickly very important we have a free five day react gs challenge coming up this coming up monday february 22nd through february 26th it's going to be a ton a ton of fun you will get to build things like slack clone you will get to learn react you will get to go ahead and learn how to build with components how to use redux style components all this other stuff so completely free five day react just challenge link is down below in description go ahead and join trust me this is something you will not believe me you will not regret okay so just go right now go ahead before we get started trust me it's gonna be a lot of fun no but other than that i think other than that what's up this is the second link down below secondly down below check it out second line down below exclamation mark right in front of it so you can see it exactly exactly just click it and reject it exactly so that's the one let me go ahead hello oh can you hear me go go talk talk talk yeah so yeah guys really really important uh again slack loan five days free react react.js challenge okay we're gonna have a lot of fun we're gonna be learning not only how to build a slack project we're also going to learn how to go ahead and actually you know make money as a developer how to become a sixfigure developer as well it's a very very very important a very important just challenge get in there guys if you're not in there what are you still doing come on all right all right anyways that's it for today let's go ahead and get into it all right so we did npm start to go ahead and start our project and what is the next thing that we should be doing uh david what do you think so right now we should be going ahead and just pretty much cleaning up the whole application and i'll just get started with that what do you say okay let's get started so let's go and clean out this application exactly okay you can see david here here pretty much yeah go ahead he's going to go ahead and move the header and all this other stuff which is the boilerplate which is we don't need that right now right so right exactly exactly we don't need any of those stuff uh that's pretty much just for the uh template app that you can see on the left hand side and right now because i saved it it's now gone and the whole thing is completely white exactly and now next up what we can do is we can go into the file explorer uh if you can open it up right there yeah yes and there are a few test files so number one is app.test.js we can pretty much go ahead and just get rid of that as well as logo.svg okay and setup tests.js we don't need any of these files for this project so basically bye bye all these files byebye byebye adios baby okay anyways byebye i was speaking czech here bro anyways guys so cool so we got that we deleted all the files now let's go ahead and get started and build our first component right now we're still not done with the cleanup process by the way no no because we nee uh okay go into app.css okay and delete everything in there okay so let's go ahead and go to app.css okay go ahead yep boom oh just like that delete everything okay one thing we do is we like to do add margin zero for everything so we should like to say something something like this we'll say margin well this is not margin mark come on i hate it when they're just kind of like margin right there zero boom boom boom awesome sweet so that kind of removes the margin and everything because things like headers things like p tags things all those they have margin guys okay and so we try to remove them for that purpose okay awesome so we save that save everything say everything we have cool we have app.css and look at that he is already running uh he's already typing up clever program right here and you can see if i save my app.js file we should see clever programmer on here but we technically don't see the cloud pokemon here there's a reason why we don't see cloud pokemon here i mean sometimes you need to refresh the whole thing okay there we go and cool so all right so the first thing we need to build is what do you think guys the first thing to do of course when we go ahead and create any project we need to think about a few different things and one thing one really important thing being actually just how it's structured right so if we look at our for example application a few things happens here if you think about the structure of our app right we have things for example like the header right here right this is the header okay okay let me go ahead and freeze this this right here is the header right there that's the header okay so so we need to build the header after that what do we have we have things like a sidebar you see the sidebar right here that's a sidebar right here correct right then we have something called what is this what is this called this is i think what is like emails think about is just email container right can we think of it like that yeah yeah i called it emails view yeah so an email container exactly so that's what we're going to do all right next we have what what is this called what should we call this uh david i mean i think the easiest way to call it is just side icons basically just a few icons that take oh we got 20 donation let's go yo whoo um that's just what 20 euros i'm not sure what that is 20 something super chat i'm chesh i'm 20 cents 20 cents okay thank you so much you said 20 indian rupees thank you so much bro i appreciate it we really appreciate it yeah of course awesome sweet so cool all right let's get this party started right away uh so we know we figured that part out okay that's really really important next thing of course as we go into more components we have components for example like a logo component right we have things like an input component right we have things like the icons component where all of our icons your gear icon will always be used right that's really important and of course we have individual email components now why are we specifically talking about those that's a good question right it's because when you divide when you build projects in react you want to split them up into components right into small little sections right that's always the goal of of react.js components components components components components just think about like that okay you build components with components exactly you build components with components so that's always the goal right so let's go ahead and keep this going right here all right so we got this component the first component here we're going to work on today is which component david we are going to be first building the header exactly so we're building the header component which is this one right here so you can see i'm kind of clicking through it that's going to be the component we'll build right now all right in that case let's just go straight into it to build a header component what we need to do is actually create a header component that kind of looks like this so we'll say header not like this we'll say header boom and we'll close it out right we'll close it out now of course this means it had a component right here but just because we added this does not mean that it's there because what we need to do is we need to go down back to our source file source folder and we need to create a new file called header dot gs okay this is going to be our header component now inside the js there's a we need to create a function now component okay that's what we now need to do so to create a function component what are we going to use we're just going to use the extension and just type in r afc exactly it's what is the accession called by the way anybody knows uh es7 react redux yeah graphql yeah yes es7 it's it's a yeah just just you can sort it out if you if you search up es7 snippets or maybe you add react as well yeah uh it's gonna do it yeah and you can just type in r a fc because that that way it will create an arrow function exactly so now now if you do rfce by the way we have 369 viewers let's go you guys are epic let's also like this the video just to help us out much really appreciate it like this video subscribe for videos like this guys of course but like like like that way you know that way gets out to more viewers and that way you know we defeat this youtube algorithm which is so mean to us sometimes but it's okay we still live with it we love you at youtube sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes not cool so you can type into something like rfce right here yep and that will actually create the component for you right there see now this is this is what we have so now we have our header component okay cool all right so now let me let me do a little bit of organizat organizing in uh in the folders section just because make sure everything is at its place go ahead so nas just threw in the header.js which is amazing but uh i kind of like things uh kept tidy okay so let's go ahead and have a folder for components right and everything that is actually going to be a layout component like a whole something i like to have them a separate folder okay so i'll create a layout folder inside of components so right here this is the connections folder guys and then inside the components folder you will create a layout folder right here you see a layout right there right there right there and then what i would just do is pretty much just drag and drop the header into uh into layout and that will pretty much do its thing and now my file is there there we go so now the components is inside layout i'm not sure why it shows us like uh the way it shows it's so weird sometimes because we don't have any other folder in there but we will actually create it and then it will it will show normally just now that it's inside the layouts folder okay that's the only thing you have to understand okay exactly so how do that js and again we do this for cleanliness purposes for cleanliness purposes that's always the goal here okay okay all right so let's go ahead and i'm just gonna just command a command c for some reason that one got deleted so command v and this is our header component beautiful so let's go ahead and save this one cool so you can see now this is the header component that's in here and if we go to our react app it says headers not defined now why is that the case because if we go now to app.js you can see right there right we need to import our header that's the first thing we need to do so let's go and import our header so we can say import import header from where let me go ahead and remove this from what's like yeah it's a components folder and inside a layout and then you just slash what you see header right there this will actually import our header component this is how we use the you do that in react.js okay look at that now it's so good so that way if i go to header.js right here if i type in something like for example h1 cp right if i save that right now you see cp right there right cp right there that's how that works okay let's go back to our header gs uh app.js so now that way this now this way we can now work in very simple parallels we can now focus on specific components and work directly with them without having to try to look at the big picture too much right that's the cool part next up in the inside inside the components let's create a query header.css just to make sure we have css file correct actually no we can we don't need to do ahead of that css we are not doing header css because we are doing something fresh let's go we're going to install components which is we don't need a css file now exactly you might be confused but trust me you're gonna be so happy when you see this trust me so okay all right what is the first time we need to create david tell me so step number one you just want to go ahead and install style components yes yes let's go ahead and component that's step number one so let's go ahead and do this we're going to open up a new terminal here okay and we'll do npm install correct install and what are the styles is the style dash components i think so styled components yeah i think it's styled components yeah style yeah style dash components and what it will do guys is pretty much you can define the css inside of the javascript file which will make your code a lot more but i mean it's going to be confusing at the very beginning but once you get a hold of it it's going to be amazing because you can literally forget about all the html tags and you can create your own tags exactly that's going to be epic exactly it's going to be really really really really really really really really happy trust me something i've seen before we're going to write css in javascript how cool is that right so that's going to be the really cool part cool so awesome so we didn't and let's go now we need to go ahead and now import style couples right so how do we do that so you just want to say import styled from styled components and that's going to do it and we see something like styled components right there okay dish components yes cool so now we're in the in the hap now we are inside inside our header inside our the first thing we're going to create is we're going to create a wrapper right here you see that guys a wrapper and the wrapper is just going to wrap the whole header component right when we create the wrapper we're going to now you can see that the way he did is almost like a component right but it's going to be a style component and the way we do that is we simply go to const wrapper right there down below okay and then we'll and then we say style.div so instead of instead of basically doing div and then putting a class on it okay what we do with that is we do we create a wrapper almost like components right style component inside our gs file right here and then we say that it's a div so if we take a look at this now so if i save this right let's go save this you see nothing is in here but what i can do for example is i can say for example let's just let's just have an example i'll say here background background look at this color color and i will say for example here background color and i will say orange because why not okay all right see right there i just have background color orange now i can give it a height let's say height height of let's say 200 pixels like how sick is that like that is so sick honestly for us to be able to see all of this just like that so easily so easily it's insane and then i don't have to do a css file no nothing so let's go ahead we don't need this of course we don't need what do we need for for in this case let's actually go through the whole structure of the header because then it will start to make sense why we do what we do okay so the structure of the header that we're going to create of course is initially going to be the logo wrapper right there so it's going to be a local wrapper that's going to contain our icon right here and the gmail logo so you can see here what dave is doing is he creating a logo wrapper right there okay and then inside here he's going to create first he's going to create the this icon that we call the hamburger menu okay and then we're going to create after that a added simply an image of our gmail logo right there right there okay what kind of exactly there we go beautiful so he's done it right here div there's gonna be a menu icon and then image source is gonna be right here now yeah the menu icon is gonna be imported from material ui so we will just wait for that a little uh but by the way i will actually drop a link for uh in the chat and that's going to be the source of the uh what's that the logo there's the logo awesome thanks thanks thanks yeah i'm just gonna drop it in the chat so you guys can and if you can copy and go with it if you can't find it just go to like gmail type in gmail logo into you know into you know and that's pretty much just do images you know local you can just copy something like this for example okay that's a gmail logo right yeah i i think that's exactly the one yeah it's pretty much the one so don't worry so much about that okay awesome all right cool we got that let's go ahead and install our menu icon actually can we do that let's install a menu icon uh yeah we can we can totally do that so okay again we're going to use material ui icons material ui icons right there okay icons right there that's okay material icons right there cool uh to install materiality of course you need to install material ui icons and you need to install materialize as a package correct yes or no yeah you need to install the core and then you can install the icon let's store the core to install the core as you can see here i go to material ui right there to install the core all i simply say is i simply say like this npm install right there material ui core so let's go ahead and do that ah that's not what i want let's go to go ahead and go command v into our terminal and we say enter npm install material ui core that's going to be the first part all right installing that installing that you can see hopefully you can see the bottom portion i know we've kind of run the right hand side portion all right then what we have let me go ahead and put this on the left hand side so we can see us better right there you can pretty much just hit an up arrow and then delete core and then type in icons and now we're saying icons right there yeah it just makes things super easy nice okay install that that's gonna be sick all right i love this song it's so good beautiful so we got that portion all figured out let's go ahead and actually import our icon that we need to use and the aka that we're going to be using if we go and search up for let's say material material ui icons yeah actually this time what we will use here is going to be the menu icon i can just pretty much go ahead and drop it over there yes if i search up menu right there yeah this is this is where see it says menu if i click on this one it tells right there import menu icon from until ui your icons and that's exactly what we're going to do here so let's go ahead and do that right now right there beautiful okay and now we can just say menu icon and then close it and we will be good that's it pretty much you can see right there boom right there done let's check out how the application let's see how it looks like okay it says local wrappers how to find it yeah because yes that's actually the thing with styled components you need to uh pretty much define all these wrappers and custom tags always it's just something that you you shouldn't freak out if your app freaks out yeah uh it's probably because you forgot one of these pretty much every pretty much guys every single time that you go ahead and you have a div you're going to create a style component for it does that make sense makes sense yes exactly okay yes so we got that let's go ahead and save that portion all right oh we get the gmail icon right there beautiful let's go awesome that's what's up nice what's an accent all right should we get the search so next up we will have yeah we will do the search wrapper and that would actually be a little uh crazy that will have a few different things in there so first we will have the search wrapper right right there and the one we're going to create is this wrapper right here so you see right this right here this uh this right here the cert the search input that's going to be the so we call it the search wrapper so can we think about this again right now inside of that uh go ahead we need to see that little green a gray thing that's going to be the search bar wrapper yes whoops yeah because the search wrappers is going to basically be just like a div that's like that's going to contain the inputs right there and then the input itself is just going to be this part right here right that's going to be exactly the search bar wrapper that you have right here yeah and then notice that up here on line 5 i just imported an other uh icon but from material ui icons where is that and that's great yeah icon beautiful okay yeah and that's going to be the search icon so that's going to be that little magnifying glass right there up top yep which is going to take you to here exactly see right there right there exactly awesome sweet sweet sweet cool so now comes a input tag which is going to have a text nope it's going to have a type of text nice nice and we'll have a placeholder of search mail right because that's what we have in in gmail right search mail and just close it and we will have one more uh which is going to be the x expand more icon i just put it down below uh search icon and there will be that little down looking arrowish oh the one you're talking about this one right here correct this one right here beautiful yeah so this is the one we're talking about so you can see we created three different components okay one component is going to be if we look at this right this is going to be the what this is going to be the um the search icon this is going to be the input and this is going to be the actual experiment icon you can see that how everything here is pretty much a component okay component component component component okay just keep that in your mind component component component right and just all it is is just boxes it's just rectangles that's all pretty much it right not a big deal at all cool all right next up so we cut those now do we need to create of course i'm guessing style components for them right uh yeah let's let's actually do that right now while we are at it so so let's go we wouldn't we would need to have a con what's happening we wanted to have a const of a search wrapper right how do people see my email i already have people sending me emails what the heck how where does he show it where you guys are sneaky i don't even see what it is but anyways okay let's keep going i mean guys let's just let's don't send me emails okay don't send me emails guys yeah yeah let's do it let's do it okay let's go ahead so search rapper anyway so search rapper that's gonna be the first i'm going to create which is this one right there yeah we have a stock component right there uh you misspelled const hold on hold on hold on hold on let me hold on let me type okay next up i'm going to create x uh that's pretty much it we don't need we don't need to create a search eye no no no no we haven't no no uh we have the search bar wrapper as well oh this one okay go ahead yes right here that's another div oh we got a super chat from i am raven thank you so much you are the best my friend appreciates the donation as as always beautiful thank you thank you so much awesome let's check out how our app looks like okay let's take a look we'll save this right now save that and now let's go back to our react app and this is what we have i know i know no no no i know i know i know it looks hideous i i think it's production ready yeah okay let's put the production goal okay that's fine that's fine so we got that next up let's create a next part which is going to be what which is going to be these icons icons wrapper yes see these icons right here this is the one we're going to create okay all right awesome switch so that actually will have just i think like one of the four different uh material ui icons yes so i'm just gonna go ahead and grab all of those and then put them uh onto line eight see if you can scroll up a little uh and okay oh that's another icon okay so we have yeah so we have okay so here check this out so we have the help outline icon which is going to be this this specific one okay then we have the settings icon which is going to be this one then we have the apps icon is it this one uh yes the apps icon is going to be that nine little dots oh this one right here okay this one yeah and then the account circle icon is gonna be this one right here right there beautiful okay pretty simple pretty simple okay let's go ahead and again we imported all those from material ui as you can see right here okay next up so we have the icons wrapper and that's going to grab those icons go ahead and throw them in there beautiful settings icon icon account icon beautiful and let's go ahead for let me go ahead and put this here right the icons wrapper let's go ahead and create a style deal so i'm going to say let me talk let me create this so i'm going to say damn it go icons wrapper wrapper is going to be equal to styled dot div guys style.diff right there beautiful okay so now go ahead and save this and if we go back to our react tab this is what we have you can see again it looks hideous definitely fine completely fine right oh we have another super chat thank you so much super chat uh let's not talk about that right you guys that's that's that's a different explanation so let's go ahead let's focus more so on what we're doing right now okay so thank you so much cool let's go ahead and keep going keep going keep going uh let's now go ahead and style these specific portions okay let's style this the specific portions so we have what we have the wrapper and what are we going to be using for this rapper just in general let's think about this huh uh so yeah that's actually uh another new thing on the channel like we're going hard on css today because we always use uh display flex but it's just outdated and not that cool so we will use display grid okay okay let's go ahead and try this display grid so inside the wrapper let's go ahead and do what display so go ahead you do it you're typing you're typing go type type type type type okay or type okay so we will just say uh display and instead of flags we will type in grid right and that's actually a new uh something you can pretty much go ahead and search up the documentation but you should think about it as a display flex row and a display flex column combined so it has the power of both of those and it's just uh super useful especially if you want to create a flexible website yeah you can see for example here this is the cool part about this is that i can do i can create these grids right here just by saying for example display grid and i can even do give it like row so for example hey i will have columns and and the first column is going to be 40 pixels if i zoom in here if i zoom in on here for example you can see here it says the the first columns will be 40 pixels then the second columns will be 50 pixels then the middle cons will be auto right here and then third column is going to be 50 and then back to 40. that's really cool part this stuff you can define is just simply by using css how insane is that i think so i think that's pretty insane okay all right beautiful let's go continue on oh yeah yeah uh so once we are cool with that okay we need to ensure that uh the how do you say that all these uh like we have those columns set up yeah in the instance let's think about this which comes we want to set up well we have here we have a few columns one is going to be this column yep right and that and we know that it's going to be like 270 pixels so there's three columns that we need to create and so to define those three columns is pretty simple if you look at our guide you see how it says grid template columns let's define them you can see here uh data's typing grid template columns right there which is exactly what we're typing right here right right there and we're going to define it 270 pixels auto 170. so what does this mean this means that this means this means that if we go ahead and refresh this let's go ahead and refresh this i'll save this right there this is a fusible you see by the way it right away went to its places right if i go to for example let me go uh well that's not what i want if i for example go to and i say arrow okay you can see here that 270 this is this is this one that's this uh right here column then the auto is going to be the auto so it's going to be changed depending on the size exactly it's like flex one it's going to change depending on size and then 170 pixels that's going to be this one okay make sense guys this is how the cool part about display grid with grid columns okay awesome let's go ahead and keep going david okay so once we are cool with that uh we want to actually add a little bottom uh border which is going to be one pixel solid and it's going to be light gray it's just a nice little touch that what the guys over at google did uh to gmail they have this uh bottom bottom border so we'll just go ahead and type in border bottom and it will be a one pixel solid and light gray yeah right there so let's go ahead boom cool so i don't want that so if we go now go to here you see now we have a very light light light uh border at the bottom here beautiful okay all coming together nice i like it i like it okay let's keep going keep going now we will give it a height of 70 pixels right because again here hi we have also around 70 pixels right here beautiful right here awesome all right exactly nice and we want to align the items to center so that means uh vertically everything is going to be centered out and it's not going to have this uh roller coaster style exactly so you want to be basically we want to center a vertical center align everything right pretty simply okay let's go ahead and take a look at what david is doing here align item center beautiful and you can see now now it's not it's not still not as pretty as we want it to be so if we refresh this right still space we want it to be but that's completely fine because let's go right click inspect down but on this one exactly because the thing is like the logo just messes up the whole thing but we will fix it don't worry we'll fix everything right so let me make this larger it's larger okay cool so you can see now this is what we got now we have this specific you see now this is a grid you can see how it's outlined the grid right there this is the grid we have you can see this is going to be the logo wrapper then right here let me go ahead and move myself more to the middle maybe right here so you guys can see my our bet are better we have this specific portion logo wrapper then we have the watch the search wrapper and then of course everything else now the reason why it's at the bottom right now is because this thinking gmail icon is pushing everything to the bottom okay pushing up to the bottom so let's change that right i just want to add a little quick disclaimer if you are using safari it's not acting okay just don't worry about the safari okay nobody cares about safari gosh darn it david okay so uh next up we can we can get start like we are cool with the the overall wrapper styling now let's dive into the logo wrapper right yes yeah that part exactly so we will go deeper and deeper and let's just get started let's go so the logo wrapper will is going to have a height of 45 pixels beautiful right okay obviously we are going to use display grid okay just for the sake of learning because it's so good uh yep and we will have a uh we will actually go ahead and define again the columns so it's going to be like we will have a grid template uh columns okay right because right now because right now it's pretty much in rows you can see here right this is in rows we have row one and row two so by given to put it into a column we can put it into columns you can see right there so let's just do that right now yeah okay so the first column is going to take up 25 of the width of the whole wrapper and the other one is going to use flex one so basically use up all the other space and this is yeah go on go ahead keep going keep going okay uh let's save and let's see if it fixes because uh we might need to add the other div so we don't have just so specifically you see this is still still still still because i think you you've misplaced good grid template columns you didn't say it right because you did not type it right right there template now of course the issue here is this gma clone is still way too large right we don't need that guys we don't want that so what we're going to do is we're going to wrap this image into a div just like david did here right here i'm going to wrap this image but we're going to wrap this image into a style component so i will say for example here let me write let me type this and i will say here logo i will say logo for example here right right there that's the logo okay beautiful so okay logan defined that's completely fine then i go here to the bottom and i say here let's go ahead and do const logo equal style dot div dot div right there and i will say right there and now i'm going to give it my my uh what's it called my items that i want so look at this cool beautiful so now what's going to happen this local well it's pretty simple in this logo i'm going to give it a number one height of height of 45 pixels 45 pixels okay right there save that okay that way our logo is 45 plus and you can see here right now see it's 45 pixels but the but the but the the gmail actual local image is not actually 45 pieces unfortunately so what we can do is check this out just by saying things like this is we're going to mix display flex and the logo look at this i will say here display flex look at the display flex and then i will type in after that right there good so save that okay and look at that right away gmail goes straight to his position right right away that's the cool part about it we just said display flex boom it is right there and of course and we can do it applause for us which is amazing hey there we go let's get going so we had that display effects which is awesome let's go ahead and now put this specific icon in its rifle place as well okay so what we are going to do is actually go back to the logo wrapper and we will get started with the nesting uh css correct into each other and it's going to be epic so inside of the logo wrapper i want to go ahead up here and just show it uh visually see if you can scroll up right there yeah so the area that i highlighted so if i if you see inside of logo wrapper we have this other div inside of that so that's exactly what we will do uh inside of the logo wrapper okay yes yes so let's go down and let's take a look at that okay so what we were doing here is we will just type in div because we are targeting the div inside of the logo wrapper does it make sense i hope it does yeah so we're talking this specifically right there see there's there right there okay cool yep and what we will say is we will go ahead and say display grid once again and this is where the power of display grid comes in because you know what uh display flex you would have to say justify content center and then align item center and that way it would be centered both horizontally and vertically correct but with display grid we can say place dash items and then just say center and it would just go ahead and both vertically and horizontally center it so if we go ahead and save it i think it should it sound this but again and then but then that screwed up the the gma because this div not only affected that not only did it affect the logo right but it also affected um like it affected this icon and also affected this so it kind of overrode the flags that we had before which is the issue right so to prevent that all we simply say we say here the menu so we say for example we create a new one called menu right there see just like that okay and this down the menu icons inside that right there and so what we do now is go ahead and create a new const menu menu style component right here we'll say styled style.div beautiful yeah style.div beautiful and inside now then what we're going to create is we will go ahead and now say display grid just for that menu so we'll say display grid okay grid place items what is it called place item center right center place items yeah place dash item center right there exactly place item center boom right there so you can save that just like that and of course not done yet hold on now we need to remove this portion boom remove this portion save that and look at that now this is exactly what we want right look at that so now we have our gmail icon right here we have our menu icon and it looks pretty damn good like that is pretty sick i would say right like look at this i mean compared to what we have here it's pretty much [ __ ] the same thing i think it even looks like it even looks better like how cool that i what like guys what's up what's up google uh yeah watch out for us watch out for us we're coming we're coming google that's how that's how good we are exactly that's how good we are awesome thank you so much let me get some amazing comments guys you guys rock awesome thank you so much for the amazing comments beautiful so we got that specific part next up let's go ahead and work on the next portion which is going to be this input portion right here let's work on this input portion right here okay exactly now we don't actually need to worry about the search wrapper uh because normally if we use display flex we would have to add flex flexo one but since we have done that up in the wrapper with the grid template columns auto uh we don't have to worry about that so we can just pretty much skip it but it's actually nice that we defined it so we can automatically this auto right here guys will define the width of this search wrapper that's the cool part about it because the search wrapper is just another column you see everything to the side okay let's keep going all right let's keep going so next up we will go into the search bar wrapper right not that one we're gonna leave it out okay yeah and we're gonna go into the search bar wrapper so that one and for that we would actually give a nice little background color uh yes guys and it will yeah uh actually that will be the whole wrapper so for that we will have this sort of light grayish color which is going to be one no it's going to be f1 f3 f4 yep nice nice beautiful okay good good good good good and it will have a width of 750 pixels right okay so that way it just uh goes all the way out and it has a fixed width now should we have okay maybe we cannot do a fix with later on but that's okay don't worry about that so we'll do that something later i mean for for now it's good no it's good yeah and this will have display grid as well again the reason why is because you can see here right you can see here that we have one column second column and third column and this is what we're going to use display create any situations like this okay exactly and right now the grid uh template column template column yes this is gonna be what it's going to be ten percent then auto steps for this seven percent autofocus so it's going to be 10 for this auto for this and 7 for this meaning that this is 10 percent right then we have basically 90 this is going to be 80 or actually this is going to be 90 no 87 percent on 83 percent no 83 yes 83 yeah yeah yeah and it's like you see that that's how that works with with uh with uh auto now i kind of want to change this to 100 though i don't want to keep it constant i kind of just want to do like this because right there see i think that makes a little better so the reason we can't make it a hundred percent is that go back to gmail please okay let's see this so if you go back to the original gmail and actually full screen it this is original no no uh just full screen the app do i have to yeah because it will prove the point oh yeah so i see what you mean so basically it sets the max so here's what we can do to do that we can set a max width of 750 pixels look at this right so we can say for example if i go to rectap i can say something like yes the width is 100 so we can say for example with 100 but i can say max width max width max width is 750. yep and so that means now if i go ahead and expand this look at this if i expand this it will only expand to 750 boom right there see yeah pretty cool huh that's what 10 years of experience yeah yeah yeah [Laughter] right you tend to just kind of stuff often and then you learn how to do it right so right there but there you go i see why you are the instructor inside of our course profit with javascript which is linked down below link down below guys profit pwg one of the best courses out there on the planet literally no not one of the best the best course the best on the planet to become a javascript developer okay keep going all right cool so next up uh we will do place items center right so just so we have everything centered out and we don't have to worry about uh centering them in any ways so we would just type in place items center and i made a typo again cool and we will give this one a height of 45 pixels as well okay and give it a border radius okay uh ready six pixels again and how he kind of is doing that right because he's given the height just how we have in the original gmail right then he's centering everything so make sure that to make sure that everything is centered right like this right here so make sure it's ever all centered and border radius is to make it kind of this concave portion right here you see it kind of like rounds up very nicely that's the border radius portion okay let's keep going let's go inside ah we just got the troll in the comments somebody registered a new google account called g mail and he goes like hey guys why are you copying us that's funny it's hilarious i love that okay cool so look at this now this looks very very similar to what we have inside the gmail original icon like that is pretty sick i was saying that's pretty sick guys really important guys we are now at how many likes are we at how many likes are we i don't even know we are at 550 likes let's go let's go let's push those likes keep going let's keep it to it let's let's take this to 600 guys you guys got to 600 like this video come on 600 i know you got this i know you got this 600 likes come on come on we have somebody who says i am 11 years old and i love this channel thank you so much thank you so much okay where is that i'm trying to find that guy amazing oh you guys are amazing 572 let's go if i send you two comments keep it up keep it up five nine five five six come on can we get this six seven hundred can we get to 600 come on come on let's go that's what i'm talking about that's okay anyways let's keep going yeah you guys are the best always let me make sure all right okay oh good all right moving on someone goes i'm two years old okay okay that's fine too all right so we've got so we will go ahead and start nesting css once again now we will target the input uh field in in in the middle and we will give it a width of uh 100 so basically it will take up as much space as it actually can right and next up we will give it a height of 30 pixels so it will almost take up the whole wrapper but it's oh my god why what's wrong with the indentation and then we will give it a background of none so that way we don't have that ugly uh background look to it we will also delete the border so we will give that a border of the none as well and we will give it a font size of 18 pixels okay so basically we will just make it make it a little bit bigger and now what we need to do is add a uh colon focus because now as if you if you actually go ahead and click inside of the uh yeah you see all that yeah it looks like it looks horrible like it's like yeah how do you know somebody is a beginner web developer and actually haven't watched our channel yeah they leave it there so again and the way the way we can actually track it to make sure the way it works if is if i inspect down but on this one you can see right like i go the input i can actually force look at i can force hover or i can force focus right i force focus right here and then like uh let's go force uh not for for state focus within active no yeah because i actually hold on hold on come on right there let's see if i force focus you can see now if i scroll down if i scroll down you can see it says outline you see focus visible uh i'll go back go back to here go back to here see it says focus where is it where is it oh my god where is it hold on hold on focus let's do one more time for state focus now okay right there so you can see here oh you saw it right there it's like it said grid outline offset so outline right there that's how we go ahead and go to outline we go outline and we said okay fine okay find it [Laughter] so save that okay save that and this is what we have so now we have no outline it's exactly what we want now we need okay look how sick that looks that looks pretty sick i would say should we change the colors of these icons a little bit i think these icons are a little bit more like yes i think so look i can actually actually inspect them on this icon that we currently have inside inside and in the original in the original gmail right literally we're kind of we're hacking a little bit here but that's completely fine then look i have the color right here 5f6368 so i will go ahead and copy this and now just copy it and i will give you the actual uh what's that called div that you want to target because material ui icons has this mui svg icon dash root and for that we will need to give a color and that's where you put it yes i think so there's multiple ways you can put that but let's for now let's put that there there's more ways you can put that actually there's one i think this is how you do it uh well there's might be wrong i mean so there's there's actually a few ways you can do it one way because you can do it this way and so now you can see the icon there another way you can actually do is check this out guys here you want to see something cool look so here's what you do you can do for example let's say i can do here i can say for example search search search okay right and what's what that's going to happen is that's actually going to be the search the search icon wrapper look at this look at this you'll see what i mean hold on hold on hold on that's not it hold on hold on uh wrap it up then what i do is i go to search like a wrapper i scroll down this is the cool part about style components so watch this carefully okay i can do const and i say search icon wrapper right icon wrapper wrapper equals look at this styled check this out styled search icon and now inside here i can define the color of this dang bro i can define what's happening there i can define now the color of this specific uh let me go ahead and put the tab on here right here i can define a color which is going to be which color this color there so that means if i remove this right here even if i remove this portion right if i place it into this search icon wrapper right if i go here right there see now this wrapper this look at this i'm not sure why that went all the way that just [ __ ] up everything else there because we only defined three columns and now we have so i go ahead i can do command right there so save that look at that you see now this icon has that color nice how cool is that huh how cool is that that's what happened is i define i define my own style component right there right so called search icon wrapper and i said okay let's go ahead and make the style component make that be what make that be a uh where did i just say it what did i do what did i do where is it where is it really right there it's a bit about yeah search like a wrapper and i say it's a style component with a search icon as kind of like the input it is almost like inheriting that class it's inheriting the icon and then it's redefining the color of the icon that's it that's cool yeah but we can also really cool yeah but you can also of course put that inside here so inside there let's put the svg root back into here so go ahead david okay muisvg icon dash root bomb color and you have it on your yeah alfred yeah so let me copy that here boom command c and i'll do command v right here okay save that now every single eye comes like that and look how sick that looks guys it looks so good so good hey so good so good so good i got it music that we listen together come on [Laughter] all right keep going let's go ahead and do this we need now a few things we need to fix now that's going to be which which which thing so we need to now fix yeah this position last but not least in the header we will have the icons wrapper on the right hand very right hand side so for that we will use display grid once again and we will have a grid dash template uh columns and that will now now i'm going to do something something crazy go ahead go ahead so what i will do what is it what is it i'm curious i'm a lazy guy okay so if i wanted uh flexo one for what times i would have to type auto four times but i'm a lazy dude so what i will say is i'm just gonna say repeat oh just repeat what four times auto whoa hold on hold on hold the phone hold the phone david hold on oh [ __ ] really wow that's cool damn that deserves this right here damn that's good yeah that is what i'm talking about holy moly so this i'm not gonna type all these stuff out like so this is saying my time is more valuable than that are you sure i don't have time time to just type some of them stuff okay i can go grid template columns repeat for auto means that basically every single column in here that means i will repeat auto four times it's gonna be auto for all of these support it's gonna be so basically auto it's gonna it's going to basically equally different it equally space out all the columns that is pretty sick i'm i'm pretty sure i am that's oh wow i'm actually i'm that's pretty cool i'm just save it please save it oh let's go that's what i'm saying that's what's up look at that that's awesome okay let's go keep going dude all right next up uh we will have we will once again want to set the colors of those uh material ui squeegee icon awesome root thingies and we will just gonna give it a i mean you know that color yeah i got the color i got you i got you i got you one right there dope that's the color so now the colors back so you can see now that these are the ones of color so you can see look how close that looks look at that okay now we'll probably add some space a little bit later on in a little bit that's completely fine don't worry about that but i think the really cool part is the fact that like it's spaced out it looks good it's functional it's the awesome part right and one thing to keep track of is you can see how we're putting a class in here inside this style div so this is almost like kind of like traversing a tree right what's going to happen is it's almost like you want to think about this that that hold on let me show this to you right here let me do a brush so you just added a b in there come on you're really bad bro hold on so we have this icons wrapper right here okay what's going to happen is we're going to target the mu mui srg icon inside this icons wrapper that's a cool part about components and so for example if i wanted to also like let's say if i want to target something else i can say for example like i know image let's say for example to target an image that's within the icons wrapper you see what i mean that's how that works again really really really useful right this is what style components are so good this is what we can't do in inside normal css unfortunately in like normal css yeah but inside components we can and so we do because that's how we do because cool okay cool all right exactly with that yeah i just want to address a few comments uh in the chat section so the reason why we have part one two and three is because we are not just going to give you guys the front end we are actually going to build a fully functional email client that you can send and receive emails with uh but in order to actually process all that stuff that we are actually teaching because there's a lot of new stuff here in terms of like style components we have display grid and all these other stuff we will just go a little slower and today is only going to be front end only but then as we proceed further we will have more stuff in there exactly exactly and one other thing guys we are 662 likes let's get to 700 guys come on like this video 700 likes you got this almost 700 come on let's get to 700 we're cooling at 664. i know you guys can do it come on come on come on come on come on come on come on oh that's awesome you got to 600 let's we'll celebrate when you get when we get to 700. okay whoa 6.85 holy moly already six ninety two eight nine come on come on i'm not going for it for 6.99 let's do it let's do it guys this is way too good this is way too much fun let's go 700 you guys are the best we love you so much okay next up next up let's can we add some margin here i'll kind of want to add some margin to to this specific icon i mean we can we can do that i kind of want to do that uh to do that i let's go ahead for this specific portion we're going to say um i'm going to say margin left let's do margin left of 8 pixels because i just want to add some a little bit of a little bit spacing spacing is actually very important in code just so you know because if you look at here for example you can see there's spacing in this specific element this is actual gmail and if you look at an actual gmail you can see this gmail let me see i'm going to show it to you has spacing also it has padding left six pixels and padding right even like two pixels for example but they are very nice as based out which is a really cool portion that i like like you see here right there look at that beautiful all right cool so we got oh look look at that even though you see how it's spaced out and this is they're actually using grid i'm guessing right are they they're using what's right they're actually using grid i feel like no i don't know i feel like they are i feel like they are using flags never mind they're just sniffing i mean they just could still fight at some point they use flux and then they use grid like all right i don't know we got that it looks good okay next up what the next thing we're going to work on guys is what is what it is going to be the sidebar so it's going to be the left portion the very left portion yes that exact part uh honestly i haven't ever seen that pause inbox button so we will just forget about that but don't worry about that apart from that we will have everything yeah so look so here's the thing now to create a sidebar we have to consider not just a side but we have to consider the sidebar and also this right hand portion and also like that's this specific portion right this specific portion as well right so we consider everything exactly and now to consider everything what you have to think about is okay well how do i put it into a component and how do i style it to weigh so that it's in grid and columns right think about if you had this in a column right if you had this in the column right here yeah see column column what's going to happen is pretty simple we will go ahead and actually create a component called main which is going to contain it's going to contain all of these other columns the sidebar column the views column whatever it's called it's called the the inbox column and then the site icons column what am i called so let's create that by the way i'm going to go to app.js that's not what i want oh come on you got it yeah i got it how do i okay command p oh there we go app.js okay inside the header we're going to now continue created to create a main component like this right there okay create a main component and of course now we need to create it inside our file instead of components so inside component let's go ahead and do file new file that goes into layer thank you thank you and then i'm going to type in rf to create the component beautiful and that is now our component so we have with the main component right here and of course we need to now import that component inside the main so we're going to do that right now to do that all we simply say is we'll say import main let's go ahead and close this out main from from from what from like this i'm going to say component boom we'll say layout slash layout slash what main no main.js just me right there okay and so now we can import that main component if we go to main.js let's go and type in cp just to make sure it's all working go right boom right there you see now we have cp right there just really small nothing too much but but right there yeah awesome so cool now within this we're going to create what we're going to create three more we're going to create three more components three more columns exactly that's again we create this as a wrapper as a container and i'm going to create three more columns all right now let's go ahead and call this a wrapper wrapper right there nice thank you okay okay it says wrap is undefined again because we're going to create add a style component so let's say import import styled so import styled from styled components component components right there awesome okay that way it will give us the ability to do const for example wrapper is equal to styled style dot div right there boom right there see style.diff okay save that beautiful i just wanna plug in something real quick so guys i don't know if you've noticed that we actually haven't ever used uh class name in here yeah we don't have to worry about that anymore because literally all these style things are local to that specific file that we define them in so in case you would miss miss out or you're not following any naming convention and you mistakenly give the same class name to you to uh divs this will never happen again with styled components so it's it's super safe and it makes your life so much easier yes yes always always always and again guys i to i just kind of want to be serious here we have a five day react.js challenge coming up february 22nd completely free for you where we're going to be building a slack clone just like how we're building a gmail clone here in five days you'll get to learn how to build a slackline you'll get to learn react.js and you'll get to most importantly kickstart your career as a react gs developer free no questions asked you'd be stupid not to do it i mean not so you'd be used to but it would be stupid not to do it link is below it's the second link right react.js challenge check it out join starting february 22nd you do not want to miss out awesome so i just dropped it in the chat too so it's pretty hard to miss from now on so inside the wrapper as we said we have one we're going to create three more components one is going to be side the sidebar component right cyber component then we're going to create which component the emails you component right yes let's go to emails view emails view uh let's go do like this email you know emails view component okay and then finally it's going to we will have the what i called it side icons but if you want to call it like maybe shortcuts or something yes i think that's cool all right you go ahead and i'll take the drive okay so what i would do now is i actually went ahead and already created this sidebar.js file because we still need to do that and now we also need to create the emails view dot js file okay as well as the uh i think it's showing up yep as well as the s well what i was typing i was typing in the wrong place and now we can just we can just say side icons dot js that's going to be another new file and so that and to make sure that these are actually working uh what i will do is just go into each and every single one of those files and just type in rafce and that will pretty much go ahead and create a react arrow function component i will repeat that with all these three files which is good and now i can pretty much go ahead and go back to main.js right and we can i don't even know where it is oh yeah here it is and we can we can just import all of them okay into main.js so yes that is correct so we'll just grab this and boom right there awesome look at that so we have now emails you were imported from the emails view right then we're importing sidebar then again and the reason why we have dot slash is because the main component is now within right it is now within the layout folder that's we don't have to say layout slash or component slash layout we simply just say you know dot slash right there dot slash okay exactly that's cool and you can see now everything's working now we don't see anything of course but it's okay that's not an issue i mean we what we can do what i like to do is just uh just to visually show it that we have this sidebar we have the emails and i'm just gonna type in random uh stuff in here so we can just see that everything is actually in there and it's working and we are still waiting for the icons to say emails view you can see right there and his site icon so he just simply just put those in there so let's go ahead and say yeah beautiful that's the icons all right so oh dope okay so everything is showing up so let's get started with the uh sidebar.js file i think that's going to be like we can just go from left to right and so for that we're going into sidebar.js and as as we are already kind of used to it we will get started with a rapper uh which is going to uh make us make our app freak out immediately so we will just say const wrapper right here you see wrapper that's gonna be the wrapper okay beautiful so we will go ahead and import style from oops style from styled components yes good good and we can quickly go ahead and define or like declare the wrapper which is going to be the cost wrapper yes style.div exactly okay good good good awesome dope okay what what what's so funny no i'm just looking at your inbox i know oh grace stop big fan i don't know how he got the email i haven't shown the email that's the crazy part oh but anyway let's keep going let's go now let's go who knows let's keep going yeah and so inside of our wrapper we will have the so first let's take a look at how it looks like because on the top or on the left hand side we will on the top have the compose button with the pause inbox button we can actually add that to like i don't know for now let's do composer now okay okay so we would we will have a compose wrapper because uh it's it's so much easier when you have everything in boxes and organized and all that stuff yes so first thing first we will have a compose uh rapper yes and oh uh right there and that's going to create that and then inside there we're going to create a compose button that's just like this okay right here okay nice so i will just add in it as a comment for now so we will actually create the compose button as a completely different um nice what is that component yes yes yes yes and we will also have a side buttons nice so these buttons are going to grab these buttons right here you see how we have these buttons right here that's going to be exactly and then inside there we're going to have like an input inbox button a start button a snooze button and so forth but we're going to define those a little bit later on okay exactly that's just yeah exactly it's just so cool to just figure out like how we will go about it and then down below uh like right below it uh we will have i called it a meat wrapper because it it actually integrates with the google meat so we would just have that too so the meat wrapper the meat wrapper is going to be this one guys you see how we have the meat right here that's going to be the meat wrapper right there you see i'm kind of as i'm making these as his type i'm making these outlines you can see right here this can be very helpful for you guys to to see how you know this stuff kind of comes together okay yes and then right below that we will have a hangout hangouts rapper and that's gonna be the last stuff yes and actually where like way down below at the very bottom uh we have that this one right there i call the bottom rapper bottom rapper it's a weird name you got david button rapper the bottom rapper how would you call bottom rapper the bottom rapper rapper bottom icons rapper cool yes yes yes yes the bottom wrapper yes it's got the button i wrap the whole button on it buttonhole okay now uh don't save the app because it's going to just go crazy okay but what we would do is once again i'm a lazy dude so i'm just gonna uh copy paste like we will have the comp compose we will have side buttons right there uh meat hangouts and bottom yeah i think i think it's enough so i'm just going to go ahead and then copy paste all these uh things in here because all of these are actually divs so we can we can we can pretty much do it nice and yeah it's cool and let's take a look at what's happening now okay so let's see if we go ahead and now save this okay let's go direct app and if we save that yeah we should pretty much have nothing yes okay cool so uh actually let's go back to main.js because uh we need to create all those uh columns so for that we will once again use display grid so actually remember like all the sidebar the emails view and then the icons are side by side next to each other so for that we will use once again display uh grid nice and we will have a grid template columns and then remember that on uh in the header we had 270 pixels for for the logo and all that uh left side of portions nice so we will do 270 pixels then auto and then instead of 170 like we did in the header we would just use 50 because otherwise it wouldn't make any sense to have such a big uh shortcut thing okay good good good let's keep going so this right here so this portion right here guys again this right here i'm gonna go to the arrow tool this right here is going to be the 270 right that's gonna be that one the auto is going to be this one and then the 50p is going to be the little small part right here that's it you see that's we did we now defined three separate columns this is all we have to do in inside display great that's the really cool part about this okay let's keep going okay so we got that portion okay let's go ahead and save this up to make sure we got it let's go back to oh and look at that right there see email's auto you see right there imazada was already put in the center and the sidebar is already here and then the icon is already here beautiful it's exactly what we want right and we can use them later on i can even give them like a custom some kind of a color later on as well but that's fine let's just keep going with what we need to do and focus on the sidebar exactly so for the sidebar uh let's take a look at what we will have so let's get let's actually get started with the compose uh item so what we will do is we will just add a new um what's that called component which we will call compose and this is this is where we will need to import a new uh button so what we will do is go into the compose folder create a brand new folder and we will call it uh oops i'm in the wrong folder so we will need to go into compo like make sure to you that you go into components and you want to create a buttons folder let's go and do that right there so inside the components we're going to get our buttons folder right there right there so you can see we have a bonus folder right there beautiful okay awesome and then inside there we're going to create a compose button right so let's go ahead and do that yeah in just a second because i actually initialized the button okay now we're cool so inside of the buttons folder uh we will have a compose dot js okay let's go ahead and do that so let's go right click and we'll say new file of course and so i think that david has done that for us not yet not yet do you want to do it i'm still so i'm just so i'm just i'm just doing compose.js and we are good on that side okay good and i'm just going to type in rafce once again react arrow function export component boom and let's actually imported it right away inside of our sidebar so what we'll say is import and then go up a level of folders and we was oh geez yeah import compose i'm a bit faster than i'm thinking ahead two way too fast way too fast david way too fast yeah i'm using safari that's why i'm fast come on sorry it just made me cracked up it's funny so what i would say i will go up a level of folders go into buttons and then inside of that i will i will grab the compose component and it should actually uh fix things for us and again there is something the reason why we're doing this this up means because we're calling the sidebar remember the sidebar is where the sidebar is in here okay so we actually need to go up we need to go up a level we need to go up from here sidebar back to the components level right in here and then down to the buns level right so this means go up back to the components level that's what this means then we go down to the buttons level and then we go to the compose button that's why we're doing that specifically okay okay let me go ahead and save this just so we have it okay good yes okay so back to sidebar okay we're cool we're cool all righty so next up what we will do is i just added a compose text into the compose button so we can see that it is actually getting imported and now what we will do is once again use material ui and we will use the add icon from material ui that's going to be that little uh plus sign yes exactly uh yep icon that's so real that's good that's going to be this icon right here guys see this add icon that's the add icon we're talking about okay next up next up because we are using uh what's that styled components we will name it uh we will rename the div wrapper so we will say import uh what's that styled from styled components so that's good on that part but we need to uh define it so we will say cons wrapper equals tile dot div backtick nice nice nice nice cool and we will add the add icon in here and we will make the font size of large we will just pass it in because once again these icons are at the end of the day they are components uh components as well yes and they accept oh by the way we just got 800 likes let's go let's get to 900 guys let's get to 900 likes can we get that i know we can't come on let's go that's sick man we got that bro oh man we can get to 900 likes i know it at least 850 at least 850. trust me i know it anyways all right you guys are the best as always thank you so much nice so hey what's up welcome everybody i saw a few people uh a few people saying that it's their first stream so welcome nice so cool guys so you can see here we have the compose we have the compose text which kind of represents specifically this specific portion we have the add icon right here which represents this portion now if we go ahead and save this you can see that really that doesn't really look good at all because if i go to here it's just kind of here so we need to put that into a button so how do we do that right now so to put that into a button that should be pretty simple right well the first thing to do is we need to define a this wrapper and to tell it the width and the width for the add icon and the width for the p tag right so to do that i will say this what yeah display grid yeah what we would say we will say display grid okay we're using display today then we'll go to something then we will have hold on template columns yes we'll say grid we'll say template slash columns columns okay and here we'll say we will say 35 and then auto 35 in auto meaning that the add icons will be 35 and the compose could be auto so you can see that's that's pretty cool now also we're going to give it a what should we give it do we give it a width the compose icon is that was there wait for the composite or no uh it's going to be auto okay with his auto okay that's fine with is going to be auto with is going to be auto now of course let's now make this really nice style you can see here we have like this box shadow and we have some border radius so let's actually do this for now i'm going to say here i'm going to say background color just so we have something background color let's make that orange i know i know i know i know it's going to hideous don't worry just just listen up here right so background color is going to be orange okay right now of course now of course i know i know yeah i know i know i know i know i know i know but don't worry about this okay that's music yeah i didn't know it really was but now what we're going to do is we'll go ahead and well for one let's align them center so we'll say align items line items say uh center items equal to centered for everything cool item center that you seek a center is basically the plus and the compose uh is there a height of this or no should we give it a height no we actually have padding so we're going to give padding to this specific portion let's go ahead and give some padding to this we'll say padding okay and we're going to give it six pixels top and so forth so look at this six pixels then 32 pixels and i'm explaining i will explain what that means in a second here 32 pixels six pixels and then eight pixels so what does this mean i want you to remember here one simple thing something called trouble right you're like holy [ __ ] what does this mean us well don't worry about this i got you okay whenever you are doing something like for example let's say padding right whenever they do that for example right i'm like ah trouble trouble trouble okay let's go back to now b ah let's go back to here uh freeze okay so let me type in again one more time here i will say trouble trouble okay all right that's what you always get into yes yeah i know i know that's just me so this right here means t t for top r for right b for bottom alpha left so you can see t six pixels t you see 32 is the right six pixels is bottom eight is left this is how we remember these short cuts like how cool is that trouble just keep that in mind trouble i get in trouble you get in trouble right and so whenever you do shortcuts top right bottom left it's as simple as that guys honestly and that's pretty cool i'll say top right over under yeah bottom left empty yeah i know so that why the break gives us a border uh a padding so you can see it creates a padding next up let's go ahead and actually add a border radius to give it some a little more concave looks like border radius is going to be in this case 50 pixels boom boom save that you see hey beautiful that looks great okay all right awesome then we're going to do is let's add a box shadow now the back shadow is going to be it's going to look a little bit like this box shadow and i'm going to copy from over here because we took it it took us a while to figure this box shadow out so we'll just do back shut up with this one right there so look at this so zero one pixels two pixels zero rgba 60 blah blah 64 67 0.302 zero one pixels three pixels one pixels rgba 60 64 67 0.149 okay i i think remember that i hope you remember that remember that in your head right now just you have to memorize it okay just around that remember everything okay no i screw i scrolled this for you so hopefully you can actually see it uh when you go ahead and copy this for yourself okay awesome so that's going to be the box shadow i would just i would just drop it once again in the in the chat because it's pretty hard to yeah okay sweet sweet sweet treat somebody said trouble a nice way to remember yes exactly very nice way awesome so we got that portion let's now go ahead and go in the second portion and that's going to be i'm going to define now a uh what am i going to find i'm going to define now a cursor so i'm going to say cursor reverse cursor i'm going to say pointer that means that when i hover over something it will be like a cursor so you can see here that's a cursor that becomes like a cursor awesome nice i like that okay all right next up i want to go ahead i'm not sure are you sure it's with auto because i feel like the width should be yeah smaller width it is with auto because we will add the padding afterwards ah okay ah okay cool huh okay one thing i want to do though is for this specific portion for our app i want to do a few things i want to change this color to maybe maybe be more grayish and i want to change the the font size here if i look at the font size let's go inspect element here okay this is original gmail here you can see div let's go get the tier compose okay so here's the div you can see in this div this is the box shadow by the way this is how this is how we got the box shadow just so you know we literally just copied it okay and then the font size is this one so font size 0.875 letters spacing 0.25 and we will do that exactly exactly here and the color is going to be this one so i'm going to say color let's go color ah come on i'm going to copy this come on there we go i'm going to say color it's gonna be this one so save that next up i'm gonna say font weight font weight of this specific thing is gonna font weight is going to be 500 nice and then we're going to give it okay that's pretty good that's pretty good and then we're going to give it a font size font dash size let's give it what 0.875 i don't even see what what okay if we go direct app real rem okay so dang does that did it change the color or no cool i mean it probably did not but it's like so close to yeah anyways let's remove this back of color orange which is hideous remove that i don't need that anymore hey i mean that looks pretty good i will say that looks pretty damn good i don't know you know that's pretty good so cool we got the composition we will go ahead and modify in a second now whenever you hover over you see how it has like this box whenever you hover over you see this right here oh that's not composing anything right now now hover over this to make that work here's what we're going to do we're going to do and this is another cool thing that you have inside style components you can actually define a hover so i can say hover for example hover right there i can say hover right there and then on the hover all i will say at this point is going to be we're going to alice do we change the padding no we don't need to change on the hover we now simply change the box shadow so let's think about this if i hover let's if we write right click and smack down on this one inspect that one and this one is the button right here see this is the whole button right here i'm going to say for state hover okay so that's not good that does not work out inside instead i'm going to say for stay hover on this one look at that and so you can see on hover here's what we have look at that right there just pay attention to this one we literally just got this from from google itself so sorry google we just copied you i mean you know you put it out there for people to see so there's nothing you can do about that so look here's what we'll do i will literally copy this box shadow that we have right there this box shadow and i'm gonna say on the hover i'm gonna say box shadow shadow and hopefully you can copy this for them in the comments for them to put in the comments just oh yeah sure sure sure okay and then what's going to happen is after that one we're going to also define the background color so here background color can be this one so boom so i'm gonna say called background color background dash color dash dash color this right there right there beautiful awesome cool so we have that background color is going to be this one next up let's add a small transition look at this transition it looks fancy as hell oh there should i see this transition uh what i'm talking what am i talking about by the way the transition i'm talking about is going to be this one right there boom so transition and this transition i'm going to put the answer in the wrapper itself so transition boom hey look at that see and we're transitioning the box shadow i know it's cool right dang bro so cool you're getting fancy here so fancy because that's how we do it we get fancy out here so that you can be fancy with us okay i don't know what what kind of accent was that but anyways oh yeah thank you thank you awesome so we got that specific portion let's go ahead and save this all right save that and now if we go back direct up look at that boom oh oh that looks so good oh look at that dang that looks so good so cool so good all right in that case how about okay cool now let's go ahead and let's continue on and you can now take take the oh by the way guys we have another super chat thank you so much five dollars hey let's go intel appreciate appreciate you guys so much as always as always thank you so much cool all right let's move on um i think we actually need to pause if you if you really have to go because the next one is going to be a bit of a bigger stuff that's fine let's keep going for a little bit here okay let's go let's keep going okay so going back to the sidebar uh what we would do is we will have a crazy stuff let's go back to these sites now yeah let's do the crazy stuff so what we would do here is because once again i'm a lazy likes let's get to 900 come on come on let's go i know you guys got this come on 900 likes i know you got this come on come on you guys are the best that's what just say 800 854 likes can we get to 900 come on 854 857 come on 87 we have 863 okay good good good good good keep going keep liking come on three a67 come on ac7 come on 871 hey it's 71. can we get to 900 come on come on 871 come on three a72 a72 come on 874. okay well it's gonna take a while so anyways let's just keep going eight seven and six are we there yet are we there are we yes i see that it's only five oh [ __ ] this is good this is good this is good come on all right let's keep going 882 come on holy [ __ ] come on oh my oh let's go come on 84 86. hey jesus huh 887 it was going down one come on 87 come on guys let's get to 900 come on only 13 more i know you can do it let's go 890 81 come on 900 when we reach 900 we're gonna move on come on let's go and you want come on 897 come on come on come on it is our 900 let's go let's go 900 that's what i'm talking about that's always so much fun you guys are the best that's all i can say to you oh my gosh you guys are the best 900 likes that's 908 now okay all right take the reigns david okay so let's quickly in five minutes uh let's do the following so what we will do is we will go into the components folder create a brand new folder which we will call data because once again i'm not going to type out all those icons instead we will use something clever there so going inside of the data we will create a file which we will call uh side whoa whoa side bar button items dot js right that's nice now this is not going to be a react component because this is just going to contain all the data and all the icons that we have so first thing first let's import all the icons that we will need so we will need the inbox icon from material ui icon the star icon watch later send insert drive file icon label icon and the expand more icons and what we will do here is basically just create a json that we will export right away good nice so we say export const and we will say sidebar button items equals and this will be an array and inside of that array we will have an icon right yes so the first one is going to be the inbox icon and we will just close it out and we will just pretty much throw in uh those what you say uh components right yeah and again guys the reason why we're doing what's gonna stop is because you see this icons right here we're not going to about to type this at 1.1 we're going to create the data for it right here and then i'm going to import that and loop through every single icon and simply just display it just like this that's kind of the goal here just so you know okay that's how you want to do you want to be efficient with your code okay exactly it's one of the biggest things people see look look for when they hire you exactly yeah exactly and like everybody is like looking for that so even when i uh when i interviewed for other companies i was given these kind of stuff like yep i just had to make code much more optimized yes so next up uh we will just pretty much place all these stuff here so we will have the star icon and i'm actually so glad that they didn't hire me star icon that was gonna have the watch later icon or the the watch icon yeah that's gonna see that we have the sentence we will have the send icon next up insert drive oh boy that's here let's go here come on i'm messing it up come on you got this come on nice nice we will have the label label expand more boom cool all right and so watch later icon is going to be the snooze item and then we will have the drafts so if you think about this right this is going to define the icon for us right so this is going to define the icon when we loop to this this is going to define the icon which is going to be here right and then the text is just going to be defined the text so which is going to be here right exactly so we loop with this all we simply say we loop through it and then we simply display it based on what we get from the data pretty simple exactly and now like that's pretty much the data of those icons that we see there so yes going back to our sidebar the js file what we will do is we will do an inline javascript because jsx can do it because it's so powerful yes and first thing first uh we obviously want to go ahead and import the sidebar button icons or items yes so currently the sidebar button items but what we need to do is let's go back to sidebar okay let's go back to sidebar right here stop.js and we need to import those side those uh those uh the data right sidebar about this data and we'll do that by simply just going to here you can see here when we go ahead and do that i see sidebar item items so if i go ahead and go ahead and close this out sidebar item so we import sidebar buttons items oops no it's not right items from right from what from what from you see here data sidebar button items it's simple just as that and again this right here means we're going up two levels right so i'm gonna go up up up up up right to get the data simple as that okay cool exactly and why are we going to up on that popup because if we look at we look right now we are currently inside which we're currently where where is it it should be in data source data so we need to go up to data oh yeah then from data we need to go back to a biscuit no we need to go off from sidebar from cyber go you need to go no no first you need to go out from layout then you need to go out from components source this is one out good and then grab it then we go another out to go to components you see therefore components we're going to go into data right and that's kind of how that works right there and go to data right yes right there that's all we're doing like that way and now here here comes the cool part so now what we will do is we will just go ahead and say side uh sidebar button items and we will just go ahead and map through it and we will have single items in here right nice and once we have those items i just want to have a new div which i will call sidebar button item right and in this case uh and yeah yeah yeah okay yeah cool yeah so we will have the sidebar button item yes right yes and for that i will get uh throw in the item dot icon good then add the space and the i oh so item dot text text and again how does that work out because we're going to loop through this array cyber button items which comes again comes from here you see a sidebar button items okay so everything is going to be and everything every single item is going to be an object you can see here and then we have icon and text you see that's pretty much it and then we look through it when we use it we're going to say item ah going to say right there we're going to look through it i'm going to say okay map through or loop through the button items for every single item i'm going to find a sidebar button item which is which david is creating below and then from that we're going to use item the icon just how we defined before and and that text simple very simple right and he just created right here if you scroll to the bottom he just created a buttons wait where did you create it 47 right there line 47 sidebar button item that's pretty much it and then that's we could define the actual button we want to use okay let's go continue let's take a look at the react app by the way so let's go do this i'm going to say save this okay let's go rectangles 929 likes can we get to a thousand likes i think we can 929 likes can we get to a thousand likes i know hundred percent and we can do that guys all right to a thousand likes come on we got this oh oh oh okay all right next up what's next david uh it's 10 33 by the way that's fine keep going keep going okay okay so now what we will do is uh let's actually go ahead and make sure that these like so far things are looking good but we just want to make them look nicer so first up we will go into the wrapper and we will say that that will have a border uh right and we will say it will be one pixel solid and it will be light gray nice okay right ray like that cool and we will we just want to make sure that it actually takes up the whole page so we will say it will get a height of a 100 view height okay nice and that will be pretty much what we directly give to the rapper now here this div right here and it has a border right it's pretty simple and the 100 height of 100 bh just simply means that it will expand to the height of 100 100 vh that's pretty much it that's all it means yeah that would pretty much just use all the yes on the screen yes correct that's it that's awesome yeah and next up we will go into compose wrapper and that will use display grid of course nice and we will say place dash items and we will go and say start what's up okay let's get closer right here just you know so basically start meaning oh look at that that's cool nice i like it cool so that basically right away put it in the start i love it okay keep going keep going and now we will add a little bit of padding nice and i want to say that above and below i want to give it 10 pixels and on both sides i want to give it 20 pixels so this means right here this is top and bottom so this is another stroke i guess you guys can remember okay this right here if you do if you specify two items this means top and bottom this means left and right so think about vertical horizontal vertical horizontal vertical horizontal just keep that in mind okay that's pretty much it yeah vh vh i actually learned that like what happens if you uh fall off a skyscraper right yeah you go top to bottom and then you lay down okay i like it you go tuck the button kneeling down that is one way to think about this when you fall off a skyscraper nice job i mean did i remember it or did i remember it i guess you did nice i like it yeah look at that our button right here is pretty good it looks very clean it looks very stylized i like it awesome keep going all right so uh we will pretty much leave out the side buttons wrapper it's just going to be uh the one again that we just have and we're just not going to touch that so we will move on to sidebar button item and for that we will do a few different things so we will say it will obviously have display of grid like that and we will say grid template and it will yeah like columns nice and we will have a 14 px no 14 and then auto is going to be the left the right hand side so basically we will give 14 to the icon and the rest is going to be filled up with old text so that's what that so that means that this 14 right here is basically the cut is going to be the icon and then yes the auto is going to oh okay that makes sense okay the audio is going to be gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha okay cool cool gotcha now uh we will use a color of gray in this case for both the icon and the text as well i i tried to keep it simple so i was just like okay let's go with gray and by the way speaking of gray our student devin gray got a job at paypal let's go you're seeing the problem because again linking by if you guys are interested link in bio pwg the best course on the planet uh for javascript to become a javascript developer that's pretty much it i ain't got to say anything else it's just the best because we did it we made it and it's so good exactly exactly all right it was like an ltt yeah yeah yeah yeah ltt plugin okay so we would say uh padding uh five pixel and then we will give it a 25 pixels so 5 pixel above and below and 25 on both sides and it would just make that uh spacing look so much nicer and i think if you refresh or save it will actually apply hey look how beautiful that looks oh my god that looks so sexy whoo let's go ah that's good awesome and so that my friend is the sidebar item component now is that pretty much it for the sidebar just so i know right let's do it however let's do a hug we have two more little things just for these icons let's do it let's do it so one of them is going to be invisible for a little but we will say we will give it a border radius okay and then guys you have to trust the reason well here's like the reason why we do that is because when we go hover hover over this you see look at this you can keep tapping keep typing when we hover to see how it has this this like um this like border radius on the right right hand side you see that right there that's why because when we hover this and we need to add a border radius to it just as simple as that okay exactly exactly exactly and yeah so what happens is uh we will give it a border radius of zero one hundred percent wick so one hundred pixel one and zero again and it's going from corner to corner uh top left top left top right bottom right beautiful and then bottom left and then we will give a uh
