hey what is up guys how's it going this is Kazi here from clever programmer comm I am running this as a test to see how the livestream is working also I want to let everybody know that we're doing a JavaScript live challenge and we're gonna be doing a 20,000 dollar giveaway so it's gonna be a pretty huge challenge and the winner actually gets an online coding bootcamp that's three months long at clever programmer and the person who refers them gets ed so I'm gonna just pop in here and chat with you guys hey I'm good how's it going so if you guys have questions or anything we can kind of rapidfire back and forth I know it's been a while since I've gone actually live and I'm testing out a new set up and making sure everything is running smoothly hi guys Marcos hello hi Francisco hi Mazz hi gustavo okay this is looking awesome Oh looks like I'm live in the Facebook group as well nice to have you guys there ma says I hope I win and guys if you guys want to join the challenge it's very simple if you want to join the challenge if you want to become a sixfingered JavaScript developer an interested in joining challenge make sure you join the challenge we're going to be giving away $20,000 worth of prizes as we say right there and the link should be in the description I hope and if it's not in the description just go to clever programmer comm and it'll be there join the challenge okay so here if you're wondering like hey how do I join the challenge make sure you go right over here clever programmer calm that will have all the details just click a button and then BOOM you can join the challenge ok and there's a video for you to watch that explains how everything works so it's gonna be extremely clear another thing that I get a lot from people is hey if I'm a beginner and I've never coded does this still work for me can I still join absolutely if you're a complete beginner you can still join and that's totally fine okay it's whether you're a beginner or advanced there's gonna be something there for every single person to learn so I think you're gonna really love it and if you're already in this Facebook group then amazing I'm so pumped to have you here and again if you start if you have any questions start writing them down and we'll start getting into it okay this is first of all wanted to test to make sure everything is working and running smoothly I know I me and my girlfriend and Nas was actually running the challenge we manually approved a lot of the people and we got over 1,000 member requests in less than a day so it's going to definitely definitely be the biggest challenge that we have done and I feel like a lot of people in the world for JavaScript have ever done especially when to giveaway it's gonna be massive and it's gonna start April 6 so the thousand people that we saw we declined a lot of the people probably declined six or seven hundred people just because they weren't the right fit so we are very selective about who we let into the group there's a list of questions we ask and we make sure that people answer them we make sure that the people who are entering are high quality people so the quality of the entire group is absolutely really really good right and so yeah we're looking for people really ambitious hungry trying to learn code but more importantly actually also trying to make an income from that skill so I'm gonna go to chat we got a lot of messages coming in I do know Java so okay ender says oh that's so cool I can show comments so easily ender says I do know JavaScript but I'm bad at it okay not a problem as long as you show up and you actually participate you can still win in the challenge also if you actually refer somebody who wins you win so let's just say ender is like really bad at JavaScript right and he doesn't end up winning the challenge because he doesn't make the best project also he doesn't participate but let's say he referred his friend and if his friend wins then ender also wins the coding bootcamp or and her also wins the same prize that that person does so that's what if you refer people you can really really increase your chance and if you refer the right people you can really increase your chance of winning this challenge ok so again I know James also asked what if you don't know much ASO if you're a complete beginner that is totally fine it's not a big problem at all also how is the audio guys Kevin says whoever is going to join the challenge good luck and everyone do your best awesome Thank You Gavin for that I will says we need to learn to make a site like Facebook wash hands wash hands virtual hug yes because the corona virus we probably all need to do that actually a little bit Nicolas so I said if you're a complete beginner that's okay you can still join the five day challenge and you will still get a lot of value out of it and you can still participate in the challenge okay let me see on YouTube I might have to update the description let's see I have to update the description right maybe on YouTube description on YouTube right so give me one second guys I will try to update we got 123 people live watching so that's amazing give me one second guys I will up did the description I'm sorry about that that will and apparently I can't update it from here so give me one second spare with me please but yeah if you go to right now I'll pop it up on the screen so it's available for you guys and you guys can easily if you want to join the challenge go to clever programmer calm and in the meantime I will try to find the livestream and update the description yeah that's tougher than I thought videos 5 ok edit ok cool there we go so now the thumbnail the description on YouTube should be there if you guys can confirm for me that would be phenomenal yeah stay alright perfect ok back to the thing and I'm gonna now start taking your guys's questions and answering them alright Zacky column says which live chat are you checking Facebook or YouTube I'm actually checking both I hope that it's sending me both of the messages from the Facebook group and yes I'm seeing some of the messages in the Facebook group as well so it should be showing me both of them join me YouTube and Facebook so it doesn't matter where you're messaging me from Gustavo says our beginner Kazi but I hope I went and we take a lot of the big thing is how much you are participating if we seen the challenge you're participating a lot meaning you're showing up to the live strings you are completing the challenges you are asking questions and commenting you are engaging with other people in the group if you're adding value to the group and you're helping other people that are there we will see that and that really massively increases your chances of winning even above sometimes you just coding in the best app for example so it's not just how skilled you are we also want to see how helpful you are how hungry you are to actually grow a career as a JavaScript developer any level is fine so it's not just beginning right if you're a beginner great if you're not a beginner this is still a good challenge for you to join thank you dev patel says web dev or software engineer personally for me dev web dev I like web development a lot I enjoy it a car says what time does the life start so yes we will be going live the event starts April 6th ok so put that in your calendar this is gonna be massive guys you don't want to miss this challenge gonna be huge I don't really think anybody's ever done this before so it's gonna be massive and we're gonna have a huge group I'm expecting at least a few thousand people maybe like four or five thousand people if not more gonna be participating and I'm talking about amazing people it starts 6 April 6th at 1212 p.m. Pacific so what sort of just a good question so for example in this JavaScript challenge right on day one I will be talking about the opportunity that exists currently as a JavaScript developer even amidst the crisis that's happening right now and what does that opportunity look like for you on day two three and four you guys are gonna be building in Google Maps project it's a fifty seven hundred dollar project that we actually went to up work and then we saw this job description that says we will pay you fifty seven hundred dollars if you can actually build as Google Maps project we build that live in this training so even if you just come to watch and see how that's done it's gonna be of tremendous value to you okay and then and then if you ever want to actually just get that recorded version of it you don't wanna buy a version you can always join our JavaScript which we're gonna announce at the end of the challenge but during the challenge you can do the you can build the Google Maps project completely from scratch and then again the people who are going to be building the best versions of that app or adding any extra features or going and adding some being creative in it that's going to be huge or people that are like making a video walkthrough of going through the app and then posting it in the group that's also going to be huge and we're gonna we're going to give people points for each thing that they do what does that mean you know this is not found oh did I put the wrong oh I see thank you okay all right thank you

basic understanding or you can at least like make some HTML CSS and JavaScript works if you want to look up some basic tutorials online I myself have an 8 hour JavaScript tutorial on YouTube that's up there for free I have a HTML and CSS tutorial for free on YouTube so go ahead and take a look at those to just get the basics how do you actually write the code how do you actually open a file how do you like do certain things with with JavaScript and HTML and CSS just yet the basics down so then when you come to the challenge you're extra prepared is it a link to sign up for the challenge yes the

yep thank you golden honey April 6 at 12 p.m. Pacific is the first training Chima says can you build realworld projects with JavaScript cuz you don't talk about no GS yeah I believe so for this project I believe so nas is going to be doing natural training for the JavaScript portion of this project there might be use of nodejs to make it go live and do all those types of things okay so there might be no jest but definitely we're going to be going really heavy on the JavaScript portion of this this challenge thing no we are not going to be doing this often we've never actually done this ever before so that's why you really want to jump on this opportunity and take advantage of it because again it's going to be live and if you miss it you just miss it and we have no plans to do this even until the next year we will try to use only JavaScript vanilla GI so you can learn the core skills we will try not to use too many frameworks in here it's April six through ten okay so golden honey you wrote April six through eight the challenge goes April six seven eight nine ten okay so it's five days long in about hour and a half every day so try to come with something prepared like the laptop should be prepared if you yeah you can use sublime text whatever coding editor you want to use you can use it it doesn't matter when you sublime text visual studio code it's all good use whatever bringbring whatever you want it's okay no you're gonna need to use a laptop or a computer you can just use a phone a saline is it vanilla JavaScript using syntax yeah we're gonna be touching on es6 it's going to have JavaScript and not too many frameworks we're just working on building a core project you're gonna be learning a lot of wire framing we're gonna go deep into like how to actually like build out an app and each component of it awesome thank you glue says it's working link is working thank you guys yeah there might be some node.js surveys in the challenge that's a question for Naz to answer okay yeah the challenge is going to be mostly web development but you will still learn the principles of how it works and there you go guys this is what the schedule looks like it will be April 6 through 10 12 p.m. live every single day 12 p.m. Pacific to 130 or 200 p.m. will be one to two hours each day if not more so what do we have to do in this challenge in this challenge you should follow along participate you should you'll be given homework every single day because every day you can be given homework day 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 day 5 so for example on day one I

boomed now it's yours so it's gonna be I'm just gonna be giving you that portfolio for free on day two three and four when you're building the Google Maps app project you're gonna be following along and you're gonna be building it okay then for extra points you can add additional features so they'll have a roadmap of features so you can add to each day in your homework assignment we will tell you what new features to add to the Google Maps app for example on one of the days you might have to make it go live on another day you might have to add like you know one little extra thing to it so each

mobile device but we prefer that you have a laptop and computer ready right side by side so you can actually be watching the tutorial and the training and then be coding and learning at the same time now keep in mind ninth Nas might be going a little bit faster thousands of people in this training right so Naz and I might be going a little bit fast so if you can't keep up that's okay just take notes and like visually follow along and understand that recording will still be there available for you right in the Facebook group and if you're not the physical group make sure you click the link and join and but yeah so some kind of computer laptop something like that will be a better and take notes and everything along the way okay again if you want to record it full recorded versions are perfect of all the apps then at the end you will suggest like if you want to join profit a JavaScript that might be a good time to do so yep so we're gonna be covering we're gonna be going over and building an app with JavaScript okay okay awesome so this has been really good guys wanted to make sure that we could easily come in here and communicate with all of you guys this is awesome I'm gonna also see some Facebook messages I don't know I don't think me restream is sending me Facebook messages a monk says what is the incentive for you to give this course for free so this challenge is absolutely free and then at the end of the challenge if you guys are interested you want to take it to even the next level then we'll be offering or process a JavaScript program which is a paid program and if any of you guys want to join your always of course welcome to join but you know again for the JavaScript challenge you don't have to pay anything to participate in it and it's completely free no you don't have to know anything extensively before the challenge if you'll want to learn know it a little bit great but you don't really have to know anything above for hand javascript is not mandatory for backend Java developer no I don't think so Seamus has also discovered experientially the sublime is very fast and quick in action even as a slow computer sublime hope is yes sublime is extremely fast sublime is sublime is awesome I like some wand plus it like when you write stuff it kind of writes in 60 frame rates per seconds it looks beautiful yeah I'm a fan of sublime but you know again with visuals to get code and how easy it is to like add vim integration in there and everything else them takes the cake for me Sherlock says I don't care about winning but I need the experience after this is done how can you how can I get you to teach me more in depth sure log that's a great question he asked that in the Facebook group if you want to learn hide messages from the stream what is that okay cool so yeah Sherlock if you want to go deeper afterwards and of course what we do is if you want to join a cross with JavaScript course one of our paid programs that clever programmer I mean these are deep right they're like 15 week online coding training programs then you also have live coaching calls and live trainings with Nas who's the main instructor for the JavaScript program so I mean it's really you're getting like you guys would essentially be getting what you would get an online coding bootcamp but like for a fraction of the cost so that's huge so yeah I would I would recommend that you then jump into our courses like profit with JavaScript if you guys want to take your training at a deeper level and that's going to be huge we're gonna be opening up profit JavaScript you know which is of course we currently have closed and we will be launching this on April 12th so make sure you guys also have your calendars marked for that okay Jonathan asked what's the main criteria for selecting the winner the main criterias performance that means engagement how engaged you are are you coming to the last rooms are you communicating with other people are you helping out people on top of that we're going to take a look at your project how well did you do it did you add extra features to it did you add anything that is that's like more than what we asked you to do is it creative and then on top of that when you're gonna we want to ask you like we want to know how many people did you refer if you bring anybody else in the group so we kind of take all of those things into account to determine the winner of the challenge but again it's mostly based on performance so the winners come from the performance and then if you win or if the person wins based on the performance we ask them if somebody referred them if somebody referred them then that person wins the prize right so we have you know in the first place of course we're giving away coding boot camps and second place we're giving away all of our clever programmer courses every single one you know automated a Python profitable programmer on 1k our freelancing courses profit JavaScript everything sits about like $1,600 plus value so it's huge and then for place number three we're giving away profit with JavaScript course for completely free and that also means you get the community support you also get the live coaching calls you get everything completely taken care of and then from 4 through 10 you get a 50% discounts discount on profit with JavaScript course so that's our criteria and then that's what we're giving away yeah especially in this time we hope that's gonna help somebody you know especially a lot of people losing their jobs I mean some of the people that are in my like coaching program in our coaching program like some of them lost their jobs because of the coronavirus situation and so you know if this is our way of like helping people and
