hey so listen I'm at this event with my who's right now reading a very important email and what I want to talk about is commitment so right now what I am committing to at this program what they want us to do is envision our upcoming year 2019 and see what are some of the accomplishments some of the biggest accomplishments do you have made I have wrote down my vision oh and by the way we should make this gear lives the motto in action over anxiety so we wrote down some of our visions my biggest one for the upcoming year is commit all the way to cover program go allin on the business and pull all in on helping developers like you board inspiring aspiring to be a developer we're already are a developer and help you scale your career $200,000 a year or more and I felt like up until this point I've been holding back to a certain degree I could be making more videos I could be putting out more courses I could be getting on more calls with you and I feel that I haven't jumped it all the way and made that much of a commitment you know I went kind of crazy it but I know myself I can actually even vote and even more so that's what I want to do for yourself what I want you to think about is what would be your biggest accomplishment of 2019 the upcoming year what can you commit to and pick one to two things do not pick more because then it gets too much and you won't be able to actually achieve that so pick one thing maybe for you it's becoming a fullstack developer maybe for you it's becoming a data scientist pick one thing but choose to commit all the ways because to many times we say we want to do something and then we halfass it and we become mediocre and a lot and we never actually end up becoming best at anything so you want to spend this upcoming year being the best at one thing so what I want you to do is for me I want to grow clever programmer like crazy so my goal would be have a million people subscribe to this channel but that's a more result baseball right but what I want to commit to is a more action visible that I can control so I might not be able to control getting a million subscribers but what I can control is making five to ten videos a month sending you guys a lot more emails that just give you a lot more value building new courses so that's what I'm going to be committing to five at least five videos a month if not ten so what I want you to do is if you have watched this video what I want you to do is put one thing that you would commit to and drop it in the comment below just one alright and write it as a sentence what's that one thing you're going to commit to for 2019 for it to become for it to become a successful year for you that's it for this video thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video
