and after i told her i was about to cry so i ran grabbed my dogs ran to the car and i cried and i listened to the radio i just drove around because i couldn't really believe it it just drove around this is a interview with one of our students his name is on and how he went from making twenty thousand dollars a year doing postmates to making between seventy thousand two hundred and twenty eight thousand as a reaction developer yeah he enrolled in the full stack mastery boot camp and now we're gonna take it over to on and just so you guys know he started out with basically he went to a different boot camp really felt like he was not being he was not learning much really felt like he was about to just go back to a job that he didn't like like doing post post office or you know amazon flex but then he got into here and was able to learn much more and let it job so with that said let's roll the video let's do it everything was hard for me like i did html css in high school which like 10 plus years ago and we met with like clients and build basic apps basic i built a dog app before i even had a dog and uh and then uh the javascript camera i had a really hard time learning javascript just because i still i don't understand like the language behind the language like deconstruct or string or array like it's still it wasn't clicking for me but when i asked for help the instructor would take two to three weeks maybe even more to even get back to me and if he gets back to me he's like you can figure it out just google it 18k for this like 18k i expect to be a developer by the third or fourth month about putting that amount of money in to this investment so going forward we learned express handlebar which i found out from nasa no one does anymore and then we didn't learn to react until like the fourth or fifth month which was cool weekend i react i'm getting something that i'm used to but their way of teaching it was like once we once we passed this topic there's no going back you're not going to get help from this unless you do it on your own there's no like if we're going to react and i had a question about node we're not going to go back like from it there's nothing like everyone else was i'm not saying everyone else but there's a few of us like i don't know what's going on so we formed like study groups we had projects that we work in groups that we get to choose the people that we need to work with thank god i was with someone that did she's she sar and he was like amazing at coding so at the time he was trying to teach us react and try to teach himself react and and at the very end he decided to do a we just sized the group to make a movie app and we cannot figure out how to do firebase we couldn't figure out how to like link firebase to the app and then i came across clever programmer when you and kazi and i think his name is sunny was doing a clone for spotify so the part that we couldn't figure out was how to get the music to pop up with react when using the api so i took some of the codes i learned from the spotify clone and i added to our project and we're able to pass the project let's go so so yeah yeah that's awesome that's amazing tell me like right you told me when i got a call with you you told me that uh you know after the boot camp that you went to before you were in a very bad spot you were in a very bad place like you wanted to go back to like to work it like a like as a post office man or something right so like why tell me why well well i had some very bad experience it's just like my grandma got cancer so i was focusing on like her more so that's one problem two is like just the experience of like the instructors like do you really like your in your motto of the school is we care about the students we want the students to succeed everything is about the student but once i got that certificate i don't even want to look at the certificate it's sitting right here next to me and every day i look at this and i was like i didn't learn anything i i can't i can't use this like i it can probably get me an interview but i can't get me a job so when i was sitting there i was i shoot at that time uh it was hard you know family problems stuff like that and then i was i to make my grandma proud she just all she ever wanted was just me have a job i'm not end up in jail i'm not she's very basic as long as i'm not in jail i can do whatever hell i want but she was like do something that makes you happy and i was like well at that time i'm gonna do something that makes you happier so i'm gonna apply for boeing i'm applying to be a i don't know work at postman i'm do i did amazon flex for a few months something just to get by pay bills i came across because of the stat the spotify clone i said that i'm gonna give clever programmer a try so i signed up for pwj and uh coffee called me that night night and i [ __ ] boy ever i was kind of embarrassing but the whole time he was talking about welcoming into pwg i was like i can't believe i'm talking to you right now i was just watching you eight hours a day just like last week and then you're actually calling my phone at 10 pm at night and the whole time he was like introducing pwg to me like we were happy to have you join a community this is a lifetime thing and i don't and the whole time i was just like i can't believe you're calling me he called i was like man this is probably something new but i was still in the mood of like i don't want to code no more like if if this is how coding is like if the school is like this imagine how the work is like like if i'm behind is everyone gonna be like nah he's done no we don't care we got his money already or we're only paying him let's turn them out let's just move on or find someone else to replace them so i just thought if it's doggy dog like that then i'd rather just work for a doggy dog company and just you know go on forward so uh and then you guys posted a reaction i said man i got a little bit money for amazon flex i'm just going to join it's it's what a weekend eight hours i'll just do amazon flex and like two or three o'clock in the morning i come home take a nap and i'll do this every single day and then introducing boot camp at the very end at first i was like man another boot camp do i when i want to get yelled at dude how how is this going to work i have no money i have like i thought i had yeah so this is definitely one of the things i'm interested in knowing it's like yeah you went to a boot camp already you invested in it you had a bad experience and you had very little money so what was going through your head when you decided to join this again another another yeah boot camp yeah so uh i had a phone call with daniel and daniel was like you sound like you really want to do this but i'm not gonna pass you on to frankie aka timmy until until uh you are dedicated to this and i really want to get good at coding i i liked it in high school no one really liked high school but then i wanted to do something different i wanted from further on i don't want to be like hey my kid's gonna be like oh he's just another mailman there's no no shout out to mailman's or people that work for boeing all this other stuff but i wanted to do something different where i can teach one day if i'm blessed to have a kid i can teach him how to program and learn the ins and out of the computers and stuff like that software because down the road tech is going to be the one biggest thing in the world so uh i had a talk with frankie i called him timmy at first because i thought that was hilarious you lied to me already and then uh right there and then there was that first obstacle is the money deposit down like for for you for a clever programmer to believe in you you also have to invest in yourself to become part of clever programmer so he gave me a week and uh i have a pride to not ask people for money because i don't know maybe that's just the asian thing but it shows kind of like weakness or something like that but uh i asked my sister and then i asked my brother my sister was like come on you just did a boot camp why are you doing another one like you know typical asian and then uh my brother didn't say anything at first he's a very to himself type of guy and then the next day let's say tuesday tuesday he was like hey do a down payment and pay the rest with amazon flex learn how to code do what you love and not have excuse that money is the reason why you couldn't do this so he works at construction sites so he makes a lot of money but he says that uh you're my brother so i have to take care of you regardless even if i hate you but but that's that's how brothers are he gave me and then uh the [ __ ] or timmy and then uh i said hey i have the money i'm ready to to uh 110 be in this boot camp join let's go and then you join the boot camp yeah yeah dude that is so amazing to have a brother like that because um but they're not like hey here's 5 000 bucks yeah to have somebody that believes so much in you you know to be able to give you the money or just just to have faith in you that is the biggest trust you know just like hey you know what you got this not a lot of people get that and so man you're lucky to have that and you know what and you took that and you were not afraid to ask and you actually invest in yourself and then that resulted in what you have right now and actually being able to pay back your your brother even more is that correct yeah yeah so now i'm curious right so you figured out a way to get into the boot camp figure out the payments you're like hey i'm gonna make it work i'm gonna invest in myself i'll join this but now i'm curious and people who are probably listening to this are curious how did you go from that to being able to get a job so like walk me through what happened you know kind of step by step yeah what made this different that allowed you to get there so at first i just thought hey i already did the boot camp this boot camp is just gonna be review of what i just missed i basically missed everything about javascript when i did this boot camp so uh they we miss what is that hexadecimal was the very first lesson i was like what is this what what do you mean zeros and ones i thought computers just you just type it in they know what the heck they're talking about i've been learning softwares of different companies so you just have to type in and then it saves itself i didn't know there's like a whole like different dimension basically to it so uh first week i hated it to be honest i hated it it was like nas i love you and everything you're the best i've ever had you put me in the hot seat every single single time and then that's what we do he's like you think you know what you're talking about okay so he picks on you and then it starts i wanted to test here right i'm here to test students right to make sure that you guys know what you're talking about because sometimes you don't know what you don't know yeah yeah and so that's when you realize what you don't know yeah so it was it was at the same time i was like man possibly different i'm just having cold sweat i'm like not really relaxed learning in class like this is different from any class i've ever been in so after a while it got fun and then it got really challenging but we were all excited and then i think i think that's part of this boot camp was how we all became like family within a week or two like there wasn't no you i'll be scared to message this person because i never met this person it was none of that my first thing when i first came in was my last boot camp every time i try to crack a joke i'm more like a class clown just to break the ice with like the group that i'm in just so it makes everyone welcome first because i'm i already feel like i'm okay but for other students or like people it's hard for them to break in and you know talk about themselves or like be comfortable talking to you vice versa so i made a joke about hexadecimals and it still lasts to this day and uh it i was afraid when i cracked that joke no one's going to laugh i was like oh it's going to be another boot camp but remember that we're gonna get tshirts that says 15. study group that we have uh i feel like i can hit up anyone in the group and be like hey i need help with this code and they're like yeah you got time to zoom like you'll get that from instructors you don't really get that from students you usually get like if you hit up as an instructor they'd be like yeah just give me some time i'll make time for you not for my last boot camp but this boot camp and then if you hit up a student like hey you have time to study they're like yeah just give me 10 15 minutes i might have you know and we're all over the world this could be morning was what one am and i hit him up and he was like yeah i can help you understand some codes he sent me some links and stuff like that the links don't make sense because i don't know like you know but he's there they were there and then every time we meet every tuesday thursday saturday sunday no everyone's you have a bad day or have a good day knowledge comes and makes us stretch makes us feel comfortable and then he we relax for the first five ten minutes of class and we go right right dance too every call yeah yeah right he's like i don't care twopiece combo to the head of coding like he knows we have a headache from it we know we were confused but it slowly slowly like hits like a hacker rank he introduced the hacker rank leak code and at first i looked at so my last problem was i figured out was i can't problem solve i can problem solve in real life but when it comes down to coding it's a lot different like you're giving instructions of how to stuff out and then you're giving a process of how do you break this down to write out so you do pseudo code and then the next step after that is to write the code so nas will do like a bunch of examples it can be try binary search it can be stack queue all that but he would write us out in pseudocode basically writing us the code we just have to figure out what the code is in javascript and then it's at first i was like oh god damn it javascript data structures this is different i didn't learn this from the last bootcamp they just told us how to make a app and they gave us the bootstrap all we have to do is write in the thing to make the buttons work that's it but now now dude can i just say i'm so proud of you for even being able to know what those are like try right binary saying it up i'm like holy moly like 90 people don't even know that right so but you've been able to know that understand it right you already already understand problem solving you already understand data structures which is the foundational programming right so like man proud of you for even just knowing that you know yeah and it's a singular reason why most people don't get jobs yeah because their foundations are weak yeah yeah yeah it's not that that so so let's just say data structures in life he's teaching us how to break things down in code and then figure out how to solve them but i often use that in real life that you can break stuff down and solve it see there's always a solution to something you just have to figure out how to do step by step so at first i was it was very difficult i had a hard time with hacker rank because there's so much there's so much problems there's there's easy medium advance and then nas introduced us to try hybrid i hated that the most the most but it was what you just decided it's combined so my goal is always to have what you learn here and how to learn here and to combine it right because it's not just about knowing like stacks or cues it's about learning okay how do i use both of them right together how do i use a tree together with a linked list or something something like right so you've been able to use all the different tools in your tool belt together that's what makes you a powerful developer right and so my goal is always to kind of mix and match with that yeah so let's get to the fun part where i decided to do internship at this certain company i'm not gonna say the name i'm very uh super sisters so until i see that piece of paper with the offer sheet i'm not even gonna mention the name i just told you guys but i'm not gonna mention it again because i'm very superstitious until i get that first direct deposit and then i'll brag all the day all day i want so uh about a month ago i was really having a hard time keeping up with class and i got offers from different places and before we could use how long were you in the boot camp so far just so we're aware january yeah march march two months into the program got it continued and then uh so i i was i'm a type of person where i'm very i have to know the code i have to be ready for this interview i have to be you know a hundred percent before i get to this interview i'm not going to do the interview jesse one of the instructors let's say ta part of clever program was like just do it the if you get hired you just got hired two months in the boot camp why why are you not applying like there's a bunch of people that apply 100 200 applications they don't get it you guys know what i'm talking about but i'm just saying like we like the mindset of just like being nervous and being scared is not going to be good for you because you'll never want to do it like before this i used to sell vacuums and i did amazon flex was like jobs i hated but if i can do that why can't i just you know apply for a job and then let's see if they like me just as a person or if i'm just you know critical thinker if i'm just a problem solver and they just have to reteach me how they code but as long as i get the foot in the door at least they're teaching they're like they're paying me to relearn how to code like them so i was like man forget it i'm just gonna apply 20 30 jobs but my main goal is this certain job since 2019 how the ceo is how the companies run it's in seattle i want to be part of this business i'll be intern i apply to be intern i'll do janitor work i'll bring people's coffee i'll get people's mail uh you want me clean your shoe i'll clean your shoe it's just i just want to be part of this company i don't care what i have to do i'll print paper all day if you want me to i'll walk around with you while you do sales or i'll grab hold your umbrella i don't care i just want to be part of this company so i i i've been to their meeting a lot of zoom calls i don't know what's going on in the business but it's because i'm a novice to the company so after a while they said hey you want to come in check out our facility as long as you get vaccines or stuff like that or you just come in with a covet negative results so i walked in for a few times and i i loved it their their their atmosphere is just like clever programmer they want you to learn they want they're all employees are treated equal there's just this mindset where it reminds me so much of clever program i was like this is even a plus i'm going to stay here for resolve stuff in seattle and then i decided to come down to california be part of clever programmer but that's the main goal and then um when i got the offer what was it yesterday um i got the offer yesterday i was sitting right here in the same exact spot and i looked at myself and i looked at uh the stack full mastery and i was like i want to tell people but the very first person i wanted to call was you nas but you never never went back i was busy man i'm sorry i was busy i called frankie didn't even pick up uh so at that time it was 11 a.m i joined jessie's uh react class that she hosted every tuesday and i told her and after i told her i was about to cry so i ran grabbed my dogs ran to the car and i cried and i listened to the radio i just drove around because i couldn't really believe it i just drove around for like 25 35 minutes qazi and uh and frankie called me around like two three o'clock pst time and they're like we heard we heard you got the job i was like yeah but there's something else that happened and i've been very quiet about this because nas taught us don't say it until you get it just get it first and then you can brag all you want so another position came up not really a position but my brotherinlaw runs a real estate and uh remodel houses and he resells the house and stuff like that but the thing for his clients is he doesn't have like he doesn't want to do a form to write out the parts he needs to remodel how much the price is so he decided to hire me to run to make his website with a database where he can see the pricing for each place that you pick up the like wood or like how many nails you need and stuff like that or if you want a new bathtub or like stuff like that so he said that he'll pay me two thousand dollars every two weeks are you sure you won't pay me that much like i'll take i'll do for free for what is he what is he going to be paying you for he's he's just outside trouble and not basically his assistant of like hey what did they buy put it together go get the parts and then i have a van or truck and i just have to drop off the part he's paying me two thousand dollars just to do a little bit of uh heavy lifting but control like maintenance of his uh website i am thinking i might not be able to do it myself so i am going to partner up with one of my old teammates have somebody else do the physical work you do the web development work but i'm fine it's a family business so i can do anything to help his business grow and uh so this is what does that mean for a year if it's like a year long that's like what 4 000 a month yeah it was 52 i think me just one second okay so 4 000 times 12 is forty eight thousand thousand dollars forty eight thousand so that's outside of so that's forty eight thousand a year doing this outside of your current seventy thousand dollar a year job that you're hoping you're gonna get right knock on wood yes but we're pretty sure that you're going to get it so that would if you had both of them that would be 70 000 a year plus the 48 000. so that's about 120 something thousand which is fantastic dude and that's your first job as a developer i mean that's freaking amazing yeah i didn't believe it when uh you guys couple months ago said stay with us there's a chance it's true initiative work hard learn how to code we know our [ __ ] baby we know our [ __ ] let's go yeah when we first came it was like everyone that did the boot camp or they're like a retreat that has 101 guidance from you guys as mentors minimum 52. i would never imagine my side would be times two of that i would never imagine out i'm happy with just the 70 but then when my brotherinlaw was like hey i see that you're doing good in this boot camp and you're always going to school like i'm always like i'm always texting like hey i'll be late i gotta finish this class i don't care if it's eight o'clock i'll go to home depot at nine o'clock i don't care but i have to do this now and then i can leave so he just showed like i'll be i'll be working to like with him you know 11 to midnight some sometimes he just sees like hey he this kid is doing school trying to get a fulltime job plus helping me on the side because you know he owes so he can't really lift that much and then he's just like instead of just now i said i'll do it for free just to show that hey it's a family business i'll take care of things we're doing this together it's family but the fact that he's he's like hey i'll pay you from just the property make some selling houses he'll just pay me every two weeks or just pay me once a month i don't mind my fourth house i don't i don't mind on top of it you get to learn right so it's always always a learning opportunity at the same time you get bbs can be paid to learn it doesn't get better but i want to ask you a question okay so what did you like you told me one thing it's one thing when i got on a call with you and i was like holy [ __ ] it's amazing and i was so happy for you right you tell me one thing in terms of what you learned from this bootcamp that really kind of really transformed your mindset when you went into the interview like what was it tell me dude this just just happened tuesday right just it just happened no last sunday sunday not bad i'm losing track of days now so sunday uh we had a student i'm not gonna say his name that was uh working at internship and then he was just describing how his internship was going nas was like be the ceo of wherever the hell you want to work you have to go in this show initiative you have to show that you can make more money for this company let's just say you're irreplaceable basically like you got to know what you're talking about you can show it's the action that matters you can show that you can actually do this so i walked into that interview i was like i'm not going to be nervous i'm not going to cross my legs i'm not going to show hand motion even though i had a button up and i had like boxers on but they couldn't really see the bottom of much they just have to see that professional and then like home body at the bottom very i was very outgoing i made a lot of jokes they see that i'm very outgoing person i made the room kind of like la it's it's always fun like we're here to have fun you're here to see how i am as a person this is how i am as a person i'll get stuff done i'm not going to complain or make excuses there's no excuses it's either you do it you don't do it there's there's no like i don't know what happened it's either you didn't do it or you didn't do it or you did it so the fact that nods just changed the mindset of just like making excuses blaming other people like you didn't do this the fact that i used to blame my old boot camp for how i didn't like coding was completely wrong it was wrong there's a bunch of developers that came out that boot camp it's just my experience was bad that's one out of like you know hundreds of kids that did that boot camp but instead of making that excuse i decided to join this boot camp and listen to what nas had to say liam had to say jesse had to say daniel every time he popped in here and there khazi coming up with like exercise throughout the class just do it and then the outcome would be dependent all the outcome will depend on you is you you do it or not if you don't don't do it developers let me let me okay like another interesting thing i want to ask you is in this boot camp what were some of the hardest moments for you oh that's interesting i bet there are a lot okay so uh this this this part um i thought it was pretty funny so we just got done with data structures right and uh liam kind of gave us a hint that we're gonna go to front end and i was like oh friend ends easy all i have to do is display flex that's all i have to do easy and then he gave us this porno dora app of like a timer yeah and i'm just sitting there i was like how are you supposed to make the timer go with the orange circular to like match up and then i was like not the front end was easy that is a lie so the fact that i underestimate front end front end is just as hard as backend because you have to be it's just as hard so i was like okay no more data structures thank god but there's no way this bootcamp is going to be easy i already knew that it's going to be my like there's no way that he takes a relaxing two weeks there's never a time that he takes like the easy two weeks so we decided to go back inside front end and then we did a couple of apps and front ends from uh what is that a frontend mentor and i was like oh he's just gonna try to get us back in front and learn a bit you know before we get inside react and the most challenging was switching from data structures where i thought i had a grasp on and then he decided to do a frontend uh spotify search bar with instead of using javascript he wants you to use link lin link bliss and then auto completely we did do that but he started out with api async away functions first and then he goes there's a better way to do with react so we bumped into react and i'm just like sitting back i sat back in class one time it's like this project isn't done this project isn't done that project isn't done but nas is number one thing is just do it you have to do it if you do it you get it you turn it in you get to look back once you add that to your portfolios you did this app but it's very very challenging very challenging it's very hard i'm not going to say you should think of this as boot camp where he's where nas is going to show you the demonstrations and then give you activities and then like tutor you how to code and then move on hell no he would legitimately call like he would finish her code and then he'd be like hmm who who do i think not paying attention or who's pretending to pay attention he calls us out on it which at first i was like oh this is fun but then he starts calling me out only sometimes i'm just like i got this i'm not nervous no more but then but here's the thing by calling you out right that made you more vigilant but also calling you out it made you more confident to go into the interview right yeah and i want to ask you a question for you what was it that they hired you for right like i didn't get that part from you like what was it only the behavioral questions like was it you cracking jokes and them just loving your vibe and they thought hey let's just bring this person on or what what made them say yes to bringing you on into their company and giving you a job offer well they gave me like different um let's say situations of how i would deal with you know problem solving so let's say for example if a software is messing up how would i go to solve it with no help let's say it's that you're basically i t but let's say no one's there to help you how would you solve this how would you go about it well one thing i learned from ingrid one of your past students is she wrote out a list of how she solved things is output input complexity pseudo code and then code so when you break that down into bits and pieces as you know how the software works you know how to debug it because once you learn how to debug it you should know how that software works figure out like what's the problem the first complexity is like what is wrong with it is there different ways to solve it and let's say pseudo code what are the steps of making this let's say problem solving of how did that error come up in the first place for let's say step one step two would be trying to figure out how to solve that problem and step three just solve it and there's a lot of stuff with they asked me how would i deal with like if i was stuck on something if i couldn't like if i was i couldn't learn it or something like that like a learning situation where everyone goes to i just told them hey i'm gonna take a walk with my dogs or when i get if i can't solve it that day i'm gonna i'm gonna take a break come back but i'm gonna think about it all all night that's all we think about is how to solve that problem all night and when i get back inside the next day i'm going to solve that or ask you any technical questions as well or no they asked me it was uh it was uh i think they asked me linked lists how to make a linked list how to catch api or how to fetch api um i think there's one more but i couldn't really did you solve any of them or did you fail in those questions when you were answering i know i failed um the second technical question because uh i was at that time it was an hour and a half in they asked me at the very end so i was like my energy is basically kind of gone i was just kind of like just thinking of ways of how to solve the problem and i wasn't like quiet about it i was like scratching my head or i was like rubbing my chin is winning or usually when i think but one thing about me is when i get nervous i make jokes by that time i knew it was not time to make junk this is serious so i was like at this time i'm just going to be like hey this is how i would solve it step by step by step but if something error pops up my resources would be books for google and at that time i'll use that to solve this problem going forward if there's people around me then i'll ask for help but this these are the first steps that i would do so go back to output input complexity pseudo code code and that's actually very important is like right when you go ahead and when you go to the interview it's not just that you've been able to solve the problem it's you being able to talk through it yeah right because that's what they're looking for is they're looking for people who can communicate who can talk through a problem even even for example if they can't fully write it or maybe they get it wrong but most importantly hey can you talk with someone can you work with a team to solve it yeah because you're going to be working with the team and they want to see how would this person communicate their lack of understanding or or their actual understanding to other people on the team and if they screw up will they take ownership or will they lie and make up [ __ ] and not take ownership over this so all of those things come into play so even when you're on zoom calls and now it's calling you out you working under that pressure answering him explaining is really helping you even for those interviews so yeah i love that like how your journey went it had you know it's like you have to learn coding and master that but on top of it you have to actually be confident take a chance in yourself right and actually apply for that internship even though mentally you were like hey i'm not going to apply so like jesse and nas pushed you to apply right so it's a lot of it is mindset work as well so that's incredible i mean you have this amazing job offer so tell me what does your life look like after going from this boot camp like what is it going to be looking like for you now what are you excited about i know the first few months is a lot of adjusting but i'm very lenient i'm i'm ready to learn as much as i can i'm at age where i i don't want to stop learning because we're like i already invested so much money on coding so there's there's more steps i want to learn how to play guitar i want to learn like a bunch of stuff more and stuff like that i don't want to learn how to dance from nas but that can wait down the road but it's just at this moment in time i wanted to i wanted to from all my past things is i always wanted a stable job i always wanted a job where they care about the employees the ceo is inspirational to me like i even messaged him right when i got the show like you're still inspiration to me i still want to clean your shoes but i'm just saying you know you just you gotta stay humble and hungry at the same time it's just the mindset of nah i don't know how it is going to be in the future because i haven't thought that far but the fact that i'm not nervous no more or the fact that i'm not like scared of like what what am i going to do in five ten years like am i gonna deliver mail am i gonna do amazon flex am i gonna learn how to become electrician so i can work for boeing for an airplane company like i don't have to do that no more the plan that i set out from 2009 to basically yesterday knock on wood is accomplished my now my next goal is to work at this place first no until i feel comfortable enough about my skills where maybe one day i'll go down to california and work with you guys and maybe maybe that's fantastic and we decided to open up like a school or something down there who knows no we are planning to do that that'll be amazing and we would love to talk about that so dude i'm so excited you're like just to flashback right you come into this program you're doing postmates making 20 000 a year you go through this now you're potentially looking at making between 70 000 to 128 000 a year that is absolutely freaking fantastic dude you should be really proud of yourself for putting in the work taking the chance on yourself being humble having that humility you know deflecting with humor but i think that helps you know people like you yeah for that right so yeah but it's okay i love that lightheartedness is freaking awesome dude so now this is amazing i'm excited would you recommend somebody who's thinking about joining full stack mastery boot camp and wants to be a part of it and they're thinking about it they're on the fence would you recommend this program to them no i have no hesitation and why tell them why man you just have to come in for me come on i just almost gave up coding the fact that the instructors care even if you go even they don't even you don't ever have to hit them up they hit you up through messages like hey how are you doing with this code like the effort that you guys put in to actually care about the students is number one the fact that if the students know that the instructors care they give their effort even more and the fact that you hear rumors about other boot camps like how come they never succeed like they probably do succeed just depending on the person but the fact that the rumors of like school were like gap and stuff like that and now if you just join this force mastery boot camp there's a better chance of you actually getting a job and they're gonna help you until you get a job they're going to help you with databases frontend backend mock interviews you can practice doing a capstone capstone basically there's some there's people coming in they want you to build their website you work as a team you talk to the client to build them a website and in the end or other what other places can you get all that within the time frame of you being part of the boot camp and it's very it's the only thing difficult i see is the time of how you how we are not so for bootcamp is usually like states or us but you guys are global global like you can help people from india vietnam russia as long as you're a part of this they they're they're able to get in without being 10 15 20 000 in depth and you guys have a payment plan that works out you guys have a team that'll communicate with us let's say you can afford it they'll work out a plan for you to even attend as long as you're committed as long as you put in time class is going to be fun it's going to be challenging it's going to be there's probably going to be some days where you don't want to go to class but the fact that if you feel like coding is hard once you join the coaching call every tuesday thursday saturday sunday you want to continue coding that's so great about nas is you feel so much of a headache you don't want to code no more and then when you get inside coaching call it just clicks instantly so where can you get that anywhere else school you like i don't want to go class i'll just skip class forget class even though i paid 20 000 for class sometimes you don't want to go for class right even if just this you want to be in class yeah that's absolutely amazing bro thank you so much for jumping on here and like sharing this with us yeah i'm so happy for you like seriously this is absolutely crazy to be able to do that in three

actually put in that work and succeed and bring that and bring good energy that's the most important thing if you don't then unfortunately that's not a good fit yep so with that said we would want you to be the next success story and if you want that for yourself go ahead and do that with that said this is your boy kazi and nas we will see you in the next video
