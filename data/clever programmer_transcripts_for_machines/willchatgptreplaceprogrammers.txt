will AI replace programmers not only coder jobs but every industry jobs are at risk as a developer I am having job security thoughts after seeing chat GPT do all this stuff it means no future for software Engineers with more and more stable AI short answer no long answer maybe look when calculators came out mathematicians weren't like let's all drive down to the Golden Gate Bridge and just take a nosedive when tools like tractors came out Farmers didn't stop existing when social media came out people didn't stop communicating to each other now here's what did happen a ton of behavior changed there were a lot less Farmers than there were before because one farmer could do the job now of multiple retractors with social media instead of going out and speaking to people he could speak to thousands of people just like I am right now with a video and with mathematics people are able to think at a higher level because they have calculators for programming you have greater languages than assembly and so all that's happening is we're able to operate at a higher and higher and higher level and progressively will keep operating at a higher level until our speed from input to Output becomes almost instant that is essentially where we are approaching where we as human beings using the aid of Technology are trying to become for the lack of a better word gods where when we think of an idea it becomes that's where we're approaching even Elon Musk said this on a Joe Rogan podcast where he said our input ability currently input output ability is very slow we take in information and we output it very slowly so if we need to send a message her brain thinks about that then we go on our phone then we type it in then the message gets sent out he wants to reduce that to almonds instant where things like neural link could think it and things could become so really all it comes down to is your ability to critically think and solve useful problems all of the tools are designed to help you so as AI is coming will a lot of programmers be losing their jobs absolutely will there still be a need for programmers yes because you will still need programmers who can use tools like chat GPT to Output with 5 10 15 developers could now it the choice is in your hands you could be on the side of I am defeated this technology is coming I am stressed I can't sleep at night I should just end my career right here right now and if you do so the other developers will probably thank you thank you if you decide not to do so and if you decide to continue I promise you will be one of the developers that will out leverage and outwork a lot of other developers not by more work ethic because you have a tool like Chad gbt or other AI tools that will come along to help you you'll output 5 10 developers work we as an economy and Country and the world will just move at a much faster Pace when we want to think of an app and we want to build an app we'll be able to build that app almost as fast as we can think of it and so the thing the app that took a year before might take three to five months now because you have tools like chat GPT to be able to help you write your code if you need to come up with functions hey the function that sums things up it can just write it for you hey can you add this feature to the app Chad GPT can write it for you hey we need to be able to handle users or save these users to a Firebase type that in Chad GPT or an AI technology will start spitting out code for you and you could plug it in can you wake me up my backend that can handle post requests or get requests for our users or allow our users to update their app or their profile picture or their user profile or whatever it may be boom Chad GPT can spit out code you could plug it in and now your app has a new feature so really your ability to produce increases at a really high rate so if you want to be the modern day developer I would say Chad GPT or AI has to be your tool set has to be part of your tool set you need to learn programming you should still continue learning programming but on top of that you should add the use of AI to help you in your Learning Journey to help you output more code to be more efficient to build more to ship more projects I think the Modern Day Developers as human beings right we're becoming more and more like cyborgs again something that Elon Musk says which is we didn't have anything right then we got computers and then we got phones and we were able to access any piece of information from our phone well now we have this assistant that works with us our Jarvis chat GPT or any AI tool they'll be coming along it allows it works with you and it helps you think of it like a butler that works alongside you the people that will be winning tomorrow are the people who are adapting to technology any person who's won look at history are the people that adapted to technology so the farmers that started learning how to use tractors the mathematicians started using and teach teaching how to use calculators as fast as possible everybody who failed were people who were afraid of change scared pissed themselves when new technology came out coward and fear made themselves useless and just went well nothing matters anymore yes at the end of the day nothing matters you're gonna die and none of this is gonna exist the sun is gonna explode and they're gonna be no energy left there might even be a big bang that happens later so in an infinite amount of time span yes nothing will matter but practically speaking right so you know the reason I'm saying that is because a lot of you are like well yeah it's coming and it's only a matter of time until they could do everything okay but until then you can do a lot of things and you need to be focused on the present because what you're talking about might not happen within 50 to 100 years and by that time you'll be dead so what do you have to worry about so for now all you can do what you should do is adapt to these Technologies learn how to use them learn all these tools use them on a daily basis to build applications to write code constantly and consistently use it I promise you the best of the developers we're going to be seeing now are going to be the ones that could use these tools these AI tools are adapted to this technology and you will be some of the most highest paid most educated highest value people on the planet so short answer no AI will not replace the need for programmers long answer the reason why I said maybe is because in a long enough time Horizon where AI can do everything including think that's a possibility but we're not even close to it so you need to adapt to this technology take this technology use it on an everyday basis use this technology to build apps go conquer the freaking planet
