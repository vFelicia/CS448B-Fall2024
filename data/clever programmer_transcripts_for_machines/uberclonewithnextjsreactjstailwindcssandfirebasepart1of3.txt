youtubes are going yo what is up guys how's it going this is qazi welcome to the uber build you're going to be building uber from scratch okay and it's going to be an absolutely incredible build today i got with me you got nas now dumaski and guys we're building a sick app today we're going to use technologies like next year yes react gs we're going to use stealing css style components and even tear this out we're going to create a map using map box that's right it's gonna be a lot of fun guys this is gonna be absolutely incredible there's gonna be a ton of stuff that's gonna be covered in this so please keep up i hope you're gonna enjoy this and have fun okay uh and we'll go through this kind of quickly okay so it's gonna be an uber build it's gonna be jacked it's gonna be awesome tailwind firebase react next stack is i mean this is stacked right yes so stacked upon stacks upon stacks that's right tons of stacks here so now we're ready to build uber clone this is day two of the challenge so this uber build will be built in three days we're gonna build it slowly so everybody can keep up with us and make progress that's our goal um all right and these are the things that you guys are going to be using all right let's go here who's ready to build it guys drop it down below in the youtube chat in the zoom chat because we already let's go yo frank ramos just started off with the five dollar donation thank you so much paul just dropped the four dollar donation thank you so much uh tag us on instagram at cleverkazy and for nas tag him at nas domonsky okay uh put put your stories of you coding we will repost you we love that stuff okay cool the chat is blowing up everywhere i'm excited let's keep rocking and rolling okay so day one of youtube guys we got ton of views on youtube we had 670 people watching us live and we had over 130 plus homework submissions so thank you guys so much for that we're going to be getting to the uber build in just a second so that's for everybody that's tuning in right now i'm going to be getting to uber right away yeah okay some submissions were absolutely awesome so thank you guys for that um so here we have macy so on the left hand side and ben carter you all built your portfolios and even deployed it online so shout out to all of you that looks so good that made that ben carter one is so good it looks exactly like via's code like that is top level like knowledge like very creative i love that nice job then that's a really nice one and good job macy as well awesome job putting it together that's awesome devlin roca built their portfolio nice job looks very clean i like it and then juan you took our portfolio and changed your photo and stuff like that it's a good job and you guys even have the links there which means it's deployed so nice work oh wow leonardo we got leonardo up in here looks like he likes to solve problems and jose he is currently working as a lead backing developer what that's crazy well now you're also going to be a front developer so that's sick that's beautiful jay and mario drop your portfolios great job and uh guys don't feel bad if you didn't show your portfolio we still love you okay we're here for you we love you now oh nice now what's the agenda for today uh the agenda guys is this right day two to four we're going to be building the uber clone with uh with next js react.js tailwind css and firebase okay that's what's going to be happening today and for the next two days after this and day five we're going to be going over your roadmap to becoming a frontend developer in under 90 days and we're going to be revealing something very special on that last day so stay tuned yes and all those days are 5 00 pm ps you guys should just remember that okay make sure you come to every single day every single day is value packed jampacked energy packed yes 5 p.m pst remember that okay here's where we're going to be building today all right so we're going to be building uber and you guys are going to be building these screens all right so that's a login screen with full user authentication once you log in you get to view the entire app and you can choose whether you're going to do ride or what you want to do okay once you do that it asks you it takes you to the search hey where do you want to go so you can put in your cities like santa monica or los angeles or whatever it may be and then check this out right on the last screen it will tell you um not only which rides are available but it'll tell you exactly how much the cost too based on the distance yeah so like if you want to go from santa monica all the way to europe it's going to cost you a pretty hefty amount right so it will actually calculate that for you yes but anyways today guys we're going to be building two pages so we're going to build the home page you can see right there and the search page so the two pages that we're focused on is start those two pages okay and then the next two days after that then we'll be focusing on the other ones okay but these are gonna be our focuses for today beautiful beautiful okay that's the main goal for today okay is that clear to all of you guys what we're covering today capisce okay beautiful beautiful awesome all right uh now stick to the end right of day five we have something special coming for you so just like i said make sure you keep that in mind and let's get started with today's training if you have any questions comment them below and we'll be able to answer them at some point wow uh fha just dropped the donation for 25 and just said current student in fsm that's awesome thank you so much that's one of our students in full stack mastery boot camp and it seems like 5 p.m is a perfect time and they can actually jump on are you guys liking these times better like 5 pm pc instead of 10 mpc let us know down in the comments below we would love to see it okay and one last thing guys i want to say guys let's go ahead and smash that like button okay if you guys love us we love you so we'll appreciate some love and that i know will make you smile so smash that like button at the same time of course subscribe because we're gonna do this a lot uh of course and that's pretty much it and of course take this out as many people as possible because this is some amazing amazing value and at the same time we just have a lot of fun so we like to spread our knowledge to the whole world and our energy absolutely all right with that said guys here's time for some freaking homework okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna give you guys homework at the end of this okay so that so stay tuned for the homework what we're gonna give you and the homework is gonna be basically what we don't get to build during this build okay and we'll let you know exactly okay cool uh with that said i think we're pretty much ready to let's get started to pretty much get into it okay so let's go ahead and close this out yeah and i'm gonna give you guys just a little bit of context guys just so you know for those of you who are you know following along you know i always say this if you cannot keep up it is completely okay right the point of this for you guys to see what we can do what you can do as a coder there might be a lot of new things for you right and that's just the whole point of it right is the it's like to see give you some seeds and what's possible yeah okay and then you can add later on rewatch this video so that you can go ahead and you know take it step by step all right absolutely so don't yell at us if you just kink up keep up with it you know we're not gonna take up five hours you wanna take up only a few hours okay and this is the this is the app guys so i'm showing you guys the app here's the map right you can see what's going on you can click ride and then in this app you can type in like which cities you want to go to so here we can do something like this right and then i can go los angeles here and i can hit confirm locations and boom it actually shows me my route from los angeles to santa monica right and here are my options when i click them you can see things change and it also gives me pricing yeah and that's pretty much it you can then after that you can go back go back to the screen if you want you can hit the back button right there the top left hit back again that takes it back to the home screen and if you even hit the profile page the profile picture it will actually take you out and we'll send you out yes exactly beautiful so guys give us some fire down below in the chat if you are excited to build this because i think this looks pretty cool wouldn't you say so cozzy this looks pretty freaking awesome um i'm really excited for for you guys to watch um watch this get built out um okay amazing so i think let's go ahead and get started so now what are the first steps guys all right what do you guys think drop it down the chat in the chat well open up the terminal so for you guys open up your command line or terminal okay that's the first thing that we're actually going to go ahead and do here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to go into a folder so i just like to go into a folder called github that i have okay you don't need to go into any folders you can stay exactly where you're at okay yes and then what we want to do here is we want to type in a command all right and this command is a simple command that allows you to install this next project yeah let's install this project okay so so what you guys want to do is do npx it's called it is called npx create next app that's right npi create dash next app and then you do at latest yep so we're gonna do just like this cool now to how to be able to make this work you have to have npm installed and as we said yesterday you have to have npm installed so hopefully you guys got that installed yeah or notes installed sorry and you can try it and if you don't have it installed you can install it of course later on as well okay even after this video like if you at any point you just can't keep up and you're trying your hardest and you're like just getting frustrated you can just watch okay i would say keep trying to code along with us and if you just can't some point you can just watch all right and make sure you're kind of getting it that's the whole that's the whole idea okay cool and what's your project name i'm just gonna call it uber next clone okay just like that and i'm going to hit enter and now you see it's saying installing react react dom and next nice this is looking good yes on eslint so your sled is going to be for cleaning up your code yes uh if you guys have trouble with like hey what is um you if you said cd github and it didn't work that's okay that that command only works for me because i have a folder called github if you don't have that folder you don't even need to type in cd github you can just type in that npx command that we showed you beautiful next thing we want to do is we want to open up vs code and open open up our project cool so now i'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna i'm gonna open it up in my uh via cs beautiful okay if you want the the command let me go and get you the command npx create next app right here i got you boom okay so i just basically went into my vs code and i picked that folder all right so if i were to show you guys how you would do this is you would go to whichever folder you put it in here i'm going to click uber next clone and then i'm just going to hit open in my vs code and it's going to open that up right here okay beautiful and uh i'm gonna make nas and me a little bit smaller because i think we're taking up over like too much of the screen it's gonna stop you guys seeing some of the coding action that's happening so that's gonna be mad yeah okay awesome so i think uh that's good and now i'm gonna give access to nas so he can jump in this as well and start coding beautiful just put in slack from me all right here you go thank you i'm gonna open this up in a little in a second here one second okay um all right cool so we're gonna start now coding this see you cause it do you can do it again uh it's not opening the actual thing okay here let's uh try this again there you go okay now i see it hold on awesome hey it's just taking a little time okay all right it says you have joined and it says you left so hopefully you're in i hope so too okay beautiful wow guys we're up to 303 people this is fire thank you guys so much for tuning in we're gonna be building uber all right from scratch and you guys are going to watch us build it and watch us add in all this functionality so i'm excited for you guys i hope you guys are excited whoever is just tuning in now uh welcome welcome and like we said you know even in the zoom chat if there's something you're feeling like freaking out it's all good just watch along and you're gonna start getting it and picking it up uh cool somebody's like yeah the terminal is taking a long time to upload yeah that'll happen sometimes uh is this not working for you bro i got it i got it it's just taking some time okay thank god whoo are you in yeah yeah yeah i should see okay because it to me just says zero participants give me one second uh joined hey let's go and can you okay great so we've got that guys right we've got our application we've got two things we've got of course in the top left if you want to look at it if we don't do a shared server just yet let's not do that just yet let's go back to our file structure okay and you can see there's two there's a few things we've got we've got the pages folder we've got the public folder right there and we also got even uh what we've got the styles folder that's right the one that we're going to be working with right now is going to be the pages folder so if you go to the pages folder right there yeah and if you simply open up index.js so i feel like a bunch of people are asking what was the first step so let me just show it because i think bunch of people are getting stuck there so uh a lot of you guys are saying what was the first step so the first step was this we typed in literally the first thing you need to do right is i'm just going to go here and clear this up so it's clear the first thing that you're going to do is this npx create next app at latest just like that and that's going to install everything for you if this gives you errors this just means you don't have node installed the right way and make sure you have it installed the right way and then everything will work yes okay awesome um and then you essentially open that folder so this will create an app for you then you create then you open up that folder in visual studio code all right okay all right let's keep going nas beautiful okay after that we want to do is we want to open up the terminal here so you can do open terminal all right here we go there we go and you can do npm space fun space dev all right there we go beautiful so looks like you've got we've got us a and now you want to open this one up okay here we go there we go open up let me zoom out all right so this is if you are able to get to this point you have your very first uh react slash next app up and running okay so congratulations if you've made it or if you haven't made it it's okay you can rewatch it and make it up to here yes yes yes yes so at this point guys this is your first application right it's the starter application but of course we're going to modify this now okay so if we go into our pages folder and if we go in to our index.js yeah we can do that right now okay so let's go into pages folder and let's go into index beautiful okay and you can see that there's all of these things we've got the head we've got the main and this is literally like html except just to give you guys some context in next gs react.js it's actually called jsx which is basically html but for javascript okay so just has a different name okay yeah now we're going to do first is we need to remove all of this in terms of remove everything from head where you see the head and i'm going to go all the way down i'm going to remove all the way down to the footer right here so we don't need all any of this stuff right here okay this is what your file should look like after you're done exactly exactly then you want to go ahead and click save right and at this point your application should look like nothing i'm going to go i'm going to go ahead and open up my localhost so i can see what i'm seeing from your site beautiful and inside here which you can just say stuff like for example you know i can say the header right and if you run this if you save this it should technically show the header for you right there okay yeah so now if you look at our application right now let's go back to our application okay uh the prebuilt one the right the one that's already been built let's go ahead and sign in with google kazi all right and what do we see go sign up with google now when i see applications guys i see what i see boxes literally in life your life is made of small boxes in terms of coding wise okay so if you see a box here what are some boxes do you see right here guys okay let's think about this well we've got one box that's the map okay and then we got another box that's going to be the bottom section right that's going to be the that's going to contain your buttons going to contain your header everything right so the reason why i do that and this is very very important is because this allows me to build html structure remember how we said that html is like a bonus right well i'm literally looking and how the bones are built right just by looking at it like that okay so if we have the map you can see i'm gonna go and create create this div called map div right here and inside here i'm gonna say map right that's gonna be my fault my first thing yeah and that i'm going to say here div right here and i'm going to say i'm going to call this the let's just say the start section okay boom so you can see if we go back to our application we have two things map and start yep all right beautiful and there are two like little boxes yeah they're just two little boxes and i'll show you exactly why they're how they are little boxes if i go back to my uh css actually it's uh inside the home the mod of the css you could click on that one maybe maybe you can follow my code can you click follow me somehow or no yeah i can i'm following you yeah is it good yeah yeah okay beautiful all right so if i go back i'm going to go back minus the js i'm going to give this a class name yeah for now and because i just want to show you exactly what we're looking for right i'm going to call it styles dot let's just call it a map yeah and inside this day i'm gonna say class name is equal to right here styles dot start okay right there's and we we give this like class name because remember in order for us to style something we need to have a class name okay yeah i go back to my home damage that's my module.css and i will actually create those so like i said we created the map one boom and then we're gonna create the start one right like so okay i will go ahead and create a background color here and i'm gonna call it a red yeah right right you guys can see right away right we've got the red color if i go to start i'm going to give this a background color of what green oop not green green no beautiful right so now we've got those two things right now let's think about okay how do we now make sure that all this you see remember how we built these two boxes one top and one bottom right so how do we make it in a way where they fill up the whole screen that's an interesting portion right well this is where we have a height for example if i go to my container here and i say height i can say 100 vh okay and check this out this is called 100 vertical height pay attention i'm going to give the background color let's just say uh background background color oh let's just say blue for now so you guys can see exactly what i'm talking about oops blue beautiful there we go you guys can see so without this height of 100 vh basically nothing will happen and it will just be like this yeah you see but if i say a height of 100 vh now is the full height yeah yeah okay now how do we make sure that this all these now take up the same amount of screen real estate this is where we you use something called display flex and you can know this down somewhere you know somewhere in your notepad but flexbox is a very important tool you're going to use just in general as a developer right it's what is what allows us to create like structures you know like facebook for example uses flexbox netflix uses flexbox everybody uses flexbox to be able to structure things yeah so if i could display flex here boom beautiful after that okay don't worry don't worry don't worry both faces in a second here we'll say flex direction you change direction to b column right here column and now it's column flex direction and now what i'm going to do is because of this i'm going to give my map a flat and i'm explaining this a second here flags of one boom right you see will take up a lot of space and then i say start also guys flags of one boom so what just happened here right remember basically what we did is we gave our map so our map right here we give this you know when i say flex of one it means basically the weight the importance of that div that container and then our start also has the same weight or the importance so if they both have the same you know the same amount of weight that means they will what they'll be split 50 50. correct yes or no yeah 50 50. yeah right if i give the start of 0.5 check this out what do you think will be smaller right if i say 0.5 what do you think yeah the star one let me ask you this what if i say this is flex 0.5 then which one will be smaller here's my question to you dropped in the chat i'm really curious which will be smaller if i put flex 0.5 for the map which one hey that's a good that's a good one guys exactly it will be the same so if i flick 0.5 i'm saying they are the same importance got it so guys this is what we created on this point right it's all good and dandy that's exactly what we want but of course it's not application the next thing i'm gonna do guys is the following i'm gonna go back to instags and what i want to understand is yes this is not the uber clown at this point but because i don't want to go further using css at this point we're done using css we're going to be using now styled components what i just showed you just one way to create styles which is an amazing way but now what i'm going to show you is how do we create style components use style components to create amazing css ready for this ready quasi yeah let's do it beautiful all right so the first thing we're going to create is we need to install tailwind css okay can you or can you go to google please and type in uh tailwind css or tailway style components there we go yep so if you type in tailwind uh tailwind style components right is that what you said that's right tailwind styled components here we go cool yes let's click the first one that's what i'll do that's we're going to use then you guys want to go ahead and scroll all the way down go all the way down and there's the install not all the way down sorry that's two that's too much let's go a little bit up now this is the one right yeah now scroll up a little bit more scroll up uhhuh up stop stop stop stop stop right here scroll a little bit down and there you will see so if you scroll yeah they go beautiful if you scroll and then you see how this is the code you want to run but we're not going to run this just yet because we need to install tail and css separately so there's a button there tail and css you see that button it says install tail and css in the little font that's italic it's like italic font on the bottom on the bottom uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's see there we go cool so i'll click that beautiful and then you guys can just even probably type in install tailwind css into google and come to the same page yeah click next yes at this point cool and there you go this is what we need to type in so the first thing you type in is gonna be the npm install which is this npm install dash g section you see that quasi got it so uh wait hold on hold on npm and saw dash g yeah right there or dash oh whatever this says right there oh and dash d sorry npm is still there this is the one right that's the one again yes okay okay got it all right cool so we're going to copy this one yeah all right let's go ahead and then this is the one that we're going to install with that's the first one yes cool so here we go let's hit so just copy paste that into your command line in this folder hit enter and that's going to start the installation process for that okay uh i guess for future if you guys want to build your app you should probably just do this this will make it easy to install uh taylormade by default yeah yeah that might be pretty good yeah okay cool and then what's next this one over here exactly then you want to do it exactly you want to do that one next okay cool so let's paste that one that's going to be the next thing that we want to install all right so now it's created a css config file beautiful and you can actually see on the left hand side there's a css config file that's been created for you yep right here that's right and then if you scroll all the way if you scroll more down now in the actual browser so go the browser back to the browser now scroll down you see where it says configure tail want to remove unused styles and production yeah there we go and that purge you see that purge the plus for the purge yeah i'm gonna copy that section and just paste it over that exactly paste it over that purge in the tail without configuring yes so before purge was empty you guys and now we just added these things inside of it yes cool good awesome good beautiful so we've got that okay and then at that point we're pretty pretty much done the one last thing i want you to do is you see how it says scroll down a little bit and it says import till and directly in your gs yep so take this guys and this is the page we want to import it in so go to pages slash so underscore app.js all right all right here and inside here you want to import that exactly yep perfect so i'm going to go here and i'm just going to paste it so that's good beautiful all right and is this it or do i need to do any of this stuff here not yet so that's pretty much that's almost done we've got one last step guys okay let's go back to our initial npm where we fought where we found style components gives you if you hit the back button kazi oh there we go beautiful and then now you want to install the npm i the whole npm i one there we go okay cool so let's go ahead and do that let's copy paste so tailwind has a multiple steps guys to get it to work let's uh to install it so we installed tailwind and now we're going to do tailwind with style components exactly exactly so just to be clear guys so those who don't know raise your hand or raise your hand or just drop in the chat if you don't know what tailwind is like who does not know what tailwind is you probably don't know probably a lot of people don't know so tailwind is like a it's like a css library that basically like combines a few css styles because css is like the core right that's like the core that's like the core that makes everything work yeah um tailwind then is uses those core that core library to go ahead and give you some functionality to make it easier for you to style things it's kind of like bootstrap a little bit yeah i don't think if you heard it before yeah yeah it just makes it easier for you to write your css okay exactly exactly exactly so you installed that that seems to be a little good and now at this point we're pretty much done if you scroll if you keep scrolling to the bottom in that uh on that page it will tell you how do you use this it says import tw uhhuh so copy that yeah and let's use it inside our index.js instead our index.js import that there cool beautiful and guys that's it so now here's the cool part let's go ahead and check out how we go ahead and use now tailwind all right now if you follow me along here instead of using divs now we're gonna use style components so it's kind of like we're creating our own div names yeah watch it right i'm going to say the following i'm going to say a wrapper okay and i'm going to close this out with the wrapper boom of course it's going to break not enough is going to work don't worry now i'm going to create that style component i'm going to say const wrapper is equal to tw dot div we're using the tw that's from here the top right and we're creating the div here and we're using backticks so what these chords called are these are called backticks so they're not quotes be careful with that because a lot of you guys will probably miss miss it right they're back they're like on the left section of your keyboard yeah all right i'm gonna save this now and you can see it's it's kind of working right now right it's kind of there right yeah and it's not even broken that's the cool part also instead of me using this div class name styles map i'm going to say map oop map and i'm going to close that with a map as well boom yeah right instead of doing that start i'm going to say for example i'm going to call this a different name i'm going to say here it's called a action button so i'm going to just call it a little bit differently which is completely okay right they're going to be called action let me see one second it's going to be called action items actually actually items sorry action items action items beautiful and we'll close it up with action items as well of course it's not there yet so we need to go ahead and const action items equals to tw that div so every time you create a div like you know like action items or whatever basically you have to create e specify it using tw.div right yeah now it might be asking question okay i'm going to save this construction map can you go ahead and uh handle runtime error can you refresh it uh yeah sure refresh okay server error requires new the chrysler constructor map requires new oh that's why we have it we didn't do the map on guys const map as well map is equal to tw that div there we go that's why yep cool beautiful nice let's go beautiful let's go the app is done hey guys thank you so much for watching we'll see you guys in the next one all right so you guys can see that we've done we've done basically what we had in the css so now remember how we had the rcss i used to follow me yeah you are beautiful yeah remember how we had our css it looked a little bit like this where i'm going to transfer this to using tail and css components so watch this now remember how we had inside the module inside our container we had display flex flash direction column background color blue let's transfer that to here i'm going to go to the wrapper that's our main uh div wrapper i will say flex number one that's gonna give me flex items okay then i say here flex dash column okay which is gonna be columns and then check this out i go the map i'm gonna say bg dash red dash 500 is it not saving let's see let's refresh save looks like it's saved well where is the color though rapper map gw dot do yeah you got the wrapper yeah that's that's right yeah like this column do we import all of our styles that should be good you're not using styles anywhere though i can remove that one actually let me go see here that's interesting why is it not specifically what if i do bg red bg dash rad dash 300 uh dash you know 300 i don't know anything nothing that's so interesting guys restart the maybe we could try that okay try stopping it and starting it again npm run dev uh let's give it a try so restart hey let's go everybody give it up for david let's go david yeah let's go guys if you have issues like that just go ahead and restart the app quit it out of it and how do you query you said like control c right or control x to quit out of it right uh yeah ctrl c and then just start the run the command again npm run dev that's right and all that is on the terminal guys if you're wondering okay yeah so here's what we did we created the flex we made this wrapper flex we give it a bj red 300 right or let's just uh bg 300 i'm going to you know how we did the whole height screen i'm gonna say h dash screen which represents the height of a 100 vh okay there we go beautiful right and then after that right that's pretty much all we have to do let's look at our map now and with our map we want to give it a flex of one like so which will have them take up as much space as possible and the same is going to happen with the action items right i'm going to give it a flex of dash one now we have map and start so it's exactly the same thing guys as we did the last time capisce capisce beautiful ever understand that so like i said we have flex of one which basically specifies that it's the same weight as the other one guys okay all right so we've got those two things beautiful the next thing guys we're going to work on quasi is what ha you said the next thing all right i think i don't know bro i think either the you want to work on the map or you want to work on yeah do the map let's do the map cool let's do it okay map is also going to be kind of very careful because you have there's a few things you need to install as well sure okay let's go can we show them the map at first uh yep so this is the map that we're gonna be working on right now guys yes beautiful okay let's work on that map now this map guys just to be clear it's usually called map box right so it's a it's a really cool tool that just allows you to import maps and use maps in your application so the first thing you guys want to do is open up your browser and go to mapbox.com cool got it there we go mac box mapbox.com that box okay you want to create an account sign up ooh okay yeah it's okay it'll be quick just do it really fast you'll be fine all right i'm gonna be creating my account guys let's do it you guys should be creating your account too yeah hey that's nice hey um okay your account really quickly here let's do it all right my account is being created now okay it will send you a link and i'll send you a confirmation link to your email so if you just open up your email really quickly there's an unexpected error apparently for what i don't know okay awesome so that's good yep it did send me an email so now i'll go to my email guys hit the like button guys much appreciated how many likes we're at i think we're about 300 400 likes i'm not sure let's go up to 500 guys you want to get up to a thousand likes this one you guys got this all right here we go beautiful um confirming my account okay awesome confirmation of my account is now done so here we go this is this is what we have yes so this is your your account for mapbox okay again it's free no matter where you are you should be able to create an account you don't have to pay for anything you have to enter billing nothing none of that okay yep daniel daniel no you do not have to follow along my friend okay beautiful so if you scroll down uhhuh scroll down you'll see there's a few things there's a token portion and so forth but that's not we're looking for let's go all the way up cool okay and actually can make it a little bit bigger yeah the full screen cool where is your scroll all the way up is that as much up as you possibly can yes create them where's your dashboard i'll click dashboard okay let's see uh that's that's what i have okay click on integrate map box there we go okay type in uh web js this one yep cool beautiful use npm okay beautiful and then copy this npm install map box so copy this one yeah nice copy this and put it into the terminal guys okay so let's go back to our reviews code nice and put on turned on and hit enter there we go it's installing it that looks good nice all right installation is done okay so you've got that working that's beautiful the next thing to do so you want to then you see how it says you need to link your style she says you see how it says link shrek you see that where uh on the on the right include the gljs css file you see that uhhuh copy this no we don't want to copy this we want to do it a little bit differently here because we're using next yes so i gave you the specific code kazi in slack it's called import mapbox gl okay so you want to go ahead and copy that you want to go back to your um app.js guys app.js and then under here then you want to import uh mapbox gl got it okay okay you got it beautiful at that point we're pretty much done pretty much done do we also import this too no no that's gonna be later okay cool yes stop that now hit next on the right section like where you see next in map box okay yes okay now we've got a few things okay you see this bomb mattebox glue because required we don't need that this is where now we import mapbox so let's go back to index.js okay let's go okay and there we're going to import mapbox i'm gonna do this right now okay so give me one second here i'm gonna do this right now for you okay so it's literally just called macbook gl like so like boom so right here okay boom so map gl from mapbox gl okay that's gonna be our macbook gl next i'm gonna do is we're gonna create our uh token so in the specific token and i have a token here but on the right hand side it will show your token as you guys can see in your uh okay it says i don't turn my string constant let's see let's see let's see it's okay you can just do it like this because i forgot to put a beautiful okay okay one second let me go and copy the token properly because i didn't copy it well okay do you want me to use my token or no no i got it okay beautiful all right different token here okay so the token you see on the right side you see how you have you guys have a token on the right hand side um yeah that's the one you want to copy so you want to do matte box gl access token copy that whole thing and paste it exactly where i just showed you yeah right here just like this yes okay done well cost says done wait what cause that's not no no no no no [Laughter] uh my my brother's name is wakas that's why there you go beautiful so we've got our token guys the reason why we have a token is because this allows madbox to know that hey you know what you are a real person okay yeah now for that after that what we want to do is we want to now create uh our map box now it's a little bit different now as you can see that you see how it says um new map shell that map all that stuff that's not gonna create so inside here yeah we're gonna do like this we're gonna say const map equals new map box stop map like this right here okay don't worry about this so far now this is gonna work we don't want this right now okay okay beautiful now you basically can copy everything that you have on the right hand side near that specific uh what's it called map yeah if you can copy this that's completely fine okay so you can don't worry about it let me see yeah beautiful um next thing we want to do guys is this is a map but it's not really going to work initially because we need to use a different type of style to to make this work now what i mean by that you see we initialize the map this initializes our whole map okay yeah but in our application in next gslash reactor yes in order to initiate something to start the application we use something called use effect that's right so i'm going to import something called use effect import use effect from react you guys can see it right here in the on the on the top okay let's save this right here this is what we got okay and then at that point we're gonna use use effect so use effect boom okay the next thing we're gonna do we're gonna do we're gonna create a function like this and i'm gonna specify that it's a something that's gonna load in the beginning of replication so just to give you guys some context use effect is something that's gonna be uh conglold and whenever your application loads for the first time so if i do console.log yeah log and i say hello all right and i save it okay can you maybe go to the application qazi yeah let's go to the application boom yeah and if you rightclick inspect element can you try that yeah there we go okay let's go console beautiful and yeah i see hello right there yeah you can see guys that's hello right and that's only ran the first time that your application gets loaded and that's what we need to do with the map right now i'm going to send you a link here really quickly here okay so i'm going to say map box here essentially link really quickly macbooks using um right here so i'll send you guys this link really quickly you guys can go check this out i'll give you this in slack okay this will give you guys some context on how to use mapbox and react can you go go ahead and open that one up sure all right there we go beautiful i know it's like imitation guys but this is just something you have to learn when you you know get into this okay now let's scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down scroll down and you will see something called source app.js how do you add mapbox gl to yes right there at the bottom just scroll down okay scrolling there we go keep scrolling yeah and there you have user so skip scroll a little bit more uhhuh there we go and now we get the user fact you everybody see that it actually tells you exactly how to do that right there you see no uh right there use effect okay right there yep got it beautiful yes so that's what we want to do but we're going to do a little bit differently right so we can copy this it's going to copy this quasi uhhuh copied it okay and then go back to our piece of code yeah beautiful and replace it with a used effect with the user effect that we currently have okay beautiful hey beautiful and i'm gonna work with this now okay so we don't need this map.current no don't need none of that okay and so i'm just going to say const map here const map that's going to create our map here this right here container is basically it's going to look for hey where am i going to put my map right what id now to to enter that i if i you look at me i have this map section right here i'm going to give it an id is equal to map yeah right here i can remove this map section right here now this map basically is going to say hey you know what this is where you put your actual map box so instead of doing map continue the current i'm going to say map okay the styles that's completely fine okay for latitude longitude i have a specific lab to launch it's like the center of the united states i can copy and paste this for you guys maybe you guys can copy pixels for you as well it's like 99 right here 39 you guys can copy and paste it for you if you guys on youtube or if you're on on zoom i can even do it for you right now as well so you can all have it all right so let's go ahead and do that right now boom all right then the zoom what do you guys think this zoom does okay what do you think this represents you guys tell them in the chat but you guys think this represents who can tell me what do you think this represents the zoom portion but tell me what is represent that's right it's just a zoom tool but it's basically the zoom number so i'm going to remove this zoom number boom and i'll just give it a three yep you guys are yes there we go that's beautiful i know right so go ahead and close out your uh console console log your inspect element please yeah beautiful by the way i see you guys guessing it correctly in there in the chat you guys were saying you guys know what the zoom is so nice job on that yeah good job everybody so look everything is good all right so this is our first section but of course you guys can see that maybe this map looks a little bit different than we usually look uh what we first showed you it's because there's a different style you see this right here this this style we want to have by the way this is the style that we want so i have a different style right here i'm going to copy this for you and paste it in for you right here well it's a different style i'll paste it in for you and zoom guys if you want to check it out yeah this is the style here we'll paste it in zoom and a monother somebody if you guys can paste it on youtube as well so if somebody needs it they can have it exactly so now you guys can see that the map looks very different yeah yeah that's that yeah it looks very very very different so the map guys is done it is done we can remove all this section we don't need any of this right here right we can save this and our map is pretty good now i'm going to do this now a little bit differently guys now one of the coolest things about nextgs that you can do is the fact that you guys can create something called components and who can who can tell me what are components what do you guys think who can tell me what are components if you guys are in zoom what are components what are components huh components what can tell me it's a piece of code that's right reusable ui element a part on your app parts of a whole yeah that's a good way to think about it beautiful it's a reusable ui element right so it's like almost like you use the same kind of little structure block to be able to use in multiple places so for the map because we're gonna be using multiple places guys i'm going to create a component for this right away so if we go back to pages if you go to the pages section you click right new for a click and you click new file uh and and okay our new folder in your folder and create that called the components okay we're going to put that inside of pages right metal pages you guys can see already created right here well okay okay you created it while i was creating it so i'm going to delete mine cool there we go okay so then i'm going to create inside here i'm going to create a new file right click a new file and i'll say map dot js guys boom that's our map now okay that's gonna be our component there's nothing in here so to really quickly create a component i'm gonna say r a f c e and this is a really cool um kind of you know a handy dandy tool what is the tool called uh cozy do you know uh it's like extensions so it's uh if you go into uh if you wanna install this extension it's like is co is uh react.js code s7 it's like yeah snippets and stuff like that so it's this one right here es7 react redux snippets and then you can do rafce and then essentially just makes a component for you right off the bat exactly beautiful so within this at this point we're gonna i'm going to go back to my index.js and i will import a lot of stuff that i need of course i'm going to import my tailwind and my my map box as well we'll copy all of that i will go back to mata.js i will use it i will also import import use effect that's we're going to use inside here you could just do it over here i think huh you could do it up here but that's fine yeah i can just i don't need the react portion at all honestly right so got that and then i'm pretty much going to do the same thing i did before because remember i'm going to create this div called wrapper right wrapper i'm going to give an id is equal to math they're like looks like uh david rokosi had a hand in that styling yes yes he did what's up david let's go dude he had a lot of hand in building this app actually behind the scenes oh yeah oh yeah he did it everybody yeah let's go all right okay the developer in the shadows true that through that i will go ahead and import this map.gl access token so go ahead and copy all of that or or actually cut it go back to my gs we're going to use it now here okay okay right again we're just making it a little bit more diverse another is a little bit more kind of componentized i like to call it right after that i will copy this user effect because i don't need this insight here i will command exit i will cut it put it into the map section boom boom boom use effect beautiful save it okay okay and then let's go back to my app.js oh it is sorry and i don't really need this at this point right this whole map thing i don't even need this either you know even this at this point now instead of doing map i actually import the whole component i will say import map see and then right away told me that it's inside the components.map right so we create this component we're going to import it now instead of doing this i'll just simply say like this save so let's see will it work will it work let me see let me see it says fail to compile it's okay and if our map has already been declared it's okay because if we scroll here guys you guys can see we have this const map we don't need this remove this save it boom okay wrapper is not defined don't worry because inside the map.js we have this wrapper inside here so we need to create it using const wrapper is equal to what do you guys think what do i do here guys who knows put on the zoom chat put on the youtubes guys what i do here to create the div that's right ralph i do what dot exactly okay i will save it and it's not there for a certain reason because guys remember guys we had this flex one when we defined our map so i'm going to call this flex dash one now and watch our map coming back back again oh it's back it's back okay give me one second okay uh turn off i think people are having trouble with the font and uh really i like the font i i like it too uh i'm just trying to see like what's the best way to turn off italics um i mean yeah i think keep going for now and i'll see if i can figure that out so guys we've got one thing working okay the map is done part one of this is done of course now the next i'm gonna work on is the bottom section guys okay the bottom section of this application so we have all the uber yeah the map is good to go it's it's the actual uber styling nice look you can even scroll through it like if you go ahead and scroll through it zoom out of it it works guys nice okay beautiful pretty cool all right the next section i'm going to work on is inside the inside geos it's going to be the actual action items so as you can see i'm currently here yeah i'll go ahead oh there's and a few things that we've got here guys if we go back to our original app okay i'm going to divide this into a few sections go back to the original add those created ready uh okay cool okay now let's draw those sections that we want to create okay let's draw them out so we've got the top section maybe you can use a rectangle bro the rectangle section all right there we go there we go got the record so we got the header i'm going to call this the header yeah okay after that i'm going to call the other ones called action buttons that's another div and after that i'm going to create something called input in the input box button right so three things we're going to add in there got it yeah so let's go ahead and do that accordingly you know in the actual couple action items here guys is going to be that box right there the actual items is the whole box actually actually honestly is the box around the whole thing right exactly okay so action items will have all of these things in there exactly that's actually our action items inside here we'll have a few things we'll have the header boom and then we'll have the actual action buttons these are the action buttons right there beautiful and then inside here i'm gonna have the input button yep and that's gonna be that where too right so who knows guys who can tell me how do i create a header component a header style component who can tell me in the youtube in a zoom chat how do i create a style component guys who can tell me you know it should be called header you guys give me the actual piece of code i'm curious what do you guys think not an h1 ruben no not an h yes lm that's right so we call a header so i'm gonna say header here yeah header beautiful and i'm just gonna and you can see really it completes it for me okay beautiful it's not defined because you define it i'm not gonna define at the bottom say const header is equal to t w dot div okay yeah beautiful save it done right it's of course you still can't see anything that's okay completely at this point we're going to have a few things the first i'm going to say is an image right there'll be an image here and after that point we will also have a we will also have a what a um profile right so two things you need to add image and profile guys let's first i'm gonna do is to add an actual image i'm going to i have an image here called the uber logo and i'm just going to copy and paste it for you guys so you guys can go ahead and use it right i'm going to say create something called uber uber logo okay and the source it's going to be an image because source is going to be um well i have the source right here so maybe you guys can go and copy and paste it right here the source but david can you explain to everybody how you have google drive where all the images are stored david are you still here is he here or no i don't know of course i am okay hey david you have a google drive that has all the images correct yes so for youtube people it's right down below the description and for everybody else uh inside zoom you guys got an email with another link just click the button it downloads the zip file it has an mdx file which can be opened in vs code which you can add to all the image sources yes and can you do can you can you give them the link as well for the zoom people sure sure sure i'll grab it one second and put it in in the chat that means that while he's doing that guys i'll give you guys a link to the actual uber logo don't worry i got you guys i dropped it and uh zoom yeah yeah yeah i already dropped it okay okay then what we'll do is if you scroll the way down to uber logo let's say equal to tw and who could guess what are we gonna do guys five points for those of you who can guess it is it t w dot one is it tw dot dave or is something else what do you guys think what is it yeah it's t double dot image damn good job guys nice nice people are awake yeah let's go hey we've got the uber logo can we show that showcase that okay let's go take a look yes oh nice here we go it's a pretty big logo yeah massive i'm going to remove this pg red desk 300 because we don't need this yeah do it okay so that's fully white okay great we've got the uber logo the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to define super look i'm going to give it a height okay for the height i will say h 28 right that's going to give it a height so h stands for height so it's going to make it a little bit smaller and honestly that's that's pretty much it then what i'm going to do is on the profile i will create a few things right i'm going to create a profile container okay profile container and then inside that let's go ahead and do that i'll say profile boom oops and inside that there's two things guys we have the name the name uh for now it's gonna be rafae kazi for example okay and then we've got wakazi at that point we have what the user image right yep user image beautiful now again i'm gonna call like this you might see a difference right guys you see how we have start this up like this and then we end we have an end tag this is a start tag this is an end text those are you who are wondering okay yeah and then but inside here inside an image we don't actually have an end tag but the reason why is pay attention it's called a selfclosing tag selfclosing tag oh why is because here you see this slash at the bottom on the right yeah that's the selfclosing portion okay because of this okay so that's why i wanna just want to showcase to you guys okay for the user image it's also gonna be it's a different source so um i have a different source i have a specific user image let's see if i can grab a user image that i like let me see here i got that right there copy image address right here you can grab any image guys i'm gonna i'm gonna give myself my own image sorry guys you're gonna be me all right let's go okay now i'm going to create those specific divs guys for the profile guys who can tell me what do we create guys kant's profile what before write it out what is it tw dot what dot div okay then we've got of course we've got the name so it's going to create the name one const name is equal to tw dot div as well okay and then finally the last thing is going to be user image now for the user image what is it tw dot what who can guess fireplace can get the user image const user image is equal to what tw dot image yes sam that's right oh not you image all right let's go and save that let's look at our application here in a second here beautiful so we got two things guys we got the uber we've got the rafikaze and we got the image guys okay now we know that we need to have all of our profile stuff on the right hand side right you guys know that at this point now how do we make that work who can actually tell me if you guys can guess to make it work from left to right we use something called something called what not float relax that is right yeah that's right so i will say that on the profile section i will say here this i will say flex watch this a so don't worry that's just that puts the name left inside of this but to make the whole thing flex i go to the header and i say flex yeah right oh do you guys see it by the way yeah do you guys see as i type in flex yeah good you guys do okay we have flex on the header as well okay cool so you guys can see that rafikaze is right there the next thing i want to do is for our header okay i will say flex space and now i'm going to say um it's called justify between now yeah what this does what does it do kazi it will justify between give spaces exactly it it will give as much space as possible between all the things right all the things inside here yeah then after that for the header i'm gonna make align everything uh in a kind of like uh you know to the center so i will say here item center and it's kind of like centered i mean but not yet but you will see it centered in a little bit okay after that i will go ahead and close this out i will go back to my user image and i'm going to modify this image because it's a little bit too big for now okay yeah for the user image i'm going to say that's going to be a height of 12 and a width of twelves okay so that's a h of twelve beautiful it's gonna become a lot smaller great now how do we add those round corners kazi who can tell border radius baby let's go border radius you gotta add that in every time you need those rounded corners that's right and tail and c says it's called rounded full okay let me open that round thank you look how beautiful that is right yeah run it full okay so we're kind of there now next thing i want to do is center the rafikaze portion yeah so i'm going to say in the profile i will say flex items dash center you guys can see me typing right there yep beautiful and i'm going to give a margin right uh 4 on the name so for this name right here i'm going to say mr4 okay and a specific name i'm going to give it a width of 20. okay so far looking pretty good i like the way this is going by the way this is looking good now for the user image back to here guys and now our user image kind of has like a small kind of border that you might not see so far but has a small border okay to give it a border what we need to do is say border here right and i'll say border gray dash i'm going to say it's going to be 200. you might not see it yet why because it's covered by the image okay so to make sure it's everywhere we give it a padding right i'm going to say p dash px save it nice you guys see that blue border kind of like if i do you can see a little border has everywhere if i do p dash two for example three yeah yeah you see that right there that's the border right but if i do ps2px it's only gonna give it a small border nice right there beautiful so so far it's looking not too bad i'm like where this is going the only one they want to modify is for the name i'm going to give it a text of small just to get a small text okay it's just a little smaller text and that's pretty much it guys so we've got our uber we got our thing all is good there how do you think let me ask you this question how do we you see how on the right hand side how our profile is so close to the right edge yeah how do you think we can give a spacing for the right edge you guys can tell me what do we do they're saying padding some are saying margin that's right that's right now if i want to give space on the inside of a box which one we use this one you should definitely get if when i have that what do i do then who can tell me that's right it's gonna be padding guys now i'm going to give padding on the whole actual item this whole thing i'm going to give padding on because this whole thing kind of you know reflects the whole application so for the action items right actual items i will say here p dash four and that will make this a lot smaller like this can you maybe zoom out a little bit kaze because i feel like you zoomed in for your application so it's like it loose looks very okay yeah thank you there we go do you want me to take them out more like this much this is good yeah i like that okay cool i like that all right guys the top header thing is now done okay capiche done now the next thing we're going to work on is what what is the next thing we need to create guys who can tell me what's the next thing do you create it's going to be what section is a cousin huh yeah that's right action buttons hey beautiful by the way guys it looks like your camera is a little bit um out of focus yeah okay there we go that looks good so i'm gonna create the action buttons here action buttons beautiful okay that's gonna be on my container const action buttons is equal to tw dot what div okay beautiful save that we got that section of course you guys can see yeah because it's pretty much nothing so far right inside the action buttons we'll have a few things well we have three buttons guys i'm gonna call action button okay action button that's what i'm gonna call it so let's go ahead and do that right now so i'm gonna say here action buttons guys is gonna be the box that contains all of them right and then the action button is going to be the one button and then he's going to have like three buttons in here like this wants to be for ride another one's going to be for something else it's going to be for the wheel section yeah so these are the buttons he's making right now ride two wheels reserve that's right and then we have the resort action exactly i'm going to call it okay beautiful okay kazi can you go ahead and maybe create a tw div for the action button while get some water please cool go for it all right so here we go uh we're gonna create a basic one so we're gonna do const action button just like this i'm going to do tw button and we can do div here okay cool so we have these three showing up here right now if i want to put them in a row how would i do that guys because right now they are going by columns that's right what do you guys think you can do right yes so a lot of people are saying display flex that's absolutely right so we're gonna have to display flex and then it'll actually show up as a row because that's what we want right we don't want it to be up and down we want it to be in a row just like this and what do you guys think with display flex on on which on which div you guys tell me which one action yes good job good job the plural one nice good job guys that's that was sick so on the action buttons guys i'm gonna say here flex right there right you see now it's from left to right got it so from left to right now okay now a few things i want to add in here because we not only have a button we also have an image inside there okay yeah so the action button i'm going to give it a specific color here so that's the first thing i'm going to do because i just want to want you guys to see so i'm going to say give it a bg that's gray dash 200 okay we can see those colors now right it's pretty simple here and then for the action buttons in order to have it kind of stretch along the whole screen i want the whole thing what i'm going to do is i'm gonna do a kind of like uh a uh i'm gonna give every single one a flax of one right so check this out guys right nice there we go yep right so we have now three buttons they're all the same weight right the same importance and that made them the same equal beautiful i'm going to now add an image inside there right i'm going to create an image called action button image let's go scroll to the top and inside there okay i'm going to create action action button image what is this called guys what kind of a container what kind of a close what kind of closing tag is this called guys who can tell me what is this called so tell me what is it called it's called a salt yeah damn you guys are good nice there we go soft closing tag right i'm going to go to source and the source guys is also guys we have the source and the google drive folder here's the image boom that's our source i'll copy and paste it for you guys maybe kazi can you copy and paste it for us yeah dropping it right now there we go okay beautiful nice so we've got that portion all right of course now i need to create the what the tw dot image so i'm gonna say here const action button image is equal to tw dot image beautiful oh we've got ourselves an image okay so looking pretty good i'm lucky this is going but it's a bit too big which doesn't i don't like so i'm gonna give it a height inside here h dash three fifth right there see so h dash three fifth is our height okay now another thing i want to do is for the action button individual button i'm going to give a specific margin because i want to create some spacing between every single one of them so i will do i will go ahead and do uh m one right here and this one yes we'll see now spacing you see guys yeah there you go that's beautiful and i'm going to give it a height dash 32 nice yeah exactly then i'm going to go ahead and because i need to for every single one of them right or every single one of them i need to center it so who can tell me how do i stand out that way for any questions or anything like that we're going to be taking all of them from you guys at the end okay a lot of the questions we'll take some questions we might be able to take now but most of your questions like if you want to be able to ask them like leave it to the end and we'll cover it yeah exactly so guys how do i go ahead and center the contents inside this dip who can tell me who can tell me yeah justify con that's correct so i will go ahead inside the action button i will say items center good to put in the center right but of course i need to give it a flex first that's as a display flex nice beautiful now you see how it's from left to right because by default flex direction is row by default so to make a column we say what flex dash column see now it's top to bottom yeah then i say justify center beautiful put in the center i like it now everything's centered guys okay that's exactly what we wanted to do also now i'm gonna i'm going to give this specific button a little bit like a rounded right so i'm gonna give it a specific rounded uh corners because i'm not very sharp i'm gonna say rounded lg beautiful hey i like it i like it i like it okay and i will go back up to the action button i'm going to add the same button to every single or the same image every single button let's do that right now guys okay let's do it right now boom nice okay we got the wheels don't worry i'll change the links a second here beautiful okay sweet nice yeah i'm going to copy the image for the actual wheels right here yep basically pasted that image right there you can see it says bike.png at the end and then the code here changed okay yes then i'm going to go to kind of copy and paste um the the next image the reserve one month in here boom let's see hey that looks good yep i'm gonna put it for you guys in the chat as well okay cool cool so we've got the ride we've got the wheels we've got the reserve it looks so good now here's a really cool thing wouldn't it be nice that if you hover over these buttons they kind of respond somehow how cool would that be guys okay so to make that work just like that so let me show you what he's talking about like these ones right here so that little hud gets big like that boom yes so to make it work i will go and open up action button and aside there guys we're going to add a small thing first thing i'm going to say that i can transform this so i want a transformation layer right the fact that we can can you see it as i'm typing by the way um hold on let me yeah i don't know why it's not following you can you move around even i'm following you right now yeah yeah okay there you go yes because it's like all the way in the bottom here okay cool oh i see i see okay so you added just rounded lg transfer uh you just added transform i think though right that's right that's all i added yeah okay yeah cool next i'm gonna do i'm gonna do on the hover guys check this out on the hover colon scale dash 105 let's try it now hover or something hover over something ah nice so there's a little bit of movement going on but we still don't have like that smooth animation just yet yeah to add that all you have to do at this point is just to say transition boom add that and now hey all right see it now yep i see it wow taylor makes that easy look at that i know yeah that's nice next thing add the text texture excel okay uh right there text excel okay so he just made the size of that text much bigger and that's it guy that's it that is it guys okay nice okay next one we need to go ahead after the action buttons you need to add the input button guys okay so i'm gonna call it right here input button yep giri giri krishna says the team is really helping a lot of people learn coding appreciate the effort thanks a lot thank you so much brother appreciate those kind words thank you so i'm gonna create an import button inside there and see where to where to good guys you can tell me now how do i create this in terms of the actual style components who can tell me what i do const input button say goes what tw that do good save that okay now don't see anything right now yet so i'm going to go ahead and give it a specific height so each dash 20 okay bg that's great okay dash 200 nice okay next i'm going to do is i will go ahead and do a text like larger text text to excel okay now how do we add some padding guys who can tell me what is the code if i want to add some padding to this who can tell me what what do i do okay tell me huh yeah that's right it's called p p four yes okay that will put it like this next thing what i wanna do guys is i will go ahead and change the actual center so i'm gonna say flex flex actually item center but we're not done yet not done yet because i need to add a specific margin guys okay you guys can see the virtue is very close to the actual you know everything else i don't like that so how can i add a margin top right how can i add a margin top to this action button so who can tell me what can i do i'm going to margin of this input button yeah that's right empty dash eight hey there we go so now guys we've got all these at this point this is pretty much done in terms of our homepage we've got the ride the wheels the reserve everything guys we've got both of those things got the you know the logo we've got the profile we've got the where to section right i think it looks pretty good guys now what do you think bro looking pretty good yeah we got a lot done today actually not done yet not done yet yeah people are saying peter says amazing we have fire emojis coming in beautiful beautiful peter mercedes hey i like that last name like it's like an actual car brand name [Laughter] beautiful so we've got that portion that's all good now the next thing working on is what can you showcase guys what we're working on next cool so the next thing we're working on guys is going to be when we click ride it takes us to this page over here so that's the next thing that we're actually going to be working on yeah so in nextgs to create our a different page you literally just create a new file inside your pages yeah they make it really simple with uh next because in react you have to do routing and a bunch of stuff in next all you're going to see him do is he's going to create a new page here underneath i'm going to call it search yes yeah and that's automatically going to like as soon as you click ride it'll automatically take you to that page so here's search okay and to be able to go to the search page that he made so uh yeah just add in something right so i'm gonna call the search i'm not making capital the reason why i'm making the class names capital because that's a good uh convention to go by cool and even if he says like something like hello here i can actually do at the end of this local host i can go slash search right and uh it actually brings me to that page right here so uh that's a really nice part about next yeah i like that a lot too i like that a lot too so if we know oh dang what happened here i don't know yeah okay now here's the cool thing though how do we link our ride to text page how do we do that okay well in next year we have something called the link so i will go ahead and show this to you guys if we go up we have import link from next link that's right so in usual html you have like each a you know a shrek you know stuff like that but because we're using a different technology we're using links and where do you guys think we're going to put links around who can tell me where you're putting links around who can tell me what is it what is the thing we're putting the links around what is it no no not the ride well yeah i think i'll keep the ride but what is the button yeah that's right the button yes it is technically the right but yes so inside here i will say link shref is equal to dash search that's right that's all you have to do guys okay and then at end that link yep and this link is coming from uh hold on one second just before you start typing this link is yeah so again i know knowledge just showed you this but just remember this okay you're getting importing this link cool exactly so we're importing this link and this link says hey to which page are we going to we're going to the search page so if i go and save this save that so if you click on the kazi on the right section boom takes me to the home page right up there beautiful okay now in the search page a few things need to happen to make this work so let's just i think just get started on that one right away okay yeah let's go inside yes oh too source ideas sorry inside search engine yes i will kind of modify this i will import all my basic stuff import tail and css copy from there paste it say done done at this point instead of dip i'm gonna call the wrapper that's the usual thing beautiful there we go okay i'm gonna put um kind of practice around this because usually we have parentheses but because of is linting it kind of makes it cleaner so that's okay i kind of like it like this though rapper there we go beautiful yeah what did we do now guys what do you think we do how do we create a tail when the css wrapper what do we do here i say what const wrapper tw dot div that's right t dot with that div okay okay now inside that okay what are the components that we have so if we go back to our our top section kazi okay let's go back to the application that's actually been created okay so go to the home page or what do you want me where do you want me to go the no no not the but the actual application has been created already the one that has been created okay yeah click on ride uhhuh okay and so let's look at the components that we have here okay our first component what do you guys think is the first component guys what is the first component we got what do we got not the input no that's right the back button right so let's go and put a square around the back button this one right here that's right that's our first thing the next thing is going to be the hole in the contains the input stuff so everything that's from the the image to the input stuff that's one big container so it's going to create that nice yep beautiful next one is the safe places yep and then confirm locations that guys is it that's it that's all we have to create okay so let's go ahead and create that right now first this thing is gonna be the button container yeah i'm gonna say button container it's going to create some structure from me container boom all right within that and we're going to have what the actual i'm going to call the input container yeah input container and i'm just doing this guys for convention i'm just putting it so i can see myself wanting to create next yeah and these are just comments just so you know okay then we have saved places and then we have confirm location not location my location but yeah beautiful okay now let's start with the button container okay let's create our butter container okay dinner good beautiful okay inside that guys we're gonna create the actual image so let's create a back button back button okay all right and the source of this back button is we've got it for you right here so i've got the best source of the back button you put free guys in the png everywhere okay i'll put the source for you in the zoom boom good okay here's the source got the source here it's gonna save that all right so that's our back button yeah see so i can see it myself okay now not defined of course we need to current define it so let's go ahead and do const button container beautiful equals to tw div you know the spiel at this point guys yeah the huge the huge [Laughter] then we got the const back button yeah yeah this is a pattern like once you guys keep seeing it again and again it's gonna be the similar thing right tw dot img t tw dot div and then back tick back tick and you kind of like get in a flow of it when you keep doing style components exactly now we've got the container we've got the button can we showcase what we got quasi yeah here we go hey we've got the button yeah got the button so next thing i'm gonna go the wrapper here inside here i'm going to give it a background color of gray because the whole thing is great so bg dash great that you can tell me what is the number who can guess what is the number needs to be jquery which one are we using the 400 the 500 or the 600 which one are we using bj gray what no it's neither one of them it's actually 200 guys yeah fabio that's right muscle memory that's right bg gray dish 200 you guys can see that it's you know how it is to make everything guys full height what do we use to make the whole thing the scree the height screen what do we do h what dash screen nice good beautiful honestly that's pretty much it honestly so we gotta do with that one then the see if i want to add a maybe like a specific like padding but i think i'm good for now yeah most importantly we got the other container with the panda container background color white how do we do that guys pg god my voice is killing me it's like i'm trying to speak it's like literally just like stabbing me in the back in the throat i'm like slowly dying inside just to be honest with you guys um so anyways we got bj dash white yeah all right so guys give that guys a thumbs up because we're done and out here for you yeah guys give it up for us for all that freaking effort oh my god i'm drinking water it's just not helping you know yeah it's that streamer life seriously i keep says you guys are amazing thank you brother appreciate it it's like no matter like you try to talk and just like no you can't yeah so we've got my section that's all cool i'm going to give this button container a uh actual a specific height so i'm going to say h 10 guys okay we've got the height uh i kind of like worm well yeah that's fine actually actually let's not give the height i don't like it that way that that kind of limited a few space for it which is not cool uh but what i do like about is i do want to give a padding so p p x dash four now if you don't know what does p x stand for what do you think it stands for guys px stands for what no not pixels yes mitchell it stands for the padding on the xaxis that's right right here pxport okay you guys can see that i kind of added the the thing right here got it and uh you know under the section of the padding beautiful okay we got that the the bun container i'm gonna give with the button the actual back button we'll go ahead and give it a h12 okay beautiful okay nice yeah that's all good next one we've got the input container that's the hardest one yup input container all right my throat should survive for the next hopefully half hour got the input container wow now what do we have guys remember we divide this the input container can be divided into three sections okay let's go back to our application kazi yep the deployed one here we go yep so we've got the last section that has those images you see those images that like has the circle with the square yep yep yep this one that's the first that's the first thing next thing is what which one guys who can tell me can you guess which one is it it is gonna be the no not the location the no not the plus no no no no no no no well it's the actual input boxes themselves that's the next yeah div both of them so two of them are gonna be in one two of them gonna be in one uh whole thing yeah so if you maybe put or put a square around it or whatever and then the third one is gonna be which one the plus section right that's gonna be the third container beautiful okay that's the three container so let's go ahead and create that in the input container i will call this something called a from two icons that's right so from two i can't good maybe if i speak like this i'll be okay okay go okay okay from two icons that's kind of created as a const const is equal to what from two no no that's right that's wrong both two icons guys okay good t w dot div good okay you got that you got inputting undefined that's perfect don't worry about it we got you okay let's do what const input container yeah good papa is equal to t double dot div as well save it and we're good and dandy guys okay at least then gets nearer beautiful inside this we've got three things okay we've got the circle portion okay i'm going to click it right now circle circle circle okay good and that's going to be what an image so give it a specific image source is equal to an image guys good i'm going to copy pasta for you go go pasta good save it of course it's going to give us an error i'll give you i got you guys pasta dylan says that's right circle i yeah let's define that yeah so circle i had to paste it in for everybody in the zoom so const circle is equal to what tw image and let me see do we got it okay is that a circle is that a line it's like a weird circle yeah it's a weird line oh because i picked i copy pasta the wrong thing um i got you don't worry i pasted in the line here here's the circle boom command v yep that's the circle circle there you go someone said get blood there's like black gross pasta i know it was not a circle you did not love to live up to your expectations not the right pasta now how about now is this is this the right pasta guys technically the lime was the right pasta because that actually is closer to positive than the circle is so you know okay because pasta you know it's a no never mind we got line okay same thing okay we got the source all right beautiful line source and now i've got the right line so now i'm going to get that hopefully i'll get the right pause at this time okay i'll place it for you guys in the zoom chats i'll define at the bottom const line is equal to what tw dot image as well save it okay we got the big line and finally the last thing is going to be what the square get the square i'll call the square square okay source is equal to a square same thing copy pasta this one as well i got you guys let's go ahead and end this up it's just go what does this call it again guys who knows what kind of attack is this who knows what kind of tag is this one that's selfclosing baby yeah let's go okay save it we've got the square screen i defined don't worry i got you cons square so let's kind of create this inside what nice w dot image save it beautiful so this is creating circles which are pretty big of course don't worry we'll make it smaller i got you guys okay now the first resource i want to work on is the from two icons okay uh they're kind of like you know you can just give it a specific width that's the most important thing so for the front two icons let's go down here and change the way it works so i'll give it a width 10 that should make it right away smaller okay now i'm going to give it a specific uh kind of like um flex yeah flex beautiful nice but of course not this one i'm going to give flex column nice okay next i'm gonna do is i will go and do how do we center these guys who knows because if you guys can say i mean they're pretty much centered now at this point but you know not the way you wanted to however i do want to change the input container right the ipo container right now is the whole thing so we want to change the input container to be what color bg white okay let's change it let's see hey beautiful so that looks pretty good i kind of like where that's coming from okay now next thing i'm gonna do is i will go ahead and add the actual input uh buttons themselves don't worry we'll go back to the actual circles and squares to make that a little bit smaller i got you right inside the input container guys we'll create input boxes for people to actually use okay beautiful got the input boxes i like it okay nice okay input boxes that's good now of course inside here the input boxes will have the input that's actually going to be the input that we'll use for the you know for the whole uh when you when you guys type it in so input good and for the input guys i mean nothing so far but there's two inputs here we got one another one but so far it's kind of nothing okay i'll go to input boxes let's go ahead and create a simple boxes const input boxes beautiful is equal to tw dot dip shouldn't still work don't worry but i will go ahead and const input i think to that without what guys who can you can get me okay who can guess what is it cw dot what is it yeah damn that one you guys got it so gw dot input let's see okay they don't show up it's okay okay because you need to give them a specific height guys don't worry okay so now we don't really see them all we need to do is now modify the input to make sure it actually kind of works and it's kind of there right so let's go ahead and give it a number one in height so i'm going to h10 beautiful okay i will go ahead and give it a bgray dash 200 huge shout out by the way to everybody that's still here like y'all are champs this i know this is hard and i know this is confusing anthony's yeah anthony's going off but like seriously give yourselves a huge like pat on the back this seriously is awesome like because yes because it's tricky to be able to pay attention for this long but guys like this is what coding and development is yes yes it is it is so guys you guys can see we got the two buttons right here we got can you maybe you see how those two buttons you don't really see them but i will add a placeholder so if we go ahead and do a placeholder here holder is and you will see it none then placeholder and i want to say for placeholder uh your location so let's go ahead and set enter pickup location enter pickup location okay you guys can see it right there right right array and the next is going to be place folder is equal to uh where to boom okay so two buttons now now of course what you can see is they're kind of like on top of each other right so the input boxes one is underneath the from two icons right so this whole info box is underneath the from two icons how do we make sure they go from left to right who can tell me guys quick question huh what can we do what can we do what do you guys think yeah that's right we need to go and flex it okay so let's go ahead and go to the bottom go to input container and we say flex okay nice beautiful now it's from left to right okay and then at that point what i'm going to do is for the entrepreneurship and the where to input boxes how to make it go from top to bottom what do you do now do you guys think that's right we flex columns we say flex here and we say flex dash column there we go right there we go that's exactly what we want to do for the input flexes for the input boxes we wanted to take up as much space as possible so i'm going to give it a flex of one save it there you go so now it's taking up as much space as possible also the same time i'm going to give it a margin y so for every every single input right you see how they're stuck together let's go ahead and separate them so i'm going to say um mytwo that gives what is it what do you guys think this y stands for what does y stand for you can tell me that's right overage it is the yaxis so basically padding on the yaxis top and bottom like vertical padding that's right vertical padding right m x is like the xaxis that's the horizontal padding okay that's our input beautiful the input as well i'm going to give it a round it because remember it's kind of like edgy right now which i don't like so i'm going to say here a rounded two get a specific grounding so it's kind of starting is it there it's kind of there maybe not there rounded dash two and then what i'll do at that point is let's see is is p dash to give the padding okay beautiful so that you can see that the pickup location kind of separates from everything and the one thing i want to do you see how whenever can you click into the pickup location quasi sure uh click into right here there we go you guys can see that you have this blue box that we don't like it's like a weird box that i'm not a big fan of you know yeah let's get rid of that yeah let's get rid of that yeah to get rid of that what i say is like it's it's called an outline those of you who don't know it's called an outlier so the first thing i'm going to say is outline here outline dash boom save it okay now click into into it again nice gone all right yeah that's right it is exactly exactly gone right beautiful so that seems to be all good so we've got those two things it looks pretty good the next thing to work on is gonna be the plus button okay the plus button which we need as well so let's go ahead and go back to our you know think the bob okay and underneath the input container actually no inside we're still technically inside the input container we need to create a plus button container that's right so i'm just going to go ahead and create the plus button here so i'm going to say plus icon boom right here plus icon self closing source is equal to what specific source which i got right here beautiful right there i'll copy past it for you guys everybody and then zoom that's right kevin taylon is awesome i agree with that okay save it let's go back to the bottom what is it lost what plus icon is equal to t w that what guys tell me see that by that image that's right let's see how it looks like now oh my god that's pretty bad that's pretty bad don't worry i got you we'll fix it okay we got you so the first thing i'm going to do is for the image let's give the width and the height so width 10 and h10 okay okay so now it's a little better hopefully okay i'm going to go ahead and give it a round of applause now to make it into like a full circle the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to do a bg great so bg dash gray dash 200 that's going you see right there that's the thing right so that's all good okay but how do i go ahead and make it so that it's a fullon rounded circle what do i do here kazi give it yeah border radius 50 50 but with tail it says we're using the called rounded full boom see right there just like that it is the way we want it okay um now you see how it's very close to the pickup location all the input stuff i will say margin left dash let's just say it's like margin left three maybe or is it margin margin is it not doing that no no that's that's that's the input sorry not on this one i don't want the plus icon ml string there we go beautiful and the one other thing i want to do is i want to make sure everything is centered vertically so who can tell me how do i center everything vertically make sure that everything even the plus icon is all centered vertically what do i do who can tell me it's literally like two lines of code guys what i do not a reverse not reverse item center that's right but on which component on this one on this one or on this one which component or maybe even a different component it's actually going to be on the input container guys so on the input container i will do flex that's so good but i will do items dash center boom you see the plus icon right away is right there on the bottom okay next i'm going to do is i will going to create some spacing for everything so for the input container guys let's go ahead and go back to input container scroll down boom boom boom let's create some spacing guys okay so i'm gonna say one p x dash four you're gonna space it from left to right okay so it's a little bit cleaner now and also for the actual uh with the from two icon right i'm also creating some spacing as well because i just kind of don't like the way it is so i will have here with the from two icon that's for the bottom whereas there is a wizard with the wizard wizard from two icons okay i will say margin the right is what maybe like two okay i'm liking this okay i'm liking this already beautiful i'm also going to say for the input container i will say margin bottom because i want to have space in the bottom section say margin bottom dish too as well like christmas place on the bottom too did it let's see come on did it no maybe the bottom maybe it's on the actual let me see here yeah input container all right here mb2 no okay nevermind okay so oh but yes it did it created margin but because remember guys margin is the spacing on the outside guys remember right margin is spacing on the outside okay okay now let's look at these circles they're a bit too big i don't like it so every circle gonna define give the height for the circle i'm gonna say this is a height of h2 2.5 so h right here h of 2.5 oops 2.5 save okay don't worry about it we'll figure it out okay and then finally for the line a h of 10 okay h10 don't worry okay and then for the square as well it's gonna be h of three guys okay the square is gonna be h of three each test three save it okay don't worry we got you okay so now you see how it's all stretched out you see on the right hand side it's all stretched out doesn't look good at all so make it work okay there's a really cool trick that i like to use because what is trying to do is you're trying to take up as much space you know in terms of like um horizontally and that's all because of flex guys okay flex that makes it do that so if i go to the input container here all right i'm sorry the actual from two icons okay you guys see where i'm typing right yeah the from two icons okay i will say here items the center boom you see that magically just fix it all magic is fixed up because item center is put in the center and so it prevents the divs from trying to stretch as much as possible that's the cool part about it okay so we got the word too we've got all this stuff looking pretty good i'm lucky this is going beautiful okay good good good okay the last thing we're going to do is i'm going to create the safe places so we've got the input container guys that's all good the last thing is going to be well the saved places that's pretty easy one honestly uh all we'll do is create a div here they have here called saved places so i'm gonna say here saved places here outside the input container so i'm say here saved places beautiful okay and inside here there's a few things we've got we've got the icon so let's click the star icon start icon and has a source is equal to something okay and there you go i'll give you guys the image right now in a second here so i'm going to copy and paste the image for you so i've got the image right here boom i'll place it for you guys in the zoom boom okay beautiful and then at that i'm gonna say i'm gonna say saved places for text beautiful then it's underneath here guys we're gonna create the actual style component of it okay let's go and do this const saved places is equal to tw dot what tw dot dot what tw dot div that's right okay good good good good good and then after that i'm going to say here const star icon which one do we use guys who could tell me who could somebody get at this point you guys should know at this point two what that image that's right fabio beautiful you've got both those things okay so there we go we've got that little icon okay i want to make this icon right here uh to have a square so i'm going to give for the star icon i'm giving it like a background color so let's do bg gray bg dash gray dash 400 oops now now grade s400 okay okay that's the bg gray right now okay great i like it i'm going to give it a width and a height because it's a bit too big guys so width that's 10 and then height dash 10. okay a little bit smaller now all good next i'm going to give it is a padding of 2 p 2 is going to be it's going to create some space and inside that's there we go exactly what i want and then finally i'm going to make it round how to make it rounded who knows at this point we've done it multiple times you guys should know at this point it's gonna be what what is the css thing and not too rounded full that's right rounded dash full save it hey you've got the rounded circle beautiful i like it i like it how do i do the safe places how do i make the safe places go from the bottom to the right section what i do guys what do i do you tell me not running full black that's right flex so we'll say on the on the saved places i'm gonna say flareflex good flex it okay now how do i center everything i say what items dash center we're almost done honestly center beautiful also i'm gonna do the following i'm gonna say background colors white so bg dash white to make sure this white is white as well okay i like it i'm going to give it a small padding guys for the whole uh safe places i'll do p x 4 4 to make sure it aligns with everything else and p y dash 2. and you guys can see that whenever i create padding it makes everything bigger right so it's like if i create space inside the box my box expands right so you guys will see that my let's let's make this bikes wide let's read for example red 500 okay if i made it ready for 100 you guys can see right it's a very thin box but if i do a padding vertical what do you think will happen to the box what will happen to the box guys what will happen to the box who can tell me that's right the the rebel expand so p y dash i will call it uh two there we go that's what you guys need to understand is that padding expands things okay back to white okay then i'm to give it uh the icon i'm going to do a small margin for the icon so that mr dash 2 or the dash one interesting dash 2 is fine there we go we've got the same places that looks looking pretty good okay and guys i think that's uh well i think that's pretty much it my friend i think you've got them you've got that because the rest i just want to give you guys for homework okay yeah the race i wanted to get for homework guys i have a few things i want you guys i want you guys to do for homework make sure you guys you know have something to do for the next time okay i think should be i think that one should be fun um but yeah i'm lucky this is how you guys what do you guys think this is pretty good i'm lucky this is going i'm liking where this is going guys so what do we have quasi we're done quasi yeah that's it so we're done with our section today guys now i have homework let's go back to our application that's been done already cool let's go okay okay so we can see that the confirmed locations that one has not been created yet guys so i want you guys to create a button called confirm locations so you follow the same form as we did create that dip create the component do two dot div right just how we did it create that component and just make it into like you know make it background color black with literally just stacks in the center yeah and make sure the text is centered that's pretty much it okay yep that's your homework your homework and then to find the last thing is gonna be to for the back button to link the back button guys okay yeah so link linking it means like when you click that back button it takes you to the previous page that's right so guys what do we have done let's showcase what we have done so far awesome guys so check it out look at how much we have gotten done today right so we have this page over here done and we got this page right over here done isn't that freaking awesome guys that's amazing man right like this is something that usually takes developers weeks right or such a long time to build we're over here building it for you all in under like two or three hours so if you guys thought naz did a great job guys give it up for freaking nas that was awesome i want to see it from every single person hey let's always says everybody thank you guys chad is blowing up great job nas this was awesome however it's like nas needs some honey and some tea yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah take care of your voice bro take care of your voice i know what happened i think it just it got colder here i think it got colder a little bit here you know where we live and so it's like i don't know guys we don't want to take too long on this one for you guys okay we want to let you go to sleep earlier and what we want you to be able to do is get to the work earlier so you can do your homework and finish it off so we're not going to take too many questions today what we want to do is we want to make sure that you guys can do your homework okay um finish that up it's going to be just that button that's going to be there and then more can you put that into the actual um let's put that into the actual presentation okay um i can see it what do you think do we have the presentation or no i don't i think we just put it right here so guys home homework right is uh finish the button okay make the button the confirm button yes confirm button that's part one and then uh and then the other homework is gonna be to link the um the back button back to the home page yep link back button to home page to the home page all right guys that's it thanks those are the two things you gotta do okay that's your homework one and two all right get these done and most importantly guys what time are we going live tomorrow can you let us know what time are we going live tomorrow that's right that's right beautiful okay who's gonna be there i want to hear from you who's coming to it and he's like yo i'm coming to it me me me me i will be there awesome that's great yeah okay guys so we're gonna we're we're gonna go right but make sure that you guys show up tomorrow 5 p.m sharp pacific time okay we're gonna be ready to rock and roll you know day day three of the challenge and it's gonna be the second day of the uber build we're going to be getting ready to rock and roll this is your homework okay with that said um hold on recording guys uh if you want to rewatch recording we'll be on youtube guys this whole thing has been on youtube so if you are on zoom go to youtube it takes maybe like five ten minutes for you to process all of this because it's a live video and then you should see it on there but let's just get like five ten minutes maximum guys and you should be all good okay yep absolutely i'm gonna add you here okay cool so everybody who's been watching this on youtube guys smash that like button okay subscribe to the channel so this video goes out to more people and so you can see more things about these types of builds okay uh this was building uber day one all right who's going to be here uh i just show of hands who's going to be up later tonight finishing part one yes me yeah nice peter says me jose nice we have an amazing community by the way guys if you want to join the community that will be working on this we literally had people together working and sharing their screen working in their portfolio it was pretty awesome inside discord i loved it it was so amazing guys so i highly comment guys go to cleverpromo.com discord and you'll see it there okay absolutely make you know the most important that you guys can do in coding is make networks and make connections that's probably like that's that's honestly like how you grow as a developer people and so forth yeah guys i so i know like some of you felt overwhelmed actually why don't you just say it uh raise your hands if you felt either overwhelmed today or just drop it in the chat i'd love to see it okay i know that this is i know a lot of a lot of me so what i want to say is what we've been saying from the start right these these coding days are going to feel a little overwhelming and just keep in mind this is pretty advanced stuff that we're doing okay so we're gonna be trying to simplify it for you guys um but when we're showing you this big build and if we're building uber it's gonna be a little bit complex but our goal with this challenge is to show you how coding works so let me ask you this at least was it enjoyable for you to watch has this been an enjoyable experience yes beautiful thank you guys okay very much so please thank you guys appreciate it but more i was watching the more i was definitely understanding peter says absolutely i liked it but a little bit fast okay it seems doable but i'm a newbie okay thank you the coding part was good but i followed the process to all the packages yep okay so that's the idea right it's this is going to be a lot that we're going to be doing for you know from complete step by step and all of that stuff if you guys want to ever learn it of course we have videos on youtube okay and just look out for day five because we got something special for you guys where we will give you something that's going to be really really awesome for you okay so just be on the lookout for that outside of that if you want to pick up the basic basic beginner stuff our youtube is filled with that okay html css javascript all those types of tutorials are up there with that said i think the homework for you guys is clear does everybody understand the homework give me a thumbs up or something if you understand the homework okay cool nice i like it making that black button that's it all right cool um and yeah with that said watch this video again tonight for a lot of you who weren't able to code along at the same time watch this video tonight and team up with somebody in the discord channel from this community and build this part of the app okay yes if you guys were overwhelmed like i said just rewatch the video pause it pause it you know because there is something special about you taking your time to watch this right no matter what kind of a teacher you have or you know however time a teacher spends with you there's something special about literally just sitting down in your computer going through a video pause a little by little doing it with yourself you know you're going to learn you're going to learn a ton a ton more right that's right so you learn a lot today with us as you watched it okay this is like the presentation for you guys right you guys enjoyed the energy right you saw the issues the errors we had now take it implement it put into your code and tomorrow i want to see the homework done yes i want the homework done absolutely we want to see your links we'll link you to the airtable so put your links in there guys i know you're asking us for the source code but there's gonna be some people that have done it and they can share it with you okay so this is we wanna do it this way so you're like forced to talk to other people and make friendships and not just look at our code download it and use it okay so do that okay and i think you're gonna find a lot of friends and you'll be able to use their source code i'm sure they'll share it with you okay yeah i mean i can show the social we should just share it through github i can potentially share it what do you think sure we can even share it with you guys through github and then we can link it to you guys and you'll see either in your email or in the discord yeah i'll show you i'll upload my our source code to github and then we'll send you guys the link so you guys can see it okay awesome guys with that said we love your beautiful face this is qazi and this is nice and if you enjoyed it give us some comments some love and with that said we'll see you guys tomorrow for day three see you guys tomorrow at 5 p.m set your alarms set your freaking alarms set your alarms love you guys take care guys love all of you take care bye bye guys bye
