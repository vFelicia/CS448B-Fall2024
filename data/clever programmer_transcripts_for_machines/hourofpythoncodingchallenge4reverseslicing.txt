what's up my beautiful people welcome back today we are doing another coding challenge this is your host Rafa Kazi from clever programmer and we are going to jump into the reverse slicing challenge we just completed aardvark or you should have completed it and today's coding challenges reverse slicing challenge so let's see how this one works look they're telling you slicing it's like you know you can think of it like cutting things and in Python in code if you are given a list of things you can slice and pick and choose whichever one you want okay so you got apple banana bread you can just slice by one and pick up that you know the banana or slice by two and get the bread or slice by zero and get the Apple okay so it's very simple and I'll show you what I mean by that here as you can see they have some of these code that some of this code actually write up on the top and as you can see where they have you know like a list with first second third fourth fifth six they're slicing it from 0 to 3 which means from first second third fourth but it only goes from first third as you can see right here okay and then in this example where they say list start from three and go up until forever what that will get for you is will start from 0 1 2 3 the fourth guy so the fourth element on the list and go all the way up to 6 and more right and that's what's happening here now what if we were given something we are given a function called reverse string and what we have to do for this guy is if you give it arc it should bring back Gras GRA and if you give it something like hi it should return hi verse of how would you do that learn actively code right below this video if you're on the website you should be able to code it right below you don't even have to open up your own Python and come up with your own solution and as you can see on my screen the solution for this is actually you know quite simple so let me explain let's say I give you something like the string hello right now if I gave it to you from zero to two what would you get you would get H and the e that's it so what if I gave it to you so I instead of starting from H what if I wanted to start from the e well I could say start from one and I could do this to say go for forever right now what if I wanted to so remember it start stop and then step what if I change the number of steps so let's say I did this I just kept this default the middle one which is stop so basically we're saying don't stop keep going forever whoops and then for us for step I'm saying step by two which means every other one and you can see you'll get back you can see you'll get back HL and O because if you start from hello and you take out every other character you take out the H then you take out the L then you hop over you take out the Oh what if I wanted to walk backwards well the solution for that if you haven't tried it here's a spoiler we put negative one and what this does is it says walk backward okay that's the simplest way to understand it would say walk backwards negative one and so we just go here we go boom and in Python count this is like a super easy way to do it and boom look at this we said print reverse string argh we got back grow the top here and on line 15 we said hi and we got back the river of that so that is amazing you guys we were able to solve this challenge it was very easy especially if you are you know somebody a clever programmer who's been going through the courses this should be easy for you well my goal is to make this easier for everybody who's new so if you're new to this channel welcome can you this website welcome but if you've already been here and you're one of the clever programmers right this should be a review for you and this should be a way for you to test your skills and don't just go already know this you should walk away you know you're too cool for school this is below you a lot of you guys I work with and there's really simple things that you guys might get stuck on and to be honest I get stuck on simple things too which is why I take the time out every day to practice even really simple things that's when I'm coding I'm coding at the speed of light people like how are you doing it well I just made more mistakes than you did and it was the the simple reason is that I just keep practicing it relentlessly so even if it's something looks like it's below you perfect take that time to challenge yourself and crush that challenge rather than be lazy sit on your couch and just hit skip or next video okay so actively learn actively engage that's the reason for this entire channel okay I want you to communicate actively engage posted in the comments below here on youtube post in the comments below your solution if you're on my website and if you are on my website you'll be able to code right there as well as always thank you guys so much for watching I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
