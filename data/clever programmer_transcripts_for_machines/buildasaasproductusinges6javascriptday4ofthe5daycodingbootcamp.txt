jesse and today hi guys we are check this out guys we are building a sas product that's a jobs search application a job search product kind of like indeed.com but we've got our own version look at how good this one looks right you can go through you can apply right you can filter by different jobs if i go to for example front end and i just do a fine job i can filter for different jobs right here it is so good it's so useful assess product like this you know requires a lot what we're using here is we're using javascript of course i'm going to remove this we're using javascript of course we're using some nice uh you know uh animations and we're going to use a fetch request a like be able to fetch from the api so again so javascript so js you know we're going to learn fast today right we're also going to going to learn how to use animations right which is going to be a lot of fun and most people will just use how how to how to build a a useful a a userfriendly application randomly application free and the application application from from other from like from other inspirational uh from other inspirations i want to say right what i'm being what i mean by that by the way what do i mean by that jesse from other inspirations right so guys we were wanted to build something super cool for you right yeah so we found a few dashboards that really appeal to us however sometimes when you want to make your own application you don't want to either copy one thing but you want to combine certain things off those examples to get the best thing for you okay so that is what we've done um we had a few inspirations examples you want me to send you the links now or yeah i think i actually have them i think let me see if i can yeah i think yeah yeah so for example i think it's the last three some yeah so i haven't special so one inspiration came from this for example so you guys can see that this is a person here by nassim so he has a nice oh wait hold on let me show it to you guys right here so when i seen this explanation we took you guys how am i you see my shared screen yes right yeah yeah we do we do make sure yeah so for example literally for example we would literally go to like dribble so one really cool place you should check guys to check out something called dribble.com dripbb bble.com um if you want to go search for design inspirations so a lot of times i would go to that and be like oh this is so cool be cool to build something along the lines of this you know along the lines of this and so you can see just how it's not the same right but it takes certain parts from it right and i'm not necessarily stealing or anything i'm just using this as inspiration just like you know when you make a house or you build a house you're going to use other inspirations to build a house maybe you're painting something same situation here right so this is one good inspiration that we took away from another good special we took away from was actually something called uh from a mentor they have their own but by the way uh their own you guys should check out they also do designs for different projects right here and we took inspiration some from this from them as well and they're really nice they got a really nice design as well so if you guys ever want to check out uh them their really really cool uh website from 10mentor.com definitely the website is called friend from that mentor dot io make sure to check it out okay it is super cool website and you can learn so much when you browse through it okay yeah so we took expression from different from this as well you can see again we're not it's not exactly any in any way shape or form is the same but for example you know the layout of like the three column layout that was a good inspiration right for us right so things like that right so that was really really cool awesome so at this point guys that's pretty much it let's go and get started into our fiveday coding bootcamp let's see what we've got so far i'm going to go ahead and present to all of you guys so you guys can see it that's great by the way guys i do want to add things like if you do use certain design from other designers that are really like explicitly visible that they're owned by them please make sure to give them credit okay because we all work together yes okay exactly don't exactly that's it it's time to focus let's get into it it's time you guys know the drill turn off your phones throw them throw them outside the window uh we're not liable for those phones if you do break them so i'm sorry about that but you know just you know just just keep keep in mind keep it q a guys as always after the build okay we have a q a ask all of your questions here today um i'll be here still so if you have any questions for me of course ask them today okay and of course also to us recap so we got we guys guys over 800 people live on zuma plus youtube is pretty insane over 80 plus homework submissions 18k views on youtube whoa so i mean this is the same picture you guys the last time but i love seeing all your faces and i see a lot of recurring faces for today as well so i'm really happy to see all you guys coming in today as well so let's take a look at what you guys what you guys are going to build you guys know at this point so basically like this again this is where we took the inspiration from and i showed you exactly what we're going to build right so now really important guys at this point we're ready to get started really quickly the thing uh that i want to show you is actually going to be this homework submissions i want to show you guys some homework submissions from wait are these the same ones are these different ones do you know jesse um oh no this is oh look at that no these are oh no these are the tictactoe games from yesterday yeah yeah yonah made this this is really cool look at this oh this is so this is okay what happens if i win hold on oh nice job that's so sick i love that that's so sick so cool i love that and then replay oh it says winners player x i love that and then i could go into dark mode oh who made this one who made this once are you here you know you're here bring your chance raise your hand if you're here you know you're here oh no she's not here but that's okay but this is but wait yo yonah made this one yeah yona because i think she said yesterday she's making this one in react js oh really let me see if it is i can i can look it up actually inspect the elements let me see i think so uh no no it's not right yes no no oh okay but still great work great work yeah okay so let's see what else we got we got karen she's got this so it's a karen so let me see oh karen i'm i'm i'm i'm curious for yours one that looks pretty if it has clever programmer on it damn look at that start a new game let's see oh i love the dark theme guys that's so good it's so good so clean look at that also with the icons i love it oh tom tom oh she made it this way that's so cool i love it she made the background hover oh sick yeah that's awesome wow guys this is so cool oh oh my god i'm so glad we made a tictactoe game i know i guess it looks like it looks like this guy had a lot of fun with that um okay let's see copy this one let's get see what else we got okay oh the similar one oh there's somebody had well do i just copy the same one or what oh no oh somebody just had a really sim simon just had a really same same same idea i guess yeah they even had the same icon at the top dark mode but i love the dark mode light mode it's so cool i love that portion nice job and i love the little uh touch at the top tic tac toe you see that little icon at the top the yeah i like that yeah ashish let me see what you got my friend ashish okay tikki oh damn oh wait is this two people oh like two people oh dang is this noz is this jessie this is not a suggestion i'm so pretty oh the actually oh actually puts the face on there holy okay oh that's cool oh let's start jesse i'm gonna win this one hold on hey let's go let's see though that's sick that's really good that is really sick i love the creativity guys behind this really really nice nice job on that monique let's see very very good oh monique wait what the heck wait what no way oh no way this is so cool i love that oh wait i probably can't use it it's copyrighted hold on i just realized i can't use that one i can't use that software nintendo yeah sorry nintendo about that one yeah but that's sick this is really really cool uh this is really cool okay cool wow monique that's amazing awesome awesome job clap off the hands to you guys for doing this amazing guy guys so so cute so today guys we're building this exact this project right here we're going to build a dab a like a clever i call the clever jobs you guys can call whatever you want clever jobs for searching for jobs it's a really popular because you know this is think of it as like a sas product which is software as service a product which will basically you can something you usually sell a lot of times right um and the way this is really cool for us to build this because like i said you're going to learn a little different a lot of different techniques in terms of how we use javascript and how we put you know connect the javascript portion to the html portion you kind of saw part of it yesterday with the what's it called with um but today we're gonna go like even a little bit more crazy crazier so let's get started guys all right let's go ahead and get started right right away i'm gonna put my little code cheat sheet here at the bottom and yes if you're wondering do i have a cheat sheet yes i do of course yes i do have a cheat sheet just to make sure if everything if everything if everything goes wrong i can i can you know look back on this one so let's see okay so here's what we got you guys know the drill this point let's go ahead and create a new folder uh as you can see i have a new folder already created but let's go ahead and new finder you'll find your window right there so go to your projects folder you guys know the drill at that point products folder i have a fiveday bootcamp and then rightclick new folder let's call it live developer jobs live dash developer developer dash jobs okay let me know you guys got this portion so live dash developer dash jobs okay create that one and then what you want to do at this point is fi do file open so do file open on your vs code and open up the live developer jobs folder right just click on the folders for example if i go to file day bootcamp i will click on the live developer jobs folder and then you should be able to open it from that does that make sense comprende you guys still with me let me know give me a thumbs up when you guys got to that portion you guys opened up the folder right give me a thumbs up here give me a thumbs up here yeah got it got it got it got it got it beautiful that's what i'm talking about i love that port okay sweet sweet sweet good good good good good so that's all good that's all good all right all right awesome so at this point here's what our folder looks like it's pretty much empty of course right now let me ask this question what do you guys think is the first thing we need to do to make this work what do you guys think what is it what is the first thing we need to do to make this work right let me blame the chat oh very good peter says and rudy megan all say index.html yeah exactly so let's create our index.html so file new file we'll do index.html okay of course and you guys know this point to create the boilerplate to create the boilerplate of any html right right what we do is we do exclamation point and see this gives us a suggestion and i'm an abbreviation right here and all i do is simply just hit enter boom right there look at that and then right away it gives me what i want you see that pretty pretty cool right pretty cool exactly hello and this is jesse right there hi jessie so hi okay awesome so we got the innovation map what's the next thing guys we should do what's the next thing we should do right what's the next should we do let me say word wrap please it's really hard to do wardrobe on this one guys um this we don't really don't necessarily need that portion guys for the water wrap because this is just meta stuff so don't worry about this so much okay i mean like i mean i don't know do i do view or it doesn't allow me to do work you see guys i really i literally cannot do word wrap look at this see it won't allow me so i'm sorry about that um so cool then let's go create a new folder and we'll create a css folder and then that's the new also let's create a new folder after that create new folder let's call it js right so two folders right inside a css folder let's go ahead and right click and select new file and let's create a style let's see assess file right so we have a css file you guys know the drill at this point okay and then at this point let's go ahead and link up this file how do you know how do we link the css file you guys know that yes or no you guys know that yes or no how do we link up the css file yeah good so link rel correct jesse link real style sheet right there good href href is the link uh the link where it's going to be continue on and by the way nice can you share the shirt the server with me okay let me see hopefully i can i'm gonna start a live stream that's why so guys when you link it up of course we're going to refer to the css folder not just made and then to the file name style.css that's right so that's right that's it easypeasy let lemon squeezy yes for sure so guys if we look at the app like we always talk about in the last few days right we divide things up in boxes so what are some what are some boxes we got yes what do you think of sometimes we got so let me go ahead and show it out for you guys okay right always when we do things we do into boxes so what are some boxes what do we got what do we got guys anybody have it yeah we got the search bar right so we got the header right here okay we got this header right here okay what else do we got guys what else we have search bar the search bar that's right that's like albert that's right so a search bar right here that's correct right what else we got oh hector very good main area with a grid yes right so this main area this whole main area that's the one that's gonna have that grid right so right whenever you see a collection of things you kind of group them together remember that whenever you see a collection of things you group them together okay group them together so in our case for example here right we have a css grid and that's going to be grouped together we also have this little showing 25 jobs portion and then now at this point we have the css grid that's all of this correct yes or no right like that just like that and that's it so now we divide our application into multiple multiple things and at this point all we gotta do is just you know type them up so let's do that so the first thing we did is we're going to create the header dot the header dot uh the header actually so let's go ahead and create the header jesse yes so guys you can just say this header and then inside of it oop can you guys see is that is that a big enough font or do you guys want to make it bigger is that big enough for you guys give a thumbs up if it is good or you guys want to see more a little bigger somebody said yeah bigger please okay a little bit bigger a little bit bigger how about that is that better good yes nice okay okay awesome okay go ahead jesse noel and you know like we said right if you draw the header there are certain things inside of that header so i would say um let's make a header container okay this class right but why why because here's the thing right if we have this specific header right think about like this if we have this header right here this whole thing is a whole header right that you see how this clever jobs is in the lefthand portion the way i can imagine it is kind of like this you have a header container right here that prevents it from going bigger that makes it centered you see that yeah it's correct correct correct j j j wait what is it called j lord yeah correct mag with a max width that's right that's right so let's go ahead and make that happen good job jesse um and i know it has two things what is inside of that header we have a logo so let's go to create a div class is equal to oh dang jesse's just gonna oh sorry all right okay go ahead jesse sarinas okay and then we have a the text clever jobs right here you see that guys a text clever job so let's go ahead and make that work that one work right so this this logo is gonna be this one right that's the logo right and then the clever jobs right that's going to be what that's going to be what that's going to be this span right here i know you guys probably can see that the spin oh dang jesse what's going on there's i don't know [Laughter] clever i can't type today so then what do we have at this point is we have an image so then we have so the logo is going to be the image is going to be where guys inside what inside the logo class correct right yeah exactly inside the logo class so let's go ahead and do image source is equal to what all right is equal to something which we have no idea what it is but we can actually grab a logo from our cloud program logo so i'm going to go to new tab and i'm going to say clever program right here oh not clapper.com but clever programmer here grab a programmer and literally the the way to grab the logo is very simple i go to images at this point and i just look we have the logos the first one this one knows this one this one right here so copy and adjust i copy link uh image address on this one and i will paste it for you guys to see all of you guys to see okay let's see aaron you're gonna paste it are you gonna paste it i got it yep right here that's the logo address okay those are here on youtube you guys know where to go at this point so and then do image source and then paste the link inside the image source guys okay so the image stores boom donezo nice so couple of stuff okay let's see what we have all right so now we've got all this html you guys still with me yes or no guys got it oh bueno give me a cheeky picky all right all right so now if i go ahead and right click on the index.html and all of you at this point bueno cheeky picky that's nice at this point go open with live server like this and you guys should have live server already installed okay and boom we have just a humongous clever program logo which is fine right which is fine you okay jesse yeah yeah i'm just closing the header container i just see like the div right so now now let's work on the header portion right so we have this header okay let's look at the css for this header so if i go to style.css right here okay if i go to style the css let's work on the header so i'm going to say header here okay and what is inside the header well number one is we need to change the background color of this header guys that's number one right so if i go ahead and go to header let's do background background all this header is going to be what jesse well it's going to be this color and it's like a sort of black it's black blue kind of color it's like grayish color it's like a gray color okay put it in zoom chat everybody so now you can see that how this hair just kind of became like the way it is right now and you can see right here how everybody see these little borders right here anybody see this borders you guys see it give me a thumbs up if you guys do see it yeah you see those borders right well the reason why is because by default body the whole body has a margin so here's what we do i go to body like this and i say margin zero boom you see now it's gone right now that's gone that's correct yes yes yes yes that's correct and what i also can do is let's also do a box sizing so i'm going to say the following let's say like this i'm going to say box sizing i know that for sure now box size and we'll do border blocks for this one for your box guys who can't explain what box sizing barter box does by now in the chat who can explain it in one sentence i want to see okay continue on i don't think i can explain it one second honestly that's okay that's okay so look now let's go ahead and do a font family so i'm going to change the font for this whole thing so font family it's going to be this one and i'm going to put it for you guys in the chat as well so find family right here boom find family okay so margin zero fun family and let's give the text color should be all be white so color color white right so that means so we're gonna give the body everything the color should be white because like i said we're doing like a gray scale type situation it's a dark mode application okay awesome so we got that now let's work with the header so now if we think about the header okay right the header has a height yes or no you see this height how big is this height how big is this height it's not that big right so i'm gonna give this a height of around 70 pixels okay by the way i do want to set the background of the body i think okay let's do that that's fine yeah it's this darker color okay it's darker than the header yeah so you see you see the header is a little bit less grayish it's a little more gray you see you see that gas yes or no it's a little more really hard to see but yeah you can see it okay awesome okay a little more grayish okay now for the height we did 70 pixels so you can see the header right there okay as well uh let's at the same time what we need to do is the fall is we need to do this right we need to this image is way too large and there's a lot of stuff going on here like this image is way too big so well here's something to do let's display flex on everything because that's always the answer if if you if you have life troubles just play flex them flex it fix it baby fix it break it not forget it whatever [Laughter] all right okay after that we're gonna center so let's go ahead and save this good next thing we're going to center everything so i'm going to do display flex i'm going to justify content actually i'm going to do align oh yeah just yeah that's right yeah so the display flex and let's do well first of all now it depends where do you want to have the logo and the text do you want it on the left side do you want to do the middle or do you want it on the right side that's right so actually here's what we want you to do because we have this header container guys right is we actually need to modify this header container to be in the center yeah that's right right so right this header container is what's actually encapsulating everything between the clever jobs and all this kind of stuff right so yeah go to style the css and we'll do that header container dash container right and what's inside here jesse um well i would first i'm gonna give it a color to make it visible okay otherwise we don't see it what's inside of it okay oh it's pink let's go pink okay and now now we're going to go back to header and we're going to centralize this header container because the header container is inside of the header guys got it right that's right so justify content center good now and then we do save it save it yes beautiful but also let's do online items in it to make sure it's all in the center vertically as well so align item center sorry a line items center right there okay oh oh dang that looks horrible that's all and let's let's make that image maybe smaller what do you think now i think so jesse too yeah yeah so how do we do that guys how do how do you think we make the image smaller guys what do you guys think how do we make the image smaller guys what do you guys think huh what do you guys think put it in chat yeah exactly yeah height well i don't that's right so if you know the image is actually wrapped inside the logo so actually we need to make the logo div smaller and then the image will decrease in size as well see so yeah here's how we're going to make it we're going to create a how to continue logo we're going to stylize this one and we're going to give this one a height of 30 pixels okay like this okay that's right and then what's going to happen is because i had a 30 pixel so if i say this i can see nothing really changes this point still which is fine which is totally fine but if i tell my the height of my image to be a hundred percent it's going to be a hundred percent of what what do you guys know a height of a hundred percent of what if the period is 30 pixels that's right henry the wrapper right the wrapper the parent element so boom right there you see so now the clever pokemon is only 30 pixels that's pretty much it right also in how to continue you see how the clever clever jobs is right here up on the bottom instead of on the right hand side well what do we do with that for the header container we also go ahead you see yeah we have to give the header container first of all i would give it the max width oh right 1250 pixel save that right but we also need to but this is a max width going to tell us how to continue to do a width of 100 right because then it maxes out correct correcto and then guys of course there we go you see it now that's max width of 1250. you see that right there mixed with a 12 thick see 50. how the hell did that come about i don't know so guys now boom did you see that i'm gonna do a display flex and now the logo and the text are next to each other instead of that's right vertically aligned that's right that's right and i'm gonna give it i want them you can't see it right now but you gonna have to pay really good attention i'm going to center it on the align items so if you save it now it will line vertically you see it will go to the see the text will go to the middle of the header you see that um exactly maybe you can spin a little bit on the side remove the pink jesse remove the pink boom right there see it's lovely it's lovely it is i agree i just wanted to see the actual centered right right right right plus what else do we see guys the logo is stuck to the text that's right that's right we would like it all circumstances we would like them to have a little bit of distance okay so on the head on the logo class i'm going to say margin right and i'm going to give it like a little bit let's see and so that's going to go ahead and actually push the clever jobs to the righthand side so do that jesse let's go save that boom right there also at this point you see that the font size is way too small so how can we fix that very simple guys well how do we fix that guys what do you guys think huh how do we fix that well all we do is we just make the fonts as bigger so we go to the header right here and we do font size for this one font size what is the font this one font size 20 pixels i was going to save that boom you see that's a lot better which is really really good okay awesome at this point that's pretty pretty pretty much it on the header container the header is there i kind of like it it's kind of pretty good now let's work on the next one guys look at this the header is done of course there's some spacing right here to fix later on you see how it's all in the corner which i don't like but if i make this bigger here's a cool thing you see it kind of stays there you see that oh look at that guys because that's the header container inside of the header that's right that's right that's what i'm trying to i'm trying to think is like this logo is it really in the center of everything yeah i think it is right jesse yeah it's a line it has a line item center that's right that's right so i'm making sure yeah so i think so yeah okay for sure for sure cool so that's all good next up let's work on the next thing which is gonna be this search box okay now this search box is going to be really really interesting let's go back to our index.html here guys are you guys still with me you guys still with me kind of guys put it in the chat if you're coding with us okay beautiful beautiful yes yes yes yes yes i like it now we're going pretty fast by us but that's okay that's okay it's okay it's okay so now let's go and create our next one is gonna be this this whole div search i'm gonna call this div div div is going to be class is equal to search okay boom you have class search okay so nothing inside here just yet right this div cluster is going to be so it's going to be just imagine like an empty type situation right inside that we're going to also create a div class search container because why this whole thing you see is the width is kind of within the search right so if i think about it this is right here will be search div and then this would be the search container right just like with the header mmhmm that's it that's it you see that right there awesome so let's do div class is equal to search container dash container boom search container awesome okay let's go and save that one okay and inside this div a few things we're going to need to do okay so the first things first is we have of course you can see that we have like this portion and then this portion this is a button yeah and then this is like a icon with an input you see what i mean so what i'm going to do with this one is i'm going to say a div class is equal to input container right because that's going to contain the input with the search icon okay okay right there and then after that it's going to be also d of class is equal to what a button container so wants to be the input container so if we think about in terms of logic boom this is right here is the input container right here this one is gonna be the button container guys okay does that make sense right and that's pretty pretty much it okay awesome so guys what do we have in the input container what do you guys think put in the chat guys what are we on the input container icon we have an icon icon and what field yes good good good good good so we have the icon and the field so now for the icon how do we use the icon well again let's go to font awesome just how did the last time go to font awesome uhhuh i know pretty cool huh hopefully you load let's go let's keep this music going for now all right so font awesome cool let's type in search search okay and you can see that this right here right away has a search icon so we'll have the search icon right here search icon go go good let's click search icon and there right away gives us the html for the search icon so i'm going to copy this i'm going to click on this one i'm going to copy and paste it into our input container comprende comprende got it got it got it got it got it awesome so we got that portion that's awesome and then of course but nothing's gonna work really because we need to import font awesome into our application so for you i've got the style sheet for the font awesome for you just for you guys because you guys are special just for you i'm going to put it i'm going to put it for you guys here in the chat so you guys have it boom right there whoa link style sheet you guys see that right there link real style sheet so this your link and i want you guys to paste that into your here boom right yes this is basically four font awesome for font awesome all right got it good good good good good good so we got that portion that's all good next up let's go ahead and what next step is going to create an input so if i save this let's see what we have oh look at that look at that beautiful icon tiny it's so pretty it's a beautiful icon look at that icon then we'll do input right input what input type is equal to text right and then we're going to give it an id so we can reference it later that id is going to be filter filter dash what jobs is that what it would be yeah for the jobs and then after that we're going to give it a name right the same filter dash jobs i'm can i not do a word wrap here well i can't oh let's go look at that i can do a word wrap so input type equals text and then the placeholder for this one is going to be what filter by title yeah so let's do this let's go ahead jesse okay whoa and then close it off of course oh you should you just don't need that this one did you like this no we don't oh yeah okay great so right there so that's your input guys so now we have both two things we have look you see right there and they showed up right here this one and this one okay next up let's go and create the button container and the button there's nothing really much that's gonna happen here it really is just going to be a span so i'm going to say span and we'll say find a job that's it oh look how pretty all this kind of stuff is whoa i know i know it looks horrible yeah it does oh yeah yeah is everybody still with me guys yes i'm going to copy this search box for you guys you guys see it so everybody has this here's here's all html boom look at this guys you guys have all html just give it to you guys the search html just like that okay hey beautiful nice now let's go to the css and let's start making this thing beautiful but let's go okay okay style that's see i said okay let's of course let's go ahead go to our what go to our search guys so let's do first of youtube is gonna be our search right because the search is the full on full width thing right so the search is going to be what that's going to be the width of 100 100 right here and we're going to give it a max width of 1250 pixels max width max width of 1250 pixels right jessie yes for sure okay margin zero yeah wow okay this means guys what does margin zero auto mean look if i'm here you see how it's stuck with this one now you see that boom oh yeah let's go that's how we do it yeah so you can see it's being stuck with that which is good that's good that's good it's good right right zero auto let's give it a small margin of padding so we'll do padding 0 25 pixels now what this is is very simple this literally pushes you see it just pushed it creates space right there right this zero stands for the top and the bottom padding okay that's correct that's correct share that's right someone can se it can center wait wait no sure you say content centering that's right this is top and bottom spacing this 25 is which one what which one is that is what it's the left and the right space and that's the right hectare that's great i see you put an opponent like this that's right [Laughter] yeah you know what i'm excited about jesse i'm excited for when we do this kind of stuff live in person like it's like it's so cool to see you guys in live like this and it's awesome right but like that's also go ahead jesse for the people that are in the surroundings of la hashtag code la and send it to which number nas i have no idea we'll take we'll say what messages into facebook again but yeah yeah that guys is if you want to have the opportunity to code live with us okay that's it let's continue we have to search now i think we should go to the search container let's do it so i'm going let's go to container jesse so guys like we said regarding the header and the header container the search container is gonna be inside of it so again i'm gonna make this pink okay maybe yellow how you like that better yellow um okay so essentially is basically this the whole thing is going to surround it yeah exactly so the search contain is actually going to be this whole search box right here you see that that's the whole search box that's what that's what that's going to be so let's go see that let's get let's see that yeah beautiful oh my god that hurts in my eyes jesse hurting my eyes jesse i'm sorry i'm sorry i would never aqua okay okay okay i mean yeah it's better that's better okay we gotta have a little bit of fun guys so here the search container is a height and again if nas stretches out this whole screen you will see it is in the middle of it right now right there see you guys see that yesterday yeah beautiful awesome because of the margin zero auto on search next up next up what we have is let's go ahead and go give it a border radius so there's some border radius right here yeah border dash radius boom right there we'll give it a bit rate of 10 pixels okay awesome and then let's get a border of two pixels solid right here oh nice you see i started to look so good it's going to look juicy like my water it's water oh guys so the aqua is not that okra marine and my minty green color is not going to stay that way there was just a way for me to make it very visible to you guys so i'm going to change that to the original color okay so i'm going to put that one in the chat it's again it's that one c adrian says purple you know she speaks my language you know so let's go boom there we have it let's see oh looking so good now guys you see that also so now that we have that okay you see how we have this let's go ahead and push this whole this whole thing let's push it down you see you see how this is right next to the header you see it right there let's make let's push it all the way down so what we do is we go here we go to the header portion and we say margin bottom we literally just say margin bottom header we say margin dash bottom bottom and we just say 25 pixels 25 yeah i think there you go see how pixels and then we do the following you see how this clever jobs is can this logo is kind of the left hand side of it i don't like that let's give this header container a padding padding of 0 25 pixels so guys what does that mean top and bottom zero pixel left and right 25 pixels got it i hope hector did did the move with that nice okay so now you see it's starting to look really really good okay i like that now let's go ahead and how do we go ahead right now the issue is this fine job and this kind of stuff it's all great but they're all on top of each other what do we need to do to make it happen from left to right you guys know the number drill like i said baby i should have like i shot like a button for flex instead of instead of the song i like to move it move it we should do it with flex it you know i know right that's funny so let's go to search containers you display flex on this one good good good so if we save that see now it's a little bit different so find job is right here okay good next up here's a question for you okay the search container is all flexed which is great right it's all flex and everything looks is looking looking all pretty good but here's my issue with this now at this point guys okay here's my issue at this point we need to go ahead and make it in a way where this fine job is actually all the way on the right hand side what needs to happen in order to make that portion work what do you guys think just curious what used to happen guys what do you guys think people say space between space around justify content space between justify content flex and so good so it's pretty pretty good but actually we're gonna do a little bit differently guys check this out because the way we're doing it maybe it's not nonconventional i mean it's kind of conventional but also not unconventional so first things first is the way i will do it is i will go to my um input container look at this actually no i can do it like this display flex and you see how there is an input container and there is a what a button container so if i go to my input container if i do here if i say input container check this out container right here and i say flex grow one boom right there what just happened look at that what just happened yeah oh basically so if i go ahead and do background color of this one let's just zoom back and color this one i just wanted to do the exact same pink pink oh you did pink right there see right there purple you say purple adrian so you see it makes everything push guys see with flex grow one it pushes the price of whiskey it's saying hey you know what grow this div as much as you possibly can it's like stretch this this thing out as much as you can that's literally what's happening here you see that guys that's the cool part about flexnet flex sorry i gotta do this that was funny let's grow one yeah exactly right so it will grow up on the spills it has available exactly so that's good okay at this point let's go also now go let's go ahead and center this uh horizontally or vertically right so let's in the input container let's do display flex on this one right and how do we center horizontally and vertically what do we do guys what do we do so we'll do justify content center good and then we do what align items center yeah we actually do not need justify content center because we needed to be on the lefthand side so never mind this one yeah okay but it is aligned okay good awesome next thing this search box here's the issue this search box is large yeah it's a large search box so to make this one happen what do you think is to happen here what do you think well i think the i like what you said you know like the input container that one is this that one is this part which is good right good right that's fine so that's working that's good right right so i think we need to target the input inside of that that's right so input container input let's stretch this input now all the way out to here right so if we do flags grow one check this out check this out hey you see it just stretched the whole thing out right that's cool that's cool right so now that's awesome okay now with that being said let's go ahead and modify this container to make it look fancy because as white is now good no bueno so i don't want to have a background color anymore so i'm going to give it background color and i'm going to make it transparent yeah because by default the input has a see but the fold input has a white background color by default okay by default right go ahead jesse also that outline is pretty ugly so what i'm talking about by the way don't don't don't say it just yet the album i'm talking about is actually this one check this out guys one you see this outline it's a pretty horrible outline wouldn't you agree with me on that one this whole outline that's white right that's yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah so what do we do we say we say border none to remove the border like this see the border yeah that one yeah yeah yeah but then the outline when i focus on this it still has an outline so i'll also do outline none also as well nice save that beautiful oh my bad save that right here beautiful that one okay good next up let's go ahead and do a color white to make sure the text is white colored right there so see now when i type you see it's a white color now okay let's get a font size jesse yeah and i don't like how it touches the left side i'm going to give it also a padding or margin oh sorry a margin because i don't want that thing to grow bigger i just wanted to push oh what do we do there we go title okay awesome next up let's go ahead and see now it's time to look good look at this right here right it's done look really really good okay i like that awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet that's pretty cool next thing let's go ahead and modify this uh icon so how do we modify the icon who knows guys what do we do with the icon guys anybody know what do we do the icon we target the icon so we'll say input container input container dash container container container we say icon for icon and we see font size in this icon right here so we say font size font size 20 pixels boom so we make it a little larger let's also put a small padding around this whole what's it called this whole um what is it this whole input container i so let's do margin left 25 pixels boom look at that oh that's how you can change the style of that icon good see so the icon the reason why we say font size for the icon because these icons are actually actually text they're not images the text that's the weird part about it i know you're like what no trust me cool i love that i love that sort of stuff yeah so cool uh so we got that let's go now focus on this fine job portion okay so let's focus on the button now at this point okay guitar yeah so boutonn has what a button container okay and then inside of that button container we have the span so we're first gonna like nas is doing we're first gonna target the button container that's it for now and we'll do a background color right on this one correct and the background go ahead jesse nice royal blue color blue nice i like it okay but i think it's a little bit small so i'm gonna make the width a little bit bigger good okay boom it should change nice yes right there okay and of course i'm gonna use this display flex because as you can see the find job text is not in the middle of that button okay correct so justify content of course center it and align items center it too nice align items so there we go beautiful that's awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet tweet by the way by the way guys for those of you who guys are here i know you i know we're into this right now i want to make sure that we don't forget i forgot to remind this of you guys you guys tomorrow a very important day today tomorrow is the last day of the boot camp right it's the

ahead okay fun job button so let's go ahead and do that now you can see how this find job button right now okay you can see how this fine job button right now does not have a curvature why do you guys think like that why do you think this find your button does not is not curved what do you think is the case you see this is curved right here but this is not for some reason why is that the case no not the border rays because the border rays you already have we have this border base right here right but it's actually be closed because this button is overflowing the actual parent so what we need to do is go to style of css and on where we have the border race which is right here all we say is the following we say overflow hidden oh wow overflow hidden guys okay and there you go there you go that's it right so now this fine job has a clear curvature and this is a curvature at this point that's pretty much it we've got ourselves look at this that's that's it right jesse that's pretty fast that's pretty good that's pretty quick awesome sweet did you tell them why by the way there's a monophonic um no i haven't yet i thought you were going to change the ad event but i'll tell him no please tell him again because i told him but he's not responding okay so at this point guys let's go ahead and do the fall so i'm just going to clean this portion up clean this portion up and then so the following now is going to happen now we got this we got this filter by title we've got all this section let's now work on well here's the thing i kind of want to go into a little bit into a little bit of javascript guys at this point okay into a little bit of javascript because here's the thing we need to be able to catch this text so if i type something in here am i right if i type something in here we should be able to catch whatever we typed we should be able to catch whatever we typed okay so for example now okay if i go to my file and i have my javascript folder i create a new file and i'm going to say script dot js script.js okay let's get the gs and then this one what's going to happen at this point is we're going to create a what are we thinking to do in order to one catch this text what i think has me to do guys what do you guys think what do you guys think guys event list you're right we need to add an event listener right here actually on the find job button so whenever we click on it right we need to add a click email list on the click so for example let's say first we're going to do what let's do an event listener on the click of that to find jobs okay so i'm going to say like this document do like this document dot query selector query selector and what do we what do you guys think we'll get well let's go to any html and what are we clicking on the button container that's right the button container right so let's go ahead and copy copy the button container button container let's do dot a button container okay diablo because this is a class right we'll select this one and we'll do what dot add event listener anyway we'll do a click event listener on this one okay boom boom boom right there okay click my list on this one and then we save that so let's do console.log log i once clicked okay i was clicked okay awesome sweet sweet sweet uh jessica in that case tell david please because i think i'm out of his life okay okay thank you so i was clicked okay so if i go ahead and if i click find a job let me see if i'll inspect them on this one let me see and i do console if i click on this let me see where's my console here let me scroll all the way down let me put this at the bottom of our page now nothing is happening and why is that the case yeah that's right colin that's right uh wait call font yeah that's right so we need to add this our script to actually in this html so for example here we have the link to our css but we have no link to our javascript file so that's a link to our javascript file so we'll do the following we'll do script like this script source is equal to what script source is equal to equal to what guys js right scripted js boom boom done so script source js and this will include our javascript file now so now if i click on it again boom i was clicked and that my friends is pretty much it right but of course let's go ahead and modify this a little bit so let's go to script.js okay and now that we've got the find job how do we get the text that i put in here so let's say for example i'm trying to find a fulltime job here and i say full time okay how do i grab that text guys that's right that's right document the query selector so here's will do so we'll say let text is equal to a document that get what we'll do uh because we have very selective here we'll do a we do we'll actually do an id because we have a id here right here right because yeah i was about to say so we want to target that input and in order to do that we're going to use the id that is on that input guys because an input is not a class right so we're not going to use query selector or query selector all right we're going to use something get element by id yes that way we're going to get that input with an id of filter jobs okay and if you do dot value after the sentence that's how you will get the value of that input that's right so that document that give my id we'll do that value right here okay that value and this will give us the value so we can so login now let's try that console.log it right now okay what is the text that's the text right i was clicked but i fi for example full time let me see console log i need to refresh it maybe do you have that yeah uh no not yet hold on let me put the water up on for you guys you guys can see the word rap ripping the words oh that value let's go right there okay that's great hey there's the text asd so what we did is we look at this if i do it again here right if i say full time full time boom full time what is in the text right what doesn't it text right there so that's pretty much it okay so console log so we got that so now that we got that we're good okay we're good now we got that okay so i'm going to save this right here i'm going to save this right here and the one thing i want to do is actually change this thing so if i click you see if i hover over this it doesn't act like it's a button so i'm going to change to make it act like it's a button okay so let's do it right now so i'm going to click go to back to my style of css i'm going to button the container i'm going to say cursor pointer right here so i'm going to save that so if i hold this now it's a button receiver right there you see and then i'm going to click hover state so i'm going to say the button container hover on the button container right there okay so on the hover what do you think we should do on the hover guys what are you doing the hover well all we do is just simply change the that's right it will we can actually yes we can invert the color but here's another pointer so either sometimes you invert the color or sometimes you just make the color right lighter or darker so for example yeah that's right that's right so for example if i just simply go ahead and i do a i'm just looking here hold on one second i'm trying to find my button container i'm trying to find that color right there i got it so right there that's right so background is gonna be this color i'm gonna put it for you guys in the chat oh this one it doesn't it doesn't defer that much guys but it's a little bit lighter as you can see see you see it's just a little bit lighter just a bit you see that right there just a tad right and then we can even add a small transition to it so we'll say transition all 0.2 seconds ease okay right there save that and so now if i hover oh look at that you see now it's a very slight transition now with that color and it makes it feel like it's a button and that's it that's it guys right mister feel like it's a button beautiful awesome so i love that portion i love that portion at this point what is next jesse oh the button okay so wait rewind did we finish the search container the search bar we did we did whoa looks amazing guys looks amazing right please set it in the chat if you are where we are right now plus what do you think is the next thing that we're going to be building put in the chat guys ready put in the chat yeah this is like ready for more let's go ready for more let's go ready for more let's go more more more never enough nice nice nice i love it i love it i love it ready ready megan is ready 100 understood oh we love that oh yeah people the great jobs section correct that's correct guys that is correct so i always you know when i build something like this i always break it down okay so i know that hmm what do we notice about these jobs guys every single job what do we notice about them what what do we notice about them well they all have a top section right the logo and the um horizontal three dot icon okay we have a a roll a role position role a job job name that's right okay we have a description that's right and then what do we have after that yeah also the two buttons which is one section of buttons and all that is aside the encapsulating inside of what inside this portion right here you see that right it's only a capsule inside here okay so i think at first what do you think jesse what should we start out with before we worry so much about these little thing the beeps think i think they think the bobs right what do we do i think just just make one one thing what should we call it a tile a job element we can call a job yeah we can call a tile a job tile a job title so this this this one thing is a job tile but before we do this job tile shouldn't we create all of these grids to figure out to make sure that we have all these grids or no yeah for sure because what's the benefit of using a grid in this case nice i really don't don't know you don't know i don't know well let's say you make the screen very big and you make it also very small let's see what happens let's see oh you see it stretches and it shrinks right here right but it's always three columns and three well three more rows depending on how many jobs we have but it's always in three columns it never changes so that's very beneficial about using css grid okay guys so hmm yeah let's make the board first or the jobs list actually the jobs list and let's make a grid out of that and then once we have the grid then we can go deeper yep exactly then we can make and then we'll just make one thing right and of course somebody asked about what but what about the 75 jobs don't worry about that we got you my friends we watch we'll make that into a div too don't worry i got you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah awesome so let's continue on so go ahead let's continue it yeah so we're gonna go back to our index.html okay guys and it's going to be below the search of course what i'm highlighting here okay so there we're going to open up another class div class and we're going to call it jobs dash oops does blend up list this whole is the camp solution of that just so you guys know okay that's that guy yeah okay so jobs also continue on and for now i'm just going to say this h1 i'm going to make this one static okay so 15 jobs oh and i'm going to have to do that inside of the h1 that's right handy like this and i also know that after be below that i'm gonna have all the jobs right sorry to cut you off jesse but we have to put the div inside the h1 right here it's right so we have the dfc we have a div right here right here but right there you're right okay good catch and here we have a we have all of the jobs or we could call it actually a container right now oh because it's a jobs container as well you call it a jobs container as well yeah that's great there we go nice so hey there's a div yeah thank you so the container will actually contain and will be the grid that will be the grid that will be the one below showing 20 15 jobs in this case okay so then i'm going to make one tile and what should we name it what should be the class of that that tile guys what do you guys think what's with the class of that tile what should it cuts a towel that just no not jobs this is this is only for one job card job towel that's right money out that's right so let's do job title jesse job dash tile that's right yep oop tickle yes all right and for now go ahead and then what and for now i think we don't really do much this point do we right no i don't think so either i think let's just create let's just create a bunch of job tiles just for us to see how they work how about right we can also we can put some text here just to be sure so it has something in it okay so one job okay like this okay good so that said who remembers how you make a grid from yesterday's game who remembers guys who remembers guys let me know in the chat display grid very good henry steven very good very good so we're gonna go to style the css and we're going to be targeting the let me see the jobs list okay jobs list so dot jobs list like this okay and that way we can make that into a grid now first of all like we did before oh wait we're not going to make that one in the grid yet because jobs list is not the grid we just said it i said it myself actually jobs container is the grid okay jobs list is the one that also has that text inside of it so it's a little bit more around it but i'm also going to give it a max weight of 1250 pixel okay and like we've done before i'm gonna give it a width of 100 right now in order for us to see it let's give it a color also which is a little bit of a darker gray black blackish just right now just for us to see it is that what shine is due yeah just okay let's see so right here oh one job it's only showing one job yeah one job um i'm gonna give it a height hey why is it not lagging tagging okay it's fine do you want me to type i can type is fine yeah okay type height yeah so let's do height so for the jobs list uh are we working on the jobs list are we working on the which one or the job tile we're working on the jobs list so we're working on the whole surroundings yeah um the whole slide yes okay loading is showing 5 15 jobs yeah i got it got it okay so we have the job list this is right here the surrounding so the jobs list is the whole surrounding correct and of course and now inside that we have the showing for the jobs which is what we see right now correct you guys right that's right that's right which is this one okay that's a showing 15 jobs and then we have a jobs click here that's going to contain individual job okay guys that's what we have now also i want to do i want to create a few jobs i'm going to say one div class one job and i'm going to create a few jobs boom boom boom boom boom boom boom i'm gonna command c command v just so that we have multiple jobs yeah we have one job but don't worry about that right now that's not the most important thing okay okay awesome sweet after that what we need to do is the following okay let's remove uh actually we got the width let's go ahead and give it a height of 100 v8 height i can type again okay so give it a height of 100 let me type jesse jesse yeah i'm sorry yeah height over 100 vh 100 vh okay right there there okay out of 100 vh right so that way it's 100 vertical height basically that's 100 vertical height that's kind of what we're doing here right now okay that's 100 height and then we'll get a margin zero auto for the jobs list because of course that will make it center so if i for example do like this you see nothing so far is happening it's not it's still staying the lefthand side but if i do margin zero auto if i do margin zero out on the jobs list it should technically work so let me go do it again boom right there you see one right there you see it now went together with everything right that's what kind of what happened there awesome that's it after that point let's go ahead and do the following which is we're going to give it a display flex because we need to what we need to do what what do you guys think we need to go from top to bottom right from top to bottom and we're going to get a flex direction column guys okay let's direct column awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet awesome sweet column nice column okay and at that point we're pretty much done with this one one thing i want to do is shall we give it a padding jesse yeah okay let's give it a penalty padding over it might not be visible due to yeah okay let's give it a padding 025 pixels jesse yeah padding of 012 pixels because you can see here this creates the padding from the right hand side and so that's what we're going to do as well so padding is your turn on the right hand side and the left hand side beautiful and so now the reason why we do that is because guys whenever you create applications want some things to align you see how this aligns with that this aligns with that then this is going to align with that right but it doesn't all have to be aligned because for example on the h1 section so go to h1 section jesse yep on the h1 section jobs list okay if we just simply give the a margin left of 25 pixels margin left yes right margin left save that see it kind of makes it more to the right hand side but which is okay because it actually aligns with the search icon so this is a tidbit for you on the ui ux side you want your things to align with certain things it doesn't all have to be aligned together but it is helpful for example the search icon is aligned with that but this the jobs are aligned with this portion you guys see that yes or no do you guys see that yes or no comprende yeah it's good right that's really good so that's a very really cool ui ux tip for you okay okay after that what else what else so we have the each one which kind of covers that what's the next one jesse is need to font size 20 pixels of that h1 go ahead jesse so put a font size 20 pixels on this one that's done so let's save that that makes it a little bit smaller and now at this point let's go ahead and focus on let's go to focus on the actual the block right the actual container right yes that's right so guys we're first going to be focusing on the jobs container which is sort of like the parent grid right the whole grid that's right so here we're going to say display and it's not lex it's grid it's grid and grid is similar grid is similar to flex guys grid is similar to flex but the issue the cool thing the grid is you can specify columns which is what we like to do right right so that said by the way we're gonna use something like this just what we used yesterday okay and we're gonna do that thing again whereby we're gonna say hey i want from the container 1 3 to be one fraction and i want you to repeat that so all of those tiles within those in this grid will be the same okay so i'm gonna say repeat three three one four one fr and the one fr simply means that you know what expand my grid to as far as possible and what's gonna make that happen is now these three grids are all the same width because if i for example go to a job tile let's give it let's go to the dub job tile section right and if i give it a specific background let's just say we give it a background of uh pink for now just the first thing it comes out to mine so right so right there this right here you see how they're those same width guys right but you can't see it so let me make it a little bit more visible by changing the get uh gap right i'm gonna say gap 40 pixel that way you can see this guy's better see this better go ahead so save that yeah save and boom so this gap this creates a gap between every single element that's a gap of 40 pixels guys yeah that's really really cool right and now you can see what nas was explaining when i interrupted him but now you can see that those three fractions three times one fraction now if i do this two hundred look at this if i do 200 pixels for this one see so i can either do a static width for every single element or i can do one fr which is says hey you know what expand as much as possible that's a little bit happens okay so now that we have now that we have the specific section let's go and remove the job uh the container what do we do for the container as well jesse um we still want we want um the container to grow as big as possible mmhmm so what are they doing right flex coral which means like take up the maximum space that is available hey you see so it's going to take as much space as possible that's going to happen okay so that's good and then i'm going to give it also a template so i want to say grid template some some of these ambulances off so funny repeat three also one of our so we're gonna have three uh columns and three rows jesse is that right yeah or well we don't have to specify the rows in case we have more jobs you can also say that you want to show more yeah i guess we don't need to really need these rules right right that's why i didn't say anything about it yet but that's that's the the decision you guys can make okay so of course this one also has a margin of zero 25 pixel okay like this and the background is a certain color okay yeah so the margin is easy to fix those but for now because this thing actually it's 25 pixels we don't really need that at this point because we put a padding the last time no we don't because the pattern was here right yeah yeah you don't need that you're totally right that's right we're right right you're right so background boom right nice okay save that that's going to remove this job tile pink color because we need that anymore but you can change it you can change that color okay what can we change to orange yes there we go that makes so much money thank you oh my god thank you holy holy moly okay holy nice okay that said guys of course i mean because of the flex grow it just takes up the whole space right so that's pretty nice so we can just style this tile and then like we want it right so i'm going to give it a border oh shoot border radius of 10 pixel and i'm very consequent with these guys because in the search container nas also used a border radius of 10 pixel even for the button he also used one of 10 pixels so you want in your design you want to be consistent in that that makes your design look really uh neat and slick okay is a big key guys it's a big key okay so of course curse a pointer when we point on it okay and um first okay let's first think about this okay guys inside of this um job tile how do we want things to display how do we want things display okay so of course we're going to be using this play flex right and i also want things because remember right we had we have the top the title the icon and the the three dot thing we have the role we have the description and that we have the bottom so hmm i think my flex direction should not be row but it should be column that's right okay so row is the default direction of display flex but we want to change it so we're going to say column okay so it's vertically aligned okay guys then of course i want everything to be in the middle so i'm going to say justify oh justify content center nice and i want everything to be the color of white nice okay also i can see that my one job is still touching the edge you don't want that you don't want the content to be touching your the edge of your job tile at all so i'm gonna give it a padding of 30 pixels that's right boom you see so now it's gonna push so everything inside here is gonna be pushed from the left from the top from the right and from the bottom guys it makes sense comprende good good good all right let's go continue on jesse so guys it's just in the middle because we only have two words but we'll change that in a moment okay that said oh do you want to make there's something really cool we're gonna do let's do that maybe let's wait with that hold on hold on what do you have right now let's hover right yeah really yeah oh okay so guys we're gonna make a hover how do you make a hover on a diff class what do you think what do you guys think anybody say it yeah the job tile exactly that job dash tile right i'm gonna say the hover on this one right now the really cool thing about the hover for example in this specific hub right when i hover you see how it becomes bigger this card so the way to make that work is we use something called a transform scale so look trend uhhuh transform transform right scale right here yeah a scale to what let's say 1.05 so biscuit if we do two skill two it's gonna scale to two times the size right so this is gonna scale it basically in terms of like how big it is right so look well i think it's gonna scale this one it's gonna scale like five percent bigger than the original size so see it's scaling but it still looks horrible because we didn't put a transition on it right so let's put a transition transition on which attribute the transform attribute right and we're going to give it a 0.2 seconds so now if i hover oh how cool is that yeah that's what i'm talking about guys that's awesome so now that we've got that i think the next thing we need to do is actually work on making all this content inside here right that's the next one so let's go and work on that jesse yeah for sure so let's go back to our index.html guys and as i said before it contains like four sections right so we have the top section or you want to call it different you can tell me too now the top is fine go ahead top okay and i'm just going to make it so it's inside of the the job tile okay guys so don't worry about the rest of the job tiles i'm just going to focus on one job tile okay so um class that's the top section right and hmm there's an image in here okay just make sure you put it inside the idea of jesse please yeah that is very good catch yeah and well guys we could um get a picture from somewhere okay um and use that as a source so i got you a picture i got your picture this is the picture right here copy my address and i'll get you the picture right here boom right there awesome that's the picture i got for you okay yeah and now we want to have that icon that those three dots we want to have that so but we're not going to use that from font awesome we're going to be using that for material ui icons really that's how you use that does font awesome not have those icons by the way really it does i think maybe okay you want to check it out yeah let's check it out so if i go to font awesome i found awesome so we don't have to import anything front off but i also thought it was fun to see because it's really easy to use that actually yeah okay let's do it your way let's do it let's try it thank you so guys you can span class and then you say material icons and i'm going to give it a name so this name i came up with it myself okay this is by the way the name of that icon how material ui names that okay and here but inside of your spam to pay attention inside of your span we're going to say this and that is how material icons will know that this will be an icon in your app okay so how we're going to link that up there if you go to the side of material ui icons you can find a link there and just like um just like we did before with the font is uh awesome it's just a link and i'm going to share that one now in the zoom chat okay and i'm also going to pop it here at the top after line 9. see that on line 10. you can scroll to the top oh yeah nice yeah so you can see for example if i start if i search what is it horizontal dots or more horiz so more just so i'm because if i just say dots yeah that helps too by the way yeah let's see right there see click on that one and so right away right it's it says more you see that right there that's more horrific right here okay then freshly there learn more about the import okay yes and there you go below and then you have there you have the link the rail link component prop libraries go blow blow right there here right there there boom so if i click on this link i need i'm going to put that again now usually guys if you you usually don't want to combine two different two different icon libraries but but it's okay we'll just do it with you guys today so you guys can learn it because there's two different types there's a font awesome one there's material ui right so but usually you want to kind of stick to one but okay awesome oh you already put one sorry jesse yeah yeah that's great so this is just for teaching purposes that we're teaching you guys two different libraries okay awesome so that said let's continue we got that icon right now i want to know if it's visible if it's really working yeah it's as well right there see oh my god oh that's good that looks so good hey that's the icon awesome all right let's continue on at this point let's maybe change the color of this from orange to something better yeah let's do that let's do it let's go to stella says and on the job tile instead of doing orange we're going to change the different type of color we're going to change it to a color that just going to put in right now yes so that is again that grayish color it's the same color as the search container so it's lighter than the background otherwise you won't see it right hey let's go i just put it to you guys hey look at that started look really really cool starting to look really really really cool awesome sweet sweet sweet okay cool cool cool okay what's next jesse hmm i would say let's let's let's do the top section okay because then we got that portion already done okay the top section okay right the top section because as you can see guys what's wrong with this top section we don't want those two items to be vertically aligned right no so top and i can make this very visible for you guys i know maybe you already get sick of it but it's just very handy it just makes makes things very easy to understand too for you guys okay so boom there it is and there the three dots is at the bottom okay so i'm gonna give that a width i'm gonna give this a width of a hundred percent this top okay and i'm going to give it a display flex now of course as you can see you cannot see it now if i remove the aquamarine color you can see that the dots are now at the top on the right you see that you see that so let me first now stop wait up hey sorry about that go ahead that's okay and then let's target the image so it's a little bit smaller and we can see what's actually happening okay so that top image and it's very small we're gonna only make it like 50 pixels okay boom nice okay i like that i like that so that's right there okay awesome yeah but as you can see it is next to each other and that's not something that we want no right how do we so how do we spread that around so we can spread that around by going to the top section okay and on line 133 i'm gonna give it a justify content of space between okay so as you can see guys what kind of color should i give it blue maybe it's very visible boom there we go that's nice nice right there it is okay right there that's all that's looking really good look at that awesome i like that so this is looking really really good so we got the top section now let's work on the next section after that okay yes let's do it so next up is the title i think the title well the title or the the title or the role name i guess yeah that's fine let's go let's call the role name that's fine rule name so this class oh where am i typing oh here go ahead sorry guys so div class roll name like this and then please type inside of the div i don't know why my computer is doing that but that's okay and for now i'm gonna say this okay and after the title we also have something else we also have a description hold on just so let me remove this kind of stuff hold on because there's extra spin just it gets weird i know is it because i don't know maybe because it's live shirt let's create all this weird stuff maybe so you're prettier and my prettier also going off setting off at the same time yeah i think so let me see so thank you span so dave dave so we have div class name roll name lead part design right here awesome i like that okay cool right and so for example here now we have a lead product design right here okay and let's continue on so here diff class description mmhmm that's with the next order that yeah and here inside of this one i'm just going to put some spam with some laura lorem ipsum inside of it just to make things a little bit easy for now okay that's nice nice nice so the little chat give you guys the lauren epsom while you guys by jesse you're typing right here oh you got it okay go ahead and of course after the description section we're gonna go into the button section so i'm gonna say here div class buttons and i thought okay let's make this a little bit handy so i'm gonna say diff class button button and i'm going to call this one apply now right that's going to be the apply now button right right so here apply now and here i'm just going to say button and you'll see in a moment why i don't need to give that another class as well okay so message now we got all of the sections now inside of our job towel but as you guys can see it's a little bit packed right it needs spacing it needs styling and all that so let's do that so we go to stella css okay let's go ahead all right beautiful beautiful and then first of all of course we're going to start with title mmhmm so as you can see the title is touching everything at the bottom at the top and that's not something that we really want no right so i'm gonna give this a margin okay of 20 pixel and again this this right here is means top and bottom margin yes this right here means left and right margin guys okay left and right so top and bottom is 20 pixels save that and there's no margin for now so i think the reason why there's no so there's no it doesn't show the margins the reason why doesn't show the margin is because sometimes when you use when you use display flex that's something will happen so if you actually put into a padding that will actually work so padding so save that oh that doesn't work that way let me see so title title title i think we did we changed the title name let's see oh yeah we did so it's actually your role name my bad real name yeah roll date okay so save that boom right there awesome and penny still works by the way so it's not an issue but the padding of the margin honestly next one yep so next one um roll name and then we wanna um target that span inside of the roll name let's give it a font size of 22 pixels font size 22 pixel that's pretty much and of course that's it nope we don't need it because we defined the the font family at the top right right so other than that let's go on to the description correct and the description guys hmm let's say i have a lot of text what is something you can do to avoid it from overflowing so we want to give it a fixed height that's part one it's a fixer which is really really important okay so let's go give it a fix hi jesse yeah so i'm going to give it a height of 105 pixels that's right okay and then we'll give one i'm going to give it this right so because sometimes for example sometimes what might happen is you might have too much text right inside here and so you want to prevent our goals to run too much text so five by the way it's not description by the way it's something uh description that's right description let me see we just make sure it's all good description okay so that's good so if i save this if i right click inspect them on this one okay let's see what the height is currently let's see what the current height is so the current height of this element right the current is somewhere let me put it into a dark side here the current height of this element right here description l you see is 105 exactly right it's 105 pixels exactly which is really cool right 100 exactly so exactly what's what what we're going to do as well right and so this prevents any anything else from going larger than that all right at this point so we've got a description let's work on the next thing let's work on the actual font size we can also on the description we can say font size on this one so we could do a font size of 18 pixels right to make a little bit larger smaller right and we can do a different color as well on this one yeah there you go nice that's awesome so save that but now let's go over to the buttons guys that's right so that is one big class as you can see and again i'm gonna make it visible okay like this boom nice let's see so save that a nice so we have the apply now button right here and of course the message now button and these will become buttons here in a second so i'm going to make it a little bit i'm gonna make the letters black for now so you guys can actually really see it but let's let's let's think about this too you know first of all we don't want the buttons to be touching the text above it okay so i'm going to give it a margin top of 20 pixel that's right so margin tells me okay awesome boom it will move nicely to the yeah let's go awesome and then again of course guys what do we want in those but what would you what do we want apply now and measures are at top of each other but we want them to be left and right of each other right so this split flex of course and what else guys justify content space between that's right that's right that's right nice oh sweet space between there we go so they're taking up the most space that's put that between them basically okay that said i'm also gonna give the buttons a height okay a fixed height boom there we go nice nice nice nice nice awesome so we got a fixed height okay and what's next jesse i'm gonna i'm gonna define one button okay one button so now we have this whole group right that has two buttons and now we're gonna work on individual buttons right now at this point right so if i would give this a background color you wouldn't be able to see it because look it would just cover the whole button section that's right exactly you know so this is what we're gonna do we're gonna give each of these buttons we're gonna give the button a flex of one so why are we doing that jesse what do you think um i want the button to stick up as much space as possible that's right right so we're trying to make it so for example if you do background color green do by glitter green for a second here you're able to see that that basically that will allow will allow you to see that it will take as much space as possible yep see there you go see so yeah it takes up the whole thing because there's two buttons right now right so now let's go ahead and remove this for a second here okay good let's continue on with the next the next button or the button right now well i want to inside of the one each button actually i want the text to be in the middle right so again i'm going to be using display flex and i'm going to say justify content center but i'm also going to center it vertically right so i'm going to also use our familiar align item center plus i'm going to say border radius 10 pixel nice okay i like it i like it so and i'm going to give the grayish color to the letters okay this one and we can pop it into the chat okay whoops i got it i got you yeah i got it and i'm also hey why can't i not type can you type yeah type so then we're also going to give it a background color as well so let's go ahead and give every single button a background color as well so let's do this boom right there so let's do the background color right here save that okay so now you can start to see the buttons right right you start to see the buttons let's remove the background pink so because we're at this point wait wait wait no wait a moment no because look i i still want to show because there's one button is different from the other one right so first of all let's change the font size to font size 14 on each button okay so font size font size 14 14 pixels okay so it makes it a little bit smaller which is awesome okay and what now i want to target the apply now so let's do class apply now apply dash now okay yeah and then when i say color for this one color is going to be white right yeah it's going to be white and then when i change the background color background i'm going to change the color of that is going to be that blue one which is the blue one that we have yeah that blue one that's right jesse yeah that blue one so the royal blue one nice that's awesome that's good okay so guys as you can see we did this by only using one button class so apply now is therefore has the same size and the same border radius and all and is also centered the textview is centered just like a message now and notches also but only on the apply now button we're doing some customization that's right that's customization so but that's why when we go to inside html guys that's why every single button here you see there's a they have a shared class right we use shared classes so that we can go ahead and apply the same class to multiple things right that's the whole goal at the end of the day right in the same situation with here awesome so we got that let's go and remove the back of color pink now can we do that now jesse yes for sure boom okay somebody says you could target the first by button first child that's also an option for sure that's for sure that's right so look we got now this portion you see now for some reason it's like very much stretching it is there a reason why stretching the jesse so i think it's actually because of the align item center so look if we go back to our uh let me go back to minus html and if we go back to our the job tile correct so let's go to job tile here yeah so if we go to job tile here and you can see here we have just my content as center and what we do is we do online items and actually going to be flex start or not that's not doing it as well so let me see so if i go to here if i inspect them let's take a look at why it's it wasn't making it so big right because that wouldn't make really make sense why is this the case let me see if like start uh justify content oh justify content center yeah no it should be i think flex start see okay so that puts at the top okay more space evenly okay but what's at the top but let's see why is the case the job tile has a certain height padding 30 pixels i actually know why i think it's also because because when we when we did flex grow so you see here this one yes right here right it says flex grow one let's remove that one for now eh you see and so that will make it take up only as much space as i can right let's uh let me go ahead and put back the grid template columns i'm just going to see if that changes anything repeats you mean yeah three one f r one f r yeah right there see so that's what happened so now we told okay so what these template rules are gonna do the reason why we need them now is because this is going to mimic whatever this is right so it's going to make sure that the width and the height are the same guys okay that's what we say grid template rows and this flex grow one it was kind of expanding to too much and it didn't really need to expand so we don't need to do flex grow one at this point instead we're just saying you know what just create three columns with three rows and we're all good at this point does that make sense guys all good yeah that's awesome sweet sweet sweet so we're all good at this point and then also so that's good i like that and at this point that's pretty pretty much it on our side um now that we've got look at this now this comes like the really really crazy part okay what's the crazy part that we're gonna work on now at this point what do you think jesse oh well we only got one one job that's right so we got one job only right now right but we need to get multiple jobs so this is where we now go back to script.js and we make it happen and we get fancy with this kind of stuff guys okay yeah we got fancy so nas where are we getting the data from so for these jobs because i don't think i wanna you know put all of these tiles hardcoded in there no we don't so this is where for you i mean actually we did a lot of research i did a lot we did a lot of research and like we kind of thought well can we use an api somehow and they're not not a lot of companies are allowed us to use apis unfortunately but what we can have is we have a json file that can be used for where you can download that will have all these jobs data so for example i'm going to give you guys the link right now okay i'll give you guys the link right now to that google drive folder i'm going to copy this link okay so it's going to it's this link right here boom it's this link right here and it has a data.json right here you see this one so i'm going to give you guys the link right now boom data just so i give you guys all the link okay i gave you guys all the link you should have the link now awesome sweet and those are on youtube we'll have the link in the description later on okay after after this uh thing so data json so that's good and then let's click on this one and click right click and then click download boom click download okay guys let me know if you guys got it give me a thumbs up if you guys got all that link okay let me know if you guys got the link i think you guys all got it just click right then right click it and then click download awesome suite click download okay so that's good we got that portion okay we got that portion and now what you do is we need to import that nice yes good good can you send it again i sent you guys the link hold on right here that's just when you get the link yeah so now that it's done here's what we need to do right where do we have our data so we have our init.css or you know and so forth let's take our data.json so i'm going to take my data json right here my data javascript yeah so the data that jason guys i just made that file here in a visual studio code so here i okay sorry jesse so i basically you drag it from your downloads folder or whatever it would be put into json folder you see since jesse already did it i could just do replace go ahead and now we have all of our json stuff in there look at that right there guys oh so good so this is your jobs data this is what you would usually get from api right but in our case we have our own kind of little uh javascript object json objects for you guys to use so now the question might be well nas okay we have this data but how do we actually grab it and actually use it what do you guys think huh good question huh well i think you would definitely do that somebody said titles somebody says somebody said that this task is literally what react.js made for no not necessarily you're wrong it's actually what javascript is made for so react.js just plays on top of it right so javascript react.js right javascript is going to make this happen too so check this out if i go to script.js right if i go to this i'm going to create a function and this function is going to call be called get jobs right so let's do create a function here function we'll call for create get jobs okay okay so we got the function guys okay we got that awesome and we're gonna use it to call fetch and fetch is a way for us to get yeah effect is a way for us to get from api so we'll do fetch fetch and we're gonna fetch a data dot js from our json file yeah from a decent file right yeah it's kind of like you fashioned it from the api from a certain link that's right that's right guys right and um yeah and then we're gonna wait until we have that so that's why we're gonna be using dot then we're chaining it we're gonna wait for the response that comes out of it so basically what we can out of our json file okay guys and it's jason so we can basically gaze sonify it that's right okay that's right which brings us back certain data and that's the data that we need in order to use we're going to do return data but before we turn data let me go and console this so you guys can see what i'm talking about so console.log dialog data right and the way this kind of works is very simple okay guys look whenever we fetch is we get data from the api right then what happens is we've converted data to json right we convert the data to say hey you know what we're going to use a json object that's going to use a json object and then we actually get the data right here so if i go ahead and save this and i call this in my javascript file and i say and i say git jobs okay and i call it in here i call it in here okay so get jobs i call them there okay awesome sweet sweet sweet and then what's going to happen is very simple i'm going to inspect them but on this one inspect them on this one i go to console oh right there these 15 objects all 15 objects are right there guys you guys see that you guys see that yeah isn't that cool right so we've got the 50 objects all in here if i if i open one object look we've got all the data about the specific job so this is where now we can get even fancier okay how do we now show these specific objects how do we show all of them so that they're all right here well you would have to loop through these objects and then access get the data from each object so since we know it's an object that means we have to access the keys that's right of this object so let's go ahead and do create a function called show jobs right and you see how i'm splitting my functionality into smaller functions okay show jobs right here and i'm going to pass in the list of jobs in here and now check this out right so number one what i'm going to do is i'm basically going to pass in the list of jobs that i'm going to get from my fetch data right now how's it going to work we'll check this out i'm going to return this fetch data object because this fetch actually returns a promise i know it's weird i know you guys haven't learned promises which is okay okay i promise kind of like you know what i promise that at the end of this at the end of today you will have this done that's what's happening this fetch is promising this function that you will have the data at some point later on think about it like that think about that way right so what's gonna happen here is very simple i'm going to say get jobs.then and this that then is going to be called only when the promise is fulfilled basically when this fetch gives us the data as in for example in your case guys when you guys finish this project at the end of this class then we'll do something right so let's do that then and really what's gonna happen is just then that's gonna get us the data and then look at those happening here then we're going to create a function and we'll do what we'll do show jobs show jobs we're going to pass in those jobs in here boom and that way i can do yeah i know cool right oh so wait and the show jobs function in order to show jobs that means i have to use html that's for sure plus this job is an array with objects correct so the show jobs function should actually loop through that and then say with each object um hey html i want to show this job object with certain properties oops don't want that so look if i it's backed up on this one now inspect them a console we got an error let's go ears is good jobs is not defined it's fine it's because we just present because in here we need to pass on data right you see this is data and that's going straight into here here's how it works literally it's kind of kind of like this let me let me show you guys it kind of looks like this it's kind of like this so it goes from data to this data right from there it gets out of the get jobs function then it goes to here and from there it goes to here and from there goes to here i know weird right and then from there it goes to here uh yeah you see i do understand it though guys because look read it closely step by step okay because on line 9 and line 17 those are called function definitions okay we are defining what a function should be doing there then on line 24 that's actually the first step because that's where we're calling the get jobs function look at that show jobs jobs and show jobs exactly what we want right here guys look at that exactly so good so good i like that so we've got the jobs okay you guys still with me you guys still with me oh good beautiful so we've got the jobs now the question is how do we market how do we put those jobs right i want to just leave those jobs as a consult for now here's one thing i know and there's one thing i know is the following i know i need to put those jobs inside the jobs container so what i'm going to do is i'm going to grab the jobs container i'm going to say let jobs container is equal to document dot query selector and i'm going to get that jobs container oh that's not what i want jobs dash container right right and let's go to console log this one for now as well so console.log jobs container boom okay console.log that let's see so if i inspect them on this one again console so right now the container is null because i think createselector.jobs container right here jobs container do it again a you see this right here e yeah very good that's right there right so we got that document and this is where we need to replace the html guys so let's go ahead for do this first yeah no i know wait right so let's create an empty so literally we're creating html now inside javascript listen this we have jobs.html is equal to an empty string for now for now it's empty string right and then what we're going to do is we're going to loop through every single job that we get from here look for physical job we get from here that's right right so we'll do four each we're gonna for each job let's go ahead and create a function for this one right and then we'll do something now at this point so let's go ahead and console log the job for now so to console the log the log each job okay right and if i recognize inspect them on this one look at this see this is every job literally every job that we have is right here exactly right so we got that oh i know that also means what is one of the keys that also means if i do console.log oops not local storage logo storage logo what is logo console right now logo is gonna look at that these are all the logos for every single job you see right there right there right there right there awesome awesome so now look at what we do guys i want you to pay attention to this really quick really closely go to index.html every single job tile we're going to copy the whole job tile right because that's what we want to repeat is you want to repeat every job tile for every job comprende right that's right like like just doing it right so copy every job yeah go to script that source and here's what we're going to do i'm going to say jobs html check this out guys java's html plus minus remember how this was a string before i'm going to say plus equal to which is basically going to concatenate it concatenate i'm going to use back ticks like this so these are template strings okay let me kind of clean this up here for a second yep sorry i'm going to use back ticks like this oh my wait wait wait wait back takes like this i'm not pasting the whole thing here oh the whole thing the whole the whole html is going to be in here guys the whole html i'm going to make it just a little bit better so it's boom right there yeah okay you see the whole thing the whole job tile so now check this out we can for every job here's what we're doing for every job we'll concatenate this html to this job html do you guys see the yes or no right you can see that okay okay same section we have this job html i mean sure you guys but you can copy it from your guys from your site too so let me just do that for now i'll put it in the chat here boom that's a job html for you guys okay so then what's going to happen now this one is very very simple right we're going to go outside our for each loop let's console.log dialog the java.html so let me see the jobs.html let's console logo for now inspect element let's see console oh look at that oh this is all html that we will be showing guys that's cool right all of html okay so we got that portion and here's what becomes smarter instead of using this link let's use a variable how do we get individual url for every single job how do we do that guys tell me what is it jesse job job so you can type that job job dot logo that logo save that next one instead of using this what do we do oops sorry um wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait we're gonna do job dot roll name wait hold on go ahead now do it if you allow me go ahead just wait no i'm still wrong hold on jess you're still wrong wait wait wait it's okay it's okay you can oh we can always fix things afterwards guys don't worry okay okay job dot roll name pay attention guys it is rule name uh uppercase or camel case i mean so the second world has a second word it has a capital letter okay inside of if you you can check it out guys if you go back to your data.json file can you show that not there you see it right see first it starts off with a yeah exactly role name logo those are the keys of this object that we're using we're accessing while we're looping through this big array of objects okay so let's go back to our script.js and also for the description i'm gonna remove the lorem ipsum thank you very much and then dollar sign make a variable and say job.description so save that guys check this out so say that what we literally did is for every single job we rendered the job we created an html a job title html for every single job with a different logo with a different role name and a different description and literally that was it right and so now if i go if i can solo the html like what yeah well java description if you go back to the data that jason it's actually not the same actually exactly it is actually requirements dot content yeah the idea you can did is the sewing challenges to technology let's go that's what we did job right here javarecommerce.content guys okay the content okay awesome so we got that portion that's all good after that after that let me see that's it for now that's pretty much it so let's take a look on this one console.log and we'll do jobs.html save that one and then the file inspect element on this one check this out look at this current developer right right so we have all the stuff oh this is horrible right and look see different content for every single thing so if we have the html now that we need to put what do we do now what do we do well we only have the html here yeah we don't have it actually in our container let's put in the container because we only we only stated it here so we need to put this jobs html inside of our container jobs container.inner html is equal to jobs html are you ready for this are you ready for this my friends are you ready let's put it in the chat if you're ready go let's go oh let's go look at that look at that that that is so cool we need to fix a few things to fix this portion right here but that's pretty much it look at that oh that looks so good guys look at this look at that guys i want you to fix a little bit of the apply and the whites like it's like uh why it's like why it's like that but other than that that is awesome that's pretty awesome so now so we got this portion which is really really cool right here's another thing we need to do what are they going to do well we got the html we got that's working you see this logo this logo let's go ahead and add a border is the logo jesse right what is the borders for that logo i was thinking the exact same thing so border radius it's in the top section okay guys it's in the top section okay so border radius and then we're going to give it one of 10 pixel let's see how this looks okay it looks much better much much much much much better okay okay awesome so i say we save that and then we need to somehow for example put this apply now button make sure it's always that at the bottom jesse yeah how do we do that let's go to the bottom section let me go ahead and remove that and put the bottom section so if we write let's let i think let's do an inside inspect element so if i inspect them on this one let's see let's see what we got here because that's how i like to do it so right so if you look at our code guys okay our goal is is the following we need to make sure that this portion right here is always at the bottom right because right now it's kind of not it's kind of yeah you know right oh so we have to stick it there's the top there's a role name the description right there's buttons so all these different things are kind of there right which is great but the problem needs to be the fact that the planar button needs to be kind of below so the one thing i think we did is let me let me check this so the one thing we did is i know you had this center let me see if that fixes anything doesn't really fix doesn't really fix too much no jesse um a little bit but i think it still depends on the height of the description to be honest okay so we got that portion let me see i'm trying to understand what is the best way i do this i think what we can do is kind of like for the button section actually no i think i might have an idea we can also pull the buttons down to the edge of the tile description what if we do for description we do flex scroll one right there oh hey yeah that's oh yeah yeah okay that makes sense to do that yeah right there you see yeah so guys let's see let's let's show you for real okay so like this okay that way you can really see what's happening right so let me let me go to show the code guys okay let me show you guys the code so let's go back to description right here okay so as you can see now this is all like this it's all changing right it's all weird but if we give this a flex grow so it can get all of the space that it needs yeah it always is going to push basically this to the bottom you see that's what's going to happen guys it's all going to push at the bottom to the bottom which will make the button is always the bottom do you see that right there you guys see that yes yes yes everybody good good good good so that's kind of how we make it work right it's i know it's a little cool things like that that make things really really happen and make things so simple guys right right awesome sweet so i kind of like that one thing i'm really curious why is the apply now button is jumping up and down that's so weird let me see so let me go inspect them on this apply now button so right click on this one inspect them on this button so apply now space between this is good display flex margin top do we have in the apply now button we also have this background color align item center which is great i want to understand why it's not chichi to true that's so weird is it because when we're in the hover is there a hover different hover state for this one so let me try put the hover on this one so if i do on the hover do we change the font size at all no i'm just curious no we don't maybe it's just on my end though i see this that's interesting i don't think it's not like a good deal guys right not that big of a deal okay let's see so guys here's what we got we've got all of these specific things right here it's looking pretty pretty great we have a ui developer we have a freelance data data let's look at this a lot of amazing jobs so the question becomes is how do we go ahead how do we go ahead and filter these jobs when i go and search for something here how do i filter for this guys right how do i filter for this for this thing what do you guys think somebody said there's an issue with that then i don't think so you guys sure just make for the dot then make sure you guys are returning the fetch right here if you if your dot then is not working properly you need to do a return right here and you do the return right here because the data gets returned from kind of like here you see that so make sure you do that okay guys awesome we got that portion the next portion is gonna be the following how do we filter it well let's go ahead and go back to our script.js we have the jobs function we have everything let's go ahead and now do the filter jobs function guys all right oh the filter job that's interesting i know so let's go ahead what'd i just do yeah let's go ahead do that so we'll do function and we'll do filter jobs okay filter jobs and then so that's the font it's going to filter based on whatever we typed into here guys understood good and the filter javascript are going to pass in two things one is going to be the text we searched for so it's going to be the jobs which is the list of jobs that we can filter through and then the search text and this preference as you guys know these are parameters that we can pass into the function right because parameters are very important right these are parameters we can pass into the function okay awesome after this here's what we'll do okay let's go filter for them so here's what we'll say because the search text you need to see if that matches up with data inside of a job of course that's right that's right so so we have search text continue in place okay there's something inside the search search button in the search input let's go and filter through it so we'll do let filtered items is equal to the following so pay attention to this portion is really cool jobs dot filter that filter es6 has a filter function guys has a filter function so e6 so jos.filter and we'll do the following we'll do job and let's and what this allows us to do is this allows to figure out basically here return true here's what happens here return true if we want to keep this job right otherwise return false so basically it's going to go through the list of jobs and we're going to figure out the proper if statements to say hey which ones to include as paul part of filtered items right here okay or filter jobs i want to say filter jobs okay so let's do this we'll do the following we'll do if so here tell me guys what are some things we're going to check through when we filter the job what are some days we're going to check this for example let's say you let's say you type in the company name what do we filter what do we check through in that case inside here what do we check through guys what do you guys know tile description that's correct a sheet that's correct so title and description so we're gonna check through the role name right the type what else we're gonna check through what else we can do location as well that's right we can do content company megan says yes yeah we can do not id because we don't want to check through id guys we don't really know what ids ids of the companies are right the role name the company so let's do that here's what i'll do first i'm going to say if right if and this is going to be a big gif guys okay big gif if job for example dot role name that i'm going to convert the role name to lower case okay to lower case right because we're going to search through the lowercase portion of this i'm going to make this a little bit bigger so you guys can see too lower case when i check hey does this includes includes what search text search text so if i search for example for full time okay it's going to go through the role name of every single jobs inside here or let's just say i search for you know pekka developer i'm not sure what that is that's really interesting let's search for pekka developer i have no idea that it is but let's say i swear through it you're a clever developer exactly that's what we are hey right there right so if you let's say you stir through it it's going to find it's going to look for a job with the role name where the load where the role name matches that search text right so either if that's true or let's just say that something else is true or obviously or a job dot let's just say maybe the type is the same so job.type dot to lower case right that includes what the search text as well right again or or what job.type.what job.company right company dot to lowercase right that includes the search text or what type well i think that's about it well we have the description as well oh one so job dot if i go to my data json description is where inside the requirements that content or java the requirements thank you jesse to lowercase that includes search text you're right that's right right this is a humongous big if function and then we're going to create the brackets for that function and basically here's what it says if any of that stuff is true we will go ahead and return true wait wait wait wait because you started typing it just started starting to do weird things so i'm like it will return true right and basically for that job it will include that job as part of filtered jobs so for example if i go ahead let's go and then otherwise however if it does not including that stuff it will else it'll return false that's right between false you see and so this at this point we've got the filter jobs right here right we've got the voltage drops what do we do with those filter drops well we can return them so let's go and return return the filter jobs right there okay right however however here we have if there is no search text so if there is no search text else let's let's say you put nothing in the search text we're going to return all the jobs to you so i'm going to say all what else else uh return return the jobs that we get from here return jobs because we're returning now to filter jobs right now what's up we're returning to filter jobs mmhmm right but this is still it's only data that's right that's right so i think we still need to make a step on how to show these filtered jobs am i correct that's right so let's try that so let's for now let's go ahead if i for example remember that guys when we filter their jobs we'll filter them where through here right so if i click on something we get our search text here so let's for example let's now actually try it out so i'm going to say let filter jobs right the filter jobs but actually before that we do we need to do get the job so let's do uh get jobs right dot then and hopefully this works for you guys too we'll do the jobs right so get job is gonna go get the data from here right again we're gonna get it from here and then we'll do let filtered jobs is equal to filter jobs whereas our first parameter is what the jobs okay correct so we're gonna put the jobs inside here so we'll say jobs and where's this coming from from here so it's gonna go like this it's going from here to here right from here to here that's how data right now is being passed around okay awesome so now we go ahead and and then what is it what is so if this is our first parameter what do you guys think is our second parameter tell me what is our second prime what do you guys think tell me what is it search text that's right the search text so we'll say the text is right here so we'll do text that's right so yeah i know cool right so yeah super cool and now let's go ahead and console.log that just so we see console.log filtered jobs let's see now guys yeah so guys this all happens upon that click upon a blue button find job when you have put a search input in there a search text that's right okay if i go ahead you can see i click on this this triggers that which then we do the get jobs right here okay let's see so if i go ahead and inspect them on this one if i do console if i let's just say we say uh what should we search for guys tell me what you want front end developer let's do let's do front end so we'll do front front end yeah fine job oh we got two jobs look look two jobs look one one from springbok i.t and the other one from michael page guys look at that how cool is that we just filtered through them and now since we filtered through them let's go ahead and show them right so what do we do so what do should we do we need to call in here guys what do you guys think tell me what do you think we need to call in here what do you guys think what do you what do you need to call in here huh hmm anybody nice good good good good show jobs show jobs right here and inside the show jobs remember the show jobs takes in a list of jobs so we pass in now the filtered ones filtered because before remember here when we do get jobs which is this gets this gets called when we first initiate our whole application right this gets called that right right exactly yeah yeah yeah so show jobs and then um we're passing in the full jobs right so this gets us all the jobs right here the first no wait wait rewind so indeed first we're going to be calling get jobs right here yes that's right get jobs and then we're going to pass the data from get jobs to show jobs and show jobs will just show all of the jobs at that time from the json file that's right jesse once we have filtered something or at least once we made a search input we click on a button find job that's when again get jobs will first be called because we're first going to get that whole json object and through there we're going to be filtering because we're calling there the filter jobs function indeed nas because we're passing there the jobs and the search input that's right we're going to get something back and that is being shown by using the show jobs function how cool is that guys so now how cool is that if i select front end for example let's just say i do front end right and i searched fine job oh look at that you see that's the power of having functions you see because this show javascript will place the html from the java whatever you pass in when we filter them that's we pass in so find out now if i empty it again there you go okay look how cool is that yeah i know right that's so cool okay what else for example let's go ahead and like for example let's go through maybe um ui device oh remote remote remote remote fine job look at that oh that's right sick so sick i love that about being a software developer though that i can just work remote the best part that's the best part awesome so look that is pretty pretty awesome so we got that okay look at that we got that now at this point we can say we're done but are we but are we done yet or no she said no not done let's make this more friendly oh yeah yeah let's do it let's do it jesse yeah let's do it because guys what do you need in order to make this mobile friendly you guys know this melissa's like let's go it's on fire baby let's go hey all right let's add those media queries guys okay you just go look hairy baby so look let's think about this so here's what you guys to pay attention to when you make something mobile friendly okay let's go ahead and start minimizing this at which point do we think it is not user friendly anymore i think at this point like at around i think around a thousand a thousand pixels let's go and see so if i for example here's how we can test it here so do you guys like the way this looks right now or no yes or no tell me in the comments because his semi is very specific he says 960 pixel okay so look if i go to jazz container instead of doing so let's remove this for now okay instead of doing template columns i'm going to say instead of three let's just say make it with two yeah oh see that's a bit too that's a bit too large i don't like that either so i think it's when we get to around nine 20 see 920 pixels right because for example from here let's say it's still three for example let's make it three let's do three yeah it's still kind of usable it's not bad okay it's still kind of usable not bad at all okay oh it's very small though yeah it's okay we can we can always yeah that's still not bad right so let's do maybe at around what what do we say 920 pixels right 920 pixels or actually let's do 940 and 40. so let's do 940 pixels so let's go to media query inside i style the css let's go down so immediate so do you have so let's go to media craze right here okay so just maybe you can help me out with kindle's media queries i'm getting the code for a second here yeah i'm looking it up i'm searching it for you yeah so let's go to our style.css and what did you say you want to apply it on on the jobs list right correct that's right so do we have the media queries here jesse yeah where is it i don't see it no no i'm gonna add it now oh okay so go ahead yeah yeah so but instead of a min with i'm gonna do max with where are you typing and a line hundred and one oh i'm sorry i'm not at the bottom media queries are usually at the bottom of the css sheet that's right so at the bottom that's right oh nice what are you doing i'm just scrolling down i know okay oop there we go max with i'm gonna say 9 40 did you say 9 40 9 30 actually 9 30 oh got it yes and media screen or yeah that's good and here we want to do something about jobs list right so there instead of we have that's a grid so what we want to do is instead of having it in three columns we want to change it into two columns that's right into two so two one fr that's right let's go ahead and save that that's right awesome so now let's let's and for also let's go back to our grid let's remove this rose we don't need that right now so let's remove this rose for now okay we don't need that at this point okay awesome and i kind of also want to have a fixed height for this kind of stuff but that's fine it kind of works it kind of works like this right now that's fine all right but it's fine so remove the columns now if i for example guys here's what you'll see if i now go ahead scroll past 9 30 nothing's happening what do you think is the case what do you think is the case because it's not on the jobs list guys units and the jobs continue to change so you see this right here so copy this jobs container let's scroll down instead of jobs yeah there we go thank you jesse so save that boom right there so look so three now go down to two oh and at which point do we go down to one what do you guys think still two still two what's which point six hundred well let's go to seven we're stating there right so do the same thing now let's go to 600 and now we can go down to just one one column one column that's right guys how cool is this oh my god i love this portion i love my i'm guessing you guys are like yeah let's go template repeat on the far so let's save that oh look at this and we've got ourselves a mobile friendly responsive job search application guys that my friends is it that's it you've done it look at that you can go with some more friendly it's beautiful it's functioning look at this if i clear this out and i click find jobs i see all of them which is awesome i know it's so cool i can go back down to more friendliness guys this is pretty pretty pretty awesome i'm excited did you guys enjoy this yes or no you guys enjoy it yeah yeah beautiful that's what i'm talking about hey yes yes yes yes everybody enjoyed it guys i love the fact that you're all in there that's cool guys that's pretty much it from us let me look at the homer what happened over the homework now oh i know oh what is that color why is it so pink or blue hey let's go awesome guys so that's pretty much it let's now go into the homework guys this is a very very important very important okay for us so let's go ahead and do this let me remove how do i remove this background color of this of this this is what is this um go to the three dots now click on the yeah click on background exactly okay okay

that's gonna be like the cherry on your eyes you know it's chocolate cherry topping on your eyes you know right so on this whole challenge so you want to be there because if you are planning to make a portfolio well tomorrow you're going to be hearing how you can make the most use out of that in order to land your job okay so very very important that you guys join tomorrow okay other than that who has any questions come on any questions any questions hey so megan hi megan so i'm gonna let you go ahead and mute yourself so ask to unmute let's go ahead and put you in a spotlight hey hi megan how you doing great things um i'm doing good um i've been keeping up with you as you're coding okay and i'm doing fine on the html and css and i can debug it and i'm really feeling confident with that javascript i'm i'm keeping up with you but some things aren't functioning quite right and i'm having difficulty debugging right are there sites or somewhere that um are like legitimate or good resources in order to help me learn how to debug better because who's trusted and who yeah like which ones make the most sense yeah so that's a very good question because that's also part of debugging but nas you go ahead first yeah i'm actually you go ahead you had you have something to say go ahead so um debugging is a skill okay as a developer is one of the most important skills actually so megan this is an excellent um question because ninety percent of the time when you're coding you're actually debugging yeah right right so what i tell my students first of all first of all when you're debugging or when you have an error what happens is often you go sort of like in a panic state right you're like i got the error you go like that okay if your bug if you know your bug is really bad however okay so you got to pull yourself out of that emotional state first of all that's always my first tip okay i'm a performer and a middle school choir director so i'm pretty good in those situations like stay calm awesome exactly so we're gonna go into a problem solving modus right i always start with this question what do i know and what do i not know what do i know for sure and what do i not know that i know for sure too okay and i write that down so in your case and always for number one rule also start at the start so even though you know you have a bug somewhere in your code deeper in always go to the start where is it really and then that's where you're going to be logging so it's always with with code you know it's always making a hypothesis like if i'm logging this i'm expecting this is that coming out of it yes okay next step is that coming out of it yes oh that one is not coming out of it oh okay i need to go back yeah back up a little bit so that's how it goes and it's really it's a skill you know to keep your head um level to keep yourself levelheaded to stay calm under a deadline to be fast at solving it resources that's all part of it yeah okay so if you're being challenged by this and you're seeing yourself like oh my god i'm at this stage congratulations you're doing an excellent job because you're growing as a person as a developer so i want that to stand out to everybody if you're having trouble doing that but you're you have solved something you should celebrate that's right okay you should celebrate you should go so that said megan what is a good what are good resources well you got to go step by step um and to be honest i use for example a few bible or like a cheat sheet so w3schools mdn mozilla free code free code camp and also people kind of underestimate this as a developer i don't know it's because i did a career situation i learned things different but i write things down even about my code like hey what what is actually happening here how did i how did i go how did i go to see if i started a well i have to pass b right so where where's my b at so i am trying to retrace and backtrack my logic does this help for you okay yeah that that makes sense so more of a flow chart so because because it's a lot there's so many streams of logic that it's hard to figure out which stream of logic is right particular bug and so that makes sense to have a flow chart yeah so it kind of yeah figure out where in the stream i went wrong exactly so especially with this job search right always start at the start so what is the story a user pops in he or she puts something into the input presses the find button which function gets fired office first okay the get jobs function okay get jobs function what does it get jobs to do that's the filter jobs function filter jobs function oh i got the filter jobs hey now we're going to show jobs show jobs function yeah so that is your logic and then that is so from there you're going to micromanage okay what's happening inside of those functions and how can i console log certain results okay so i'm because i think my mind is i'm debugging it like in html where i'm taking like this division or this section and trying to and that actually makes more sense where it's debugged by function yeah and then it's going to make more sense with each okay yeah that actually feels very helpful that turned on the light bulb yeah yeah so it's a function but it's also the user story i always go back to what's the goal of your app the goal of your app is actually the goal of your code guys the goal of your app is a solution right so i always start like what is my goal why why am i doing this and i i actually just sometimes i'm also overwhelmed right i just start at the start and i just start reasoning yeah and that's when i find out things actually i don't remember i don't memorize everything to be honest i don't i do have a pretty good memory but i don't memorize it because i just go through things to a certain workflow so it's just practice okay debugging is a learnable skill don't forget that yeah don't forget that okay yeah it's it's like kind of like jesse said it really is practice and like megan how long have you been doing javascript now just curious okay so i'm gonna tell on myself agree in communication technology in 2005. okay and i have not coded since really i have been teaching middle school and so we'll bring you go ahead and and this was back in the day where notebook was the only editor no way no book notepad like we literally html and css i'm used to doing that and figuring out those bugs okay but javascript is another animal that yeah i'm just trying to i'm tr i'm i think i'm trying to treat it too much like html and cms css yeah and i have to debug it differently and i got to tell you i'm in love with these editors that like pop things in for you like awesome that's awesome and honestly though i think for you right because i know you're trying to debug stuff right i think for you you kind of want to go more to the beginning like okay all right now i think for you it's not so much about the debugging it's so much about knowing the fundamentals of javascript right right and that's what i'm saying i don't know where to go yeah that's a legitimate source to step me through like the very basics of this is how a function flows that's right that's right right so so there's a few resources okay so the fundamentals guys are the most important things so free code camp has a lot of amazing fundamentals right it's a free resource for you guys to use literally go to free code and then i think it's a section called like web developer and there's like a section for like javascript you know section for that so just type in basics and you will get a bunch of answers and they'll literally go through like the most basic stuff you can actually learn right so that's very important right so free code game is great um we also have a lot a javascript crash course on youtube completely free as well right right so there's some really good resources there um like i said there's a lot of tutorials a lot of tutorials out there you know for you guys to learn the basic javascript stuff tomorrow you know i'll mention this as well tomorrow is always you guys will i'm not sure if you're interested potentially enjoying our coding boot camp that's what we teach you guys as well we teach you guys the fundamentals as well so there'll be a chance for you guys to see if you're potentially if you you might want to do something like that too right that will be tomorrow but yeah on the free side i think it's a free code kiln one um the youtube one youtube was great um and that's your guys's youtube right yeah that's another thing is when you search there's like 50 bazillion yeah i know some of these might be junk i don't know i know we have a javascript crash course literally it's called a little josh it's literally eight hours long oh i'm somebody just put it in the chat yeah i'm gonna open yeah that's great thank you so much hours long megan okay and okay that's but most importantly make it is you want to a little bit that you want those fundamentals you want to get those down really really well right yeah don't rush yourself into too many crazy things like please don't go into react js right now please don't the biggest mistake that a lot of people make you know so guys if you've been doing react js without having fundamental knowledge in javascript i will come looking for you she will come and hide you she'll hunt you down so yeah that's the most important and then after you learn some of the mentos as you learned it start applying that kind of stuff because when you start learning this kind of stuff on the tutorial section you might find yourself in the tutorial hell portion so yeah so make sure you don't get that far you know towards that so learn the fundamentals start building projects some kind of projects with those fundamentals and then you can kind of level up to the next section even if they're just like completely like useless just for fun projects just build something that applies that skill 100 yes yes because that's what you do as developers is you we're just building stuff right and so right now like you like think about it ask any developer right now who's probably like who's seen our stuff before right i talk to a lot of people so does jesse a lot of developers and the pattern goes like this a lot of our students will watch a lot of tutorials they will build the projects they've got the amazing react.js projects they've got the amazon clone and the uber clone and the netflix store and then whatever clone and then me clone whatever it's gonna be you know they can't apply it to anything else no they can't okay when i that's not what i want i want to actually understand what i'm doing because the whole point is not to build a project the point is to understand how to build it yes yeah you're on the money let me give this to you yeah exactly you run the money on this one so that's what you focus on is those fundamentals the answers does that make sense yes yes that does and once you've got once you've got the fundamentals that's why for example we teach like fundamentals so much like for example you know we teach like and we teach crazy fundamentals literally for two months straight i we have i have students who come in with like react js knowledge right and i teach the fundamentals so you're like they're like oh is this really what javascript is you know like everything like two months of it which is like literally variables functions right we do crazy stuff like stacks queues data structures you know algorithms all just fundamentals okay yeah that's what i want you're getting so good at that yeah that it's kind of like when you for example you know you know like when you're learning a new language right and you learn those fundamental things in the language right then other stuff just becomes easier right yes 100 like i said i teach music first once you understand those fundamentals and you can put them together in a million different ways the rest of it's just like it doesn't matter what it is you just know how to fit how they fit together exactly that's it okay so i need to go back to learning quarter notes yeah yeah so when it comes to code indeed you actually gotta look at the code and be like hey which tone is this yeah c d f e or which is a minor or is it a major or you know approaching like that yeah awesome okay okay the help up thank you yes that got it yes very much thank you are we gonna see you tomorrow 11 pst absolutely okay let's do it okay thank you thank you megan okay hi back get a question wait hold on back hi back how are you doing wait there's there's two people hold on back go ahead back i can't hear you i love you guys ah thank you we love you too well okay no i think i watched one of your videos last night okay and you mentioned that as long as you get like the fundamentals of math or something that i mean it's like i have something called math character how about math disorder i can't remember the numbers school back in my school math don't worry i cannot i can also i said i said fundamentals of javascript maybe back okay because isn't that a part of the logic part of learning javascript and all these other things that i want to learn no i can use a calculator yes well if you need to calculate something with numbers you can use a calculator but you don't need you don't need to calculate anything you don't need math back i have i had a student i had a student it's so funny i had a student who was actually um he was learning math to get into coding i'm like what are they doing like why are you doing that like yeah because you know you need to know math i'm like no you don't because if you think more realistically go ahead back no i was just gonna ask why why don't you need to know at least like basic math well let me ask you this today did we use math yeah really i mean i can do like percentages and if it's got something to do with money then i'm all on it but other than that no no did we use did you need to be a fulltime programmer doing that did we use math lab yesterday i was so confused yesterday i ain't even gonna lie but i wasn't feeling good neither so that hinders my brain sometimes so um we didn't use math yesterday either but yes marcus said we did use minus n plus one oh okay sorry we use subtraction and we use addition algebraic ends and so all right so the ends don't worry so much about that the end stuff that's like we don't use that too much at all like the main thing you need to understand is like okay like in math yes subtraction addition multiplication division you know that kind of stuff you need to know but honestly apart from that that's pretty much it honestly apart from that like you would need to most importantly need to learn is like how do you loop through an array how to loop in a list like you need to understand like what is a variable and how is the variable stored in a computer right like that stuff is a lot more valuable than knowing how to do logarithms you know what i mean it isn't wait don't y'all teach the uh so can i ask you a question algorithms we do yes what oh okay why was the word algorithm no no i said i said logarithms log right but when i hear algorithms which i think you all see from the the camp right yeah i think math and that i mean not math it's not math it's not math no it's not math at all algorithms yes it includes some like addition multiple like stuff like that but algorithms is actually about using logic and different data structures so for example math is about okay addition subtraction getting things together removing things it's about solving a problem it's about solving like for example how do i get to a certain number right like that's that's what math is about it's about how do i get to a certain number right with yeah with algorithms it's actually about how do i produce certain results that looks in a certain way right so for example a lot of times for example you might have like maybe for example in an algorithm for example for example in algorithms there is a simple uh thing we do for example which is like um you have a matrix a matrix is basically like a in multiple rows of arrays right you have a matrix of that and you want to think about okay and i want to get a diagonal difference between the whole matrix i know it's probably like weird right now right but what is that there no difference it's basically you have a matrix that goes like this and your goal is to be able to loop through the matrix in a way where you can get the sum of the numbers that you have the one diagonal the sum of another diagonal and subtract them they'll sum and subtract the sum you see okay that's an algorithm you see for example another algorithm might be for example hey you know what to create a recursive function that will print out fibonacci numbers now fibonacci is actually part of math you guys know fibonacci right yeah so fibonacci is basically like it's like it's like a built up stack so for example for example let's just say you have number one and three the next fibonacci number is one plus two which is four the one after that is going to be three plus four which is seven but for that it's going to be four plus seven which is going to be 11. so you see where and the the last two numbers we're adding them together does that make sense so and we and so that's what algorithms are about math we don't use much of that right we use a lot more logic behind hey how do you use an array hey how to use a binary tree okay and how do we create a certain result you know using that binary tree you know what i mean stuff like that so i'm scared for nothing yeah you're scared for nothing well good thing relieves your scaredness yeah yeah because yeah it's not it's not math back it's like i i have i have students who no idea what like like math like are you kidding me like what is your what is your background back if i may ask what did you did you study anything or what's your current job currently i am on disability right now and i desperately want to get off from it um but i've went i've got some college courses behind me but um i haven't really worked except for my exhusband in the last 20 years um gotcha okay okay okay gotcha so yeah so look math is not the most important thing for you honestly you just want to focus on learn those fundamentals of javascript okay learn fundamentals start to build that logic and just start building stuff because coding is about building you're a builder that's who you are you're a builder back yeah and a creator like the creator said yesterday yeah and the creator um and so that's part go ahead no i was just going to tell megan to go to y'all's website there is a like a mini bootcamp of html or something that's uh javascript or something that i got into oh the prophet saws yeah yeah okay awesome well not not just that one but there was like there's a free thing that i got into oh yeah okay yeah i'm like okay i don't know about it but that's awesome man either i found it earlier okay okay so go check it out girl come out of program.com it's all there awesome did you were you less confused today was that they will say a little better yes okay oh but what can we use like well i don't know what like an api is really i mean i know the concept of it but i don't know how to like apply it or anything so i know you so i know i know you join profit javascript your learning api is there but an apis is called application application interface it's an application program interface and it's kind of like for example think about like this right when you for example it's when you for example um how did i say this when you order something on amazon right how do you think amazon knows about your order the computer tells it yeah a computer tells it but tells what tells to who to the provider then no necessarily yeah but how does that work that's right but how does that work out how where's the bridge between you and the factory that's where the api would come in at yeah right okay why couldn't we find does not like indeed or monster or last door do they not provide api they eat or we can make our own little desktop and not always have to go to their thing that's what i was thinking yeah so they don't provide apis because they want to keep the data for themselves and it makes sense right they want to release it to everybody oh yeah yeah so api will allow you guys a public api will allow everybody to use their data unfortunately we don't have that so we couldn't use that right so and yeah so i i kept i kept trying to search for different apis i just couldn't find any honestly but yeah there are companies that have apis there's a there's a weather apis a bunch of weather apis there's a bunch of different guys that you can like public ones that you can use that give you like free data to use okay like search up free public apis and then you'll see on google well i know about like the the weather ones and um there's a couple other ones that i've seen earlier because i have this idea of something that i want to make and it involves apis oh that's awesome okay so um um would like instagram and youtube do they have like aps oh youtube does youtube does okay you got it awesome back awesome are we gonna see you tomorrow back oh yes ma'am thank you awesome back all right we'll see you tomorrow okay back thank you all right i'm not going to where i don't want to see one of the questions you never know where i can learn okay okay awesome how are you doing how are you doing sit lana go ahead feel free to ask a question right here oh so many ladies hi hi julana how are you i'm fine how are you it was great today i i really enjoyed the your program there that's awesome thank you glad you enjoyed it you have a question do you have a question for us yes i do have a question uh my question is um okay i was uh it's actually from my job i used to work in the company which is ecommerce and they had the book honors based uh website and i was making a lot of product pages and all that where so but it wasn't wasn't my setup it was the setup of lead developer who just needed help someone to help him with them without product pages and all that okay which is which is not coding at all okay so the question was from uh my job or from from the bus from my previous job is it possible to create a website let's say in html or any kind of uh you know as a platform a hard coded website where people can put products in the in the basket and and then that fulfillment goes the basket the entire thing that is in the basket goes to that woocommerce store that company owns let's say if i want to clear create an affiliate website and uh that has a calculator let's say how much energy do i need to spend uh do i spend during the summer time and how much solar power do i need how much battery do i need for um for my solar setup and let's say people would use that calculator on my website right uh they would calculate let's say it would come up to several batteries of certain kind and that information would go directly in that that's uh in the my cart on my website would be stored in in cash and also this information would be would go directly to book honors and where people would you basically check out their purchase okay so so so okay so i understand what you're saying so you're saying basically you have a website let's just say it's your own website it's an affiliate website what just happened here oh you have an affiliate website right right and it and it's let's say that what let's say the domain of that website is website let's just say that so your domain correct right you have another website that's a woocommerce website is that right another one and that one is for example is like celana's woocommerce let's just say that's another domain correct right so there's two different domains right one is a woocommerce one one is a landing page just for you correct right okay and so you're trying to do is that for example when i when somebody clicks add to cart right on your website it adds to cart on your website and also on the woocommerce is that what is that what's going to do uh it actually in a cut on my website and that information is sent to the cart of that woocommerce the the main website that does the main checkout function so basically the i'm just an accommodate and the uh the owner of the website of the woocommerce website is uh is the one who gets you know who sells the product and i let's say as a affiliate i provide websites that let's say uh provide let's say calculations for your recipe or calculations for whatever that you need to build a setup who it yourself set up and it would uh send the all this information of the products let's say my website would say uh sell or suggest certain products and uh that is stored let's say a customer a user checks out all those you know all those products through my setup that i make on my own website and then this information from the cache was directly in the part of that book owners uh and uh the the oil checkout sink is in woocommerce uh not on your side romanian website where they process all their purchasing for all the clients for all the users but my website is an affiliate website it doesn't sell anything but it lets the users to select the products and then check out the actual purchase of those products that are already collected in a cart and that cart is being transferred to that book honors and then it's been processed in the website on on that main website that was a question of my boss at my previous job that i couldn't answer but i don't work there anymore but however for myself i would like to know how to do that because that's a way that's a very interesting uh thing to do yeah yeah so so i've really enough i i i haven't used woocommerce but i have used a different ecommerce application before um so because there's two domains it gets really hard to communicate between two of them right so it becomes really because there's two domains it's like two different websites like having two different houses okay um so the only way you could do that where you have the product on one site and the checkout on another site is if you if woocommerce actually gives you an api to use so woocommerce i'm not sure if they do or not but if they have an api where for example you can send information to that website and it will populate the data based on what the url is for example because the url can have a lot of data in there so so here's how it looks like for example let's say you have let's say let's just say this okay so yes it's possible it's possible so let's just say that you for example have you know you have your cart on your site right and it has a list of products and every product has an id like a a barcode right it's a it's an id a number right when you click checkout the url of the checkout will take you to the woocommerce site right yes but the url will also have the data of the ids that are in your cart so we'll have for example for example let's just say your woocommerce site is called setlana's commerce let's just say that right so the slide will look like this it will be so when you click checkout it will take you to svetlana's commerce.com yes question mark products equals and then you have all the ids of those products and the use of products and then on the woocommerce site you will have to install some kind of cost to customization you will have to do some kind of customization to where you will look at those ids in the url and you will populate the cart based on those ids so is it possible yes does it require some custom custom coding yes it's almost like for example you are it's like for example let's say you have two different houses right and then let's say you just you um let's say for example you have some recipes right let's say the first house has the ingredients the second house is going to use those ingredients to actually do something with them and actually cook so what you will do is of course is you will go over you will walk you will take the ingredients into a basket right and you you will walk out to the next house the next house will take those ingredients and they will actually make something out of that right right that's literally what you're doing is in the url is you're putting the ingredients in there in the url which the ingredients are the ideas of the products themselves does that make sense it makes a lot of sense thank you so much you got it but this that does require custom coding but in coding pretty much anything is possible i mean except a few things would like to learn how to do that and i would like to make that project happen do it do it make it happen make it happen i think it's really really cool it's a really cool it's a really cool um yeah it's a really really cool problem to solve i like that i like problems like that thank you thank you awesome did you enjoy did you enjoy the past few days yes oh yes a lot [Laughter] are we able to change were you here and were you able to build the projects too yes yes i was following along i was building the pro projects the only reason i didn't submit my coffee shop is because i want to turn it into the ecommerce for my own product oh my god gotcha gotcha awesome well nexus we'll see you tomorrow at 11am okay oh yes thank you byebye byebye byebye all right guys let's go ahead and do a few let's go 10 more minutes of questions and q and a's hola how are you i see you're asking a question go ahead hola i see you waving go ahead hold up hi how are you doing i'm fine and you i'm doing amazing you have a question look at that smile wow no three questions oh my three questions let's go let's do two let's do two questions pick two best questions okay first i want to say uh i'm so excited from the beginning of this bootcamp thank you i love you guys love you jesse i love your motivation thank you so much okay my first question is before this bootcamp i entered a beginner bootcamp i learned the basis and now in javascript i use angular framework is angular is uh good and should i continue in this or i have to change to react library or use another one so now i'm confused what are you what are you using angular for what are you using angular for i do you have a job right now for that using angular now i'm uh i'm doing like training training ah okay gotcha gotcha gotcha i mean look if you're doing angular that's fine gotcha gotcha if you're a learning angler that is okay you can keep learning angular because it's still a good framework to learn right and you start it and most importantly what you want to understand is do not skip those basic javascript things that you need to learn right like i said a lot too many people skip the step of like learning some basic javascript and they go to the framework right away so okay sure learn angular but also make sure that you're learning those fundamentals of javascript and those basic javascript things okay like how do i create a function in javascript how do i use an array in javascript how do i loop through it so that's the one big thing one big thing i recommend for you is to just keep that in mind but you don't need to switch to react.js right now that's that should not be your goal okay that means angular now is better it's good yeah it's good it's good it's good okay my second question is i start this uh full stack path because my future goal is to be a devil okay expert okay and now i want uh some advices to continue in this bath and just for you because i want some advices so advice is on what and how to get to what to devops or or what css oh devops the what future goal reach people devops also development operations ah yes yes yes i want to be an expert okay awesome so have you done devops before no it's my first okay okay so look so do you know do you know devops includes a lot of things like servers and stuff like that do you do you know that or yes okay awesome sweet so if you want to to do that i think you should start doing devops right now because right now you're learning like javascript and stuff like that which is great right but you should not wait to learn devops like you can start learning devops right now you can start learning how to build servers right now you see what i mean okay right so keep learning what you're learning but also start put start going into a little bit of devops section as well hola okay there's a lot of for example trainings on devops on youtube and stuff like that so start going into that okay okay okay got it awesome any other questions yeah i know yes i want to say thanks still got it you got it you got it i hope you enjoyed it okay yes awesome thank you thank you thank you yes okay anyway any questions let me see what a quite a question here elliot you had a question about ellie if you're trying to guys if you're trying to ask a question guys make sure you have a camera on it because i can't see you guys if you have a question though then if uh nicole said can i ask a question in chat sure nicole go ahead nicole can someone upload the tick tock game to github we have the titan game together and github we do have it by the way we have to take that game and github we should i think we posted uh in the homework post it was in the homework post yeah no i don't think so but i can do that i can upload all of the projects um from the first day the second day and the third day and put them into facebook how about that guys yeah we actually have it on github if you will just post a link we have them all on github we'll just post the links to them okay we'll post them on facebook awesome doing sweet sweet sweet uh elliot if you had a question please make sure you have your thing turned on but otherwise it won't be able to get to you uh venura you had a question go ahead yes uh first of all uh thank you so much can you hear yeah i can hear you yeah first of all thank you so much i'm so excited uh from the beginning of the quarter i have two questions uh i have uploaded uh homework two times uh that tick tock talk games okay uh because uh first of all i uploaded uh with the basic stuff and then only i have put the dark mode into it and i reupload it uh i want to know is it okay yeah that's completely fine yeah completely fine yeah thank you yeah uh i want to know that when when we are searching something uh can we split uh speak the user's words uh and put them into a carrot and uh uh make those uh the spaces removed and all the stuff like the python like python so is there any real keyword or function to split a string into an array that's just going to say yeah i want to split uh the user's words into an array and i want to search uh through the word by word and then then at least one uh job vacancy will be there to the user yeah there's actually a split function in javascript just just just check that one out okay yeah okay sure okay awesome is there any api to find jobs uh i looked into it it's really hard to get them it's really hard to get those apis i looked at every api it's pretty much very very impossible i mean it's possible but indeed indeed has an api but you have to get approved by it so like it takes days to get approved yeah yeah uh thank you again you guys are amazing uh at this point uh the time is uh 3 am

previous challenges the five day challenge before or other events you know there's there's a there's a big story behind this whenever you guys are having these kind of challenges there's something from my school coming up challenging me more uh like the first time you guys did it was my first term exams and then there were midterms and then you know the last time you guys did this challenge they were my final exams so it was all you know the luck was not going around me so this time it was amazing because now i'm having my vacations of summers that's awesome oh right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay great great to hear great thank you so much for comment that's awesome yeah that's it thanks guys you got our friend thank you we'll see you tomorrow okay byebye okay awesome sweet okay next one sold out you had a question we'll take one more question guys and then we'll go guys okay go ahead hi thanks uh thanks for giving me the opportunity yeah first of all thanking you for uh the wonderful sessions you had like this is the first time i attended a boot camp that's awesome i am actually a software engineer i'm working in a legacy uh technology but for the last 11 years oh wow really i'm i'm uh trying to switch to a full stack uh developer role okay so i'm in process of building my profile and it was absolutely helpful extremely helpful that's awesome right where are you from by the way where are you from by the way i'm from india but currently staying in the us in connecticut night oh connecticut oh dang okay that's cool awesome and how long you been here by the way just curious uh almost on a year and a year almost a year okay also you're pretty like because i i came from ukraine right but i've been here for like 10 years now oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i can't i'm i was originally born in ukraine and i came here when i was like nine yeah okay yeah that's great awesome probably you are staying in the west coast right yeah i'm staying the west coast right now in los angeles yeah los angeles yeah yeah so uh just wanted to know like uh like this will you be having any course on react.js any bootcamp covering react.js yeah so so the tomorrow's boot camp tomorrow's um i mean yes of course our boot camp within clever programmer does cover react.js uh but in terms of free boot camp in terms of free boot camp maybe i think next month we'll see maybe next month we'll cover that okay we don't have we don't have another pipeline but we do have we do a lot of videos on youtube from clever programmer on react.js yeah be sure to check those out yeah and just another question is like uh say uh it's been 11 years i'm in a different technology and if i want to switch to uh like full stack you always start as a fresh like a junior developer right but the experience is 11 years so how do you see it like how is the opportunity for folks to easily switch at a yeah so here's what happened here's here's how i see it happening okay you will start out you will learn react.js right you will learn the new technology you will learn foster development you will probably start out as a junior at first at your at a new job but then you'll probably go to a senior within six months okay yeah so basically how is it like you need to get that first kind of like experience and a job using that new technology but once you got it because you have so much experience from all technologies once you've got it you're pretty much set and you can count yourself the same developer and react gs honestly thank you so much thank you so much for the explanation you got it you got it awesome you guys are awesome thank you i'm glad you enjoyed it we'll see you tomorrow okay thank you okay awesome sonny sorry that's a question in the chat some other question let me see what are preex uh please notes what are the prerequisites for react what level of js should you know or when do you know it's time transition so transition will will be fairly easy for example you'll know exactly what tradition is when the transition is right honestly when you go ahead and if i told you a question like hey can you merge two arrays for me together if you could do that okay good transition point if you have built an amazing price with javascript and you know those fundamentals you can build javascript projects from scratch without too much crazy knowledge of trying to look up on google or without too much of you know uh too much of kind of like second guessing yourself like you should know how to create a variable you should know an array is you should know what an object is you should know how the class is you should know how to create and use them in an actual website right if you know all those things that's a good time to transition into into javascript or react gs my bad but if you don't know those things you you don't know those fundamentals then don't push yourself so much into interact.js just yet give yourself time to learn those basics and then you'll be good hopefully that answers yes guys foundation is so so so important imagine it you know you want to build a house right if your foundation if the foundation of the house is not strong then every house you will build from that moment on will always have a weak foundation so your house will always be weak doesn't matter how pretty it looks on the outside with react or some other nice framework it will always have a weak foundation and actually this also because i talked to a lot of students okay i see that they're shooting themselves basically in the foot because they're going they're having this progressing line like oh i know how to take these projects and ah a react project and then i asked them did you know so what kind of data structure is the props in react and they go like or what is the process yeah or what do you do yeah sorry jesse and then they're like it's an object and then they say i don't know what an object is and then i go back and i say like an object is a fundamental javascript concept yeah you should know that first before going into react that's a typical example of somebody that went in to react too fast yeah okay so make sure that doesn't happen to you because you have to go all the way there and then you have to go all the way back which makes you feel like oh i'm at the starting point again i don't know anything which is true you don't know anything at this point i'm sorry to break it to you yeah however that's the whole thing that's the whole thing why we're saying this the whole time your fundamentals are so important so you don't have to go make a detour okay that's a good thing just gotta go like this that's a good point that's a quite that's a good point um so yes what is this best programming uh what is the best program to start with if you are wanting to get serious about programming then the goal to program that allows you to go towards any field i mean jeffrey if i mean i think what we're learning right now in terms of javascript i think that's the best way to start honestly i asked about oh program yeah i mean one is we have a course called prophecy means program language he says i don't know i think that's about the program what is the best program to start with if you are wanting to get serious with programming and then he says sorry program language oh okay yeah javascript is a great start because javascript will allow you to do a lot of different things right you can go from javascript to react gs from javascript then to and then from javascript basically to any angularjs or framework right and once you know those frameworks and pretty much and you know javascript very well then you can actually apply that kind of knowledge to them if you learn a new language like python then jingle and so forth so um i actually think is you know i know somebody said cc plus plus or python maybe those are great too i personally started with javascript that was my first start and then i went from javascript to python so um honestly either way you go python or javascript either way you go you will kind of learn a lot and then that will allow you to apply to your knowledge to many different things the thing is if you look it's kind of like this let me ask this question if i know how to drive a car can i drive any car that i want pretty much especially if i know how to drive a stick shift right if i know how to drive a stick shift i can pretty much drive any car i want no matter what car you give me you give me an automatic car i will drive it you give me another stick shift i'll drive it it's the same situation here yeah yeah learn how to drive the car learn javascript and then the other stuff will be easy somebody said can i drive stick shift yes i can drive a stick shift guys yes i learned in ukraine i was actually thinking like what do you mean by sticks yet but yeah i also drive stick shift yeah yeah but i i no longer have a car that has any gears so my car has one gear only that's it and that's just full speed ahead that's it awesome guys i think that's pretty much it i think that's a rather questions that's pretty much it guys i think guys honestly this was well you had a question back yeah okay okay go ahead hold on go ahead i know i know go ahead back thank you can you hear me yeah i can't hear you you're muted back we could hear you and then the mo there was a moment we couldn't hear you go ahead try again no no you're muted still click unmute there we go yeah there we go okay uh what time is the homework uh do because i i've only got like a little bits and pieces of all of it because i've not been feeling good so what time is it i know it's new like today sometime but what time because i assume that's end of today well what is your end of today uh eleven 11 11 11 pm pst okay because i'm assuming that's how y'all are going to pick the um scholarship person yeah yeah yeah so end of today so but by end of the day i would say got it okay as long as we as long as we modify everything okay got it awesome we'll see you tomorrow okay okay i might be dead by then because i i literally have just like little bits and pieces but i'm going to try to get it all done and get the scholarship just saying okay try it try it try it all right awesome i love it i love it i love the people guys at this point that is it from us guys it was so much fun thank you guys so much for coming on to here guys we'll see you guys tomorrow at 11am pst make sure you come and join again right we're gonna give you the road map the ultimate aroma to becoming a fullstack developer we're going to give you certificates of those who are in the boot camp you guys will get certificates you know showing your completion of the fiveday boot camp so make sure you do the survey make sure you join tomorrow and that's it other than that have yourself an amazing day and we'll see you in the next video
