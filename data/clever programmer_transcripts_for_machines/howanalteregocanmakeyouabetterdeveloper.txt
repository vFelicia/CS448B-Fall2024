versus ego don't be right do right I wrote here I have a very powerful Alter Ego I remember back in 2017 I was just like cozy like you're the best nobody can outwork me my work is the best work because I was a oneman Army I really needed that part of me to be alive I used a lot of that to be able to do the 15 to 16 hours on the nonalter ego side I want to work hard to develop leaders on the team even if it means some of my things get sacrificed and I want to work my face off to bring that out with care and empathy
