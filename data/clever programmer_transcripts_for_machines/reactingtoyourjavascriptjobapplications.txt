what thing is looking good bro the app is looking great let's set that let's go to whoa it looks clean oh that looks good let's click on my anime list and doesn't take me there takes me to my anime list if i go back dude this is a sick app he made we got a bunch of applications there are you that stand out like i kind of didn't really look that much at anybody that didn't submit a video so you must submit a video otherwise there's very little chance we'll review your application hey what's up guys today we're going to clean audio he's using router nice this code is looking good right yeah and he's using like grid components yeah i saw a grid component he's got a good teaching style and it look he's zoomed in just enough yeah and he's using sas uh he's using react context api in a way that we haven't used it before and he's using use history and all the stuff you show oh wow his uh github is looking really clean are you emailing him all yeah i just emailed him and i just uh told him to reach back out and shot on my number who else so then we have uh let's see bradley had a good video as well so we're looking at bradley's code right now and he submitted his application with us and he he did the tesla dude yeah so it's clean dude because we wanted to build this webpage so a good project just go ahead and copy yeah that's a good project to submit to us and we're just kind of kind of skimmed through that yeah using sass i like that he's using react i mean that's bonus points and then um i also like that he's actually on windows right yeah yeah oh yeah yeah because a lot of uh what most of our builds that we've done on mac so this will reach a lot more people yes because i know a lot of the people who watch the channel are on um on are on windows and then he goes through the build it's overall look go back for a sec when you're using important guys um important like unless you're using material ui but any in any kind of css stuff you don't want to use and you don't want to throw around the exclamation mark important and and here um go back to that jquery snippet your favorite jquery so guys wherever we see jquery it's an immediate nogo like we don't want jquery like if you there is always a way to write this stuff with the latest sort of javascript standards so jquery now is phased out it's not in a lot of the packages so it's not actually part of material um no it's not power bootstrap anymore yeah um so it's yeah it's pretty much it's eradicated now so you don't want to be using jquery so if you can go ahead and build something like this again with by using like react and then es6 standards that would be awesome exactly so yeah i would i would uh that's what i would recommend and there's a lot of important stuff going on here yeah i mean there's a lot of uh nested like you see you've got like if you go to line 76 down there's a there is a ton of like i mean in this case if you're targeting this many things maybe i would have just given the same like given one class last name to everything and just target because right now you're doing tons of nesting it's super confused it's very coupled like if i want to change something now it's kind of like where do i change it without breaking stuff yeah so you want to make sure that your selectors are more granular than this yeah you're doing css work yeah exactly so there's some stuff with the code i think that could use improvement yeah overall i like the video in the corner though that's pretty good yeah and the presentation is really well he's well spoken yeah half half is good when you do that so when you show the app that you're working on as well as your code that's always a good sign but one thing i'll say is and it happens with all of us the energy tends to dip when we're talking yeah so try and always keep the energy up that's when you're yeah when you're demoing it yeah that's a big one guys that's big one and also make sure you submit because if you don't submit a video we're probably not even gonna take like we got this one guy right and he just submitted this to us so we don't know what to do with that yeah and also guys somebody submitted a youtube video but it was from 2018 yeah right put in the work shoot a new video yeah um because i'm only taking serious submissions yeah yeah and these are just applications we've gotten we've i have a lot of people dming me on instagram we have a ton of people these are 67 applications that we've gotten and then we have a bunch of people dm'ing on instagram and through email they're submitting applications too but please try to submit your application through this air table yeah um but yeah like send us because everybody everybody that follows us is a developer so if you don't make a video and send it to us like we're gonna like ignore anything else because we're looking for somebody who's looking to create content we're not looking for a software developer to make apps for us right like we're looking for somebody who will produce content for the channel exactly like simply dropping a link to a website that you built and your github is is not going to do anything but we pretty much skip over them um it has to have a video um we saw a few with videos um and those were very good attempts like but the ones that weren't like for example we've gone audio recording it's not gonna do anything guys like anything that we see like that is pretty much gonna go ahead and skip over it so exactly make sure you add a video to that that submission yeah so this is the one that you guys saw us talking about earlier this is the one that we really liked this is sick and he actually does it like a actual youtube video right so he yeah there's an intro to it hey what's up guys today we're gonna go over how to build a website using any api you want today we're going to use the my anime list api as well as we're going to use react.js as our frontend framework to build out the website hope you like it and let's get into it all right guys so the first literally 13 seconds and he's in content like he done the intro very clear intro and and he's framed well as well like he had the framing of the shot pretty good the audio was crisp like and they also skip ahead to his code and his zoom is really good yeah he zooms into the screen so you can actually see the code and the code itself is like pretty good yep really clean code and uh and he shows like a complete build so it's a two hour build um all the way and he uses a bunch of different like he even has an outro so the intro and outro are very important he's actually dropped a piece of content as his sort of submission which is even better than just a sort of like video saying why you want a position like dropping us content like this is going to be what we're kind of looking for because it shows us that you can do it like it literally shows us exactly because we appreciate like you saying you want to work for clever programmer and you believe in the vision like we appreciate that but we're looking for the actual work right now like just show us your work then if we have an interview then you can tell us like why you believe in it or what you're looking for but our ultimate goal is we have found this to be the best way to help developers at a global level and we just want to keep maximizing creating content for them and helping them so just show us the work and that will be a good place to be at we went through a bunch of people's before we even started recording this video but those are the few that stood out to us like bradley stood out and then peras was i think um like i think that was one of the best submissions absolutely yeah so make it so if you want to model somebody model perasa's one where he just kind of intros it right away and then boom he starts making the video and there are not so many us and ums and dead time and low energy the energy is just high so keep that energy high right when you're recording it you have to understand human beings are following you if you're doing a two three hour build and your energy is low somebody will feel depressed and not want to actually build it yeah and guys as a test watch back your content and think would i watch this like and don't be biased so it's very easy to be biased towards your own content because you're like this is the best thing ever but really be like critical and try and look back and and as a sort of exercise if every time you say um or uh like literally restart like literally restart and then really be quite like forceful in yourself yeah yeah so exactly just slow down and you can speak again and try to remove the crazy arms and others but to be completely honest even if you have the ons and um like it's not going to make the world of a difference as long as your speaking ability is good your presentation is good you've prepared the code in advance and we can see that you're flowing through it your project is good those are the things that really matter above every everything yeah because i mean like we all yeah it is a good point actually because like you don't have to be the best on camera that's not really what we're looking for like that can come with time that can be an improvement like as long as you're willing to put yourself out there and do it but the main thing is like perez's video the reason why it stood out so much is he covered a lot of different concepts in his video and he taught it really well yeah he thought it really cleaned up very well because like i know like elizabeth flucher code who follows the channel a lot right and she she you're coaching her right now too mentorship and then i know she wants to apply for this as well she has a very soft she's very softspoken so her video is not going to start off with like it doesn't need to start off with like yo what's up guys this is like it doesn't need to be that but she could just be like hey guys today we're going to build an airbnb clone let's jump right into it and boom it just switches there and she's like so here we're working on her reactor she can be softspoken but as long as it's clear yeah presentation is good the code is good the project is good that is you know like really really powerful exactly and everyone has their own style guys just like because you might see somebody like like me and carzio and we're quite like loud at times it doesn't mean that you have to be loud i mean like everyone has a different style and a lot of people sort of relate to different styles um and and it can work for you and it could actually be a lot better than our style um it just depends on sort of like just be yourself like be yourself on camera when you try and put on a on a different persona that's when we can kind of see through it and it doesn't really come across that well on camera so i'd say just just be yourself and it doesn't matter if you're shy or you're nervous like just you actually reaching out and sending us a submission in the first place shows us that you're willing to put in that extra step and that extra effort and beyond that as long as like you can sort of break down concepts and principles and teach it well the rest is kind of like can be improved over time that's right yep yep so with that said the link is still below this video the air table link click it apply make a dedicated video and we're looking to hire somebody within this week so don't sleep on it there's not permanent amount of time by september 30th or before it will have found somebody um who's like kind of ready to go fulltime and again just to be clear it's like fulltime position we're looking for and we're looking for somebody to make dedicated content for clever programmer for eight hours a day so it's content heavy you know and for you it's like super dope because you make you want to learn coding you'll keep learning it and you keep making content on it and then it just makes such a big impact in people's lives and that's really like the ultimate thing exactly also a bonus thing we actually went into perez's github and found his he had a social media account so he had an instagram account and he actually had some good content on there as well so like that's an added bonus right like if you can show that you're sort of you're you're you're quite like you're already producing content that's going to be something which is awesome as well it's like kind of a cherry on the top exactly yep so with that said go ahead click that link below if you're already making the video and apply and best of luck exactly guys and hopefully we'll see you on the team oh
