hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm let's jump on and talk about tuples okay this is something we did not discuss in our data types yet and we need to cover this concept so remember when we had lists and you can add things to list and delete things from lists and lists are super nice so you know list would be something like groceries and if you said okay let me turn on this one thing so it does not keep bothering you guys okay all right there we go now remember list was like groceries and you might have a banana and Apple groceries that's funny apricot okay well with tuples you can use them a very similar way you could have let's let's make it something that you can't change for example or you know Social Security numbers I mean you could use whatever you want but I just wanted to use this one and it could be some number here it could be another number right there and then another number right here okay so this here is actually called a tuple why is it call that nobody knows but it's wrapped in parentheses and the main difference between a list and a tuple is that you can add things to a list and delete things from a list but to a tuple you can't change it you can't add things to a tuple or take things out from a tuple so that's really the key difference I'm going to go down and show you ok groceries we can do dot append cheese cheese okay and if I print out groceries here okay and you'll see the results at the Pope this round a different file you can see the results right there it says apricot banana apple and cheese because I just added cheese to it and it shows that you don't have a method like dot a pen for tuples so it can you can do that for them okay this was just a very basic example of this why would you need to use a tuple well if you were working with data that you really never want change like maybe you were storing people's passwords you never want to you want to store them like this because maybe that's something you might now want to change right or at least you might want to make it really difficult for people to change even people who are programming those websites for you or if you're programming a website like that yourself it's really quickly let me show you where you can actually find this code so I'm going to actually push this code up for you guys okay let's see here add learn whoops Python okay so you guys can actually go to github.com okay and look up my username so maybe a clever programmer and one thing you can do is go to users and follow me okay but if you can't follow me just look for a clever program or underscore stuff this repository go to this repository right here and you will see learn Python okay there's the link if you want to go directly github.com slash clever program or slash clever program or underscore stuff and then there you'll see something called learn Python go in there click tuples and you can actually see the code right there and that's where I will let me make it a little bit bigger so you guys can see it better this is where I will try to add the code for you guys from here on out and you guys can just go ahead and check everything right on there okay hopefully that clarifies everything alright that's it in the next video perhaps we're going to cover a little bit more about mutable versus immutable data types so I'll see you guys there
