beautiful i love the way it looks we are using javascript we're using html css tailoring css as well and also firebase to be able to save you know the data on the next part two i was on clone 2.0 we will actually be uh building you know the product page and the car the cart page there'll be three parts to this and all together it will just be a great looking amazon redesign hopefully maybe amazon looks at him like okay great this is great maybe we should do this something like this but yeah who knows so anyways guys let's go and get started here are the few steps we need to do all right uh i'm gonna put this at the side okay right here so i have this with me let me see here i'm gonna put this i'm gonna put you guys here so i can see all your beautiful faces nice i love it okay let's go ahead and do this now at this point all right i got the i got my code that's what i'm talking about i've got my the bing all right so let's go ahead and do this let's open up vs code everybody right now let's open a vs code or if you have vs code open your homework of course was to create a new vs code um or to download just what i'm trying to say here so let's open up use code everybody got views code up open yes yes yes yes let me know please well let's put him put that in the chat so i can see the chat all right let me know if you put they have the vs code open beautiful all right next thing let's go ahead and open up a new folder so i'm going to open up a new folder i have a projects folder specifically just for you know projects and inside here i'm going to say a new folder and i'm going to say amazon dash clone and i'm going to say 2 amazon clone 2 right 2.0 that's what it stands for okay all right amazon clone two jesse are you with me here or jessie yes of course she's with me she's always with me yes jesse you can hear me jesse jesse okay she's here all right so amazon clone let's go ahead and open up our folder here i'm clicking i'm going to click open all right and then i'm going to go to projects and then you see the amazon clone 2 let's go and go ahead and click amazon clone 2 right here right here and so you guys have it open okay so i click open beautiful nice nice nice nice nice all right let's wait for it to open let me send you ask what good extensions to use uh let's not talk about that just yet okay and then the first thing i want you guys to do is right click and click new file then do index.html index.html oh so it looks like jesse is a little bit just uh gone here for a second it's okay we'll bring her back in a second here so it is html and of course in order to add all the boilerplate we know that there's a boilerplate uh a lot of different things so if you just type in exclamation point check this out just a commission point and you hit let me there we go thank you jesse hi jesse here she's back hi i'm back thank you all right so if you just simply hit exclamation point let me cancel this if you simply just hit exclamation point and hit enter we get all this html that we actually need you see so we have our html tag right here at the top we have our header tag of course we have our body tag and so forth right we've got the title so all you gotta do is just that it's just that uh is there a startup folder available somewhere the startup folder is really just right click new folder guys right click new folder that's all you need to do nothing nothing crazy okay all right that's it so let's go and rename this title to be amazon amazon 2.0 we'll call it a better version of amazon because that's how we do it okay and then honestly that is it right so once we've gone that let's go ahead and create the body and then in the body what we'll do is we'll do this is this is this right here is amazon amazon 2.0 boom right there let's go and save that now what i want you guys to do is now open this up now to open this up there's a few ways if you go to your extensions you should have an extension called live server so if you go to live server right go to this extension click install and that's it if you don't have this just right click and do open and um what's it called copy path just do copy path and then you can paste it into your actual path uh here on chrome okay but let's go ahead and do right click open with live server right there beautiful so now we will have our live server and you can see right there it says this is amazon 2.0 you guys with me yes or no you guys with me yeah i see all you beautiful by the way just to really heads up if you are not able to keep up don't worry you can always rewatch this video multiple times you know so don't be so worried about that okay that's all i'll tell you and this is mainly like for viewing purposes to give you some good perspective on what is possible with cranes until this and then of course you can always go back and rewatch this one more time all right amazon 2.0 let's go ahead and right click and then we'll do new file as well and we're going to create style.css okay just like that all right this is where the styling for our amazon clone is going to be okay nice and then what's going to happen now at this point is the following we need to import a few different things to make sure everything is working properly all right so what are those things i need to import jesse what do you think well we want to work with tailwind of course that's right so in order to work with you know something like tailwind and if you've never worked with that before what you do is going to look up to wind in google so let's go ahead and do that so let's go ahead and go to tailwind and what you want to look up guys it's always the documentation so here they have documentation indeed or you can go to get started start learning right there and right away at the bottom you see it tells you exactly what you need to do in order to install and there's multiple ways to install your tail and css but but let's talk about the easiest way for us to do it just temporarily and that's through a cdn which is basically just through a link so if i just keep going down and down and down and done see using tim what's your cd envious at the end now i don't fully recommend it if you're going to build it with a lot of projects but for a starter project it's amazing so just right click on this or just go ahead and copy this right here and honestly you're pretty good so if i come and see this i will put you put it for you guys in the chat so you guys have it as well let me go ahead and put that for you guys in the chat and then a monit if you can actually put that in the chat for youtube that would be amazing thank you very much uh that'll mean a lot okay so this is going to be your link now some of you might ask the question of what is telling css right what is tailwind css a great question anybody know what 101 css is raise your hands raise your hands okay who has no idea what telling css is raise your hands there we go a lot more hands raised good question so taylor and css is a css framework anybody know here bootstrap bootstrap right a lot of you guys know bootstrap so it's kind of like booster but it's on a different scale right so it's uh as i said here it's a utility first css framework packed with classes like flex i know pt 4 text center and rotate so basically um to give you an a simple rundown what bootstrap is a lot of it's components so if i go to bootstrap for example here and this is just a really good one because i want you to understand exactly what you're getting into so that's why i'm explaining this to you so if we go to bootstrap you can see that if we just go to docs for example if i just go to docs right here right um and if i just go to layout or if i just do for example you know forms you know or let's just do buttons i'm going to search for buttons here right so bootstrap is very much you can see i can all i have to do is i have to do button button primary and that gives me the button right here you guys see that yeah right here you guys see that yes right so this already gives you predefined components right basically you just use this class and then you've got the component called button button primer that's it okay but with tail one it doesn't work out so much that way okay with tail instead of using for example buttons let me show you i'm gonna show you how exactly you would use it let me see here it's basically instead of using components you are actually breaking it down into smaller pieces you're actually breaking down into smaller pieces like for example width look at this you see you know color you can set specific background colors just using a very simple class like bg red bg yellow okay and so for example if you want to create a button in our case for example there's a button called play now let me see there's another button that we can use uh let's see for example like this button right here okay play now uh or buy now i bet by now where is it where's that button right here there's a button the butt button button button anybody see the button yeah yeah line 48 i think uh line 48 48 no that's not the button 47 47 47 there we go so button for example you can see then instead of just for example in bootstrap all we do is we say hey button button primary that's all we say that's easy it's simple right do you like that by the way i like how it's simple right it's so super duper easy but without what telling css when i create a butt i say hey flex non flex item center just like content i give it a width i give the height look at this right it's pretty crazy then i say hey text purple so text purple 700 background purple 50 right then i say bg purple rounded full to make give it a rounded circle with nine and height nine crazy right pretty crazy uh yeah it's kind of like but that's not the binder button hold on that's the add to back button this is the binder button right here my bad it's see text white bg purple 700 rounded full you know item center so where do you see the big difference between bootstrap and tail and css where do you see the difference put in the chat i'm really curious what you guys have to say what do you see the difference between bootstrap and tailwind css that's right more control david that's right so in tail and css you have a lot more control a lot more freedom that's right maya that's right a lot more customizations right if i want to make this button maybe larger or smaller i just simply change you know the the width you see this width a half i'll just change the width if i wanted to that's right and that's it right instead of just having to be one thing that's the only thing you can use i can make it as customizable as i want and all that is by simply just adding a bunch of classes and all those classes are is they're just simply css classes underneath the hood their css attributes so if this width one and for example if you think about it this width half what do you think this actually converts to w you know one dash two under css what do you think converts well it converts to the following with here i'm gonna show it to you yes with fifty percent that's correct that's right that's it that's all it is underneath the hood okay so i just want you to understand that portion okay very poor very important and so basically anything that you are going to use in taylor css is just going to be that so if i want to for example if i want to give it uh do a background color i do search and say background color color right i hit enter and then right away this shows me exactly what i need to use and here are the options i have for background colors blue you know violets you know blue green orange yellow and i just simply say hey bg gray 500 that's it guys that's it so let's take an example if i want to go ahead and have this text i'm going to say div here okay command x command v and i say div class what class would i use to give this a different color of let's say blue tell me i want everybody by the way everybody right now on zoom and if you're on youtube you should be on tail and css documentation right now every single person you guys should have that open because that's how this is going to happen okay so if i want for example color right like a text color boom right there and this gives me all the colors i can have so if i want to text color green which kind of looks like this i do text screen 600 command c i do command v right here and then look at this i go to my amazon 2.0 and then what does it look like this is green simple right right but right if i right click on it and i inspect it what it actually is let me show you here's my inspect element if i actually inspect it what it is oh a class see it's a class type screen is simply color rgba with a specific you know opacity if you have my friends is it it's nothing crazy whatsoever nothing crazy whatsoever so did i give you just a just like a little really like a really quick tour of what talent css is did you guys get a better understanding of that by the way is that better is that better i get a thumbs up i get a thumbs up from a few people nice beautiful okay great so that is what telemachus says it's a framework that allows you to customize your uh your colors your buttons a lot more than like a booster would allow you normally all right so let's go and get this started in that case so if i have this all right let's now think about what we need to do with our amazon 2.0 here's what it looks like right now here it is um pretty cool so let's think about what are some components we need to build in order to make this right i always like to divide my projects into small components right i want you guys to tell me in the chat what are some components that you see right there michael okay i see it so navigation bar that's right so the nav bar right here that's right okay i like it what else do you guys see the sidebar that's right the sidebar right here what else do you guys see i'm not calling maurice the main section i'm gonna call it the main section right or maybe this is like the shopping section i don't know right we also have what we also have like this banner thing right the header this header or banner that was called we've got the categories section right here and then we also get the products the product section the products look so damn good by the way so damn good right the product section i know i know i know and of course if we look more even deeper we have for example the logo now what else what do we have that we have the search bar right and then we have a little few icons right here that you know that you can use as well right so uh yeah that's right search icon and so forth right that's right that's right okay great all right so if we know these are components what do we need to start with that in that case well we need to go ahead and start out with those components am i right no react here guys we're only going to use javascript unfortunately or not not unfortunately fortunately we will be using javascript just for this so you guys will learn how to use you know the the basics of javascript here all right so let's do this let's go and create our div right what is the first thing that we need to create well we need to create our what kind of the container right the main container that will contain all of this right first things first i want to do is i'm going to create a div diff right here and this div is going to be like a you know a full width div so this is going to be the containers i'm saying div class div right here that's the container i'm going to give it a full on background white so bg white class bg dash y and then again that's coming from directly tail and css okay and a width dash full how do we get that because if i go to 101 css and i say width for example width width and then i go simply to width you can see here that width full is width of 100 exactly see so that's what correlates to in in uh in my terms okay i love i love how you can look everything up inside of this documentation i know um so basically it's like these are utility classes so called utility classes and those are actually equal to your standard css properties but they have their own classes so they have their own unique name that sometimes also means when you're looking for a width of let's say 50 pixels or actually it's not 50 it's called something else um you can go scroll to the top does yeah right here like for three rem like four rem yeah exactly so it's a little bit different so that also means by the way guys if you would say um w dash of hyphen 17 that doesn't exist at class so make sure to always check whether your utility class the name really exists of it okay that's right and that's it nice can you live share with me oh that's right i forgot about that in your life sure so i'm gonna click share here with jessie so the jessica i love to coach you i know she likes to code as well love code guys i love code who else here loves code i mean i know that's why they're here yeah hopefully everybody that's how you guys are here okay i'm gonna send to you right now jessica one second here awesome okay okay it is sent done awesome yay all right so what we need to do we might need to prove it later yeah we'll improve in a second here so what we need to do first guys is we need to go ahead and actually create our header first so let's go ahead to hide this i'm going to say div class right here and i'm going to say header okay that's going to be our first progress remember we talked about first part is going to be the header okay header right there that's going to be the header right after we've got the header i'm going to accept with the right jess is trying to access into my vs code which you know i'm not going to let her um so we have the header and then what is the next thing that we we have for that i'm going to say the following we have a header and then we also have another div right here that's like this right it's the main section that contains the sidebar and the products section or whatever it's called right so i'm going to do day of class class equal to main okay now why am i calling the main these are just some terms i'm going to use myself because i want to reference them these mean nothing right now because they're not actually styled this is not telling css this is nothing this is just so we exactly know what these divs are for okay that's what the purpose is then inside the header what are the few sections that we have inside the header well the first section is we have the logo okay so let's go ahead and do this i'm going to say div class is equal to what logo again not telling css just for us to know exactly what's going on in this div okay and then after that we're going to have what we're going to have an input and then a few different other things but for that to happen oh jess are you in yeah yeah i'm it just isn't i'm in let's go beautiful okay good good good good so then what's gonna happen is we will go ahead and uh well say hello let's open this up hello beautiful but instead of hello we're also we're actually going to add an image so let's go into an image jesse okay and we'll say the following we'll say um image right and then no class no clashes here will say source is equal to the following right and i'm going to give you the source here that we have this is just an amazon uh amazon image let me give it to you right now oh oh right there i'm gonna copy this i'm going to give you guys in the chat so you guys have the link to that boom and then a month you can paste that please on youtube that'd be amazing too the youtube channel is not open yeah oh it's closed okay yeah yeah okay cool so we have that image if you just need an amazon a logo image just go ahead and search it up on line um but here's the image i'm going to show you right here this is the image right here see this is the image there's amazon 2.0 amazon logo image okay and then so we've got that let's take a look at what we have so far i mean it's it's pretty basic it's like a view and that's pretty much it okay it's nothing much at all but i know i know i know i know well you can't see it now we the letters are white but because we have a white background the you're not gonna see it that's right that's right that's right okay if you wait if you would make the background bg for example purple or something or black so let me see we would be able to see the logo yeah oh you see right there see so yeah boom there we go vg white so that's where the logo is at guys and now we can also style this image so let's do that okay um i would personally um first make like an image put it in a container oh we already have a class logo plus logo that's right yeah yeah i think we need to write it like we're going to right now is give it a width and a height jesse okay so for the container let's give it a width okay so what is it with jesse uh with i would say like onefifth okay and height uh of 16 okay now what this is yeah can we put a what does it actually mean can you put a word wrap can you put a word wrap on your code all right you guys want or toggle rap how do i do that you do view and then there's a word wrap you guys happy now guys happy now there we go there we go so we give it a width and a height and how does this again translate to because if you gotta go if you guys go to tail and css and if you simply just start search up with with right here right look at this right and we say width of onefifth what does this mean if you go to onefifth onefifth just simply means with twenty percent that's all that means yeah nothing i think crazy and the height of sixteen if i search up height again here right this is how you literally you will use tail and css you will just go to documentation you search up anything you want so height 16 is height of 4 rem okay and if you're wondering what rem means it's basically based on standard uh kind of pixel so for example if your body pixels is for example 16 pixels one rem is 16 pixels you see what i mean four rem is four times 16 pixels that's how so rem is like yeah it's like an equation almost right that's the fraction unit yeah that's right that's right so let's go continue on let's give it a background color as well i'm going to go to the header and i'll say bg grade is 900 so i'm going to say header and i'm going to say bg dash dash gray dash 900 boom save that boom so much better now so much better okay and then i'm going to give the header as well i'm going to give it a h of 16 so that we have the height as well nice okay and then honestly besides that nothing so nothing so far crazy i'm going to save that okay this is what we have now let's go back to our image class image and let's do class is equal to and we need to make sure our image is actually also specific within height so i'm going to say width width dash 28 okay and then height each dash 16 okay so i don't want it to be bigger oh it just become became like a lot smaller right but that's okay right that's okay because we can use object contain like this to make sure the object is contained in there so what does object contain is if i go to otl and css and i simply search up object contain or i'm going to say um object fit right that's what it's actually called in css and sit here you see object contain the css class for that one is object contain right so you just simply whatever css property you know of you search it up and then that's the c class that you use all right so pretty good now at this point i'm lucky where we're going uh that's awesome let's do let's give it a margin so i'm gonna say margin ml dash ml dash 10. what do you think ml dash 10 means i want you guys to put in the chat what do you think that means that's right margin left that's right jason margin left so m stands for margin nice yeah l stands for left then 10 is just 10 rem i think it's just the 10 rem that's it let's go ahead and do that save that save that all right there you go now amazon is a little bit more to the lefthand side okay yeah looking looking looking really good guys by the way we're looking really really good i'm liking where we're going okay uh next up let's go ahead and do what we're going to create our input right jesse yeah but also maybe put the image do you think this is a little bit top padding top on the on the top oh okay no that's right that's right we can do that too that's right because because it's it looks like it's not balanced out i can do a padding top so maybe just you can put it in right there she's like pinning top three right there okay all right this looks better that's it save that a little better oh liver though is not possible without body or a head tag what just happened oh too much too much jesse we killed it oh yeah okay let's go let's go so let's make the input so let's go ahead and make uh input now at this point the input is going to be which one it is going to be uh this simple right here all right go ahead jesse feel free to make the input right now so input it's just like an html input okay so you're just going to say like this and the input you know first of all we're going to give it an id like normal we're going to give it search id okay we know we only want to type text into inside of the input and we're gonna give it a placeholder called search dot dot dot okay that's first the first part now oops now we're gonna style this input up okay that said my light went out okay still see me i still see it just don't worry i got you okay that's pro problem so the input guys what are we seeing with the input first of all um we got to give it of course a height that's right so let's give the height and a width okay so let's give it a height we're going to say here of course we're going to say class and i'm going to give it a height of 9 okay and a width of 30. that's right okay 30. again that's good coming from here if i just if i type in just width here with what right and she types in the width of 30 for example right there's all these widths we can do and then look at this look at this width of 30 is basically right here or width 32 let's just say right with width of 8 rem that's it i am you see so that's it oh look we have it it's there so okay okay okay interesting let's finish it up first because but this is the thing though nas it is now vertically aligned it's not horizontally aligned that's right you know and the input is actually inside of the guess what guys the header header class that's right so what do we need to do with header which is the parent component what do we need to do there in order to get the items inside of the header horizontally aligned chat anybody know exactly monique very good flex we're going to use flex so normally in css you would say display flex but here guess what flex until when you only have to say flex see so display flex is equal to flex class right there and if you look now nice it looks good jesse nice job awesome this is the thing though that now it is next to each other but as you can see it's not really vertically aligned right so let's let's fix that and let's say items center now what css property does this look like guys css property with a value this is called which one a line a line items exactly a line item center and look the search is more in the middle of the header and that's what we want okay now let's go back to the um inputs so we gave it a background color okay and i want to give it a border so i'm going to give it border so the thing is in uh till when css just if you mention the word border it will by default give you a border a white one with one pixel solid uh line okay automatically you don't have to do anything you just have to fill in the word border however if you want to change that you're just going to do this you want to change the color of the border you say border gray 500. that's just a border color that's it so right there see that's the border color that's the border color now also i added an opacity to make it look a little bit less hard than it does okay so border opacity of 75 which means of 75 okay and um i'm gonna make i want to make this rounded but do you think we should make it rounded here or at um oh no wait no yeah i do have rounded here yeah rounded i'm gonna say rounded on the left side because it's only on the left side rounded in this case watch it guys if you look at the design and you can say xl that's going to decide how big your curve is going to be how rounded it is going to be that's right so this is rounded lxl so if i go to tail and css exam again right if i say for example rounded uh dash l yeah right round l let me see let me show you guys round the dash l you see rounded dash l is small so border top left and border bottom left right so uh it's all going to be the left section so she's doing ronda l excel which is this one and that's doing a 0.75 remember the left radius on the top and the bottom guys okay nice and so now that looks kind of like this let's see oh let's go jesse that looks amazing ever get replaced for jesse let's go all right let's continue on well we're not we're far from done yet but yeah it's a start it's a need to start okay so as we can see we're gonna be we're gonna use some padding because look it's all a little bit together right so on the input we want um on the horizontal axis we want it to move to the right well what you can do you can give it a padding on the left and the right at the same time just by doing this p x hyphen three and so v x stands for uh padding on the x axis right there's p y yeah that's p x the x axis is left and right remember that okay and so if we did that yes okay we're going to give a axe a biscuit patty on the left hand side and also a penny from the right hand side guys okay and so you can see right there as you can see as i type you see it's not letting me type towards a certain amount but even though right now typing is like black so can we make the text color white jesse uh yeah we can make a text color white we would say text excuse me that's right that's right that's good so let's go save that if i click this boom right there look at that look at that one right there that's it cool cool now guys padding is always on the inside of the element that you're working in guess what margin is on the yacht on the outside that's right so we don't want the amazon and the input to touch um so it might in my screen they're touching a little bit oh they're not in your case they're not you should make it bigger okay that makes sense um but in order to always make sure there's some distance between them i'm going to give it a margin on the left side i'm going to give it a margin okay then i think don't you think the text is too big nice it's not too big this is actually pretty good text i like this deck this is a good text actually i kind of like it okay so could you oh ouch look at that that always hurts my eyes when you click on an input i hate it i don't even know the functionality of it you know so guys that is called um an outline and this outline will always be caused by focusing on the input focusing just clicking on it basically but you can remove this okay so you're going to say here until when css you're going to say focus colon outline hyphen none boom nice now can you click on it again nice are you ready for this guys are you ready for this oh it's not there thank you thank you thank you it's not there awesome awesome then the next thing we need to do is after that we need to go ahead and actually create what we need to create this drop down this category shroud all right so how do we create that jesse next one next up oh that's not that hard actually once you know how to work the other things it's pretty easy however the nice thing of the fun thing with this category thing is that that little chef run the little triangle is called a chevron guys that um is an icon you can get from guess what tailwind library itself no way damn yay yeah it's called heroicons heroicons so nas if you go to the tailwind documentation right there okay so you say beautiful handcuffs and ssg icons by the makers of tail and css boom nice i'm liking this okay and so if i search up any nike for example uh what is that what is the icon called jesse um shepherd chef from so chev i think that's the way you can find it or arrow oh i'm just saying arrow that's easier for me to understand arrow down let me see let me see there's a arrow down arrow down there we're down right there you see right there oh yeah yeah i know oh you're gonna click copy spg all you have to do is click copy svg and then you can even paste it uh later on but we'll paste it here in a second guys okay yeah so well for first here's a second guys first we need to create the categories so let's do that right now jesse exactly so we're going to say diff class and we'll call this category so the thing is though guys there's a lot of um inline styling indeed with two in css so it's hard to read through it but if you give your classes certain names it's so much easier to look through exactly the later point okay that's right so have the div here okay and of course we're going to give this also a height okay of nine we're going to give it a width of 10. it's not very big and oh we're gonna give it that specific wait are we already there yeah no i was i was going too fast uh no no i was going too fast i was going at the yellow the yellow part with the magnifying glass oh so we're going to give the width of 30. we're going to give it a grayish color the the categories one right yeah we're gonna give it that same color so again guys it's gonna be bg gray gray 800 okay and again we're going to do the same as we did before right we're going to say guess what border border gray 500 i know i'm typing fast but you could just understand this and read this correctly okay guys just look at what it is what it is and then again also border opacity because it's the same as what we just did at the at the first part okay 75 and guess what we're also going to give it to be consistent also a padding of three on the left and right side okay and guess what well i'm not gonna do this yet however you're going to see this in a moment let's paste that if you can see here my comment.code let's paste the i svg icon the chevron here okay so i'm going to go to here guys okay i'm going to go to here i'm going to go to the copy svg okay another yes not this one copy svg and hopefully you guys have i'm not giving it to you guys for i'm going to give you guys for free don't worry guys so so here's a chevron icon okay those of you who are on youtube just go to heroicons.com and then search up you know arrow and then scroll down and you should be able to see the chevron down icon okay okay yes and then i'm going to paste this right here that's going to be our svg so if i save this now there we go oh dang what is this right here svg let's save that again one more time there we go right good good good good good good yeah plus of course guys what do we need to do we need to have a word we need to have a word inside of there in the div of course so let's say here we're going to say of course categories all right so let's go ahead and save that right there yeah where is it where is it where is it oh because you put it inside the spg you put in this so that's vegetables oh oh oops no sorry at the top i'm sorry my bad guys categories boom right there nice so the first things first we need to do with this of course guys is going to be let's change the color of the category so let's do that right now okay to make the color white what do we say what do we say for the class what are we just saying white text dash white that's it so if i do text as white boom also you can see that awesome you see the svg and the categories right they're kind of top to bottom and what do we do to make it left to right anybody know raise your hand or uh somebody said yes can we use select tag when not using select text just yet for this one okay ahead so we can simply use flex that's right so if i do flex let's go awesome jason very good boom boom also let's let's go ahead and make sure that we align it vertically so to line it vertically we do item center as the class as well okay so if i save that oh that's not what i want to save no if i save that boom categories are saved so we are so so close right as you can see guys the the inputs that text is not white because actually once nas was typing that text was white but the search now is not white and why is that because guess what that's not really text that is called the placeholder so in order to change that you can say placeholder hyphen white and now see what happens that's a good one placeholders white if i save that right now right so you can see right there the placeholder just changed to white color because jesse just added placeholder white right here okay so we got that our next step is going to be to add our what our search icon right jesse yes the search icon so again you have to search up that icon inside of the tailwind um library that's right so i'm going to say search here i'll go to hero icon say search right there and i'm going to use this one right i'm going to use this one so um copy svg and then where do i need to put this we're going to create another div right here go to create another name we're going to create another div and then we're going to call it a search icon okay and this search icon guess what it is that pretty typical amazon color so we're going to say uh bg yellow 500 okay and i'm going to close this one off and then let's paste that let's paste that um svg in do you have it i have it right here no paste interruption awesome save that oh right there so there it is so of course there's a lot we need to modify there it is allow me to monitor for this one now okay the first thing you need to do is yeah one we need to give it the same height so it's going to give the same height jesse yeah nine eight nine good and let's get a width of ten width of ten good and let's go ahead and give it the round corners it deserves okay and so somebody's asking for the svg okay guys boom boom boom here in the zoom chat okay so the icon is rounded it's in a rounded diff right so round it but guess what guys on what side is it rounded on the right hand side did i get a right jessie yeah yeah so rounded hyphen r for right and then again xl because that's the the amount of the curve that we want to have okay xl xl that's right so i'm going to okay can you save that i will save that right now so you can see right there beautiful rounded sure now what do you see that we need to change now at this point we've got the icon which is oh but we need to center it now so let's go and center it jesse yeah so of course display flex so we're going to use flex here and guess what to get it in the middle of that orange box we're going to say um which justify center okay nice and i think that's enough and then we need to i do item center as well vertically line so when you items yeah center center to land vertically so basically justify center is going to justify content so justify conte is going to align things horizontally align items which is in this case item center is going to align vertically guys okay sure for sure now what else do you guys see that svg that magnifying glass it's not white it's not white so what can we do we can change that okay so guess what guys inside of this svg so pay attention okay by the way your indentation css needs to be clean as that's how serious i am about it because i'm using the f word okay so um it has to be super clean because look otherwise you don't know what's happening inside of your divs and who which one is the parent component and which is the child component that component element is a better word but you guys know what i mean so here inside of the svg on line 25 i'm going to add a class actually just just just guess what jesse jesse check this out jesse actually if we just simply do text white on the parent it makes the whole thing text way are you sure oh yeah look at my zoom oh yeah oh shoot yeah yeah yeah yeah cool cool cool yeah so i just wanted to point out that you know so this is the thing guys the svg it can be changed because it's actually seen as text even though it's an image an icon isn't that cool yeah so apparently it works also works on the parent component component but you can also change things inside of the svg okay by adding a class but in this case it wasn't needed so okay so at this point what have we got we've got uh the section with you know the navigation then search bar the logo the next thing we need to now focus on is going to be the right those right icons that we have on the right hand side so let's go ahead and take a look at how do we build those can i build those with you jesse is that okay yeah for sure you can build those okay i would put them in a in a diff class okay so let's do this we've got this stuff down and i'm going i'm going to give it like a really small uh what i like to do sometimes is for example i like to give it like a comment so i would like to do uh 2 2 2 2 2 and that gives me a comment section and then now i'm going to say you know this is going to be what should we call it the right icons right and this way i can divide things up okay guys i'm going to create another a new div and inside this i'm going to say uh class is equal to icons okay now again this has nothing to do this class does nothing exactly because this cuz is just for you to know exactly what this div is about that's it okay nothing crazy so in this dev class icons we'll have a few different icons that we need to incorporate the first icon is going to be which one it's going to be the heart icon right jesse so if all we have to do is just go ahead and click heart heart oh the heart is so so there so fragile we've got the heart icon no don't get emo now we're coding it's so fragile so we got the hard icon the next icon we need to work on is going to be which one it is actually going to be this card icon but this is actually inside a div so if i simply just go ahead and create a new dip why do i say it's an inside idea because you can see that you know around this card is actually a orange color right an orange color so if i go ahead and simply just create a div and let's say call it the card icon so div a class and that's going to be cart icon again has nothing at all to do with anything card icon and then what we'll do is we'll give this div a an actual svg inside of that which will be the cart so let's go back to the hero icons let's select cart inside here shopping cart copy svg maybe just you can copy for them inside the chat boom right there that's our svg for the card icon okay all right now of course for the card icon if you need if things need to happen which is going to be we need to give it a height and a width so let's do that right now okay um let's go ahead i'm going to save this here so we can see it okay so it's kind of there and kind of not why because the icon section needs a text of white text of white to make sure that we have all the icons are there also what do you see here guys all the icons are what top to what top to bottom right but but how do we make them left to right left to right what do we do here guys what do we do we do flex that's right thank you so we're going to say text right and i'm saying flex oh not there not there i'll say space flex boom save that nice good i like it so now you can see it's left to right that's exactly how i like it for the card icon i'm going to give a certain a certain width and a certain height okay i'm going to say this is going to be an h of 10. each dash hello hi jessie and a width of ten okay so that's it that's i'm going to save that and uh nothing really crazy happened there don't worry about it okay then let's say bg dash yellow dash 500 and now we see oh there we go that's exactly what i'm talking about so now we have this background which is exactly what we need for the card icon all right okay now let's go ahead and what we need to align that card icon in the card inside the center what do we do guys who knows you guys should know but at this point who knows brendan who knows brendan knows yeah brendan knows i know brendan knows so we're going to say what i'm going to say flex item center for to refer align it vertically and then what is it justify center correct jesse i'm going to remember justify that's right justify dash center save that boom right there right next let's go ahead and give it a rounded section so i'm going to say rounded dash xl because rounded excel oops rounded dash excel and that is it boom also let's go ahead and change the font size potentially because i feel like it's a bit too big so to change the font size um how to choose the font size of this one jesse i don't really know for this one but approach to the font side to make it a little bit small because i feel like it's a bit too big so i'm going to the svg say font size font size i'm going to go back to 101 css let me say font size and so i can say some stuff like text small for example let's just say i do uh for this one i do text dash small okay let's see okay did this did it make it smaller or no i don't really think so did it no i don't think so either let's see okay texture small maybe i can put it on the actual icon itself some say class text is small no just make this bigger what how's that possible the text is small actually i made it bigger what the hell that's interesting okay let's just try one more time okay let me make it even smaller potentially let me see text is extra small extras how small do you want to make i know it's just it's big it's like how do i make it smaller that's the question i'm trying to figure out right or maybe i just give it a spin okay maybe instead of doing that here's another solution so do that i give it a height and a width so instead of doing that i go to the svg let's say uh class right because you can do that inside the svg i can say hi yeah that's four and a width dash four there we go thank you very much thank you very much now it's not small yeah okay and then let's go do the same thing for the other icon which is the heart icon which is which one which is here okay now let's do entergy class is equal to then height and width boom right there okay so much much yeah yeah yeah yeah okay let's also make sure that we align all this kind of stuff vertically you see how the heart is on the top while the card is cut in the center i don't like that so i will say flex items uh items dash center boom nice now the heart is in the middle all right exactly i want next up let's go and add another icon and this time it's going to be which one the bell icon bell so let's go ahead and do this i'm gonna say bell here's the bell copy svg here and then i'm going to paste the bell icon after our uh div class card icon right here so paste it in boom we've got the bell icon now hey there it is it's still big which i don't like but that's okay all right okay we got the bell icon and then finally there's this which i have no idea how to build but jesse does now i'm can i do it too but jesse knows even better no that's definitely not the case me knowing something you don't no no no no so what is your question so let's go ahead and continue on i will let you go ahead and take the reins now at this point okay we've got these heart icons we've got the card icons we've got the bell icon okay let's take a look at what we need to do the one thing i will add though myself though right now is i will go ahead and add some padding i think from the left hand side to make sure that you know it's kind of separated more should we do that yeah that's always a good good idea right to do that makes it always clean that's right so much cleaner so to add the padding all we need to do is we do either padding or margin or how do we make sure that it's always on the right hand side jesse right how do we make sure that this specific um what's it called um these icons icons yeah how to make sure it's all inside oh i would i like to use a margin auto for that in regular css um so for this we could do margin left auto which means it's going to the right so what would happen if i do margin left auto let's see if i go to the icons and i say here and i say ml dash auto boom you see ml the shot automatically just pushes to the right hand side and so basically it just adds a margin to the lefthand side automatically okay that's all honestly that is it okay and then what we're going to do we're going to add a margin right as well so i'm going to say margin right e to just give us some space here from the righthand side there we go i like it yeah nice and then honestly and then let's go ahead and do and give it a width so i'm going to say i'm going to say here's the width width is going to be 48 and then the height is gonna be the 16 that we usually know guys boom okay so and push to the lefthand side now because why because if you look at the div let's go ahead and rightclick on this one if you look at the div here boom here's a dip you see the div is big it's a big div right there it's on the right hand side there's marginal on the left hand side but it it aligned all its items svg items to the left hand side so what do we do to make sure it's kind of more spaced around what do you think jesse ooh i would use something um like justify around yeah so because you gave that icons menu you gave it a certain width right so those icons can only move freely within the width of that container correct so if you give it like justify um space around or just justify space evenly then it will um give space evenly or a little bit around it depending on what you choose of course inside of that container that's right applied it to those items that's right okay so i would choose justify around did you choose that one that's the issue yeah great and so this is all we have right now right but of course it's not done yet because the one big thing we need to add now is going to be this little svg icon so jesse go ahead and take the reins and see how you make that happen so that was like this fun um jay dentacon which is like an avatar based on your name so let me check up if you go if you look up in google jdenticon oh i'll like this okay okay okay okay yeah that's cool right let's say you say like like put in your name oh yeah anybody else want to try their name who wants to try their name raise your hand if i'm gonna try your name raise your hand if you want to be sure yeah jason all right topher oh okay okay topher yeah oh that looks so cool tall for you that's cool that looks like a beer samir samir let's see some mirror samir oh that's not bad either okay okay okay okay let's see who got the best one jesse what do you have let me see whoa that's an interesting one pretty emerald all right i like just one the best so let's use that adrian adrian adrian wait not any anime no no come on what the heck that's so cool n e n e to it please that's not like that wow that's awesome okay cool wow funky i still like this game i still like this on the bus the bus right here thank you so what you can do it's very easy you go if you go to the website by the way you see a button there guys get started okay let's go ahead get started get started so vanilla.js exactly website webjs including okay yeah we could just include that script so command c i'm going to to copy the script and i'm going to give this to every single one of you here so yeah and then guys you're gonna you're gonna don't get confused now you're gonna you're gonna add this inside of your head tag in the index.html file that's right okay so look closely where nas is putting this okay index.html at the top in your head tag so not in the body tag inside of the head tag okay and that way if you go below again to our code nas we're going to add in the last icon on line 42 okay i'm so ready for this so all i gotta do is i do svg okay i'm going to go ahead let me see yes so i'm gonna say svg okay ready for this guys ready for this i'm gonna say svg svg no not dv ready svg i'm gonna say svg just how they have it here data judenticon i'm going to say i'm going to copy this right here okay judentecon okay i'm gonna say equals i'm gonna say jesse jesse okay okay okay hey am i not in the live share anymore you're not a live show sorry jesse you you wanna try again so then okay i'm gonna save that and then i'm going to give it a a a height and a width and i'll say class is equal to what is equal to what height of 12 12 12 12 okay okay so let's go and take a look at this okay save that oh you guys ready ready drum roll okay that looks cool you guys are agreeing with that one that looks cool that looks cool all right and then maybe we should we give it like a rounded corners type situation yeah you could give it around it so you can give it rounded hyphen full which is the same as boarding radius 99.90 according to tailwind okay which means it's a full circle and oh look yeah i mean it's not rounded because there's no edges that's right around it but it's really good it's really good also let's go ahead and this bell icon let's make sure that it's also a height of 16 height of 6 or with 6. and so where is that where is that where is that we have height of 4 with 4. so this bell icon should that be a height of 6 with 6 or height of 4 with 4 no no 4 is ok what do you think is too small no i'm just trying to see what we had here i think it's height of 4 v4 yeah so let's do that let's make that happen oh height of 4 at the right i have 4 width 4. save that oh okay nice beautiful and then of course also i want to change the color of this card as well the color because this card is a little bit different because if you take a look at it right here see it's a little bit like more yeah right it's on the gray side so if i take a look at the color that i have see what is the color oh it's called text gray what is it 600 yeah uh text gray i think 200 no no no sorry you're right uh 600 600 so i'm going to go to my carter icon guys inside here i'm just saying boom save that oh look at that that looks good okay i like that that's perfect perfect perfect so we got that okay um we've got our search which is really good we've got our categories we've got our you know everything i'm also going to change this little down arrow so i think it's a little bit too big so let's go back to our down arrow the chevron so so funny i'm also gonna give it a height of four we w4 as well or not search icon does it not change the icon if i do oh because of c let's see oh never mind i'm changing the wrong one my bad guys why don't you guys stop me yeah i'm also looking at it yeah i'm looking at it at me like huh with four oh there we go okay much better and also i'm going to give it a little bit of a margin left amount dash maybe two or three there we go okay so it's a little bit cleaner okay i just like it like that okay it's a little bit cleaner i'm gonna say maybe margin left two actually okay where did you put the margin left on on the heart on the actual oh no i put an object on the chevron icon see this one the chevron icon that's the one up oh and the chevron one okay yeah yeah yeah okay okay that looks good guys we've got a navigation bar done guys give yourself a round of applause for navigation boys all right guys by the way on youtube guys let's go ahead and like this video if you guys are enjoying what you're watching would really appreciate that okay like the video let's get us to a thousand likes that would be amazing amazing let's get this video out to more people so more people see the amazon clone 2.0 that would mean so much to us okay so you guys give it a like that would be great that helps us out on the youtube algorithm and of course it helps us out in general all right it lets us know that we're doing great that's what it does so all right so is also really pumped so we've got our navigation bar the next thing we need to work on is going to be on our sidebar so you can see this is our sidebar right here boom right there okay looks really good i like it i know i know so let's work on our sidebar of course and let's see how it actually looks like in general all right we have currently the f if you're the following thing we have this rectangle here it's called the main section it's called the main section okay and then this is inside the main section we have the sidebar inside here like that okay everybody's still with by the way on here on zoom everybody's still with me on youtube i'm sure you guys are yes beautiful again if you guys are not with me that's okay just feel free to watch this video later on okay and just keep watching this all right so let's create our sidebar let me go back to my amazon project let me go ahead and put it on the left hand side oh that's not what i want okay good good good good good good good good all right and what i'm going to do is the following so we've got this section and i'm actually going to minimize it what i like to do is i'll do like this i go i like to see okay see this is the div class header minimize it done so now we're done with the header and i just minimized it and just you just simply click on this little oh now i know it's called the chevron icon you click on the icon fancy right i also didn't know that i didn't know either so that's funny okay and then let's go and do div class main and assign this mean this is where we need to create our sidebar uh section so let's do that right now okay can you give me a live share i sent you a link jesse oh really yeah it's in it's in uh it's the same link as before oh okay just try using that link okay yeah okay so let's go ahead and do this let's create a div class is equal to what should we call it guys and we have an idea what should we call this what should we call this a jess is trying to join she's trying to take over here careful guys careful careful jesse will take over all right class and then we'll say ready or not here i come main dash sidebar okay that's going to be the left sidebar that we have on the left hand side which is this one okay and then what should we call this section right here what should we call this section anybody know what should we call this section i have an idea for this section we should call it on the main section sorry it's just that's not too creative but it does it is what it is class is equal to main dash section all right so we get two sections now which is great left to right let's focus on now the sidebar section for the sidebar section a few things we're going to make it make that happen okay let me see so the side by section let's number one let's make sure let's give it a width so for the sidebar i'm gonna say width width is uh dash one dash five so with dash one dash five is basically if i go to my tail and c set documentation but go to width here right one one over five is going to be with twenty percent that's what that means okay so let's go ahead and go to that okay let's also give it a background color so i'm gonna say for this i'm going to say uh bg oh jesse is trying to join again dan yes he's just trying to you know she's just like bg gray 900s let's say bg dash gray dash 900 so i'm going to save that and we don't see nothing yet because why because yes we have a width but the issue is we um we don't have a height that's the issue guys okay so they have a height so let's do that right now and i'm going to say the height is actually going to be very interesting because the height is going to be the full height of the screen so check this one out i'm going to go to this um the the the main section and i want to say you know what the height of this whole main section is going to be h dash screen that's right it's very interesting it's maybe you haven't seen this people with this one before but it's like this where is it here each dash screen and how do we get that because if i go here height that screen is height 100 v8 so 100 vh is 100 vertical height so whatever the vertical height is off the browser that's the height it's going to take up okay all right next thing what we're going to do is we're going to say okay flex because right now flex is kind of flex is going to make it from left to right so save this boom right there you see what had just happened because i made it flex okay it said hey you know what this div needs to take up as much height as possible which in our case it is because the parent div is taking up the full height of you know the actual screen right and then the other divs are going to take as much as possible as well because they are flex items okay so we've got that let's go ahead and do a border i'm going to say border grade 700 in here so i'm going to say border gray 700 okay to give it a border but there's no border right now instead i'm going to do border top dash 2 okay so border top dash 2 oh jess is trying to read it right again dang jesse right and there we go we just added a board to the top section right here you guys can see that boom right there okay so we've got that we got our border gray let's go ahead honestly and that's that's it for now okay next thing let's go ahead and i know it's pretty cool right it looks so good though i know it looks so good looks so good yeah i like it too inside here what we also need to think about is the fact that these are categories but you see because there's padding on the lefthand side on the righthand side from the top from the bottom we need to create a div around this right here right to make sure that we make that padding actually work so i'm going to say here dev class oh where are you playing oh jesse jesse okay wait are you not going to do it inside of here you're right you're right no you continue typing that's right you just do it just do it thank you sidebar categories that's right okay guys so what are we gonna be putting inside of the sidebar categories makes sense right categories well first of all oh we got that fancy first category categories label i would say so let's make another div class for that okay let's say wait wait wait okay yeah diff class boom oh div class and my indentation on point okay and we're going to give that text we're going to give it a color 500. okay we haven't made the text yet guys so wait a minute okay and when we are upon that text we're going to give it a cursor pointer okay should i start with this though and what you can call it is you can think that's right that's cool so you know you don't need this what you can you can call this actually div because this div is a category you can call it a main cast so we can say hey you know what this is called a sidebar sidebar dash main dash category right here you see right there okay so this tells exactly what it is right and we don't need anything crazy inside here right oh that jesse just said no we don't yeah yeah yeah we don't hey hey the end yeah okay okay but we do we do need that um icon with the four squares and we need the word categories of course that's right so to get the idea of the four squares i'm going to go to hero icons and i'm going to say yeah i don't know what did i say what was the name of that view grid grid so view hyphen right here so i'm gonna say type in grid into my search i'm gonna copy svg from the view grid okay right there and jesse already copied and pasted it inside here thank you jesse and then after that i'm gonna say categories i'm gonna give the text category so let's go and do that right now but you should we put this in the span class uh we will we will we will but that's going to come in a second here we will we will we will okay that's right so i'm going to say categories categories just like this i'm gonna say expand categories inside here and why am i doing spam because when i don't like to leave text just like out like that i like to give text a little span so i can maybe control the stand later on so i'm going to span and i'm going to say categories right here cut gories okay save that nice nice nice nice nice and then we can put a spin around that too because uh we can actually we want to give like a width later on so we want to actually you know encapsulate it into a certain width height so let's put a spin around that one like this i'm going to add the closing tag of the span to the bottom as well boom right there okay okay beautiful okay that looks good i'm gonna hit enter right here so i can just put it on the next section nice right there okay so we've got the svg we've got the span that looks really really really good and then let's now add some styling to it so for number one we see the categories and that the little icon is just not looking too good it's top to bottom you guys know the drill where did this one how to make it from left to right very simple drill that's right flex flex it flex flex it barely not forget it i don't know if you guys know what that is but all right flex nice nice nice also also with the span let's give it away someone say with dash eight just a little bit smaller okay oh no class width it's going to be width dash eight just make it a little bit smaller nice right or just actually give it a width okay and then what i want to do is i want to give the whole thing as some padding guys okay now because you can see this is always on the edge icon which i don't like i don't like that at all so what i'm going to do is i'm going to give a padding of six remember how we create this side by category so we can control it well if i just do p six boom you see it pushed everything from the inside right so it pushed everything from from oh wow that's right so from the left from the top from from the left right here from the right right here and of course on the top as well it pushed everything like that okay that's it and so then what we want to do is let's go ahead and also make it a font bold because it's bold right now so i'm going to say on here on the sidebar main category i'm going to say font dash bold so guys this is on the sidebar um categories that's right it's on the subject categories right main category yeah that's right so you've got the font bold that's looking all good and right now nothing nothing too crazy that we need to focus on too much right because let's it's not necessary right now so instead i'm going to do is the following let's go ahead and do this okay let's move on to the next one which is going to be this echo and alexa which is not the main category but it's it's a subcategory so i'm going to create another div right now right there so let's put another div underneath this okay and then i'm going to say div class is equal to and here i'm going to call it a sidebar also i'm going to call this side by my cursor so i'm going to sidebar sidebar dash main dash category gory okay great and this is going to have a a spin span of what uh echo and alexa not m but and alexa good echo and alexa okay and then here's what i'm gonna do we're gonna also going to put the span of the svg image so i'm gonna say s span but there is no svg it's an interesting portion right it's an empty span with the width of 8 look why because that is what will align everything else together so if i look at it like this right and i simply just copy whatever we have here so for example we have all these classes for this sidebar main category i'm going to copy all these text yellows and stuff like that i'm going to put it in the class right here boom save that go to the amazon see very simple right a similar structure but of course i don't want that just like that so i want to remove the text yellow because we don't need that right now okay okay and instead of to do text white nice text and white okay now of course if i made this bigger you can see that it will expand later on to something so right there right there good good good good then also what i'm going to do is i'm going going to give it a small uh what's it called a small padding and also i want to give it a a some small part margin so for the margin of categories i'm going to go to the margin of categories i'm going to say margin bottom dash four but that pictures everything else and i'm gonna do p dash two to give it some padding as well just again it's creating a lot of space which which is what i like okay so we got text white we got the items uh what's it called it's it's in there as well um we have the p2 we've got that we got that let's go ahead and now copy this okay and all we do is now replicate this i'm gonna say copy and now just keep replicating it so i'm gonna copy paste it pasta i like to call it and then instead of act on alexa i'm going to say what jesse i'm gonna say kindle let's say kindle boom done okay there's that one i'm going to copy this one again i know it's crazy just copy pasting huh then we have books that's what thank you jesse i want to copy again i'm going to say electronics there we go and i'm going to copy one more time and bro this time we're going to say uh home and garden nice then one last time i'm going to copy and paste gonna say uh fashion nice save that amazon oh that looks horrible i mean not that bad actually not actually not that bad not that bad so i think we just need to give every single one of our sidebar main categories a little bit of maybe padding or a little bit of margin so that they're spaced out a little bit more because i feel like they're not spaced out uh enough am i right jesse but wait now it looks good wait where you refreshed it um i don't like it i think we can we can space it out even more a little bit honestly oh you mean like the bottoms yeah yeah well we have to give it the march margin bottom each of those categories then right that's right so i'll do that right now okay um i would say a margin bottom of about four something i would say two i'll say margin bottom two jesse merchant button two that's right bottom two so let's go to the echo alexa and we'll do uh for this one we'll do mb2 save that that pushes more to the bottom then we go to the other one we'll do mb last year for this one okay push a bit more let me see here so i can show it to you guys there we go nice nice okay same thing with the books and b there's two thank you just oh dang jesus is right in running in multiple places she's fancy all right right there that just pushed a little bit more watch out which i like and i think this margin bottom three four is a little too big i'm gonna say margin bottom three instead yeah maybe maybe remove the margin fully let's see yeah i kind of like that and then also what i want to want to make sure that this does happen if you take a look at our categories you can see that our echo and our alexa kind of are on the same step page you see that from the left to right hand side this is kind of the same page the white the reason why that's not happening is there's a few reasons why that's not happening it's actually because of one we have a padding here but we don't have a padding here so if i do for example p2 right okay see right there echo and alexa just align together you see uh a line's good with the categories same thing with the other ones also p dish two boom boom aligned together next one p dash two but padding two guys what is it what is this heading two guys means padding on all sides of the div so left right top bottom p dash two a p dash two p dash two um because we've added a padding we might not need the margin so actually remember remove this for a second i i know we do this for no reason why boom boom save that hey now it's clean that's the way i like it okay good one thing i want to add now at this point is this right here is called the active uh page right category this is called the active page and so whenever i hover over this i'm gonna have it like this but this is called the active page so we need to create that active section okay to create the access section let's go ahead and go back to our choo choo let's go we need to go back to our amazon app right here and i need to give it a background color so we need to say for example you need to say here so let's go to our cyberman category the categories one right let's give the background color and we say bg gray so go ahead jessie bg grayson hundred pg gray 700 boom okay we have the bg gray 700 now let's now edit the round corner so let's add the rounded corners now jesse okay um they're rounded how how rounded do we large large r large so rounded dash lg nice let's go ahead and save that okay looking much much much much but better let's also make it a course cursor pointer if we don't have it just yet we do have that we do have that where is it okay we do save that okay good looking really good okay i'm liking this i'm looking where it's going now just like how we have it on here same situation right let's go ahead and add a hover and let's do sell on amazon and then help so let's focus on these few ones okay so let's do sell on amazon let's do those ones so i'll scroll down okay we have this div so i'm gonna say i'm gonna copy pasta this one and then let's do this one i'm going to say here sell on amazon amazon right just how we have it in our last section and now we have help boom and then this is going to be help boom boom help right so save that one and then let's go ahead and do the phone let's go ahead and add a class to it that's going to be or not nsvg of the following so we have this vg for the percent so if i go to percentage sign let's go to hero icons oh they don't have percent that's sad why would you not have percent it's such a simple icon i know but you know that's that is what it is so that's okay in that case what we'll do is we'll use another icon library called fund awesome fund awesome right there okay let me go and get go to it good good good good let's go to uh icons let's search up uh search no not search but uh what is it called percent nice good so we've got the percent icon let me see let me see where it's at right there so i'm going to go to this one okay and so this tells we need to use this icloud so it's copy html i'll give it to you guys in html right now all right let's do it right now together boom i class that's good let's put that into our span which is to sell on amazon good right there and of course it's not going to show up guys but check this out if i go to the document or if i go to my amazon 2.0 you can see it's not really going to show up why is that because we have not imported the font awesome just yet so what do we do is we actually have the font awesome ready for you i have already right here so you can copy and paste it let me see let me see let me see let me see let me see let me oh come on come on lazari i'm trying to get it for you guys there we go i've got the font awesome link for you here boom boom ooh fun awesome no no not not that one not that one hold on guys no not that one either oh it is that one hold on i want to make sure it's all good oh yeah that's the one so right here let's go do it here so let's put it near the our other link and so this is going to be our link for font awesome so everybody with me yes everybody got it everybody got it just copy that put it into your link rail okay michael do you need to pay if i find awesome no you don't no you don't no i don't so now if i do this i class thing check this out all of a sudden it shows up oh oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah okay we got the sound now is that let's do the help now icon let's do the help icon this this kind of gives you some exposure different types of icons libraries so help or a question or whatever it is come on no no this one question circle click on that one click on this copy html boom and then i'm going to give it into eye class just like that right there nice nice nice nice nice okay beautiful so that is working all good i'm liking this let's go ahead and go back to our document see how that's working all right so let's go to create the hover section this is a really cool part about telling css by the way just want to let you guys know okay so let me go ahead and do this second here second here this is the really cool part about about uh taylor success is that they have hover solutions so if i go to if i go to css and i say hover hover back bg background right there so you can see for example i can say hover and then on the hover whatever i want it to be so maybe it's bg red in my situation i'm gonna say hover and i'm gonna say the following i'm gonna say hover and then let me just make sure it's all good oh right here right here right here right here hover bg gray 700 right here guys bg grayson hunter so i'm gonna say hover on the sell on amazon look at this guys right there okay hover on this one hover on this one let's see how that works out all right okay it's there okay but it still looks hideous which is okay because we need to do a rounded so i'm going to say there's the following now let's say rounded excel for the cell on amazon see this looks good looks good looks good and then let's do rounded as well this excel for the other one too so for this one as well nice look at that guys look at this what do you guys think so far we've got the sidebar uh maybe just maybe give it a little more space and that's the only thing i would say that margin bottom maybe four so let's do this right here on the cell on amazon let's do mb4 just so we space it out just a little bit more yeah there we go i'm liking this now this i'm liking now hey let's go so we've got that portion now guys okay that's good let's go and continue on so sidebar is this looks so nice all right thank you guys so much sidebar is done only one more section down to go which is going to be what it is now in this section now this section is a lot of fun actually and i'm like when this to you right here it's a lot of fun because we get to build this really cool banner okay we get to build this really cool popular categories and then we get to build the hot deals section and that's it you guys still with me you guys stay with me stretch it out if you have to i know we've been here for a long time come on guys keep it up all right good good good good good so let's go and continue on all right we did all this kind of stuff all righty let's go okay so browse products the first thing we need to work on is going to be the banner let's go back to our code all right let's go back to our code and our code is a lot of different things we've got the header we've done that so pay yourself on the back for that header is good okay we've got the main section the sidebar categories that's good practice something by opponent for that okay i'm putting myself because i'm proud of myself is that how petting yourself on the back yeah that's how i pat myself in the back i love it that's right so now we've got the main section okay and in this main section the first thing we're going to focus on is going to be this main banner jesse right so it's going to create this banner jesse are you by the way in the calibration section or no are you celebration are you collaborating with me i'm yes i am i am i am cool let's go ahead i always am collaborating with you okay well i'm just saying yes i am collaborating with you okay so that said guys first of all we are gonna get that banner from somewhere of course so if you look upon the amazon website you'll see lots of fun uh banners you can actually choose from which are mostly just a big horizontal pictures okay so nas if we can go to the amazon side yes amazing let me i like my recent order guys you guys seen my recent order that's a pretty cool order guys no what is it [Laughter] it's a dart dart nerf gun nerf gun okay i knew that too well huh yeah i got little cousins yeah that's why so so but you see by the house that's it guys so these right here that's what they have is they have these specific sections right here you see for example this is their they're promoting without the fast and furious right now right but for example uh this one right here is is oh dang it's on prime that's pretty cool i should probably watch that big diesel yo yeah yeah but anyways we're not sponsored by them so let's continue on but they had these better images and so we found this really cool banner image that looks a lot like kind of like this right which just talks about we ship over 45 million products around the world and the image that is is here's the link so actually i have the link for you right here let me give them the link right here jesse okay i'm getting the link right here in a second here i don't see the link though but you copied it no i know oh because it's not oh okay i know i know i know i know actually i know the language no i know i know it now yeah so you know where it is okay great so here's the link guys i'm gonna give it to you guys and zoom and for those of you for those of you on youtube because can copy it as well so i don't know why do we discontinue chat and zoom there we go so here's your link on zoom guys okay and those of you who are on youtube don't worry about it we'll figure this portion out so let's go ahead and create the div we're gonna we'll need to create the difficult main section banner so i'm gonna say here div div class is equal to main dash section dash banner okay that's going to be our main section banner div right and for this main such a better div we're going to give it a height and we're going to give it a width as well all right uh so let's give it a high jessie and this height is going to be let me see where it is yeah about 10 i would say or wait no bigger yeah i would say probably h of 44. yeah i would say probably h of dash 44 44 indeed yeah right that's right that's right yeah honestly that's that's a that's kind of the most the most of it um but once we've once we've got that that's that's only to focus on right because here's why here's why um i'm gonna save this here for a second and i'm going to go to my style assistant remember how we link the stylus css so you see this style sheet right here where do we we have this style sheet which is coming from tail and css let's link our own style the css because here's why so i'm going to go ahead and do link rel is that is that because we're trying to make a button browse products on top of an image that's right that's right that's right so i'm gonna say here i'm gonna say style.css right there okay that's right and then inside of my own install this is css i'm gonna say main what is it called main section banner dash banner okay banner right there and now i'm going to give the background image guys this is where this difference is the reason why it's not our html because we're given the background because why we have things on top of it you see we have this is going to be a background image and then this button is on top of that background image so that's why we're doing a background image on there so to make a background image we say background dashboard dash image and all we do is what we say url we give it a url and the url is just the url that we got which is going to be this one right here those of you who are on youtube feel free to feel free to figure that figure to copy paste that one thank you for adding those parentheses that's awesome if we save that now and we go back to amazon 2.0 nothing's going to happen nothing absolutely nothing because why and i'm trying to figure out why actually right now but i know why because of flex it's because of flex so if we we need to kind of go back to the main screen and we need to say flex on it so here's if i go to insta.html and i go to my main section i inside here i'm going to say hr44 but i'm going to say with with dash full okay do you have any of that no uh not necessarily no no no let me go right click inspect download this one let's see what's going on in here so it's not showing up for some reason but i'm sure there's a reason for it so main okay main is good get the sidebar we got the main section oh that's why that's why that's why that's why that's that's why why why why that's right so what's going on here is look at this so you guys pay attention this okay you see what's going on here is that we have flex right here okay and so this is right here the full this whole full thing that's flex right right there right then let me go and make that happen again so you guys can see it okay we have sidebar categories oh they're com nice huh what they're coming to get you i know i know i know so i'm just gonna come in together okay so we have the main section and then we have the main section banner okay um but here's the thing so this main section guys has no width right now because if you see it look at this so main section right nothing right i look at the sidebar it has a width but this has nothing it's zero it has a height which is great but it's zero well how do we make it a width of 100 or how do we make it sure that this main section just takes out the rest of the width honestly it's not that hard because with flex if i go to tillman css and i say for example flex flex it says flex that's right flex 1 flex 1 is what's going to make sure that it actually stretches out as much as possible so i will go back to my application here ah so if we give it a flex one the main section will take up all of the remaining space that is available that's right that's right so i'm gonna say flex one so i'm going to save that hey you see right there see just like that oh there we go i know i know hey but you're part of that so i'm like yay yeah yeah i still i still got my still not got my groove you know that's good so let's go back to the main section let's also give it some padding guys because i like that padding right here i'm gonna say padding i'm gonna say padding dash six right that's going to push everything to the side all right good next thing you know we have the image inside here which is great that's exactly what we want to have but we need to center the image because right now just kind of wonky just kind of everywhere which i don't like so if we go inside the css and instead of doing a background image like this i'm going to say the following i'm going to say background position center so right away you see it's going to position the back on center but then the following and i'm then i'm going to say background size cover and so we'll cover what cover does okay just and pay attention to this cover is going to try to fill up as much of the container as possible while making sure that it does fill it all up so basically you will know exactly that it will fill it all up but i will try to fill it up so as much as possible so the width of the actual image is always going to be a hundred percent of the width of the pant container right that's why that's so important and so then we're going to do if we go back to inside html this makes sense better in order to make a round what do we do guys tell me what do you do to make a round who remembers who remembers what do we do who remembers radius that's right we do radius but until still says who can figure out what we do until in css yeah that's right so we can do rounded that's right we'll do rounded dash lg actually i'm gonna say rounded let me see i'm gonna say rounded dash lg oh save that and nothing's going on right now as well oh wait what happened here hey actually it is there we go rounded dash lg there we go that looks pretty pretty dang good okay so then the next thing we need to do after that is we need to add that browse product so let's go ahead jesse let's go ahead and add that button jesse yeah for sure so the button i always like to make the buttons myself you know so i'm going to give it a div class i'm going to call it button okay and yeah the text inside of the button of course is going to be browse products so inside of this div i'm just going to say browse products okay like that very simple okay then of course i'm going to style the button up what's the background color it is white so i'm always starting off with background color which is background white i know that the width is i'm going to give it the 36 and i'm going to give a height of 10 okay so i should see something square come up boom there it is nice it's super ugly boom but let's make it better okay there it is we're gonna make it rounded okay and i think it's for full rounded because it has it's like a full circle yes but as you can see the browse products the word those words are not like centered right so it's super ugly still so i'm going to give it a flex i'm going to say justify center and i'm going to say items center so it is totally in the middle of that button okay in the middle of that do i need to i think i need to give it some padding is that correct no no you're good you're good you're good that's working correct yeah okay i think then on the left side i'm going to give it some margin four okay so it doesn't touch the left side i think did it help of course it is going to help well i did yes i did but also but it also added margin to the top so make sure it's margin left for jesse okay oh margin left four okay sorry about that okay okay nice good and okay let's give it a cursor pointer because once we're you know hovering over the button we wanted to get that little hand plus guess what that button is now at the top of the banner mmhmm so how do we make it so how do we switch that so the button if you if you you could either like we're centering uh like we're centering things vertically you can also put things at the end vertically that's interesting so on the parent container on the main section banner i'm gonna say um i'm gonna say flex of course flex and i'm going to say items end and okay i lost the g of yeah i think i got you gotcha oh okay okay i like it i like how this is going then of course there's a margin bottom we should add because now the button is touching the end so that's why i think i had marge 4 not as ml but just like this okay let's save that hey okay i see what you mean okay good good good good now let's go ahead and change the color of the of the text oh yeah so what's the color of the text um that is orange that gorge class so let's first make it an h4 let puts browse products inside of it okay and you can give also this h4 you can also give it a class for tailwind okay and you can hold just easy like this text hyphen bold and then boom we're going to make it that yellow significant uh amazon color boom hey let's go so over there i got the product the brows products button that's it that's all you guys need to do right you've created div that's just simply just a button right it's got all these different classes like justify center item items uh center right to make them centered right and then that creates the centering of the products okay and that's it that's all you guys need to do all right so we've got our word banner that's done guys you guys still with us yes yes yes yes brian samir darius monique good good good good our next portion is going to be popular categories so let's go ahead and get those okay um yeah this one's so fun these categories so we've got the main section we've got the main section better let's create another div here div i'm going to call it class it's equal to mean mean i want to section yes and i'm going to create one last div here that's going to represent the hot deals okay the hot hot hot deals so i'm gonna say do inside here div class is equal to what so it's not funny i mean the section dash deals that's okay let's close this one up save that in there all good all good oh good that's looking great let's focus now on the popular category so what do we have in there well the first thing we need to take a look at is we've got this text popular categories and then we have a few of these little svg icons that represent the categories okay so let's create the text first jesse okay let's create our text first yep so very simple guys again i'm just going to say start off with an h1 class and i'm going to say popular oops that it has to be inside of it of course that's right yeah otherwise otherwise popular categories okay and again i can style this up of course so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say clause and let's give it that popular categories tag okay and first of all what i notice about this is it's a bold font okay so we're going to say fon bold again how you get that is if you go to tail and css if you say bold for example right that gives you right there see font bold and that just translates to a css class property called font weight 700 that's it and it's so easy to work with that guys because once you know these utility classes once you know the name of it you just go like oh phone bold or font extra bold or whatsoever so that's it let's continue okay fawn bold and then text gray 700 whoops oh good so text create that's right text create 700 and then once you've got i'm going to save that yep save that all right beautiful all right let's give it a bigger font size can you give it a bug bigger font size jesse awesome yeah you can so that's very easy until when you can just say text and normally you can say xl but if you want it really big twice as big you say 2xl your light just keeps falling it's so funny then there was light lights i am the light okay so that said guys now we have popular categories but what else do we see next to popular category i don't know we see a star guess what a star oh do i get a star star like the star i'm a star i like stars i like stars so it's going to search for i know i know so let's let's search it for a star okay right here and here's the star right here from svg let's copy our svg for the star i'll paste it in for you guys oops right there that's your star okay let's paste it our star into where where's our star jesse after the h1 correct all right boom let me see here let me see where our star is look at the star what's pretty start show me the star that's right so straight so pretty so what do we do now with that star though jesse well a few things we need to make sure we need to make sure it's from left to right so the first thing to do is the fact that i'm going to say hey you know what flex it flex it yeah flex it um wait are you going to flex no inside i would i would flex it inside of the sv popular popular category yeah okay okay okay so okay yeah that's fine that works too sometimes yeah that works too so i put the svgs at the each h1 guys okay there we go yeah all right so that it's the same color as the popular categories and then i'm going to say flex on the each one yeah on each one i'm going to say item center yes boom there you go oh guys look at that now the categories popular categories h1 is perfectly aligned with the star next to it due to flex and item center okay and justify let's go ali auntism there sorry so that said guys let's change up the star to be honest because the star is a little bit on maybe the big side what do you think not yeah so i'm gonna say let's go and give it a class jesse yeah yeah and then um a height of six and change it to yellow so text yellow 400. okay can we save this oh get the glories that's an interesting one that's a glorious that's not correct yeah so let's save that one good something happened with that one popular cat so somebody said there's already class in svg sometimes tailwind indeed already gives his own class so you need to remove that second class only have one class in your svg there we go popular okay guys okay good i like i'm liking that one okay so it looks pretty good now however always when you work with text or when you work with sexiest guys there's always one thing you always want to make sure which is like we did with the other things spacing oh yes it's okay right that's so important so let's give this main section categories at the total top you know so it's not touching the banner here but i'm highlighting here let's give this a margin bottom of 10. okay let's see what happens now no so the main section category i think what you want to do instead on this one is let me see margin bottom 10. oh it's not live reloading i think that's why oh yeah open live live server let me see the chat one time no the same thing so inspect element let's see let's see what's going on it's okay you can always find out what's going on here just by looking into it so we got the h1 which is here we've got the main a qualities oh okay so it's not respecting the main section so um okay that makes sense that makes sense why i see i see where it's coming from okay instead what i would do sometime instead of doing like a margin uh margin bottom on the main categories what i would do is actually margin top i think that's a little bit better instead of down instead of doing that ah okay sorry wait margin top so save that there we go my live surfer working oh yeah okay on top that's right so we've got the popular categories there next thing we need to do is we need to create these little icons this is going to be really interesting so let's go and create those icons jesse okay so yeah you go ahead and do that i would first um i would first have more control i would put all of these icons in another diff okay so i'm going to make a diff class called categories okay categories and inside of these div categories so like this guys be a little patient and then of course we're gonna put each icon inside of this diff called categories okay so the first one is an icon of let's call it um desktop okay so icon desktop okay and we're going to give it a height of 20 and a width of 20. okay let's start our start off with this first okay so wait 20 okay and then close this off and inside of the div of course we're going to have an svg class okay we're gonna have an svg class and guess what we are taking that spg class from the tailwind heroly icons library there we go okay i'm gonna paste it into here done thank you what a service wow so good that said inside of this svg we're gonna give it also a certain height and width again okay so spd class height or h12 w12 okay plus we don't want it to stay what is it now black we want it to be um grayish okay so text gray 500. okay and this is the spg itself that's right but look if we look at our design we saw that they have like white surroundings around it like a white background okay so let's go back to the on line 115 as you can see here to the icon and let's give it a background of white save that to make it rounded so rounded excel and are we seeing something now i see anything just yet and i know why it's because the actual background of this whole main section is very different so you see what we need to do because if you do background white it's not it's still white because the whole background is white the whole thing is white so what we need to do is we need to change the background of the whole actual main section and then that changes a lot yeah a lot of things exactly sorry that's right section that line 101 indeed has a background of grayish that's right so if i go to let's see scroll back up where is it if i go to the main site that's right so it's actually background g bg gray is it 900 or is it 100 huh no 100 100 thank you so let's save that 100 there we go see very big difference you see now we have that's there okay now we've got the white color so the difference from everything else now we need to do is we want to go ahead and actually center the desktop icon in between the whole div so let's do that right now jesse right so flex justify center you guys know the drill by now items center okay boom the desktop should be come into the middle nice there we go beautiful okay let's add a margin bottom on the whole thing okay let's do margin bottom margin bottom dash what five maybe yeah something like that it's never it's never uh actually i think it's cause something t flex never actually listens to me can i go so if i do categories right and lots of categories and i do marginal bottom it's because it's just not um let me just think here for a second hmm i don't i don't really see what's happening so i always make i always make things visible so let's give it a color oh i know why it's margin top guys holy moly my bad oh yeah there you go that makes sense okay great great margin top five okay good so we've got one icon let's go and continue to do the same thing but for the other icons right jesse right right right right right so um let's go to the next one okay we're gonna make this a little bit faster okay guys the next one is gonna be a gift right so icon gift and again i actually i'm just gonna copy paste the top here okay the top so i'm just kind of copied what i had on line 115 i'm just going to copy that and put it here boom and then inside of here i would have i would need that gift um svg so let's go back to here okay let's go to gift gift i'll be using this one or this one or the solid one we're using the solid one okay so copy svg oh you already got it never mind yeah so we've got we've got so again guys when you have the svg when you got the svg you're going to give it a height and a width of 12 just like we did with the previous icon and you're going to give it a text gray of 500. and that's it guys you're going to repeat this process uh another one two three four five times okay we also can need to we can also remove this class right here we don't need this class anymore which comes default right here what i would actually do jesse is i would actually copy the whole thing so copy this whole div okay yeah okay paste five times one two three four five awesome let me go back to amazon oh okay so okay what do we know now they're both vertical how do we make them horizontal well we know that the drill at this point it's going to be using flex right so we go to main section and then we say flex on here wait no not here we need to go to the category section no no on categories that's right yeah there we go nice nice nice beautiful beautiful okay one other thing we need to add is also margin or as a padding or margin right on every single category okay so let's do that as well but i would start doing that not from the first from the second one second icon on so from the second one i'm going to add to each icon i'm going to add a margin of 6. so guys this is a very neat trick which you can do in vs code you can select a word it has to be unique though it has to be unique so if you can see me highlighted i'm highlighting items hyphen center with a carrot next to it and then i'm going to say command and d d d d and you can see my cursor multiplying do you see that we don't really see it but probably it's there now you can do this ml oh shoot within the m quotes ml margin left of six so instead of adding margin right jesse added a margin left on on the second there are other icons okay so but there boom right there the only thing we are left to do with is we need to change these specific icons so instead of having the gift icon let's go ahead and there's a phone icon so i'm going to copy the phone icon i'm going to find the phone icon here phone device mobile so copy svg to this one let's go to our next one which is which one where is it where is it we've got this is the desktop one it's that one that's right that thank you so nice can we somehow i think people are probably going to be asking for the svg so is there some easy way we can provide that to them yeah i'm sure we could i'm going to go the device number one then the next one is going to be the the book the book icon book boom next one is going to be yep the camera icon yes next one after that is gonna be the home icon yeah i love that one where's the home icon then we have the music icon just this one basically for you guys to everybody to see boom then the last one is gonna be which one then we have the music icon light bulb one the final one is going to be the light bulb one just this one copy svg send to you guys boom libon there we go beautiful beautiful so we've got all these icons and looks like jesse's already covered it which is good and guys look at this the icons are already there it's all already done it is beautiful one thing i'll add is probably let's remove the margin left and the first icon just see that's the only thing i'll only think i will add on here let me go ahead and remove those popular icons for those marginal f6 on the first cycle let's remove that one so it's in line and so go to amazon boom done okay that's it so popular categories are done guys okay the next category wow i know looks really good it's really good so it's starting to really come together we have one last thing to do that's it guys one last thing you guys still with us you guys still with i know this is a lot it's a lot of stuff guys we're doing here okay a lot of things but it's okay stay with us we'll continue on okay so hot deals let's go ahead and do this so this point now we're working on is going to be something called the hot deal which is the products section okay first i'm going to create is going to create h1 so i'm going to do that right now so i'm going to put myself to the right hand side and i give myself more space so you guys can see me better all right first one each one okay that's gonna have a text of hot deals and the way i like to do these icons i'm just gonna do an emoji icon so fire emoji you just copy and paste it and it works honestly um now for this h1 of course same class of the last time i'm going to say class class and that's going to be equal to text dash to excel for a larger class font dash bold for a bold font and text dash gray 700 for a gray text and margin bottom dash 5 to add a margin bottom nice okay let's see how that looks looking good okay all right so looking pretty good so far next up let's gonna create the main uh the actual main section of products right so i'm gonna say div class and these are going to be the actual products which are these ones right here you see i'm just putting them into one div that's all i'm doing so i can put a margin around them and a padding okay so div class is equal to main dash section dash products product good so the products and honestly that's that's kind of it now we need to create one product someone say div this could be one product div class main dash product boom right there close that div we're all good my friends all right four that's right for the actual main product however hold on jesse okay okay that's fine so we can create a product image okay let's go and create the product image and then after that let's go to create a product name so let me let me cover that hold on just just hold that just so hold on hold on sorry sorry something we just type each other div class is equal to product dash name okay all right that's the product name what's nice that we have we have a product name that we have a uh what is it the product make so let's do uh that one's gonna be div class product dash make okay that looks good and then for that one what we have is what div uh class product dash rating okay which just stepping right now and the last one is going to be df class product dash price okay div class equals product product price okay okay we got that those are the four things we need to write and make work right now for the following uh deal right if you think about this we have a product image that in the product image what do we have guys what do we have in the product image what do you guys think well we have an actual image right so i'm going to say this let's say image class no class for now just empty class for now most problem i'm going to give it a source okay where am i going to get this source good question if i simply just go for example this is a nintendo switch if i go to google google if i just type in for example untitled switch then tendo so you can see i already typed it in beforehand right there that's so fun the nintendo switch i love to play mario kart yeah i've never played it no yeah you click on the title switch right click on these images copy image address and boom source is going to be equal that one so source is equal to that image address but we see that's it guys that's it so now if i go back to my document holy moly that's a big image that's okay that's it i know it's part of the deal that's right so then for the product name we got what nintendo switch so let's do that right now nintendo switch you can see how this turns around so fast 2019 there we go the product make is going to be nintendo good the product reading now these are the stars okay where do we get the stars well if you simply just type in star emoji star emoji again it just makes it easier for us boom star emoji i'm going to go this emoji star and i'm going to copy this star that's it just command c and then ctrl c if you're on windows and that's it so command c and now let's do how many stars you guys want to get from the nintendo switch how many stars you guys want to give them you guys want to be nice because oh five for sure how many stars come up four point five three point five four point oh damn you guys lied into the switch huh all right so i'm going to do one two three four five i'm going to say 4.5 how does that not now 5.4 4.5 right there okay i know and the product price is going to be 290 so i'm going to say here it's going to be like this 290 flat it's actually 290 i don't remember but that's okay right so we got that portion and if we look at our amazon it's pretty horrible right especially this image which looks horrible of all but this is where we can fix that because it's all dependent on how we do it okay so if we look at the main product okay and all we got to do is just add a width so i'm going to go to my my product image i'm going to say width is going to be 48 okay and the height is going to be 52 right and okay right there see i think a lot of things now change right things now change really really fast okay i'm going to give it a bg white for background color of white okay let me see save it come on zodie come on all right just doesn't like it no speech that's right no okay that's fine i'll just open life over again such as it happens first because you know we use like these really complicated live share programs and so it kind of happens sometimes it's okay not the worst of the cases all right okay bg white next thing what we're going to do after that one is we're going to give it a rounded section so i'm going to say rhonda lg dash lg dash lg that gives it a rounded corners okay and then um just i don't think that's it now the question i want us to figure out is how do we make sure let me ask you this how do we put this in the center this image in the center of everything right how do we do that what do you guys think how do you put this image the center of everything and there's a few ways to do it by the way there's a few ways to do it let's fuse to it so one of the ways to do it is to actually give it a width and height so if i go to the image and i say hey the width of this is going to be w dash uh full which is weight of width of 100 and a height of full which is a height of 100 and then i can do object contain guys object dash contain you see boom now it's in the center then if i add a padding tool at the same time like this and i say for example um on the actual uh what's called the actual image i say you know what let's do a padding let's do a padding of four p dash four it's going to push the image in and boom you see a lot a lot better it's time to look a lot better wow that's so unclean let's go to a product name and inside the product name what do we know well one is let's go ahead and change the uh color so i'm gonna say text dash gray dash what 700 so change the color first let's make it bold so i'm gonna say font dash bold save that okay great now it's bold let's do a margin top two just to give some spacing great all right and honestly it's gonna make it the text small so text dash sm oh okay much better next one nintendo is gonna be uh that's the actual make so let's do change the color to text green you see how easy it is to be changing all these different things so once you start to know all these classes 700 it's as green as your green screen naz huh it says green is your green i know same type of green i know i'll put voice over again it just keeps coming in and out for some reason i don't know why but that's okay okay and the product rating are we going to make that yellow yes yeah so text yellow how what's the number 300 300 300 okay right but we're not done with this product made because i want to make sure it's font bold as well so let's say font dash bold for this one nice and honestly that's pretty much it then for the rating we're gonna what give it a margin y of one so m y and y one there we go that gives us some spacing which is really good and then honestly that's it uh for that one and for the price let's go ahead and do also font dash bold right we'll do text gray dash 700 nice i'm going to text lodge for this one so guys you see here on line 171 you see mi hyphen one it means margin over the uh the yaxis so that means vertically so it's actually margin guess what top and bottom that's it top and bottom so if you would do from left to right it would be mx but we don't want to use that but that's just to show you how easy it is to use that until wind that's right and to learn that okay that's right that's right that's right so really cool with that so guys look we have done one product and now we all have to do is just replicate it and it's super easy because all i gotta do is copy pasta i know but don't worry later on i know what we could give at homework what well we could copy paste this but then they would have to fill in the details of the hot deals and they could even make hot their own hot deals that's good so maybe they actually do copy pasta they figure out their own products and then make sure it's from left to right that could be good too i kind of i like that i like the idea okay they could do that yeah so let's do this how about this go to hot deals i'm gonna do margin top here okay just to give us a margin top for the hot deal section okay i'm going to say mt dash 10 maybe or there's five there we go that's about it right jesse yeah that's about it there we go that's about it no no you now you have the original mmhmm there's there is no guys this is what we just built today nope not this one either this one like yeah yes so guys look it looks freaking amazing right got hot deals so for homework what i want you guys later on to do to actually is to actually create your own little products look we've got all these products right here right all these products right here right here all these products right here your goal will be to create just their own products that will be your homework for today guys so guys did you enjoy today's session and learn so much i know we went fast i know but trust me you just rewind this rewatches again and you will be all good okay let's see yeah anything else guys as you can see there was a lot of things that we repeated like by now if we want to line something up horizontally next to each other flex if you want to get it horizontally aligned in the center justify center or vertically item center so that sort of things throughout the video even if you watch it back you'll be sick of hearing that at some point so even though we get went fast today there's a lot of repetition once you get to understand it more once you hear it more often okay guys yeah that's it and that's honestly pretty much it all right at this point what do we have for them well pretty much they've got everything they've got all the they need to know you guys know your homework let's go over their actual homework before we get into q a guys all right okay so let's see five day javascript challenge let's get into the homework okay so there we go oh this is different homework hold on i got you this is a homework from the last one yeah because i made the homework just like that right yeah so the homework is going to be the following okay you need to customize your amazon the hot deals amazon 2.0 yes okay customize the products i want you to clone the current the current product and customize it customize the product you need to have to have at least i would say at least five products also my push for you is to you know what actually challenge yourself think about how well you can you can customize you know customize the colors of the of the amazon clone oh oh can you show them that really cool website nas thecoolars.com that's cool which one the coolers.com let's put it in the chat so if i go to here for example so cooler so c o o l o r s yes that one this guy's is such a cool website it is actually a color generator okay so once you're up on the side you can click that away and then at least indeed press the button start generator and you'll see a bunch of colors coming up that are matching due to their hex code so this side will calculate what kind of color scheme looks really well that's right and so based on the color scheme you like you just use that color scheme and apply it to your whole thing right so to customize the color color theme of of amazon of the amazon 2.0 announcement then what we want to do is take a screenshot of the lid of of the whole page of the website and now post a comment to homework post and also we will go ahead go ahead and uh share to an editable the link to the air table guys will be in the facebook comment and then you just click on that and then you will post a link there honestly go ahead i think i have the airtable link here i do okay um at least i thought i had it nope nope never mind no so we will make sure so we will post that air table link guys on facebook so make sure that you guys are there to check it out other than that oh no i have it i'm sorry i do have it guys you have to submit your homework of course so i am putting it inside of the zoom chat okay the airtable link where you can submit your homework so make sure to do that okay boom and also um of course if you haven't already guys please book a graduation call with us we love to connect with you and see how you've done in the five day coding challenge and how we can help you further okay so that is also still possible i'm going to share that link in the zoom chat okay plus of course if you haven't already but maybe you did it yesterday you can still join our discord community and just in discord community have engaging conversations ask for help give support okay be respectful of each other and most important learn from each other and have fun with code how does that sound guys sounds good sounds good sounds good so so look at this point guys very simple okay if anybody want the code by the way anybody want the cocos no you probably had nobody i'm i'm guessing no one here probably uh was able to fully keep up with me anybody was able to keep up with and actually and actually finish it up or no oh samir everybody wants to index that html really oh dang okay yes i finished darius i finished oh dang darius you finished it no way you're going to have to show it to us okay let's go let's go let's go okay so guys we're going to post the link um on github this is a github is for it's uh basically it's a it's kind of like a storage for your code okay think about like that it kind of like dropbox but for your code we'll put that in there so you can guys can go ahead and check that out okay that's going to be also posted on facebook uh in the facebook post all right so just stay tuned for that and you will see the whole index.html the whole project right so but of course i encourage you to if you want to copy it go to copy but i encourage you guys to put in your own piece of code and your own customizations to it later on okay does that make sense completely good good good good well right right now really quickly guys what you do is take a screenshot of this you guys have five seconds to take a screenshot of this whole web page or this whole uh what you see on this site on there in front of you you guys have
