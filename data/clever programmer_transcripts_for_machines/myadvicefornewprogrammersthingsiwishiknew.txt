to new programmers after coding for a couple of years it's a video that i got inspired to do because of fahad imran and i just came across his blog post so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take some of his important bullet points and speak from my experience on them number one focus on the fundamentals so i have to agree with fahad on this so many developers i see always trying to learn the hottest technology the newest framework the coolest thing that is happening around them they want to pick up react and on day two they want to pick up redux and then they want to go and learn see and then they want to learn what's angular about what's the difference between view then they want to start looking up cloud computing they want to look up the difference between firebase and aws stop focus on the fundamentals if you get the fundamentals right you solve everything get strong fundamentals and develop a strong ability to problem solve even when you try to apply to companies online you will see that they are looking mainly for somebody who is framework agnostic even if you apply to a react.js developer job number two please make lots of mistakes get good at making mistakes enjoy the process of messing up then starting over then doing it again the only true way to learn is to learn all the things you shouldn't do that's what leads to mastery number three stop relying on a single source of knowledge now whether this is college or a coding boot camp or some tutorial or youtube channel you find online don't rely on only one source go through a ton of different resources come to your own conclusions number four don't fall into tutorial hell you're going through course after course you're following what they're saying on free code camp on udacity on udemy on youtube on medium wherever it may be you're moving in circles you keep going from one tutorial to the next without making true forward progress what does true forward progress looks like it looks like you going out there in the field building projects completing them and putting them on your portfolio until you complete projects that you put on your portfolio you are not making forward progress number five stop trying to master everything you're not gonna learn every language every framework every technology it's not gonna happen pick one master it get good at it keep building things with it make it useful think about why you learn different languages english mandarin urdu hindi whatever the language may be why do people learn it well you don't just learn a language just so you can learn a language unless you're a polyglot the reason why you learn languages is so you can live in that country you can talk to the people you can date somebody you can get a job that's the point where you should be learning programming languages not so you could learn every programming language on the planet but you could so you could learn a language build things with it get a job with it make a career out of it solve problems help businesses help people so don't be a programming language [ __ ] with that said i hope you enjoyed this video smash the like button if you did subscribe to the channel and i'll see you in the next video you
