hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com and today I want to talk to you guys about uh soft skills and why you might need them now I know that a lot of people want to just focus on one thing and get really good at it I mean don't get me wrong I was I have been pretty much my whole life been that way you know I started in chess um and went crazy in chess played for a long time and now I'm in the top 1% in the world um but you know so I got really technical into it and then same thing with computer programming once I discovered programming I just started going crazy into it like I would be up 600 a.m. 700 a.m. every single day um and get very little sleep and just focus on learning it and getting better ated and acquiring better skills but one of the things that has benefited me the most so far has been developing soft skills and the reason why I say this is because like personally I'm a college student but I have gotten jobs and I have worked with clients where I have charged way more and I mean way more than some experts who have been working in the field for 30 years and literally know a billion times more than I do so the point is you know I'm not saying this so I'm trying to like brag or anything but what I'm trying to tell you guys is don't just focus on improving your skill in whatever field it is that you're working in also Focus on improving your skill set you know on negotiation people skills you know make sure people like you because one of the top reasons why people get promoted or the top like the easiest ways to get promoted and stuff is for people to like you because when they're having a meeting a lot of the times people are not sitting there and being like you know I think we should promote John or we should promote Charlene because she's this you know she's so skilled uh sometimes when people are sitting emotions are involved so they'll just be like you know I really like Charlene and she's good at her job or I really like John and he's really good at at his job so it really stems from people liking you and that'll put you in better places now negotiation right just the first thing that I mentioned it's something that in the United States especially people almost look down upon like no nobody works on their negotiation skills like and I felt like this as well I almost felt like negotiation was kind of like equivalent to haggling in a supermarket um but that's really not true negotiation is a key skill to develop in your in your life and use it to your advantage um because think about it in the interview that you're having at a job that you're going to be working on for potential the next 5 years 1 year 10 years however long if you negotiate incorrectly the money that you would have made in the first year you're now going to make in 5 years so you just added on four more years because you couldn't use those 15 minutes that you got to sit down for an interview wisely so even if you're just starting out in computer programming Great learn skills but before you get that first job please make sure you work on your soft skills and improve them that'll help you with your negotiation it'll help you with people at the job liking you which will help you with promotions and more than that it'll help you with potentially being able to get into upper management okay nobody wants a leader that they don't like I know plenty of really good programmers really skilled at what they do and this is again not just relating to programming I mean computer networking um you know people who are in uh in any political field whatever it may be that you're in right if you just focus on getting good at it there's plenty of people that are really skilled at what they do but they don't make enough money right and that's the end of the day no matter how satisfying our job is we are doing it to make money and money allows us to spend more times with our family spend more time with our friends because realistically I mean let's be real if you already had all the money that you needed you wouldn't be doing a job no matter how much you love it right um I mean you might still do something that you love but you probably wouldn't be doing a job you might run your own business right so at the end of the today we are doing a job for money in return right so don't you want to get good at that right don't you want to get more skilled at those things so really focus on improving those and please take the time out do yourself a favor take the time out to learn about negotiation skills improve them okay I'll put some links for you guys below these blog posts are not written by me but I've read these and these have helped me tremendously you guys can read some books as well maybe I'll find some books and put them in the links below um but yeah I just wanted to take out some time and just talk with you guys for a second all right guys this is kazzy I'm signing out peace
