hey guys what's up this is ky from clever program.com first of all do you guys think that my barber shop kind of butchered my hair if you think my hair sucks could you please comment that below so I could show my barber all right anyways um what I wanted to talk about today was your circle of influence the five people around you and there's a reason why to say that you're the average of your five people around you more than that they statistically shown that you're not only just like hand waving Le the average of five people around you in a way that you can't quantify there's actually a way to quantify this too even your income is the average of the five people around you and that's generally true so with the people that you're around you need to be careful with who you spend your time with and again I'm not saying you need to stop hanging out with your brother or your best friend or whatever right that's okay you can have those people in your life but there are certain people who you spend time with that'll actually motivate you to go to the next level they'll actually want you to do things that can help you achieve better things and improve your goals personally you know I spend a lot of time with my family and it's awesome every time I spend time with them it's great but it's never something that makes me want to achieve more goals because you know not everybody wants to talk about business or not everybody wants to talk about achieving more goals I mean sometimes it's okay to just relax and have fun and there's nothing wrong with that but I've surrounded myself at this point with friends who are always continuously pushing me while I'm pushing them to achieve their goals so you know a lot of my friends are into fitness or they want to uh learn maybe some kind of martial arts and I'm constantly pushing them to achieve that goal and I genuinely think that people who care about you that's what they should be doing instead of being okay with you sitting on your ass because sometimes inside it makes them feel okay about themselves right and even if they're not trying to intentionally do that generally people want you to get to their level just so they're comfortable even if they have no ill intention or they don't want to do any harm to you or whatever right but it's something that you need to understand on how people psychology works whatever stage of life people people are comfortable at that's where they'll want you to go so somebody who is behind you somebody who is not at the level that you're trying to get at they'll only bring you down to their level you need to surround yourself with people who are up at the top or who are where you want to go and again they don't have to be fake people you don't have to kiss ass to be their friend right they you can genuinely find people who are your good friends and are maybe even one step ahead of you and what happens then is that they want to pull you to their level because that's what's comfortable for them and they want you to get at the higher level of success and that gives you a way to motivate yourself and get to the next challenge you know those are some dangerous words when people try to make themselves feel content people will say I'm happy living the life that I'm living I'm living the dream my life is absolutely perfect come on sometimes you have to take a break I'm always busy so I have to come home and relax really you have to watch 40 hours of TV you know theyve proven statistically they've shown that Americans watch 40 hours of TV every week every week I mean that's an insane amount of time watching TV I became top 1% in the world for my chess rating and you know how I did it I literally replaced watching a TV show with watching a chess tutorial that took my skill to the next level like I would literally come home and when I would be eating food that's generally when I would watch TV and all I did was just replace TV with watching a chest tutorial and I watched something that was fun for me for you it could be something else maybe you like arts and crafts watch a tutorial on Photoshop watch a tutorial on arts and crafts I don't know whatever it is for you and by changing my surrounding of a video help me improve my level now changing your surrounding of actual people around you can 10x that can go 10 times that so that can tremendously help you get to your goals so you know sometimes you have to think of it consciously and it doesn't feel natural and I get that but it's okay like you have to consciously look around you for people who are more successful than you or at least who are a few steps ahead of you and I know it doesn't feel comfortable being around them because then you feel like a failure but that's good because you should try to make yourself feel low so you can get to the next level don't let it hurt your selfesteem right like that's your way of getting to the next level it's like picking up a dumbbell that you can't lift but you're like holy like that's the level I want to get to that's how you should try to treat it so have a few people that you can follow and replace certain things like if you watch TV shows you can watch them that's totally fine but if you're eating and you realize that's a pattern every day watch something that you enjoy it doesn't have to be the most boring to death tutorial watch something that's actually maybe a little bit fun but it has to do with what you're learning or what you want to learn and improve at so it could be like a fun live stream of some person you watch doing Photoshop or playing a video game if you want to get better at video games whatever it is for you right I watch jitsu videos CU I love JiuJitsu and I love martial arts so I'll watch JiuJitsu training instead of or like JiuJitsu Fighters fighting and I'll be picking up techniques while I'm eating so I'm enjoying but I'm also picking up new techniques so change the things around you in a comfortable way where it's not like you have to pull your teeth to make those things work but start noticing each thing and start changing them so change your habit of the people you hang out with right if all they do is just nothing that's not a person you want to spend a lot of your time with if you're watching too many TV shows that are nothing replace that with a tutorial if you're listening to music all the time I mean music doesn't achieve anything great for you if it helps you focus and do something productive great but I know a lot of people just listen to music for the hell of it and I did so I did that and I still do that but if you just replace your music with like listening to audiobooks that's another one of those life hacks that can change your life so your friends around you be more conscious I of them still be you know Bros with your Bros or if you have your girlfriends that you're really good with you know for your ladies out there if you have your friends who you're really tight with I'm not saying to leave any of them I'm just saying be more conscious of adding some new people into your circle of friends that are ahead of you so it makes you want to get at that level make yourself a little bit uncomfortable change your habits of what you watch change your habits of what you listen to in a very simple way and it will have a dramatic impact on your life all right that's it I'm out and I love you guys so much leave a comment on my haircut guys come on seriously tell me help me out here okay I want to make sure that I you know I don't look horrible um all right I love you guys I'll see you in the next video bye
