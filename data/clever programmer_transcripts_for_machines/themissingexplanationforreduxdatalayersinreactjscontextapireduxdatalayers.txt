i just want to like visualize what we're doing here so guys we're the data layer that sunny is talking about we've explained it in a few uh other of our videos so we're not going to go too much into detail of it but i kind of just want to touch base on it a little bit but in this data layer we're going to have the user and we want to be able to access this user from anywhere in our app so for example whether we have our app you know here um and then this connects to like our different components that we have in our app so like what would be one of our components like chat yep so chat uh what other components do we have like header sidebar header yeah okay so i'm just gonna draw them in like kind of random areas okay so i'm just gonna draw uh we have like other components like sidebar and we also have other component like header and what we want to be able to do you guys is instead of doing something called prop drilling which is a problem like to access user you know we'll have to like go inside of app and then chat and then this and then access user like that instead of that we want to have a data layer on the on you know just imagine like one bucket and then we can access the user from anywhere within the app so if we want to use them within our component of chat we can just directly use it if we want to access it in sidebar we can directly use it instead of like if app knows about user then the way we access users to like drill down every single level so that's what we're doing right now with all the technology when we talk about redux or when we talk about context apis what we're really talking about is this main concept called data layer this thing right here and it's just this bucket that we keep on the side that we can instantly access that's it okay it has all these complex terms like redux and state managers and this and that and the other freaking thing but in its simplest form is i want to be able to use this as fast as possible that's it and have direct access to it anywhere i'm at exactly i think that was such a clean breakdown guys and i really really think if that if that helped you out guys all with us smash the thumbs up button yeah do that [Laughter] that was actually really clean now you because that's quite a people get very scared by that sort of explanation guys but it's all that sort of the idea of the react context api and like you saw it's actually a very simple concept it's just a case of once you implement it once and practice with it it will make sense and you get to use it okay so nice so with that said let's jump in so we've got to basically set so what cause he showed
