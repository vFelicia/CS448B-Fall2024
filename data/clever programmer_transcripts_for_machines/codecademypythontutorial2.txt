hey guys how are you doing last time we stopped at 10% so let's continue from here so that we were going through the Python course and I want to do this challenge and just try to finish Codecademy as fast as I can while trying to explain what's going on here okay so now we're doing explicit string conversion so I have a plus coconut so this would basically write out I have two coconuts okay so if I took this and like I was showing you guys whoops that's not what I meant to do if I opened up my terminal here let's make the screen a lot bigger so you guys can see clearly and let's open up I'm trying to open a Python too and if I do Python here and I tried this line you see I get I have two coconuts okay another website I want to show you guys that's really great that you can use to use a terminal just in case you're having some problems or you're using Windows to follow along you can use this website called repple it ok and in this website you can pretty much choose what language you want to use so here let's say you want to use Python 3 so you can write the same thing down except in Python 3 print as a function so you have to put parentheses around it and let me make this one bigger as well so you guys can see it clearly and I'm going to hit run and you see it says I have 2 coconuts so this is like an interactive IDE or tournament this is an interactive terminal that you guys can use so I would highly suggest to use repple dot it for for you're using your terminal if you don't know how to use one on your computer ok so this is a situation we have here okay and they're showing us what this is going to do here so let's see the run the code as is and it says you're going to get an error and now what does the air it says it says cannot concatenate string and float objects so you can't combine the value of pi is around so this is a string and a float number float number is a number with decimal values so it says you can't can concatenate these two so we need to turn both of these into a string so how are we going to do that well we're going to wrap through 3.14 in a string and that's going to take care of it for us the value of pi is around 3.14 okay so let's continue going alright string one came lot camelot string two is place let's not go two percent s two so silly percent s all this does is called a placeholder so we wrote this string here okay we write this string here and percent s is going to basically act like variables okay so the first percent s is going to match with this string one here and the second percent s is going to match with string two here so this is going to say let's not go to Camelot or a came lot and then it's going to say this is silly and then string two is going to get inside of here so place so that's what that's going to say let's not go to Camelot is a silly place those are just you know you're in string formatting those are your placeholders so you can put anything that you want for them okay all right string formatting percent to raw input what this does is it takes in data from the user and assigns it to a variable so for example let me open up here let me show you here maybe it let's run it um okay so let's let's open up my terminal because this is not Python too so there are some things that it does at our Python 3 specific let's try it here so name takes in as raw input so it's basically taking in the user input so it's going to let me type in the name and whatever I type in it's going to make name equal to that value so let's say my name is Rafa or Kazi whatever you want to type in let's hit enter now let's type name and you can see name is Kazi all right and generally when you write stuff like this you want to put a little space here so it looks nicer so when it asks you what is your name it puts a little space there so you can you can write whatever you want okay now if I type name you can see it's clever programmer so that's what ronpa does cause same thing you'll ask you for a request with then the message is going to say what is your quest and then you get to type in the value that you want okay so basically if I don't put any message here and make it empty it's letting me tight but it's not telling me what I should be typing so it's nice and more user friendly when you actually have a message like what is your name there here I don't know how to type if I wrote 4 3 4 3 4 and didn't name well I didn't know I was trying to put in a name I thought maybe I was trying to put an ID number because it didn't ask me so I just assumed so you don't want your the people that you write a program for you don't want them to assume you want to clearly give them instructions what they should type in okay so quest it's going to take in some input from you color is going to take in some input from you as well and then it's going to say so your name is blank your quest is blank and your color is blank don't remember the placeholders and we're just going to replace this with placeholders so % s this name is going to get into this percent s here I'm going to do % us and % s so it's going to take in name quest and color by having us type it and then it's going to put all of that in these % s s the last thing we have to fix as this needs to also turn it actually this is just going to be a % so this is just some syntax stuff now let me run it what is your name Kazi what is your quest walkthrough of code Academy and what is your favorite color ma blue ah so your name is kasi your quest is walkthrough of code Academy and your favorite color is blue so this is a very nice way of printing out stuff it's really cool okay next so now this time for review now for something completely familiar good job you've learned a lot in this unit including three ways to create strings okay we learned string methods so you can create a string by putting single quotes you can create a string by creating a double quotes around the word and you can create a string by putting string and not having to put the quotes around it okay now you learn string methods if you have a string and you call the method dot upper on it everything turns into upper if you have echo like this let me make it more interactive for you guys echo lower and if I try Delta upper you can see that it made Delta an uppercase a length of Charlie what do you think that's going to give you so take a second to think about it it's going to give you one two three four five six seven so the number of characters as in Charlie printing a string print Foxtrot it simply just prints out your string okay advanced printing technique so golf hotel and then we use this string formatting here so these little place holders like percent s and then it takes the value of jean this percentage takes the value of H okay let's try to run that to see golf comma hotel that's what I got so let's wrap it all up on line three create the variable my string and set it to any string you like hello programmers and print online for print the length of my string so how are we going to do that we're going to do print Len of my string and on line five we're going to say we're going to print my string in uppercase okay so that's how we're going to do that okay so we created a string hello programmers we printed out the length of my string which is 18 characters and then we printed out the actual string but we make sure we made sure we uppercaste everything so this is nice because you don't have to write caps lock you don't have to use caps lock here okay date and time let's start the lesson so oh cool so date and date time import date time why is it asking me about date time because that's a little bit more advanced but sure a lot of times you want to keep track of when something happened we can also do this using date time in Python here we'll use day time to print the date and time in a nice format okay cool getting the current time create a variable call okay so if we do print date time now so let me show you this let's actually make the smaller because you don't need to have it that big and make this picture okay and let me actually okay that's fine so I went ahead and I did from date time import date time and now I'm going to go ahead and print date time now so it's showing you today's date in today's time okay so you can do cool things you can say daytime past is equal to daytime now and what you can do now is you can do if you want to see the difference of the current time and when you start it you can do something like this okay since I stored past and previously so it's going to just have that value here so this is basically year's month and then the date and then you know the hours and minutes and seconds and then seconds from 1970 so now I'm going to do past or daytime not now past so this tells me it's been 40 seconds okay and the difference is 0 hours 0 minutes and 40 seconds ok cool now let's let's go on to the actual assignment okay daytime dot now and then print the value of now so let's do that print now cool so it's telling me the time nap current time so it's saying 23 here sudden saying something different than what it said on my computer but that's because I think this is taking the time some other time this is not CST this is not central time this is something else ok extracting information so notice how that put looks like this what if you don't want the entire date in time what if you want something simpler and that's what they're going to show you here so let's actually paste that here and let's go down here paste those two lines so we got now date time that now current year current months and current day and make it now that day so if we actually do not adhere look at what it shows you so this is now and recalling the year method on now now dot month okay and we've stored these values in these irritable so this will should give you the current year this will give you the current month and this will give you the current day okay pretty cool pretty cool you already have the first two lines in a third line we take the year and only the year from the variable now it's stored in the current year we stored the month and date from now now in a new line print down that year make sure you do it after setting the now a variable okay alright so let's print now dot year then print out now that month so it's pretty much the same way as this but we're going to just say month and then we have now dot date okay so it's going to be pretty much the same thing and this is going to be day and then that should be it okay so we got the actual date time object we took the year from it we were able to take the month and the day okay cool hot date what if we want to print a print today's date in the following format so if you wanted to make it look pretty okay kind of like this so string substitution is now going to be helpful so now it's going to make more sense why we use string substitution okay this is a little bit more helpful and remember that the percent operator fill will fill the percent as placeholders and string on the left with the strings and the parentheses on the right so these guys will get filled up by these guys so now that year is going to go into the first percent placeholder now that month is going to going to go into the second place holder and now that day we'll going to the third placeholder here okay and we don't want it to show up with the dashes here so I'm going to do this okay and that should work all right cool I can put in something else here too like dashes but then it's going to show dashes so I want to keep it I want to keep it like this so that's it for this assignment this assignment so let's move on pretty time nice work let's do the same for the hour minute and second cool so I'm going to pretty much take this line paste it down here and I'm going to do now that our this is going to give me the current hour I'm going to do now dot minute it's going to give me the current minute and I'm going to do now that second is going to give me the current second and we don't want it to show with slashes so we want it to look like this okay you can you can see that's what they tell you to tell you to make it do this is a current our current minute and current second so hopefully that was fairly simple and it's really cool actually I like this Thanks grand finale we've managed to print out the date and time separately in a very pretty fashion let's combine the two okay now let's combine the two so we got to make it look like this okay that's very easy what I'm going to do is something like I'm going to make the value of this equal to date and the value of this equal to time and I'm just going to say print date plus and let's put a little space in between and then time like this and I think that should work alright so this is the date I put a little space in the middle because otherwise it would all be mushed up pushed up together and that's not what we want we want to put a little space in the middle and then we just concatenate all of that stuff so the date and a little space and then the time okay so hopefully this makes sense and it wasn't too difficult alright now let's get started on conditionals and control flow this is my favorite part of programming this is when you can do you can have your program make some really really intelligent and really cool decisions and this is when I like to think of you're giving your program a brain it's able to pick and choose and pick the best choices and avoid the worst choices or the other way around you know kind of whatever you want it to do here's when you can get that true power over your code okay so check out the code in the editor let me make the screen I think a little bit smaller because we can't really see so I don't like how it's written because it's making it really confusing to read it this is running really long I wonder how if I can make the screen a little shorter but okay anyways so this is how this reads okay I have some function and here's what happens in print you've just entered the clinic and then it prints a second line do you take the door on the left or the door on the right and for your answer it's going to take in some user input okay so you get to type in the answer so this makes it more interactive so you get a type in the answer and it's going to ask you type left or right and then hit enter and by calling the dot lower method here whatever answer that you give it is going to take it in short case short case okay if your answer was left or your answer was L it's gonna make that and think that you want to go left okay and then it says this is a verbal abuse room you heap of parrot droppings it's kind of funny and effectively when you go to the loot room on the left that's the verbal abuse room and the room to your right that's the argument room so either of the rooms I really wouldn't want to go into but if you choose to go to the left now you've entered a verbal abuse room and it tells you you heap of parrot droppings and if you basically pick your answer and you chose right it's gonna say you've entered the argument room room and it says I've already told you that or I've told you that already if you haven't picked left or right as your answer or L or R and you pick something completely different it goes you didn't pick left or right so try again and then it runs the function again okay so it'll run this entire function again that's all alright but once you've picked something ill and out of it and here you're calling that function so basically this is the line if you don't have this line it's not going to run this entire thing okay so let's run through this is going to be pretty cool okay what do you think we should pick so let's pick let's pick let's pick something completely different let's just say Q okay so like we expected its it said you didn't pick left or right so try again and this time let's pick right of course this is the argument room I've already have told you that already okay if we picked left it would say this is the verbal abuse from you heap of parrot droppings so this has been you can really you know give your program some fun so some ideas is to take away from this is what if you wanted to make a game like rockpaperscissors so if the user put in rock and the other user picked scissors well then rock wins okay or if the other user picked paper and the other user picked scissors then the user who picked scissors wins so now this you already have the power to make your first game all right so this is really the power of programming and this is one of my favorite things all right so unless you learn boolean's you won't be able to use if if statements or the control flow conditionals that we were learning earlier so let's make sure that we get this part and we learn it correctly so boo means are super important and your competitor operators are very very important so here's all your operators so you have equal to you have not equal to less than less than or equal to greater than or greater than equal to okay so let's run through them very quickly I'm going to open up the terminal here and let's go down here and okay let's run through them file let's pick two values five and let's make the other value of three okay so five is five equal to equal to three false is five equal equal to five true let's do what do you think it's going to return if I did five not equal to three it's going to return true because five is not equal to three here how about this what do you think is going to return here yep if you guess good chaplets false now let's do five is less than three five is less than five that's going to return false because five is not less than five let's do five is less than ten okay and now you can check is five less than or equal to ten it's five less than or equal to five is five less than or equal to four false let's try a day than 4 is 5 greater than or equal to 4 is it greater than or equal to 5 is it greater than or equal to 6 false ok so just just to use all the operators and give you a sense of how that work ok so set this to true if 17 is less than 38 or to false if it is not so and 17 is less than 33 or 28 no or I'm sorry that's true right 17 is less set this to true if hundred is equal equal to 2 times 50 so that should be true but let's just run it here and we get true and 2 times 50 is 100 so that's really saying 100 equal 100 right and we get back true so true set this to true if 19 is less than or equal to 19 so obviously this is going to be true because I'm sorry I should write true because 19 is not less than 19 but is it equal it's equal to said this is true if negative 22 is greater than or equal to negative 18 no negative 22 is smaller than negative 15 so false so let's let's try running it in our terminal we got false set this to true of 99 does not equal 99 that's false 90 plus 1 is 99 so we're going to get back false here let's run it cool all right assign true or false as appropriate on the lines below 20 minus 10 greater than 15 that's false 10 plus 17 and then 3 to the power of 16 3 to the power is again 16 is going to be a huge number it's going to be a huge number like it says here 43 million ok that's what that's going to be so is 27 equal to 43 million no we can also run it in our terminal and if you want to check what this is going to be you see 43 about 43 million okay about 43 million so this is absolutely false one squared is just one is that less than or equal to negative one no it's greater than negative 140 times four that 160 is that greater than or equal to negative 4 it's not equal to but it's certainly greater than so we're going to say true is 100 does not equal 10 squared is remember 10 squared that's a hundred so a hundred is not equal to 100 that's false okay cool all right create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below make me true so 3 less than 5 it makes rule 1 true okay so if I just wanted to show you here bull 1 equal to 3 is less than 5 if I print out blue one it's going to show you that it's true okay because 3 is less than 5 right so it's not going to give you back 3 is less than 5 is going to evaluate the expression to these less than 5 and then store the result of that so anytime you use less than or greater than or equal equal to or not equal to or any of these operators you always always always going to get back a true or a false okay all right so let's make this false so let's say 100 is less than 1 so now we've made this one false let's make this true 100 is greater than 1 we made this true let's make this false again let's do 40 is less than 3 and let's make this true and so 0 is greater than negative 5 oh okay we have to use three different operators so we can see this and this alright so I just made it greater than or equal to so I'm using the less than operator I'm using the greater than or equal to operator and I'm using one two I'm not using three different operators here well I should be so I could be using you know let's just let's just do this for T does not equal 3 okay how about that oh sorry let's say 40 we have to make it false remember okay all right to be and or not to be boolean operators so here we're going to learn about truth tables and things like true and false is false and false and false false and true is false so what they basically basically mean here is if I took true and false I would get back false okay anytime you have a anytime you have the end statement the only time you're going to get back true is when both of the statements are true okay so it's like if I asked you let's say do you like pizza and poison well if you said yes you would be saying yes to both things right you'd be saying yes that you like pizza and that you like poison so when I say and if I said you like pizza and poison you're going to say no even though there's only one of the things that you don't like by saying no you're turning down both things so whenever I have say and both of the statements after to be true so now let's say do you like pizza and ice cream and you might say yes okay or you might say true and if I ask you do you like ice cream and poison you're going to say false so anytime you have and both of the things have to be true conversely if you have or the only time or can false is if both of the statements are false so if I said do you like pizza or poison you can say true yeah because hey you like one of those things right because I said or so you can say you know like ice cream you know you chose one of them all right so let's let's print out what false and true is going to give you so think about it right false statement is do you like poison and true statement is do like ice cream and here what are you going to say you're going to say false no ok now let's let me give you a false and a false do you like what positive paste think I copied it so let me give you this scenario right you like poison and you like snakes I mean you could like snakes so let's just stick with that poison do you like poison and do you like poison you're gonna say false no okay true or true so remember the only time in our statement you can get back a false is when both of the things are false okay so pretty much a mostly our statement there's a seventy five or three four out of four chance you're going to get a statement that's true so true or true do you like ice cream or do you like pizza true okay even though you you're basically saying only one of them it applies to either one okay so true or false so once again you like pizza or do you like whatever right now poison so true because you like pizza so in our statement let's just go through a few more and I hope that you're getting a little bit of intuition of this now so false false is false right the only time you get back a false it's been both are false so here you have false I'm sorry here you have a or and here you have a true and I think they're missing something here and the thing that they're missing here is true and true is true okay that's what they're missing here so the only time true I'm sorry and the only time an ad statement is going to return true is when both of the statements are true so as you see here both of the statements are true so you get back a true every other case gives you false anytime in our statement you can get back a false as when both are false otherwise you get a true in every scenario okay not true as false not false is true meaning not is just the opposite okay so if I did not true I would get back the opposite of true which is false if I said not false that's up now is going to give me the opposite of false another way to think about another way to write it is true this exclamation mark means not so not true once again what is that that's the opposite of true and it should get back false wait what huh Oh in Python you can just I think you have to say not like this you have to but other languages not as like this okay what this is wait I'm into such huh what am I am i blanking out here uh Wow okay so for some reason I just kind of forgot I work with lots of different languages so I basically here forgot that uh in Python I guess you just have to send not cool doesn't matter it's very small okay so here and so the boolean operator and returns true when the expression on both sides of end are true so remember I cannot this is what I kept stressing earlier it both both statements have to be true in an end to get it true back okay so this makes our job real easy so set boo one equal to the result of false and false easy set result abou equal to this thing okay set results alright and okay before running it let's try to evaluate it okay tell me what you think do you like snakes and do you like snakes what is that going to return okay if you said false good job now let's look at this statement here okay so this negative negative negative they're just trying to confuse you negative two is negative two negative of that is positive to negative of that is negative two and negative of that is positive two so this whole thing is really just positive 2 okay all right so positive two a equal to let's see here wait did I do this right yeah I did this right right negative positive negative positive negative positive negative yeah okay sorry all right negative is equal equal to so this thing it's saying is equal equal to this whole thing all right so now let's check that so four is greater than or equal to sixteen to the power of 0.5 16 to the power of 0.5 is saying the same thing as the square root of 16 okay so that's just going to give you back for 16 to the power square root of 16 is 4 basically it's also saying for that's fine let's just leave it at that so here is 4 equal to 4 yes that's true but is negative 2 how about this statement here okay let's check that so this is a positive 2 and this is a negative 2 what do you think this evaluates to false okay so you have false and true what do you think you're going to get if you set false good job because both of the statements have to be true all right now let's evaluate this guy so let's start off from from right here okay 19 modulo 4 does not equal 300 that's right 19 modulo 4 what is that going to give you think about it 4 goes perfectly into 16 but 4 does not go into 19 perfectly so you have a remainder of 3 so it's saying 3 does not equal 300 well that's true right 3 oh I'm sorry I'm reading it wrong it should be like this so 300 divided by 10 divided by 10 is actually 3 so if I showed you guys 300 divided by 10 that's 30 that's divided by 10 that's 3 so here we're getting back 3 does not equal to 3 that's false and we have false here so false and false what will that give you right what will that give you do you like when there's bubble gum stuck underneath the desk and do you like demand there's a bubble gum stuck underneath the desk so false no I don't all right so this whole thing is going to evaluate to false let's go with this guy here 1 to the power of 2 that's one that's negative one and is that less than 2 to the power of 0 negative 1 is less than so 2 to the power anything to the power of 0 is just 1 okay so negative 1 is less than 2 to the power of negative I'm sorry to the power of 0 that's 1 and 1 to the power of 2 that's that's 1 and then we have negative 1 okay so is negative 1 less than 1 that's true and 10 modulo 10 what does that give us that gives us 0 is that less than 10 times 2 just 20 20 but is 20 so yeah zero and then 20 minus 20 that's zero so this whole thing so 0 is less than or equal to zero and this this is negative 1 is less than 1 so this is true and this whole part is true true and true what does that give you gives you true and true and true what does that give you that gives you true okay all right so that was just some practice with those statements all right um okay so here you know if you also want to just try running it and see what you get your computer can evaluate it very easily and here once again you know same kind of things are happening but it was with an or statement so what does this part evaluate to just to be quicker let's do it like that so 2 ^ 3 gives you 8 and 108 module 100 100 goes perfectly into 100 and then there's 8 left over so this gives us back 8 and this gives us back 8 so this whole part of the equation is true and then true or but this cleese equal King Arthur now there are two different words there are two different names that's false so here we have true or false what's that going to evaluate to that's going to evaluate to true okay so let me write that true true or false what is that going to evaluate to remember the only time or returns of false is when you have both things being false okay so here this is true just to prove it to you guys let's grab this and run it cool ten so basically what to the power of two gets you tat that gets you a hundred square root of 100 is 10 and is 10 greater than or equal to 50 that's false false or false we'll get you a false right that's the only time also return a false true or true obviously that's true this is false and what is this going to be one to the power of a hundred is just 100 to the power of one is a hundred this is a false that three factorial so here three times two is six we can ignore that so six does not equal six so that's false so here both of these are false or false and we get back a false okay cool so I just did that for practice and then now they're going to show us how to use the not operator here okay not true remember that's just opposite of that these are all just opposites so there's nothing hard here okay this is really simple I'll teach you guys how to think about it so here's how to think about it okay so anytime I see a knot in my head I just put a parentheses for everything that comes after it in my head so I'm going to just put it right here so you guys can see the parentheses so here's I think about it true so once I evaluate this whole thing then I just put a knot so I just get the opposite of that's a true false 3 to the power of 4 what is that 3 to the power of 4 that's 81 and what's 4 to the power of 3 that's 64 is 81 less than 64 No so that's false so this whole thing is false and then we just put the opposite of that so opposite of false is true so let's try running it got back true right true false same thing here right 10 modulo 3 we get a remainder of 1 because 3 goes perfectly to 9 and then we have a remainder of 1 there and 10 modulo 2 here we have remainder of 0 so we're saying 1 is less than or equal to 0 that's false not false is true ok so this is going to give us back true let's try this guy here 3 squared 3 squared is what what is 3 squared 9 ok so you don't have to be good at math to be a programmer by the way guys you see my maths is not my strongest asset so 3 ^ 2 + 4 squared it's going to be 16 + 5 squared 25 so here 16 does not equal to 25 that's no hold on I'm sorry you're going to first get the expression of this and then you're going to evaluate this guy separately okay so 9 plus 16 that's 25 five and this is 25 so 25 does not equal 25 that's false and not false is true so true here okay that's what we got true when I ran this computation here and not false so here how I would do it is like this okay and then put a parentheses around this guy so false one side value eight this guy that's just simple I pretty much you know in my head take it out of parentheses not false that whole thing turns into true and then not true turns into false at the end okay okay cool so true and then false again okay like that all right let's start next lesson this end that or this but not that cool not as evaluated first and as evaluated next or is evaluated last okay or is evaluated less and not is evaluated first so now let's do some let's do some examples so not true that gives you a false false and true that the whole thing gives you a false right let's run it that whole thing gives you a false here and then false or false or false will just give you a false that's the only time in our statement guilty on false let's grab it and run it you can see you got a false cool once okay false and not true or true so here we have not true that's false now we're going to evaluate the end statement okay so not true this is going to get us false false and false is false false this whole thing is false false or true is just it's true all right you got back true and at that I have a comment there even if I don't have it it doesn't matter we just tell our code to ignore this part so we got true ok cool let's go through the last few all right true and not ok so false or false is false not false oh yeah I mean it's parentheses so we have to evaluate it false or false is false not false is true true and true is true so we're going to get back true on this guy here so let's try running this guy true boo for all right not true this is false here so we'll keep a mental check here so this is false false and false as false so this whole thing turns into false and now this whole thing is false okay and not true is false and not false is true so this whole thing is true this whole thing is false true or false will return true so I hope you're getting a sense of how to evaluate these actually ok and bool 5 let's try that now true in true is true not true is false false or false is false that's the only time false is false okay all right cool and we're done let's move on okay so this time we'll give the expected result and you'll use some combination of boolean operators to achieve that result remember the boolean operators are and or and not so those are the boolean operators okay the other ones are comparators or comparison operators so less than equal to equal equal to and don't confuse equal equal with equal okay this is something I just want to talk about really quickly so if I did boolean is equal to false now if I print it out bool it's going to set false let's say your name is equal to John okay I don't know if you're John or not but let's just say that now if I did your name it's going to print out John so the one equal sign is an assignment operator but if I do two equal sign it's a logical operator okay so let's say I've made your name equal to cos e so now if you did your name and you got cos e and now let's check if your name is equal equal John so this is checking is this variable your name equal equal to John false okay so the double equal sign will return always return a true or false and the single equal sign will actually assign the value so single equal sign is an assignment operator and double equal sign is a comparison operator alright so so here they made some combination of boolean operators which is an not or or to make this a false okay so we are going to create something that's going to make this statement of true so I can say true and true I can say false or fall I can say true and true and I can say false or true right or how about does not not true cool so we did 50 exercises and we got a batch for it okay cool we're making good progress now before we move on let's see where we are currently so we can get a sense of where we headed so let's go so we finished Python syntax we finished the tip calculator we're not going to do this because you have to pay extra for this and string console date and time and we are currently working on condition conditionals and control flow after this we're going to do Pig Latin what do we have left functions lists and dictionaries student becomes a teacher more lists and functions and loops loops are awesome exam statistics advanced topics in Python and introduction to classes file input and output awesome so we have a long way to go so let's keep going let's keep plowing through this
