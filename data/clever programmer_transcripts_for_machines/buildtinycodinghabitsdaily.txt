hey I'm here for you so how did it go yesterday I know yesterday you were spending time coding hopefully and some of you might not even seen that video but I made a video recently where I was just like just put it on your calendar to code and a lot of you said they're committing to coding tomorrow and you schedule it in your calendar and you did that two hour block so for those of you who did how did it go and for those of you who didn't that's all right maybe schedule it for tomorrow and do it tomorrow but I want to talk about the concept of momentum and why momentum is so important for you you can be in a rut you can be stuck you can be feeling like you're not making progress but as long as you're showing up every single day I promise they are making progress I promise that you're moving forward even if it doesn't feel like it and sometimes gaining momentum is as simple as just showing up for that one day okay so that might be just showing up tonight for a little bit of time encoding that might be showing up tomorrow for a little bit of time encoding and so if you didn't do that yet I highly recommend you take the time now schedule on your calendar for tomorrow two hours you put a two hour block find it morning evening whenever you want but that is very very important there are some of you who said that you guys are going to do it I saw some of you tag me on the Instagram story and I've reposted your stories you guys can go check it out at my Instagram which is that clever causing but keep moving forward keep holding yourself accountable even right now I'm training Muay Thai right now at the gym and every day I go there honestly it doesn't really feel like I'm making progress if you ask me day by day basis I'm like I don't think I'm improving much but if you watch my footage and you look at me I'm improving significantly I'm completely different than I was even 15 days ago and that's just 15 days that's how it's going to be with coding you won't feel like you're making much progress and then a few days are going to pass and you're going to realize holy crap I am at a completely different level you got to give it time okay you got to give it time and you got to put in days and hours and just practice and get the momentum and you can even get the momentum with something very simple something very easy which is as simple as hey I'm just going to put in my calendar and go do it okay once you get that momentum going and you get that momentum up and running then you will be in a winning momentum then you won't have problems coding on a regular basis then you won't have problems sticking to the schedule or maybe you might even find it fun okay because it becomes a part of your routine so make it a part of your routine see what that does for you because I'm willing to bet you that that will do wonders for you if you can make it a part of your routine calmly show up every day clear your mind and just sit there and code there are many things you can do right that doesn't matter as much you could pick a little project to do you could make a little app to make a weather app you could you know make a little app for your friend your girlfriend whatever it may be it doesn't so much matter what you're doing as long as you're showing up every single day you'll make progress all right it's a tiny bits of progress is what you need in the atomic habits he talks about the concept of improving one percent every single day and so as long as you're improving one percent every single day I don't know in a year that's crazier if improved by I don't know 37 or 100 I have no idea but something ridiculous okay in that gear you would have improved a lot so just focus on that everyday practice every day approve and then it'll start to become muscle memory even with Muay Thai sometimes when I'm learning the calm but combinations are awkward I'm how do I throw that punch and then as I'm doing it more and more it just starts becoming smoother where I'm throwing my left hook with the you know jab I'm throwing the jab and I'm throwing up uh you know uppercut and then it starts becoming smoother and smoother and then I today I learned the spinning back Fist and I almost landed it on one of my friends that was nice but practice and learning all of this with practice I'm improving all of this and with practice I'm becoming smoother that's what will happen to you with code you'll be in the command line you'll keep feeling stuck you will feel man I just I want to be able to type in the command line how I see these guys do it because they do it so fast why am I stuck all the time I'm gonna you know be able to take this idea of grabbing data from an API whip it up and then extract that pull it into a CSV why can't I do that fast enough why am I so slow the reason is you might conceptually understand it you might have seen me coded you might have seen tutorials on it but you might have just not done it yourself enough and if you have not done it yourself enough and you will suck at it you know and you will be that great at it and you will always find it difficult so don't be that hard on yourself I said hard on so don't be that hard on yourself remember that with practice you'll keep improving so Focus really focus on the idea of practicing on a regular basis showing up on a regular basis even when I'm lifting I tell myself calm your mind just move your muscles so calm your mind move your hands and type and work calm your mind and just study learn something new with coding you'll have made so much progress so did you do it for those of you who watched the video one or two days ago with me talking about coding and you scheduled it did you actually follow through and do it if you actually follow through and do it I'm really proud of you let me know in the comments below if you didn't follow through and you didn't do that even though you said you would also let me know and hold yourself accountable and for the rest of you who didn't watch that video who are just watching this video right now it's totally fine put it in your calendar for tomorrow okay just simple put a two hour block one to two hour Block in your calendar for tomorrow find a time do that and then take a screenshot on Instagram in your story and you can tag me and I will repost it okay at cleverkazi cleverqazi all right that's it that's all I have for you okay so I hope that this accountability holding accountable you moving forward every day helps you okay that's it I love your beautiful face and if you ever want to learn coding with me and you want to get coached by me or my team we have a coaching application that's down below feel free to check it out well my team and I we will get on a call with you
