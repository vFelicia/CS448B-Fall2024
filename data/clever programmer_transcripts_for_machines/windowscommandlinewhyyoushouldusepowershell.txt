so this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and in this video i want to talk about the windows command line okay so first of all regarding yesterday's video engineer truth I do not hate his channel I do not hate him he's awesome if you want to learn about realistic career videos you should actually watch some of his videos that video was just made out of fun no it wasn't to try to get more views like I got some comments or it wasn't that I hate that channel or anything like that and no I will not delete it because if I start deleting things you know that's something that connects with me I thought it was funny and I posted it around the channel I'm sorry to fit if it offends certain people but again my goal was not actually go after somebody or hurt them or whatever it was just a funny video it was a big coincidence and I wanted to just talk about it well anyways don't worry because you will be getting a lot of awesome content soon starting right now so first thing I want to talk about was a lot I'm getting a lot of questions on ok hey Kazi you made all these videos on the command line but on Windows do these commands even work and my answer to that is no the command line that the builtin command line of Windows is very different tip number one that's gonna be really beneficial for you is in Windows there's something called PowerShell so when you look up command prompt don't open up command prompt like don't type in CMD that's one of the weaker versions of the command lines open a PowerShell it's much better it has some functionality like Mac command lines or Ubuntu command lines because Windows command lines sucks and I hate to break it to you guys but I've been using I've used every operating system there is but Windows command line has been the worst by far it's such a pain to make many things work even if you're working in different programming languages and you're trying to do just import something it will be so simple in every other opera system ever but then in Windows they'll have it's like separate tutorial that you have to follow but I understand it might not align with your budget getting a MacBook Pro or your ecosystem so that's not what I want to recommend to you instead I'm gonna just show you guys something that will be helpful to you and valuable to you as you're following along these tutorials so if you see me do things like PWD and stuff if you open up the PowerShell your PWD command should work okay other commands like m'kay dirt and the PowerShell should work that's how you can make a directory CD for changing directories should also work at rmdir should also work so if you can just open up literally powershell okay that's how it is on Windows P o wer sh DLL most of the Mac builtin command lines like should work but if you're opening up the CMD for whatever reason and that's the one you want to use then the commands of that are going to be a lot different okay but I would suggest use PowerShell because after Windows seven they added that and I think that in when in Windows 10 it's definitely there as well so use the powershell and this resource that i'm on is called learn Python the hard way org I'll link it in the description below and it has some useful command lines that you could look up yourself and learn from so maybe you could use these command lines and get ahead of the tutorial series that I'm teaching you guys so you can use this to prepare yourselves and learn more things as well ok so yeah that's it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you guys learned something new and we will just get on produce more awesome content and I'll show you guys some more cool things all right can't wait to see you in the next video
