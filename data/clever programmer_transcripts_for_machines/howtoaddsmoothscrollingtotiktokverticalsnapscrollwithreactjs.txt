nice um so with that said we're going to go ahead and style the video card so what we did initially was we said that the the video is too big right it's just way too big so i'm going to go ahead and give the video player so if i go ahead and do video on sponsor player what i'm going to first do is go ahead and give it a height and width of a hundred percent right so if i go and do that you see now the videos fits perfectly inside right so it fits perfectly inside of that and what i'm going to now do is also is because if you scroll through it now you'll notice that it's the snapping doesn't work yep it doesn't work right now yeah so it doesn't work right so we kind of had oh so firstly actually a good there's a good point now so i need to add the video card twice so let me add two video cards or three so we can actually visually see if there are two or three in there so i'm going to go ahead and add three so now you can see if i even wait it doesn't ever snap so it doesn't snap right so we set the parents or app videos we set the the scroll snapping behavior there but we need to set it to the child so now inside a video card we gave it video player right so inside of videocard.css what i'm going to do now is go over and target the parent container so video and i need to add the following lines i need to say give it a heightened width of 100 pixels and give it the scroll snap align start property right so these are crucial in order to get that work right so what this is saying is it will take up 100 width this is huge i'm sorry to just keep interrupting but this is too good to not share bob's craig says let me uh he goes join profit with javascript it was the best decision of my life you're the best channel on youtube clever programmer and you have helped me so much on my selftaught journey bro that's amazing right that is freaking crazy welcome to the community hopefully you even had a call with sunny but yeah yes thanks so much for just your vote of confidence and being a part of this community bob we love you appreciate you and thank you for saying that exactly and like honestly like i want to speak to each and every single one of you guys if i haven't already so we do the coaching calls i do my coaching call every tuesday so make sure you're there and i would love to chat to you uh in person on that zoom call so that'll be amazing yeah thank you dude um it's pretty nice so we just added that code which said that we would add a width of a height of 100 and scroll snap a line start right so now what we're going to do is because if you go ahead and scroll let's see if it's if it snaps it doesn't snap right now should it okay i just saved it anyways and i'm going to refresh and i'll try again not snapping right now no so we need to actually give it a position of relative right and this will make it relative to its parent container so if we do that we should see some snapping behavior so let's go ahead and try oh oops okay this threw me off this drew me up big time okay so it's because we actually changed the class names of video to video card right so inside a video card i need to actually go and do video card video oh man that's why yeah that's what i do okay nice awesome so if we go ahead and do that and then what we need to do also for video player i want to add you see it crops a little bit i want to make your object fit fill and what that does is it actually goes and fills the container all right so let's go ahead and scroll now yep there we go hold on let's see yep now it's snapping awesome so you see we get that snapping behavior guys yeah that was fast yeah it's crazy right like this is such a neat little trick that i will always and guys this is what i want you to learn when you figure this out like a snapping sort of tutorial or you find something good hold on to that because that will help you in so many situations like if i had known this it would have made my life so much easier and so many other jobs i had worked on so take like add this to your portfolio and then have also have it as a reference to go back to you in the future when you're stuck on things and that sort of stuff because it will save you a bunch of time in your in your work i'm also going to add a border one pixel solid black to the card so that it's very apparent when we scroll through that there's a little border around it so that should help out a bit more in terms of visually seeing what's going on okay but with that said the styling is done okay for that uh what i'm going to go ahead and do is go back to the video card and
