let me tell you about the most pivotal moment in my software career i can attribute this exact moment to being the reason why i was able to crush my interview with google microsoft and blue origin i couldn't even believe that these things were achievable like getting a job at google i can't do that but after this moment i was able to get the confidence and the skills that i needed to completely shine on those interviews and this is the origin of data structures poppy so how did it start for me well i clearly remember one day at my university three google software engineers came to visit sort of for like a recruiting event and everyone was all hyped about it all my classmates were like man i'm gonna network with that person i'm gonna go become that person's best friend get the job i was just like whoa like a google software developer it was like a pokemon or something just something i wasn't ever going to see in my entire life so when they came they told us about what it is and what it takes to get a job there but in the back of my head i was still always thinking man that's just not me i'm never gonna be able to get those opportunities i specifically remember thinking that thought when there's the part where they're doing a mock interview two of the googlers went up to the white board and then one of them asked a question write me a function that can find me the path from a to b and literally my mouth just dropped because i couldn't even comprehend on where to begin this is where i was like i'm never gonna become a googler and it was so crazy because it was like a magic show literally the other developer just started to go through the problem break it down into the different pieces solve each part write this amazing function this algorithm using the right data structures to find the shortest path and for me this was a magic show this was like when you're a little kid and you see the magician pull the bunny out of the hat and you're just absolutely amazed so after that i was determined to have a conversation with that software developer i was determined to go up to him and ask him like how can i get this so that's exactly what i did i was super scared i was super nervous walking up to the guy i remember my hands were shaky palms were a little bit sweaty mom's spaghetti and then all of a sudden i go up to him and then i kind of just ask him hey man like honestly i i've never seen myself being able to work at google just because it's been like a dream for you like how were you able to do it and then he kind of started to tell me his story he was telling me how he was a developer he started working at a company in fact he graduated from the same university that i did and that gave me hope and he started working at some company moved to another one three years later and finally google recruiter reached out to him he had three weeks to prep for the interview and what he did for those three weeks was he went hard into the basics of programming the data structure and algorithms literally he told me his schedule was he would work nine to five after five from five to eight pm monday through friday he would do white boarding problems just solving problem after problem after problem then on the weekend he would do six to eight hours each day both saturday and sunday or more problem solving and when he told me that when he told me that that is when everything changed for me because that is when i realized if this amazing developer in front of me was able to get there you know starting from the similar position where i'm at from the same university it's not like a huge university it's not a prestigious university in fact it's a university that has a 100 acceptance rate what like no one gets rejected going into the university that i went to right he was able to go there and end up at google and not only that when i realized that data structures and algorithms was simply just a skill that's when everything changed for me this is that pivotal moment because i realized the skill i realized i can learn that skill i realize i can build that confidence because confidence comes from one thing and one thing only how well do you know something when you know something to a high level every detail you're going to be super confident when you perform that task and that's what i realized i just had to do more repetition so from that day forward every single day for 30 minutes a day i solved one algorithm problem and i did it again and again and again and again i'm not gonna lie i miss some days but i just did it over and over and over again and that allowed me to start to build so much competence that i could distinguish what are the different things that i have to do to solve these different problems i was able to show up with the confidence i was able to crush those interviews and i was able to get the job offers and the rest is history that's how data structures papi was born of course i'm not a guru guys i'm just a regular person i just developed the right skill set so what i want to get to right now is i want to make the magic show i'm going to solve the exact same problem that that google developer solved in front of me that got me inspired to take action because i want to inspire you to be able to go out there and build the skill set that you need so let's go ahead and jump into that problem guys and here we are finding the shortest path from the top left to the bottom right of this array i'm not gonna lie this is probably not the exact same problem that they did but let's go ahead and dive into this let's go ahead and solve this problem so what i always want to start off doing is kind of replicating the problem here i get on my whiteboard i'm gonna replicate the same array that they have in the lead code example so i have a great starting point now what i start to notice is there's going to be a specific pattern here it's going to get me the shortest path since i'm going from the top left all the way to the bottom right i can only go to the right or down from each square to the next square knowing this well i could create another array that at every specific position that's going to represent the minimum sum needed to get to that point here the first value in the top left will just be the same from the original array the first row and the first column will also be unique because we can only travel in one direction we would just get the value at that same position adding the sum of the previous positions so that gets us the minimum path because there's only one path however when we start to look at the other positions you could take two different paths one coming from the top and one coming from the left so on those we're then compared to see which one has the minimum number by adding the current position and the previous path so let me go ahead and code it up now cool so now when we actually start to code the first thing i like to do is write my pseudo code i just write it on comments because these are the steps i'm gonna have to take now these are the specific steps that i just talked you through of having the minimum path so i start with the very first implementation this is just creating my array of zeros simple double for loop next thing is setting the initial zero zero as well as now getting all of the first column and all of the first rows now by the way there's actually a bug here that i was stuck on for a bit let's see if you could figure it out before we get to the bug reveal but again this is just two simple loops to fill out the summation of my first row and the summation of my first column because those are the ones that i don't have to do different combinations so from there we go over to actually getting the summations of all of the different positions inside of my summations array all i have to do is i have to add the current value of the specific ij position on the grid and then just get the minimum of either one position to the left or one position to the top because that minimum is going to give me the shortest path there and boom here's the celebration that you always have to have whenever you think you figured it out it was at this moment that he knew he up it did take me a while to figure this one out my code only worked for square studio race not for rectangular 2d array because if you look at my first loop the conditional statement was wrong let's go so that is how that is done that is magic i hope that you saw how the magic works i hope that this kind of inspired you to really dive into data structures algorithms because that's what we did here right we were able to kind of get this problem that we had and they were able to draw it out kind of come to a solution and finally we were able to implement it so guys this is why data structure's not going to be so important you could just do this you could get better every single time i am not a guru i'm just a regular person i just worked on enough of these that i was able to kind of figure out what it was that i needed to do next you can get to this point in fact you could probably get even better results than i did you just have to practice and it's going to take time to get there it's going to take patience but we are here for you so with that being said i hope you got value from this video if you did go ahead hit that like button comment below let me know what you guys want to see more with data structures and algorithms because i want to give you guys more value to help you crush it to help you on your next interview so you could get that job offer so you could have that confidence not be like how i was before but actually being able to move towards having the goals that you want all right guys that is it for coach daniel i will see you in the next one peace
