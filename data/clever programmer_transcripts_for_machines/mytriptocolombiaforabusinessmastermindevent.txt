private yacht one of these also known as a boat we have Hamilton with us that's good this is a Pablo Escobar's house this is one of us not mentioned and actually we're staying at a Pablo Escobar's mansion of all right now okay so we saw really cool stuff on that boat right we saw Pablo Escobar's bombed homes Hamish Rodriguez which it was a soccer player Lum bein player one of my favorite players and now we're actually headed off to the jungle on a really dangerous hiking trip who are they actually had a sign a waiver for you know if something happens to us cuz they told us they're snakes vipers that'll bite you and rot your flesh and also snakes they'll paralyze you for 72 hours being us we thought it was gonna be fun and it wouldn't make for a cool vlog and so we went so okay some of the footage was lost some of the audio was missing we regardless we had an epic trip a really amazing journey to Columbia Mary Mary Jean is how they say it and what we ended up finding out was this is not a city where they're drug cartels in every corner a collie cartel is gonna kill you Pablo Escobar's men are gonna come out of somewhere and we definitely didn't even see anybody dealing with drugs this was what we saw was an amazing place all of those other things were just stereotypes was a beautiful place with loving people incredible coffee I'm gonna miss their coffee it had malls it was very developed we got to stay at epic hotels for actually pretty cheap price as well and get a great time learn Spanish and we'll definitely go there again the jungles and the mountains over some of the most beautiful breathtaking scenery sites that we've seen in our entire life and this is a place that I'm gonna be going to in a month or two and I would definitely like to go there this time for a much much longer time so in conclusion I urge you guys to go to Colombia Marion and check it out for yourself and I just urge you to travel and explore your possibilities because look when you look around the world is a huge place and just being trapped in Europe in a little land you don't want to be part of that statistic where you live and die within a you know 300 mile radius of where you were born so don't be a statistic go out and explore more and like one of the most hated youtubers currently says life's not short you just got to do more I agree with them his name is Logan Paul so do more and enjoy your life
