such thing as failing at something as long as you don't give up if you don't believe me yes look around you people that successful yes because they're the one person that won't give up they just keep doing it dude like when I was like learning how to juggle I learn how to juggle in one day but Dallas cuz like that's like an eighthour event and the do told me I out I'm like I guess I just can't do it he's like don't complain til the 999th time and I just kept doing kept doing it literally like the 900 like 50th time was when I actually got it hey guys what's up so we just got done with our event at YouTube space la asuka's can see they're actually still a few more people around here chatting it up having a good jolly ol time and the YouTube sign behind me kind of looks cool actually did not know that it would be there and it's cool that we got to see it in the dark now this event was awesome I learned a lot there were awesome things now what is in it for you okay let's say you are programmer you want to be a programming or watching this like Kazi how the hell is this helpful for me here's how this can be really helpful for you okay one of the best ways to get job opportunities LAN job opportunities is not always hiding behind ten look cool or like github or Twitter or Facebook that's not the only place you can try to get jobs or sending our resumes on indeed and monster one of the best ways to get job opportunities and the most guaranteed way there's actually meet people in person even if you're not like the best developer in the world if you see people in person meet them make it leave a good impression on them dear and you didn't know you're a Python programmer they're much more likely to go with somebody that they know trust and like rather than some online resume this way you can skip the line get ahead okay I'm not saying you still need to have skills but this is one very great way to get more job opportunities so if you watch this video maybe there are some parts where you saw me just jumping into a conversation and like talking to people so when you go to these events you don't have to be so like you're standing in the corner like hanging out which is actually what I used to do but it's a lot of fun it's like a playground right you just go and meet people and talk about anything that you want it really does not matter what the heck you actually talk about okay as long as you're talking or sharing something that you're passionate about that's kind of the most important thing so when you go to these events like let's say a Python meetup okay if your app I want to be a Python programmer come to PyCon I'm going to be going to Pike on this year as well so you're gonna see me there meeting with a lot of people and if you want help I can also help you introduce yourself to a lot of other people okay and just have a great time connect with people there builds real relationships have genuine conversation but don't be just like a sleazy salesman with your card and just like giving it to everybody like here's a business card here's a business card you want this business card oh don't do that go have a good conversation have fun get to the other person something interesting share your phone number or whatever but don't be just in a rush to give that okay that's it for me guys this is Kazi as always I love your faces off I hope you got value out of this video and I'll see you in the next video
