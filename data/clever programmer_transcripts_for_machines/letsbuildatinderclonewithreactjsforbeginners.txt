guys good to see you guys today we are going to be building the tinder clone this app is going to be amazing sonny what are your thoughts right now about this i'm excited dude i mean this is a bit of a challenge getting this one working it's pretty cool because we're gonna get to see how you guys can go ahead and build that swiping functionality that is so big in tinder and loads of other apps actually used so i'm pretty pumped pretty pumped yeah all right man i'm excited i think kind of we're going to be getting started into it in just a little bit but guys take a look at this whole thing so we're just going to demo the app for you guys right now so you guys will be able to swipe left or swipe right right and then of course let me show you over here remove my screen swipe right there we go and if i actually click right over here at the top i can go into chat so you guys can see this um maribon look at this ellen is hitting sunny up all right so you can go right here and then you can actually send um you can you see it says you matched with ellen on 10 820 and what else should we demo in here sunny so we are also going to be showing um so if we go back yeah so you see how we can pretty much go back and forth between different screens guys so that's actually using something called react router to do that so we're going to be showing you guys how you can build that and how you can have like flow through an app so you can have different screens working on a single reactor which is pretty cool and also guys these live these cards that uh you see that cause you're swiping through right now they're not being they're not hard coded they're being pulled from a firebase database and you can also notice that if you see the url right there that's actually a firebase hosted url which means that we deployed this app so we're going to show you how to use the firebase database in order to sort of get these cards up and rendering on the screen and then we're going to show you how to deploy it and get it live so you can host it on your portfolio yep so guys this is going to be pretty freaking exciting this build is going to be awesome i hope that you guys are excited about this build if you want drop it in chat if you're watching this later awesome you know i hope that you're still excited you can just drop it in the comments below with that said sunny uh what should we do should we just jump straight into the build i mean let's see guys are you guys pumping this if you are let's just jump straight in smash the thumbs up we'll get straight into it that guys that is actually huge if you can if you want to do us a favor and make sure that this just goes out to everybody because right now guys we have 489 people watching so that's already massive but if you want to help us make sure it goes out to just everybody what can they do sunny they can smash the thumbs up button guys and also if you do find it like if you're enjoying the content go ahead and post a story so grab your phones post a story on your social media so instagram and you can tell you can get me and carzi's tag right here at the bottom um and go ahead and shoot some stories because that actually allows us guys to start up a conversation with you guys if you guys enjoy it it tells us pretty much that you guys are watching we love seeing you guys repost um stories on instagram so that would be dope if you guys can do that dang everybody's pumped yeah guys this is going to be awesome uh i broke 500 people live awesome guys so with that said this is going to be the build right so this is the app just demoing it for any of you guys maybe we're seeing it a little bit later um and then because of react router we can actually move around anywhere so we'll be showing you guys all of this functionality and how you can build it with that said let's just jump straight into it so what should we do sunny so first thing is guys you can see me and kazi are actually sharing a terminal because we're using a vs code live share so first step is let's actually go ahead and i'm not sure can i actually access your terminal right now um let's go ahead and share a terminal right there yeah uh nice let me double go ahead and find the terminal there we go i think you need to share it in uh the live share settings yeah oh no we got it we have got it nice i need to get it i'll make it um yep there we go you can read and write though there you go so now there we go so the first step that you guys want to do guys is um so yeah there we go is that that is the right one right yeah cls if i type in yo can you see that yeah there we go nice okay so with that said guys the first tool that we're going to use is something called create react app so this is something that facebook built and we've used it in all of our builds so far and all you need to do is go ahead and type mpx create react oops create react app and then the name of your app so in this case let's go ahead and call it the tinder clone right and what that's going to do is that's actually going to go and launch that tool and then build a project a star project called tinder clone right and remember try not to have spaces there just use a dash in between so this will actually go ahead set every single thing up that we need in order to get um react a react starter project up and running so with that said i think what we can do at this point is let's go and head over to firebase and get that set up so everything's ready on that front one by the time this is we get this back yep and guys we're not gonna be posting the link to the app we're gonna be hosting a github repo and put it there because youtube took down our video or amazon video actually um the other day because they were thinking that they just didn't like that we were sending people to an amazon clone yeah and so even though we weren't doing anything bad but they were like hey you guys are sending people to amazon clone so that kind of threw us off a lot you know it was like scary it's like oh my god this video has 60 000 views and it just took it down and so we're but that video is now back up so we're not going to be dropping the link to the clone but we'll drop a github repo later and then you guys can just click the live link or you can just try to read the link from the url and go to it exactly yeah so guys the next what we're going to do next is we're actually going to go ahead and set up firebase so to get firebase up and running all you need is a google account so it's good news it's really easy to get that up and going um so once you're at this screen what you want to do is go ahead and click add project yeah and then this type in tinder dash clone and then it's just a simple case of clicking continue you can enable google analytics there we go create project there we go and guys what this is doing now is you're setting up a so firebase is essentially just a suite of tools by google allows you to do authentication allows you to uh manage all your data there allows you to deploy your website and it allows you to do a bunch of other cool stuff um and we're going to show you a bunch of that today so let's go ahead and see if the app's finished installing so it's almost done so it's almost done but while that's still installing what we can do is just click continue yep and what we need to do now is we need to get a magic sort of config file so on the top left we'll see something where it says project overview and a little cog let's click that cog yeah and then project settings and let's go down to the bottom and let's go ahead and yep that web app one that's it and let's type in a tinder clone i'm not sure why they ask you for two names here but whoops i meant that's all right that's right you can you can do it yeah that's fine without even checking that box yeah yeah we can go because afterwards what we can go ahead and do is we can go to the firebase hosting tab and it should just work from there okay i think i went too fast so let's uh where's the tinder so right here tender clone yup and then i think this is the app right yep that's the one if we go down to the bottom oh there we go so you see the config yeah so we just needed that guy so what you want to do at this point is just copy it and keep it in like a separate notes or something else but you just want to have that on the side um so you can we can use that later on yo amanat is in the house what's going on dude nice he's like hope you how are y'all doing kazzy and sonny awesome doing all good bro nice okay so now we have the config file and guys what that's going to allow you to do is once we actually get the app up and running that's going to be the magic piece that connects our app to our firebase sort of back end okay so with that said now we have the app up and running it's perfect so it will basically at the end of it it'll say happy hacking and it'll tell you some instructions so in this case make sure you do this step guys because if you we we've sometimes accidentally forgot this so what we need to do is do cd tinder clone yeah yeah funny yeah so that way you actually go inside the file uh inside the photo so make sure you're in here so when you do ls i am better says awesome he goes i should spend more than 200 to learn this online but it's free here oh amazing i feel like it was a chance my brother oh that's amazing i love stuff about that thank you appreciate that so once you're in the tinder clone folder guys it's very simple to get started all you need to do is run mpm start and mpm start is basically just going to start the sort of the react app is going to get everything up and running and working for you and it will launch it on localhost 3000 and you should get this perfect little react spinning icon which is really nice and everything works once we get to that point okay perfect i love that spinner man i hate when you remove it but it's okay i know i know it's uh yeah so guys if you get to this page well done like you've set up your first react project so that's a really good step and the next thing we like to do is walk quasi uh we're gonna remove these three files that i put a little x over and it's gonna be the test and the logo file yep exactly that so the reason why we do that guys is we don't need the test files for now uh when you sort of get a bit more advanced into a short reactive element you can use those but at this point we don't really need those um then you want to go ahead and clean up the app js file so you're gonna get rid of t where's my um vim maybe i don't have them on here huh oh is it not go vim no i don't think i have my vim on here but it's all good okay cool we're gonna just do that put a little h1 here and say let's build the tinder clone app dope boom right there remove this guy save and refresh and that's what you guys should have so make sure guys remove that logo at the top because otherwise you're gonna get a compilation error because we're not using the logo anymore we deleted it exactly so once you get to this point that's a very good place to be there's one more step involved in the cleanup process which is um oh nice we have someone watching watching yeah i was pumped i was like damn dope man that's nice damn we're up to 677 people now guys that is awesome thank you guys so much for giving all that love really appreciate you thank you so much and smash that like button let's get it smash [ __ ] right now so the next step guys is you want to go into your app.css and you want to go ahead and basically just so let's open up the app dot css okay so i've got css and basically you just want to highlight everything and smash the delete button to just get rid of them smash the delete that's the new one smash didn't leave one for the egypt clever coder says you guys are awesome i'm gonna enroll in pwj soon i got all your projects on my portfolio now keep it up guys that is awesome man whether you join pwg or not our number one mission is to make as many developers on the planet as possible we have a bigger mission now exactly that's exactly what we want to do guys we're going to like get developers just like just learning this stuff having fun with this stuff like it's just a superpower once you start using once you know react you can just start building anything it's really really fun like it is awesome super sharp says i start loving coding because these new awesome people it makes coding interesting and simple that's the yep right all right let's keep on rolling so index.css is the next place guys so we need to go over to index.css let's go to index and i'll also follow you so i'll go here and hit follow boom there we go nice and then what we're going to do is we're going to add a magic rule here guys we're going to say for everything uh apply a margin of zero ola is here our boy yeah and he's like by the way nice photo you didn't have this photo before now it looks clean and he goes it's definitely clever programmer's definitely disrupting online learning and it's mindblowing i guess youtube already noticed this hey you just joined the course whoa sharia says i'm in a coding bootcamp but i get so much value from your tutorials yo this is awesome i'm sorry guys we want to keep coding but these messages are so awesome we want to highlight them yeah it gets us pumped guys i love seeing this stuff some people are saying sonny and kazi is my favorite combo oh [ __ ] nice yeah this is that's what i'm talking about awesome all right let's keep it rolling so this is the magic line that you're going to need to do and basically the reason why we do this guys is because whenever you're doing html css javascript like just something to remember is that web a lot of browsers have this annoying habit of giving like us an invisible margin right so if we notice if i get rid of that rule look what happens invisible margin yeah so if i get right like if i get rid of it the browsers automatically apply that top much and they do that to everything so you're gonna start seeing like hang on i haven't put a margin here but somehow the browser's gonna so this basically just overrides that at the root and it says right don't do that let's just kind of just ignore that and just kind of uh have our own rule set so once that's done you can go ahead and close index.css and then we can pretty much head over back to app.js and then we have a good starting point yeah so that's really nice yeah so the next step is essentially i like to sort of draft out the app right so if we go ahead and open up the uh the app the sort of finished app so let's open up our build yep yep so in here guys we can see uh three main areas right we can see there's a header so in the code what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna draft out as a comment so i'm going to say we have a header right we have a we have the the cards so the tinder cards which is huge by the way for anybody who doesn't know what a tinder app is because i see some people asking that it's a dating app so if you're looking to match up with somebody or a partner whatever it helps you match up and basically just swipe left and right till you find matches with each other and if somebody swipes right on you and you swipe right on them then you can start messaging them so just a dating app that's it exactly exactly so we have the header then we have the tinder card so that that's the area where you swipe left you swipe right um depending on who's sort of coming onto your account and then we essentially have the buttons at the bottom so buttons uh below tinder cards some buttons below tinder cards and then we have the other screens before we keep going so when you say header what are you referring to is that this part right there that i'm highlighting like where the tinder logo sits and the chat and the that exactly that yeah so that that would be what we're referring to as the header component guys because in react what we do is we build everything in components so the first one that we're going to build is that header component exactly okay cool so first thing is that header got it then the tinder cards is where that big image is with that guy's name on it yeah exactly okay cool got it and then so that's that's this guy right here guys so just to kind of visually draw it out this is what we're talking about and then the button below the cards are all these like icons at the bottom exactly exactly yeah so that's going to be the first thing right and then we're also going to have um so like just underneath what i'm going to write is we're also going to have a chat sort of screen right so a chat screen which is basically going to be the screen when you click on the top right icon yeah so if we go ahead and click on the top right icon for the chat icon so it's in the header then what will happen is it will go inside the chat screen so this screen will list out all of the different chats available or all of the people that you've matched with right and then when we click on that we're gonna have an individual chat screen right so individual chat screen oh i love that car that goes you guys are making me guilty for not paying for this way to go this is gold nice i love that awesome so i think you guys have a v8 brain that's chat screen individual chat screen okay yeah so the individual chat screen is when you tap into one of those and you can see sort of the chat clicking into it yeah okay yes that's going to be that screen right there so we're going to show you guys how to build all of this right um something to bear in mind however is that we do have routing right so before we kind of get into all of that stuff i think let's just go ahead and start developing and start building that header out and then we can sort of see from there how things go right so the first thing we're going to do is in order to build this header component let's go ahead and build a new file so if you open up the um the left side so whether where the files are inside of vs code yep and let's go ahead and create a new file and let's call it header.js and since it's a component it's going to be capitalized got it yeah and also guys just a heads up we are actually going to be showing you how to use something called material ui which is a design library um i'm also showing you how to use material ui icons today so if anyone's excited about that smash the thumbs up button because that is pretty cool and you guys can use that across your projects yeah that will be beautiful yeah nice oh you did a little trick there causey nice hell yeah bro i remember oh hey so this is how we write our functional component guys all right so a functional component is literally just a function which returns some jsx jsx being some html with some javascript infusion in there so you inside these quickly brackets we can have some javascript yes you can just do anything inside of here um but what we're going to do here is basically just to get it tested and show that everything works we'll just do a html we'll say i am a header all right we'll save that file and then what we're going to do is we're going to go open up app.js so we're going to save this file open up app.js and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and import so at the top we say import header from header so just to be clear and for the sake of repetition from header he's importing that component that we had exactly cool and we're going to be using it for that exactly so we wrote it here and then we're pulling it in at this point and then we are then that allows us to then go ahead and render it so where we had our little comment here what we can do is we can actually go ahead and write the component itself and this guys will go ahead and it will basically go into the site and go inside the header and it will pretty much just pop this exact thing so imagine like we're literally grabbing this and we're taking it and we're pasting it there like yeah that's a great way to think it yep yep yep yeah yeah that's really what's happening here so then that is pretty much what we do so now we can see it says i am a header which is awesome right yeah so you can see that it's visually been put on the screen so that's really really cool um the next step that we want to do now is kind of get it looking somewhat like the the what we see in the tinder app right so we can notice in in our build we had these two icons on the left and the right those two icons resembled one the profile picture screen and two the sort of messaging app screen so if we go ahead and open up our app we can see the two icons that we're talking about so we have the profile oh by the way we are at 860 live viewers guys we love your face for being on here that is so amazing thank you guys thank you guys because like seriously that hypes us up so much dude this is awesome i mean this is we're doing it for you guys um i love when all of you guys are on here and engaging and interacting and having so much positivity in the comments i'm not missing any comments so while sunny's building it and i'm working with him i'm seeing all of you guys comments you'll see me popping it up on the screen okay and pretty much nothing you're saying is being missed so if it's a valid question i'll bring it up later so feel free to put it there right now in the meantime smash that like button let's keep it moving exactly and guys we all see i have like the comments on my screen as well so don't ever think that we're not seeing your comments we can read them as we as they come in uh yeah that's awesome to hear all right so we just popped out the header which was awesome and you see in in our build right on the top um sorry in the final build on the top left and the top right we have this profile picture icon and then this messaging uh sort of icon on the top right right to get the icons we don't want to build those we don't it's just a headache to do all that stuff so what we can use is something called material ui so let's go ahead and head over to materialui.com yep okay yeah so if we google material ui and this is going to be like one of your best friends guys in terms of your design libraries so if we scroll down it will actually go ahead and it will show you um how to install this and all we need to do is run i think it's npm the command is there i think one sec material ui let me go ahead and grab it so it's npm install material ui call yep right here at the bottom yeah so if we can we can stop our build for a second and what we can do is we can go ahead and do npm install material ui core there we go and what that will do is i'll actually start to install everything into our project for us but do that as your first step guys and then i want you to go ahead and type in so if you go to um the search by material ui and you just type and so i think if we maybe oh usually there's a search bar yeah i think why isn't it look i'm clicking is this like a fake maybe if refresh i think it might the whole thing might have not come in properly there we go oh that's yeah there we go nice type in icons nice so the first one uh and yeah what we're gonna do here guys is you need to install material ui core first and then the second step is you see where it says the installation npm install material ui icons so we need to do that line as well so i'm gonna go ahead and run that in the terminal didn't we run that just now uh no we did we did material got it oh yeah we did core so core is the all of the components everything like that son you're you're you're all good by the way if i'm talking to frankie only he will here yeah cool yeah so um literally so that's what we're gonna do guys so we're gonna pretty much have it so that we install the material ui icons and that will go ahead and pull in all of these sort of icon sets so the reason why that's so useful guys is there is so many different situations where you're going to have um an icon that you're looking for whether it be like a search icon or like let's look at um on the right side can you see on the material ui right now he's got a bunch of different um icons there so like they have those icons in the top right right if we need any of those we can go ahead and grab them these ones okay these ones right here the top yeah so there's always a use case for like some new icons but if you click where it says you can see the full list of these icons right there yeah and this will go ahead and give you an amazing little uh icon picker so from here i would actually go ahead and bookmark this one guys um because this is actually going to be a really handy tool for you guys and let's just say right now what we needed we needed a profile right so let's go ahead and type in profile yep and you can see like it's found all the sort of profile ones right so let's click person and then it will actually give you the import line of code that you need so what we're gonna do is we're gonna i'm going to copy that and go over to how do i get it in blue versus black or is it just as simple as that yeah i think that's actually using something called color i think it might be color but there's a prop that you can pass in to get the different variants and sizes okay understood yeah so now we're inside the header so we can go ahead and that's it nice and now what we can do is we can go ahead and say that let's just pop in the um oops let's pop in the person icon so right here so if we do this now and let's open up our app and i'm just going to do npm start so then by the time we open up our app it's actually there nice yeah don't forget to npm start guys otherwise it will say like your app's not running and it might freak you out i would actually run npm start maybe in a separate terminal for you guys just so you guys have it but we're gonna run it and show you guys that step of cancelling every time so that way it gets very glued as do you need to restart it right so there we go you can see it's got the icon on the screen which is amazing it's exactly what we wanted um what we can do now is actually go ahead and grab the second icon which was a messages so if i go ahead and type in message i think the one that i used was the uh so you need there's a few so if we go to material ui uh material ui yep and we type in message in that box so there's a few here there's a chat bubble which is kind of clean actually um or there's like a forum so whichever one we can go with here so we've we've gone with the forum one this one questions and answers yeah so questions one that we check uh either or either or yeah okay let's pick the forum yeah so we got forum and what we can do now is we can actually go ahead and import that into our code so we can go ahead and import nice and then we can go ahead and pop it here so i'm going to check that one form icon like that and just to be clear guys i missed this actually but here's the person icon and we have at that added and then here's the forum icon that we have just added i know it's a little hard to see yeah so you can see like as i saved it it's all popped in there and now we've got those two things and then we notice how on the code i am a header is in the middle so you have literally you have the person icon at the top you have the item header and the second and then you have the forum icon there so we obviously this isn't obviously the ideal layout right now so we need to change that layout right we need to make that a bit more um sort of as a role as opposed to sort of by default it's something called block which it means it sort of stacks one on top of the other which is going to be a sort of annoying thing that we don't want so what we're going to do here is actually before we go ahead and do that no we will do that first we'll do that first so in order to get this working guys we need to first we're going to give this a class name so we're going to give this a class name of header and we use something called bem for our naming convention so i recommend everyone goes ahead and learns this because it's a really really handy way of naming your css variables and your class names um i'll leave that here yeah so we're going to call this header and then what we're going to need to do is we need to import something like this so header.css so we need to go ahead and create a file now called header.css so you can see it's freaking out because there is no header.css file so now what we need to do is create a header.css file so i'm going to go ahead and create a header.css file and we just should be popping into it right now so there we go so we have a header.css file and then you can see now we pretty much have the file imported here so every any bit of css that i write in here we're going to now get applied in here right and this way you keep your code very sort of componentized like and sort of isolate in a nice way so we have the header here so the first step we're going to do is you see we have these three children inside of here so if we go ahead and do header open close brackets and then we say display flex and what this will do is as soon as i hit save notice on kazi's screen as soon as i hit save it's going to put that that container into a display into a flexbox container it's going to change it to a flexbox container so as soon as i hit save it's going to by default flexbox pushes everything into a row so as soon as i hit save we'll see it goes into a row which is really nice and then what we can do is we can go ahead and do something like this we can say justify content space between and what this means is all of the children inside of it give them space between them so we'll have the two logos on the sides and then i am a header should be perfectly in the center and there you go which is really nice right so at this point that's very nice that is so easy it's clean right like it's super easy to get that up and running and at that point you're pretty much already getting like near enough to sort of like to uh the point of where we want to get to so dude i just i just had this idea what we should do is like make almost a cheat sheet of space between and justify content and stuff but like not a dummy cheat sheet like a real world cheat sheet so for example like um for example we have a cheat sheet where we have this image like this right here right yeah oh that would be sick see what i'm saying like actual app and then they can see and this is like flex you know space between yeah and then the amazon one where you built the header maybe like whatever it's there so i feel like this will give people an idea of like how this looks in real life yeah exactly and even like if we had the different variations for this one header so like space even the space between center shows you like exactly the difference what it's doing that'd be kind of cool nice okay so um what we're going to do next is we're actually gonna go ahead and give this a very subtle border right so uh so if i go ahead and add a border here so it's a border i'm gonna give it a one pixel solid and this is a very light gray right so just to exaggerate this i'm going to go ahead and do this so red and you can see as soon as i save this now you see there's like a red border right we're going to give it a very subtle gray because in tinder they have a very very subtle grey underneath it so you might not struggle to see this but it's a super super subtle gray right and and the more we build it out the more you'll see that um but then what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and add the tinder logo so the tinder logo is actually um so what we need to do is we go instead of saying i am a header what i'm going to do here is i'm going to use image so like this and basically ask for a source so in this case what we're going to go ahead and do is i've got a source right here for a tinder logo so we can go ahead and do this and just so you guys can see it in case you do want to use that i'll double line it so you can pause the video and see that nice so there you go all right so you guys can see that and you can make that single line and make use that link nice and then what we can do is in the alt tag so over here guys we can actually go ahead and type in uh we could just say tinder logo or something like that because you should always give like some kind of oh text right as soon as we hit save on that it formats it nicely and then you can see now in r1 we will have this huge logo that gets thrown in right yeah so if we open up um our app on the right oh cause we've got uh there we go so now um we should see okay so it hasn't popped in actually oh i haven't saved it oops right so now if i go ahead and let's see yeah so now we've got a massive tinder so we can't actually see it very clearly but there is a huge tinder uh icon on the right so oh yeah yeah huge right which means like obviously that's not ideal oh it's very good but we basically want to resize that and we want it to be a nice little neat icon at the top right so in order to do that this go ahead and give this a class name so that we can style it and here we can do i'm going to give this one a header and then in bem style and we say hello i want to take one comment here real quick so sorry guys some of your comments aren't coming through for some reason but we have a comment by elizabeth edelslin and she asks hey sunny is there a reason why you start your components as function or const which do you prefer and why right so function against const right yeah so what she means here guys is you can either write it as function or you can do like this right and this will actually do the same thing so this is the es6 way of doing it right so this is es6 and this is essentially what we call an arrow function right so i do like to write them like this so when i'm coding i actually tend to stick to this way because it's very neat um it's very clean but when we use some tools like we used a handy little um tool called um es7 react snippets yeah and what that does is it actually pops in sort of the sort of pre sort of the prepopulated code for you but it actually goes ahead and does it in the old way which is this way so it's function now guys there's nothing wrong with this um except you just need to change it i think both are okay right as long as you stay consistent you should be good there's no massive benefit to one over the other but the more modern way is with the error functions exactly yeah and to be fair it's actually good to know both it's really good to know both yeah yeah okay got it awesome thank you so now what we'll do is where we've got the class name we do header underscore underscore and then the set after you have these two underscores you write the element that you're talking about so in our case header logo and guys you never nest so you never have three levels or like logo sort of like tinder or something like that you never do that so it's always just header the component that you're in and then the elements in our case the logo that is what we're talking about so we can go ahead and save that and then we need to style it so we go into our css we say header logo and now what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to firstly give it a height of 40 pixels okay now if i give it a height of 40 pixels we should straight away see it snaps in and it looks a lot better like that right looks a lot better but i just want to show you a little trick now say i was to say as a width of like 60 pixels right now look what happens to the image right it's this you see that it distorted right so it really distorted it didn't it doesn't look too good and if i make this a bit bigger so 90 pixels you see it stretches out right if anyone ever runs into this problem there's a really handy little hack called object fit so if you do this object fit contain what look what happens now it will keep the aspect ratio while maintaining that size so if i do that look it doesn't look ugly and like yeah then now it looks actually really great yeah so that's a magic trick there guys in this case the height 40 does it perfectly for us but object fit is something which i always recommend you put yeah i'm just going to comment it out one more time guys so you can actually see what it does so let's actually comp oh yeah you might have to put a width uh let's put a width of like let's say 30 width of like 30 pixels and you should see it distort yeah so guys take a look at that right this is important like this is a hack that he constantly like every build that we do talks about object fit contain but this basically just locks in the resolution so it makes sure it's like pixel perfect so now if we actually uh uncomment this out and save it actually starts to look pixel perfect whatever it needs to do to make that happen yep exactly so object phase and once i found out about this it was like a game changer like i was looking for something like this and it fixes so many different headaches that you always run into so definitely get used to using that guys um some things by the way guys this is amazing we just broke 9 000 views so thank you guys so much for that guys we're about to break 10 000 this is gonna be freaking insane in less than an hour so that's never happened before guys if you want to help us with this just please smash the like button and also just drop in the comments below that you're excited so we can hack that youtube algorithm send it out to more people thank you for being on here but sunny yeah go for it so much guys that's insane dude holy crap wow nice so i saw a question and a lot of people said why const why not let right guys just a quick heads up so when we do stuff like this when i had it as cons before the reason why is because khan says that like once you define it it's not going to change or you're talking about the same object so my rule of thumb is always use const until you need to use let right if you follow that rule it always just makes life easier so always use cons until you need to use that i love that this way yeah i love the easiest way of remembering that do you know what's crazy is that you told me about that always just use constant till uh you need to use let and when i go by that rule what actually happens guys is when i'm using const sometimes i run into an error and as soon as i run into an error you know and i'm like oh crap i'm actually changing this variable a lot like maybe i'm incrementing it or i'm like you know changing this array and then i'm like oh okay i need to actually use let you know and then i'll go back exactly and it protects you guys because it protects you against like accidentally changing things when you didn't want to change stuff so a really really good thing to incorporate yeah awesome so um what we're gonna do next guys is uh the per the icons that we imported actually allow us to uh add a prop so icons if you if a lot of you guys don't know are actually fonts right so whenever you talk about an icon you're actually talking about a font if it's a if it's a true icon and in this case they accept something called font size um in material ui so here what we can do is we they actually accept either large or small in our case we're just going to use large and watch what happens so if i add this here and i add this here and i hit save we'll see that the fonts so you see the icons actually grew a bit they got a little bit bigger right and it gives us like a very clear crisp one a way of using it um so that's a really nice little trick for you guys uh what we're also going to do next is i'm going to go ahead and give those icons so right now the icons are touching the side which i don't really like too much so instead of doing that what i'm going to go ahead and do is i'm going to give a class name to these two icons so here i'm going to add this class name of header icon to both icons you see this header icon header icon yeah and what i'm going to go ahead and do is go into header.css and style it and just go ahead and say that i want to give it a padding of 20 pixels so before i hit save on this so padding of 20 pixels before i hit save on this just keep an eye on those uh icons on the right so as soon as i hit save it's going to add a padding around them and we should see it now um oh i haven't saved it yet so now should a pop in i have done that right header icon header icon person class name let me go ahead and see what's going on two views away from hitting 10 000 views oh my god dude damn hey wow this is awesome and as soon as you find the fix as soon as you find the fix just jump in nice oh that's it we're good guys we just broke 10 000 views this is awesome thank you guys so much hey thank you so much we almost 1 000 uh thumbs up as well guys if we can get to a thousand thumbs up look i can see the number creeping up keep smashing it guys you're dead nice um right so the next thing guys is what we're going to do is so we actually added that padding and you can see now this is a very good demonstration of flexbox right so we can see that it added padding but notice how the image now isn't aligned on the horizontal axis with the rest of the icons right that's a problem because it doesn't look good so now what we need to do is we need to go to the header css rules and we use this nice little trick called align items and what this will do is if we do a line item center on the horizontal axis that's going to align everything cente central so now if i do that there we go well maybe vertical yeah always forget but yeah there we go so yeah it got it all straight on the same line and now that looks really crisp and clean okay so that's the first step guys and that's really nice and everything looks pretty sweet on that front so what we can do now is we can go ahead and that's actually for now that's actually no no one more step right the buttons right now so you see the two icons right now if we check out the one that we built kazi we can actually see here yeah so if we we can actually see when we click those you see that it has that nice clickable oh that little ah yeah that is nice so we want that same clickable effect so whenever you use icons um whenever you use the material ui kind of come up would come with that when you click yeah so it does come with that but it comes with that for buttons right but what you can actually do is you can take it up ahead yeah you can make it a button but they've got something really nice called icon button and what you do is you just wrap that around an icon and it gives you all of that stuff oh beautiful okay let's do so what we can do is to import it what we do is we just pull in this line here so maybe one said sunny would you swipe right on me i actually did swipe right on you that's how we met holy crap i did not know you guys met on tinder it was it wasn't tinder it was a different app called uh domo but yeah that's how we met it's crazy right yeah so here we've got icon button um right in there elmo what is that it's called dilmo dale mill yeah it's crazy huh it's like a south asian sort of stuff dang up ah i see okay yeah i heard of minder you know i haven't been there it's like tinder but for muslims oh really oh we should make dinner tinder but for developers i swear to god i feel like you just hit a million dollars only software developers allow dating each other yeah like proof of your github to get in you know it's like you use node instead of firebase like swipe left swipe left if you use node graph yeah c plus plus swipe left i've been super like you know yeah [Laughter] oh man oh that is actually golden that is i think we should build that there people would pay for that like they'd literally sign up for like 20 bucks a month yeah it's actually a good idea holy crap nice so we imported we import we're gonna have a chat after this guys if you see linda come out at any point you know he built it so they're like loving it in the comments i see it oh sick someone said tinder tin dev oh that is nice yeah that's really cool in there nice so guys you see where we have the two icons right so this person i've gone here for michael what we can do now is we can wrap the icon button so icon button oops we can wrap that like this and what we can do is if i pop that in there and i'm not going to save it yet and i'm going to do this which is why it's not formatted the way because by the way guys if you're wondering why we get that automatic formatting it's because we use something called prettier i recommend everyone does it and it will make your life a lot easier so as soon as i hit save now you see prettier kicks in and we've wrapped the icon buttons and now what we'll see is you see it just got that light little gray overlay because it's it's automatically applied that sort of button style to it which means we're doing fancy and you get that nice little clickable you know a little floating riffle man i love that like that ripple is so nice like look at that oh yeah it gives you such a nice it's so satisfying like it's so satisfying dude like yeah okay really nice right so now what we're going to do is we've actually gone ahead and finished the header which is perfect so we actually did that really nice um let's go ahead and go to our app.js what we can do now is we can actually by the way on our on our tinder for developers people are jumping in and they're like i would invest in this idea uh and then somebody's like yo i was lit bro he's like i was literally talking to my friend about what app i should make with swift and we were joking about tinder 2.0 with background checks yeah nice oh yeah i can see that one yeah nice tinder killed it dude i seriously think that's such i mean like oh we should we should do that we should do that one of our one of our bills we're gonna do that for one of our builds live yeah tinder and the next thing you see you see like 10 dev gets series c funding seriously would actually be like i think that's something we can just like stream for 12 hours unprepared and i think people would love watching it yeah and that's something me and cozzy would do like we would actually go ahead and build stuff like that and yeah that'd be fun then we should do that with maybe with the react native yeah it'd be a cool project yeah nice so now what we can do is we can go ahead and let's go ahead and get rid of let's build the tinder clone up at the top so that way the header actually sits at the top so we save that now it's starting to look a bit more like an app so it started to already got that nice app filled to the top right um awesome so the next step guys is to actually go ahead and build i guess the tinder cards right but that but before we do that i think this is actually a good point to actually introduce react router right so at this point um if we so react router guys is basically going to allow us to have several different pages so we noticed when we built the app we when we click on the sort of messages screen you opens up the messages screen when we open up the um the individual chat screen you open up the chat screen right so in order to get that working in the in the way that we need it to we need to install something called react router right um so kazi let's go ahead and go over to uh react router.com cool yep so react router and i think it's the second link so it's not the github link oh yeah that's it that's the one this is the website yeah so if you could click on web um weird website yeah i know that's what's going on this is the nice sort of docs but then what you want to do is where it says npm install react router dom you just want to copy that line right so copy that line and then we go ahead and do mpm install reactor dom and now what i'll do is i'll pull in everything we need to handle the routing right inside of our app um so that's pretty much going to go ahead and do that and then once we do that guys remember run npm start to relaunch the app back up again but you can go ahead and look at the docs they have really good documentation on this stuff so let's go ahead and restart the app but what we're going to do is we're going to actually show you sort of all you need to actually get it running right so to actually get running now all we need to do is do let's go ahead and firstly we type in router right so oops i don't know why mine does that so we have ruta yo i actually love that somebody just said like on tindev instead of dates uh instead of like um their profile pictures it's actually their coding projects and you can take a look at that and match with them based on their projects yeah i imagine that someone else said bug fixing and dating so like you could you could either you could date them or you could hire them both exactly yeah i think it's got it's got potential dude oh my god how did you get material how did you get icon button wrapper from material ui sony i just imported it uh very good question i just imported at the top so you can see it there that's how we do that um so back to react router guys we have the router here which is basically like it's going to be the parent and everything else sits inside of this now yeah so imagine all of this stuff will sit inside of here even our header will sit inside of here right so we go ahead and save that so everything sits inside of react rear and then what you want to do is you have a something called a whoa whoa whoa man what did you do the whole the app is broken i need a refund i need a refund so what we need to do now guys is actually go ahead and import it so there's a little trick and i think let's go ahead and try the import trick cozy oh god your truth never works man that trick yeah look at that which looks like oh i think that's right no no hold on let's try it here all right ah it never works sometimes it works guys but basically all you need to do is i'm going to copy it in here so you this is what we're going to import yep import react wait hold on bro there we go there we go that's the one yeah so this is essentially what we need to import guys so here what we're saying is we're saying import browser router but we rename it as as rooter because browser root is kind of ugly right and then you've got switch root and link and these ones will explain it's like we don't actually need link yeah but these three we need right so that's awesome somebody just donated like a dollar ranit that is so awesome thank you and he says awesome guys 20k views soon hell yeah hey that's it awesome nice um somebody says any tip to optimize images oh i'll show you a tip in a later video if we get enough sort of people interested you can use firebase to handle that really nicely oh yeah yeah that's true yeah um okay so we've got the router and then what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and push in something called a switch right so switch now what switch does is i don't know why it does that right so switch or switches is basically all of your routes sitting here right so let's just kind of pop this uh outside for a second so i'm just gonna comment this over here i'm gonna push this outside for a second and even this stuff let's just go ahead and push this down here so we've just got a very clean layout right so you've got a router and then you have a switch and now you here you define something called roots so here that we would have one room which would have a path which says when your website is on the home page right so when your websites are when your website's on the home page basically go ahead and do this so say like so let's go ahead and say i am homepage right so i am homepage and then what we're going to do is we're going to copy this again and i'm going to push this at the top and you want to do let's say when we're on the chat sort of page i am the chat page for example right so now we have these two different routes and they were rendered two different things right so somebody else donated oh thank you so much nice oh wow that's awesome thank you for another donation a conch awesome sheila says sunny please show us how to deploy it to firebase we will be showing you that so stay tuned and we will be showing you that at the end of the video uh yeah so now we've clicked save so now you can see because he's on the home page right now right so what we're gonna if we go ahead and go to forward slash chat look what happens now so forward slash chat look what happens whoa it's like instant i'm a chat pag there we go i'm a japan yeah so nice so that's how we basically define roots guys and that's how different pages work inside of a react app right so that's actually what's happening when you do that um so at this point what we can do is neat little trick for you is if you want the header to appear on all of the pages what you can actually go ahead and do is actually just put it outside the room right and now regardless if you're in the chat page or if you're inside the other one notice how um so if we go now to the home page so if we go over to forward slash um just forward slash notice how the header stays there that is looking clean yeah so now you'll notice how because we put the header outside of the room it renders the header regardless and then based on the route it will render out the rest of the stuff right which is really cool that is nice so this allows us to just have the header pretty much everywhere so like this thing is going to be everywhere and then the stuff that's underneath it the body of the page is gonna be handled dynamically based on dude that is so clean that is so clean like if it slash chat it will do this here which is yup um if it's home it's gonna show you us this but if i put the slash chat then it's going to route oh that is that is just clean right and even you can go to a level of doing that inside components which is insane so even in components i'm about to build one right now live okay i'm picking this stuff up you know i'm i'm picking out what you're putting now let's do quasi i'm going to do yo quasi here fire emoji let's save it and now you're telling me if i do kazi oh man that is that is just so cool right i love it i love react so powerful and like it's so clean like literally and you have this nice like high level hierarchy of like where why things render but guys one thing to notice i think they fixed this in version six reactor but it's something which you guys will run into let's say i go ahead and put this route right so say i go ahead and put this route at the top yeah now even if we go to forward slash kazi watch what happens so let's go ahead and go over to forward slash kazi uhhuh like that now you see it says i'm a home page yeah you're wondering hang on but it didn't reach because imagine like code runs sequentially in javascript right so it's going to read this and it's going to read this and it's going to read this yeah it hits this and it's like okay i already rendered what i needed so you always want to have your default route at the bottom right and then you have your specific routes at the top so you always put your default at the bottom otherwise you'll be wondering like why is it not working and i've actually sat there in the beginning and spent ages debugging that makes sense okay yeah that's a good one guys that's that's an important one yeah so now what we can do is we can go ahead and we have the chat we have the home page um and for now we can leave this as the chat but for the home page oh we've got a header here perfect so i guess the next step is to actually go ahead and implement the react card right so the react card is the really interesting part now another donation by hacker street thank you so much really really appreciate that amazing dude yeah yeah i really appreciate it guys thank you guys now i don't feel bad for getting this starbucks coffee you know finally yeah right um so and now if we go to google and type in um let's type in react tinder card so somebody actually went ahead and built a card component which we're going to go ahead and make use of which um it's a really really nice way of doing it um and somebody went ahead and made a component for that and oh my god i just saw a 3d one as well oh damn i might actually go rebuild that and do it with that build it live yeah so yeah the code and the code looks pretty kind of clean too like on card left screen on swipe seems like it handles a lot of that logic for us exactly which is gonna be really clean really nice right so what we're going to do at this point is we just need to worry about installing it so let's go ahead and copy the install code so npm install react in the card and then we can go ahead and i'll just open up a new terminal here yep oh and i gotta make sure that icd not gonna be absolutely necessary but it always bites us in the ass at the very very end yeah it comes when we actually deploy because we would have been installing our dependencies somewhere else um nice so once we do that guys so while that's actually doing that oh it they've done that pretty quick actually yeah nice so now what we can do is we want to have all of our sort of tinder card logic in a separate bit i don't want this bit to like sort of get bloated out and have a bunch of code here right it's just going to be ugly nobody wants that so here what i'm going to go ahead and do is build something like this so let's go and have a tinder cards components or something like that right so what i can do is just i'm going to create a file called tinder cards and we're going to snap into it in just a sec so tinder cards so now we're inside of that file right and what i'm going to do is type in rfce so this is the es7 syntax es7 snippets extension in case you're wondering how this works i press enter and it basically builds it like this and just to show you an example of how we can do it like this we can pretty much have it like that right we can have it like that as well but in this case it's very easy to see as function um so nice so here this is where all the cards are gonna live right so just to sort of get it working we could say tinder cards and then we can save that file go back to app.js and basically import so if i go ahead and import this one so uh oh that trick didn't work damn it so if we got to the top we say import tinder cards from tinder cards and then we save it now we can see tinder cars loads right so that's really nice and now all of our code is just going to live in this tindercards.js file which is much nicer than having every in one place yep nice so now we have the h1 here so instead of the tinder instead of having it like this what we essentially want to have instead is basically so you you'll notice in their example what they do is they actually have like an array right they have an array of stuff so and what we can do here is we can go ahead and do an array outside so let's just say const and let's just call it our characters when you say array what do you mean so an array is like a list no i mean i understand that yeah like what were you referring to when you said that they have an array array of like people in their array of like cards like what is it exactly so remember when we're swiping through those cards right we need a list to sort of swipe through so so we have like a list of sort of people to swipe through right got it so basically yeah go ahead so we're putting all of these people in an array with all their and is it an array of objects uh yes it's gonna be an array of objects and they're gonna have two things right they're gonna have an image got it got it you guys by the way do you guys follow that so far like that array is gonna need their each person's image and name so far so then we can like display the name and we can display the image okay that's what we're actually building right now if you follow that just drop it in the comments below exactly that perfect so guys what we need to do here is let's go ahead and use uh some state right so stay in react is like the short term memory i like to call it right so in this case what we're going to call it this let's refer to all of the people that you see as just characters right so in this case characters can be a very easy way to remember it right so the characters here are going to be uh we can just call it people let's just say people right so people and i say set people and this is basically what i'm doing here is i'm declaring a variable in the react way let's just just think of it like that right i'm declaring a variable so this is how you declare a array in react or any variable nice react yeah so you use state so basically this is the same this is i'm just going to keep hammering it till it's like clear in my mind and your guys's guys this is the same as literally typing in that yes exactly i'm just gonna leave that pretty much permanently there because like once you get this through just tons and tons of just brutal pattern recognition you will become insanely good at react like that is pretty much the same thing you know exactly that exactly that and yeah and i see some people saying well like that's what you're doing functional components yeah for now guys focus about functional components so whenever you see state or like or you state sorry or hooks then it's all we're always talking about functional components and also you might be wondering what set people is set people is always going to you the the sort of standard is whatever your variable is called so let's say in this case it's people your modifier is called set whatever your variable so set people in this case and what we mean by modifier is we never do this we never say so imagine we had cause this variable up here so cons people equals this we never do people equal something like this people.push um i don't know like abc right or like however you you never directly assign it instead you say set people and then here you would pass in an array or something or like this or you could oh yeah that's actually that's another good one let's actually leave those as comments so um leave your thing and i'm gonna do uh people dot push and i'll literally do the same thing as you're doing right there so i'm gonna leave mine both comment yeah we can comment that out right there so guys that's and we'll comment this out now like literally guys this is the normal way of doing it okay this is how you would do it normally or bad in this case and then this is the react way of pushing to the array okay i'll just put in parentheses push to an array in react yeah right and the reason why we use this this set people or set whatever the variable's called is because it tells react when you change the variable oh remember to rerender your the the component so that remember to to repaint the screen but reacts very clever it means that like if you change the people in that list or the people on those cards it knows then at that point to um to change uh to to sort of repaint the screen so it knows to update or refresh the screen right so in this case now what we're going to do is we let's say we have some people and inside of here we're going to have two objects we're going to have let's just say for simplicity let's have name let's have sunny and then let's have url and we could just do well let's just do characters here so we done um so in this case we had um let's just say steve jobs or something steve jobs these streams are awesome like i'm watching it every time i'm just becoming a better react developer like yeah it's crazy right like it's so crazy and then for the second person let's just have like uh let's say mark zuckerberg now here you have like the two names and then for urls we can go ahead and find like a picture of those two people um as reference so i'll go ahead and find them in a second but basically oops basically what these are going to do is the url is going to be the picture of that person and the name is is going to be what we're going to see right so that's basically our structure set up so these are going to be two cards in in in our array right so that's awesome now what we need to do is actually go ahead and pull that information into the app right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say down here let's go ahead and say so we're going to do some jsx and we're going to say people dot map so we're saying loop through those people right let's loop through that list of people to that array and then for every single person so remember it loops through and it gets the first person and you output some information loops through gets the second person i'll put some information keeps doing that until you get to the end result and then here we're going to say return so normal parentheses as they return a tinder card right so a tinder card now you're wondering what a tinder card is we actually need to import it so let's go ahead to the top of the code up here we say import it's pretty important sunny so joshua says what does the parentheses dot dot dot mean it just means that keep whatever was in the state earlier and append to that that's all that means so it just says hey don't completely overwrite it put the initial stuff first so he this is what he's referring to you guys so i'm highlighting it actually i gotta move his comment because taking over the whole screen so yeah that's what he's referring to so it just means keep whatever is there already then add sunny to that and add quasi to that if sunny did not have this guys it would actually just overwrite the actual uh array that's we don't want that we want to have multiple people in there and not keep overwriting them yeah and that's called a spread operator and it's huge in es6 uh so definitely definitely worth some red operation yeah and imagine it this way like imagine you had an array it literally just spreads it out so it spreads the contents out and in this case it spreads the contents out inside of our array and then we add sunny and quasi yup love it okay nice so we just imported the tinder card from that dependency that we installed earlier the second step now is we're going to use that tinder card so we're going to say tinder card like this oops then it got like this and then what we're going to say is inside of that tinder card let's go ahead and have a div so let's go ahead and have a div and that div is going to have a class name of card so this would say in this case we're just going to call it card we're not going to use bem just for this demonstration and while we're and what we're about to do right now is in our array we're going to have steve jobs show up for our card and then mark zuckerberg show for our card exactly so here what we can say is we can have like so the person's name will come up here right so basically to get the person's name here what we can do is we can just say person dot name and curly braces and that will actually go ahead and go to this person and it will access the uh the name key right and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna make it so that the div right so imagine we have a container we have the name but the div here is actually going to have the following so we're going to say it's going to have a style and the style that we're going to directly apply here is this is called an inline style right and what we're going to say is we're going to say it's got a background image all right background image and we're basically going to do something called string interpolation here and we're going to say it's a url right it's a url open close brackets and inside that url we're essentially going to have the person dot url and basically what this is doing is it's saying the background image is imag this is essentially changing the css through javascript so we're actually modifying the style here through javascript so we're saying set the background image of the container so that that sort of square box around sort of the person name to whatever that person's um whatever that person's url is so in this case we have got an empty i'm going to go ahead and grab something right now so steve jobs let me quickly grab a url for steve opponents guys you're going to be using camel casing yeah exactly so we've got i'm going to grab a picture for steve jobs and a picture from mark zuckerberg and guys you don't need to copy the exact pictures that we got any picture will work here but you just need to go on google and grab a picture so in this case we've got steve and we've got mark let me go ahead and grab that one so we got this one there you go any any photo will work but yeah you guys can take a look at which ones we're using and you can literally copy that if you want to but get your own yeah get your own photo are you following me still quasi i'm just wondering what was it i am now following you nice it wasn't following me for a second i think yeah so i'm just added those two pictures uh um so it's literally just let me take a look at this photo bro let me take a look at what you got let's see let's see if you're representing steve jobs the right way all right you know low resolution photo but it's all right i think that'll work yeah and then check out my mug fun all right let's check out this one right over here oh my god i'm gonna i'm sorry mark but i'm gonna have to swipe left on this one oh man so we have those two pictures right and we have this with the um by the way thank you guys so much we just broke 15 000 views you guys what the holy that is insane thank you guys so much for doing this guys uh guys keep smashing that like button i also think we broke a thousand likes i'm not sure but i think we did we did we did we broke 1100 likes jesus what is happening today guys you guys are forced to reckon with thank you for being on here but please smash that like button if you haven't already subscribed to the channel and let's keep this thing going hey we just got another uh donation nice by monu sachiteva thank you so much i love this our chat revenue is i'm above 22.30 right now i'm pumped awesome thank you nice thank you so much yeah um nice so now we have oh we just hit 1200 likes so we have the div and then we have the person's name right so that's really cool um what we want to do now is we actually want to go ahead and there's a few uh props that we need to pass inside the tinder card right so tinder card this is after looking at the documentation we're going to go ahead and give it a class name of swipe so just for reference we're going to come back to that in a sec classroom swipe and we're going to give it a key right and the key and are in this case is going to be the person's name right so in order to get the person's name we do this person.name reason why key is so important guys whenever you have any kind of list right any sort of list inside encoding you want to give it a key which is like a unique identifier for that item in the list and this basically allows react to cleverly in a smart way rerender its contents right so we need to give it a key and then so hold on i'm just gonna i'm just gonna write that out what you just said so always give keys in react and what's the benefit of this so it allows react to efficiently rerender a list right so allows react to efficiently rerender a list and this also so like in other words guys it also makes your app super fast yep yep now guys the reason why you might not see the benefit immediately is because you only have like 10 20 30 40 50 things inside there inside your list but let's say your app took off tomorrow right let's say dev ed uh like the dinder app took off tomorrow right yeah and we hit that yeah we had like a million users on there then suddenly you've got a million users and that slight decrease in speed suddenly becomes a huge decrease in speed right and say like you matched up with thousands of people because you're like an amazing person like you just you're going to see that speech the effect right what kind of projects are you developing bro holy [ __ ] you have some crazy get out dude [Laughter] i just donated 30 dollars yeah dude no this is totally that's so insane but it's something thank you oh my god guys what are you guys doing i'm about to cry right now this is a lot blowing my mind dude oh my god i'm about to get it yo you know i'm about to take the money that we're getting from the chat and we'll just do a giveaway like a free clever programmer shirt you know yeah or like a tinder club tin dev shirt and we'll just tinder was created we should write the the date underneath the estimated whatever the day is oh man now amman says does a clean up process a news effect is necessary okay so we'll talk about use effect later on um very good question though they're calling us their react duo now apparently hey that's nice dude react to it's going yeah awesome and and by the way guys i'll uh another way to think about this right guys is if i go to instagram.com and i go to like one of my things right now if i'm about to make a comment on here and i hit like blah blah blah and i hit post now instead of it refreshing every single comment that's already on this post when i hit post it only posts that comment and it doesn't refresh anything else that's another benefit of using keys and react okay otherwise that won't happen exactly but what will happen is if you say you didn't put a key a lot of people might say like hang on but it's still working right that's where you get confused because it's not actually working at that point like isn't it it's working but it's not rerendering it in the clever way and now trust me it does make a difference just rule of thumb always do use a key right so that's a nice example on instagram um so back to tinder card guys there was one more prop that's really important here guys and it's basically called prevent swipe right now prevent swipe is basically so the guys built this in such a way so whoever made this uh this component but in such a way that you could swipe left and right but you could also swipe up and down so like in in tinder you have like super like i think if you swipe up and then swiping down i don't think it does anything but in this case our app's going to be a bit simpler right so it's just going to have up uh left and right so we're actually going to prevent a up and down swipe so basically the way they they tell you to do that is you pass in an array of up and down and that will prevent you from swiping up and down look at this alexander's like npx create react app tin dev clone the race is on dude man i'm actually like i think we can start a movement with this but my bad keeps going dude yeah there you go nice okay so now with that said we've got those two things right now they also have some really other cool stuff like on swipe on card left screen but we're not going to touch on those uh just yet so with that said what we can actually go ahead and do is i think let me go and check on my local um let me see if it does what i'm thinking it does before we start it so okay yeah so now because if you go ahead and go over to your um your your local host so now you'll see that these are actually pictures right they're pictures but you can't tell probably so if you swipe left or mark zuckerberg look at that how clean is that bro yeah let me take steve jobs and swipe right that is nice you guys my mind is right nice who will pay for that app how many of you guys will pay for that app right there exactly that's that's tinder right there that's that's that's a backhand [Laughter] yeah that's for back that's the back end developers guys this is the app um they just have to log into their command line and they get they see the pictures and ascii it's just a console log of like somebody's face in ascii so this looks horrible at the at this point but i mean for a frontend developer it looks terrible for a backend it looks beautiful so at this point we need to actually go ahead and add a css file so i'm going to go ahead and create another css file called tinder cards dot css right tindercards.css we're going to snap into that now and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and import that so import tinder cards dot css there we go and now what we're going to do is we've actually got a bunch of things here so i've got a card i've got this swipe so i'm going to start going one by one so let's let's start with styling the card a little bit right so the tinder card if we go in here i'm going to give this a position of relative which means that it's now going to basically be relative to its parent so this is just a rule here that will help us out later on um so i'm just going to save that one and as we save it you'll see like things will slowly get reflected on the right right so we'll have that then we want to have a width of 600 pixels let's say a width of 600 pixels save that wait i'm seeing steve jobs and mark zuckerberg at the same time now yep you will see them at the same time okay okay got it yep but for now you'll see it because remember guys it's just a list that we're returning those so that's actually the background images of the people but it looks like you can't really tell that at this point right so we have a width of 600 pixels and then we have a um uh let's just say a padding of 20 pixels so you want those to have a bit of padding between the certain between those cards so okay so it's starting to get a little bit better and then we say a max width right so a max width this will come into play later but i will explain it when we we sort of demo this later but i'm going to give it a max width of 85 view it right so i explain that in a bit and also a height here so i want to give it a height and the height i'm saying is is 50 view height so this is all going to be proportionate to how big your screen is so usually we use something called pixels which is a set height right but view height basically will determine based on the height of your screen or your device how big it should be right so you see in this case now if we have the let's have the app open on the side because it's the local host yeah oh whoa whoa nice you see that right so it's using like approximately 50 of the view height of your screen to figure out the sort of screen so you see like is that if you look at steve's one it's pretty much like 50 is the height right yeah so that's how we do that and now i don't like that i can you know i can see like one of their eyes so that's pretty good for me to judge somebody on and then all the swiping functionality is still there everything still works really nice so the next step we want to do is add a little border radius to it so let's add a little border radius so let's go ahead and do that border radius and we that adds the rounded corners and then what we're going to say is a background size of cover and background position of center so i'm going to go ahead and pop these two in here and now as soon as i hit save guys look at this magic right so it actually went ahead and it made it so that it covered the background and then it centered it so obviously mark's picture is pretty dominant on the left side which is why even when it's centered it's to the left [Laughter] yeah he's gonna be like he's just one of those corner cases um but basically at that point we have everything looking much more much nicer at this at that stage um just to sort of show you guys in a very visual way i can go ahead and swap out mark's face for this and now there we go that's nicer right yeah that's a little bit nicer yep so then what we can do is we're going to add a little box shadow here because box shadows are nice everyone loves box shadow so let's add a little box shadow here to the card there's actually a really nice website i use sometimes for creating a box shadow oh i think i've used a few of the weird like they sort of allow you to sort of do the directions yep right here yeah so you guys if you just want to go ahead and you can copy that box shadow and that will pretty much give you like it's a very subtle behind it right it's very exciting i'll do is when we get it working i'll actually show you and get rid of that and it'll show you how that works but the magic here now guys is we pretty much have this like we have these two things stacked right so even if you swipe off of steve jobs mark will come up right yeah so by the way guys if you're enjoying this so far drop a comment below and let us know that you're enjoying this okay let's keep the energy up so then that way you can also learn a lot better the more you are engaged the more you're actually going to retain so if you feel yourself kind of like weaning off whether you're watching a replay or watching right now live as we're here with you if you feel yourself like stand up if you need to like literally actually physically stand up right now you know grab a glass of water or just like stand up move your body sit back down and have a good posture that's gonna allow you to just focus in a much much deeper level and drop it in the comments below that you're ready to go okay because we got a long way to go but i want to make sure that all this information actually stays with you so you don't have to feel like you're watching this four hours five hours again and again and it just doesn't retain this way it will retain forever okay so get your body a little bit more alert drop it in the comments below and let's keep going exactly and if you're enjoying it guys smash the thumbs up button yes do that as well awesome so that's um yes so now we actually have we have steve and we have mark sitting there over there right but that's not how tinder looks right they don't all come on the screen at once so what we need to do at this point is we actually need to go ahead and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and basically wrap our um our sort of tinder cards inside of a um inside of a so let's call it tinder cards inside of a container and let's call it card container right so i'm just going to create a card container and i'm going to basically pop all of the cards all the tinder cards inside of that container all right so the reason for this is because i'm now going to style this card container and i'm going to apply some rules to it right so i'm going to go ahead and say that the card container so that card container should have display flex so display flex which means that by default it should go into a row so now mark should go to the right as opposed to being underneath right we're going to say justify contents on the center so it will always sort of center the value right and then what i'm going to say is so now you can see like it looks broken at this point because it's like hang on like i've got mark on and i've got both of them in the center like carzi if you go ahead and you swipe on um so swipe on one person here so swipe on one of them yeah and notice how much oh nice yeah so he is already like sort of centered at this point right but we have this sort of problem of having both on the screen at one time right so i'm going to add a little margin here of 10 view height so again it's going to be dependent on how big the screen is i'm going to add a small view height here let's go ahead and make that a little bit more gentle so let's just say five view height for now so five if you hire there we go and now what we're going to do is this is where the magic happens guys so the card so if we notice that when we made this card we gave the tinder card a class name of swipe right so i'm going to go ahead and style this and say swipe and then what i'm going to say is position absolute right now what absolute does is what i'm going to do is firstly before we do this i'm actually going to go ahead and because if you refresh your page before we save this yep done yeah so guys notice how there are two things on the right right so there is uh mark and steve right they're both there um but as soon as i do this so now i'm saying set the position of this the cards not to be the default but to be absolute positioning right that means that it's going to be absolutely so then what we're doing is we're actually stacking them on top of each other right so now if i do this and i save it yep did you notice how they basically went behind each other and then wow actually nice yeah they went behind each other and then because they were actually center positioned it made it so that they all go by that is that is really really cool that is awesome right yeah so you get a really clean experience sir and everything works in a really nice way um so that's actually the way a few things i just want to highlight thank you guys you guys are loving it i'm seeing your all your guys's comments so like elizabeth is like yes this is awesome so hail is like broke amazing work loving the way you guys explain um so yeah i mean and then um i will butcher this i'll butcher this name but oh la even he was like i'm pumped and people are like i'm trying not they're like no sign of sleep here you know they're like we're ready to go so guys awesome i just see this right now because i see the dip happening and i know that that's where the energy is going down so i just want to make sure we bring that right back up so that's why sometimes boom i just connect with you and yes i'm looking at you because if you chat right now i will actually look at it sometimes you'll see me put my head down it's because i'm actually reading your chat and actually trying to respond or answer it later or bring it up on the screen so if you guys engage there we'll definitely see it but again thanks for actually engaging and putting your energy into it you will retain just so much more okay so we really want to make sure that understanding is there as we keep going exactly and guys we are always watching those comment sections so never ever think that your comment is ignored every single one that you guys post drew is motivating and it brings us up and it keeps it's what keeps us going for these like long live sessions so um we love it guys and we really appreciate you guys watching and being here um nice so now what we want to do is guys so we have mark and we have um we have mark and we have steve like perfectly aligned they're looking like good in this sort of view right but what we need to do now is actually go ahead and fix the text the text doesn't look good right you can't even see it at the moment so at this point what we want to do is we want to change it so that we firstly the way we do that is we say we go to our code and we say go to the card and say where is h3 so where there is a direct chart which is a h3 so the reason why we're doing that is because here we have the card here and we're saying the direct charge is a h3 so you're saying where the name is we're going to go ahead and say it's position absolute so absolute means that we can basically position it wherever we want right we're going to say it's going to be 10 pixels from the bottom right so in this case because it's what absolute positioning i think 10 should work and then we're going to say it's color and then we're going to say it should be white right so if i save that let's go ahead and see if that works first time is that going to work so i think we need to do 10 pixels from the bottom and there we go so now we can see mark zuckerberg at the bottom right and if we go ahead and swipe again you can see steve jobs is now at the bottom so you can see like we started to get it already looking a bit like tindo right and it's starting to look very very nice and very very clean all right so we then want to go ahead and do um let me just double check we have info tags okay nice right so that actually believe it or not is actually the tinder cards pretty much at this point done so like that's actually a really really nice simple implementation to get that working um but we don't just we don't just finish there guys i'm going to show you now how instead of pulling it from our code how can we pull this from firebase because hey firebase let's go i'm going to pull from like hard written code it's going to be pulling from firebase and we're going to have a balance here to sort of show you how you can do that and take this a step further so with that said what we need to do is uh remember that config file that we pulled earlier kazi yeah we're gonna need that right now so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and create a file called firebase.js right so we're gonna go ahead and create a file called firebase.js and now what we need to do is we actually need to go ahead so that's exactly the conflict so i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys where i got it from because i know it's been a long time since we were actually right there so i am in my app right now guys and um basically go down here and actually let me actually show you the url oh actually that url probably will not help you at all uh but here's the config file and this is where i grab it from and then boom we just pop it in right there okay this is going to contain all the information to your database your project all of that so make sure that you have found that part of the project where we actually show you how to host the app on firebase exactly oh nice kidus [ __ ] said watching this for one hour helps me more than a 10 hour video that's amazing whoa whoa that is awesome let me see if i can actually put that up on the screen i can't find that comment but that is awesome thank you oh yeah thank you so much um nice so guys before we we do that now we need to open up the terminal and do something uh do the following you need to say npm install so i can't actually edit this terminal so let me request rewrite access it's done yep so now if you press command j to pull it up so your mpmi um command j yep there we go npm i and then we say firebase so that what this is going to do is going to install firebase into the project pull in all the dependencies that we need and that will sort of allow us to use firebase inside of our app while that installs let's go over to firebase.js so what cars you did here is perfect so you just want to pull in your firebase config and then what you want to do is you want to before that you just need to do the following you say import firebase from firebase and then we have a magic sort of line so we have a magic line here so we have constant it says firebase let's just go ahead and call it firebase app so firebase app and then what we say is we say firebase because we're talking to we're talking about the one that we just pulled in firebase dot and then we say dot initialize app right initialize app so here we say initialize app and that's like a function that firebase gives us and then basically here all we do guys is pass in the firebase config so like that right so we're just passing the firebase config and it's super clean right so super super clean and then what we can do is the next step is we say const database equals and then here all we need to do is say firebase app so we're basically gonna we're referring to this one firebase app and we say dot firestore now if you're wondering what firestore is it's the realtime um the sort of the newer realtime database that firebase offers and that's how we access it so with that said that is literally everything we need to get the database up and running right so what we need to do now is to make sure that we can use the database outside of this file is to say export default database and yep so this is a this is an important thing in react guys you always want to make sure you're exporting the variable that you need access to later and you can then use it in different files whether he uses in header.js or app.js just remember exporting it at some point whether it's a component or whatever you're going to need access to it exactly and somebody just dropped 50 um that is amazing now the chat revenue is over four dollars i love it thank you guys amazing nice so we have uh x4 yeah default database so that's they dropped it and they said uh it was rene renee drops the he dropped the donation and then he also said finally firebase yeah amazing nice so guys this is like the magic point where we connected firebase to react so really really important point here right so this is actually sort of and this is so simple guys as in like it's it's literally the simplest implementation that you're gonna find with connecting react to firebase uh i've tried to look for simpler you just this is the easiest way to do it right so um once you have this up and running that's pretty much everything you need to get set so let's go ahead and head over to firebase now quasi yeah and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and create uh so we need to go to database on the left and we need to click on firestore i want to open them yeah so we're going to now be building our database to what to store the messages or store the cards no so we're not going to store messages we're going to demo how we can store the codes i see yeah because all of these people that are here they're actually stored in a database right now right in real time yeah exactly got it right and what we're going to show you is we're going to show you a mix of sort of hardcoded stuff and firebase stuff so that you guys can then get both sides of the skills and sort of like move that move from there if you want to build on top of it so um let's see what happens here so it's thinking unusually we're almost at five dollars and the donation let's go we're ten cents away from hitting five dollars you guys let's go guys i don't know there's something about this there's something about the chat five dollars that's honestly feels more than like five thousand dollars i don't know yeah i know i know it's like you feel like you earned it yeah well guys [Laughter] um what's happening here so then maybe if we refresh again okay let's see yeah okay all right let me just go ahead and log in right so what we're going to do now is we are basically going to so there is a nice firebase database called firestore right and what it does is it has this sort of collection document collection structure to it and what we're basically going to be doing here is essentially creating a collection of people and inside of those inside of this well so i'll show you now so what we do is we hit go ahead and create database click start in test mode make sure you click start in test mode um yep start test mode and then click next perfect and then you can choose any location here google's fast enough to sort of make it super quick and then what we can do is once it starts up we'll actually see the collection document view and what we're going to do is once that comes up we're going to create a new collection of people right so it's literally as easy as it sounds so it's a collection of people and inside of there you're going to have a bunch of documents which is going to refer to each of the individual people all right and then as we done in our code earlier we had name url name url that sort of format we're going to go ahead and do that in um inside of this new database so we have start collection let's go ahead and click that and let's type in people right so people and let's click and uh you can just click on auto id there and then so field can be a name name and let's type in um let's do should we do somebody new so we can see that it's pulling from new sure let's do yes let's do ellen yeah and then a add a field and let's do url so add field and then url uhhuh and then we're gonna do um so this one you can leave blank for now actually no no don't don't don't who do you who do you guys want to see next let's take some people from you guys your suggestions and we'll add them in here exactly yeah let us know guys so i'm gonna find an image for you and i'll drop the link inside of for elon musk right yeah got it okay so i dropped in the firebase config file boom and i got it bro we're fast i loved it yeah guys let us know who you want as the second person on our uh tin dev profile save and then what you'll see now is it created a people collection with the first documents of the first person with the name of elon musk and the url with his picture so we can actually go ahead and connect to that right so what we'll do is we'll start building it so somebody said zayn malik oh nice nice yeah okay there's george hot you got because they might like george i think if you took both of us and kind of combined us we get zayn malik yeah yeah it's so funny because we forgot that we're actually building tinder which means we're swiping on guys here right now oh yeah that's true yeah all right so um see so we have stephen hawking okay nice oh somebody said aaron burnett oh that's a little nice oh somebody said we want kazzy hey okay oh jeff bezos that'll be joe that'd be nice this is jeff bezos yeah okay awesome let's do that so we've got jeff bezos uh all right so jeff so the next one so inside of firebase yo guys we're about to break 20 000 views i'm about to lose my goddamn mind what is happening this has never happened holy crap guys we're at 19 483 views um the best way you can help besides opening it up on your phone or something uh which would be cheating so let's not do it that way but just like it if you haven't liked it already because that's gonna spread it out to more people but guys we're so close to breaking 2000 this is something we have never in our history of channel been able to do before on a live stream you guys this is awesome thank you guys thank you so much guys amazing um because you go to firebase and create another document so another document got it auto id yes your id name would be uh jeff bezos yeah and you got the links yep you'll get none shall get those yeah you should get a gnosis image at some yeah and then drop it in here but all right we got yeah yeah you should you definitely should he's also on tinder right now and trying to use it as much as he can i can't find nas dude on google you can't find nas domansky no not monkey ah come on man you gotta be able to find there's gotta be so much this guy's all over the internet look at this right here we should use this one oh my god what oh i spelt his name wrong oh damn it i'm sorry no copy image address all right we're gonna drop that in here so i'll create add document auto id uh name knob hey that dope so now we've got three people inside of our database which is enough for now right so um what we can do is let's go over to our tindercards.js right so now what we need to do is rather than um hard coding these values right so we don't want steve and mark zuckerberg to come in here we basically want to pull from the database so we're going to use something called a use effect hook right here so here what we do is we say use effect now what is use effect so very nice way of putting it use effect is simply a piece of code which runs based on a condition it's like yeah it's like a it's kind of like a jacked if statement um for react dynamically if anyone used exactly and if anyone used classbased components use effect replaces all of the lifecycle hooks like lifecycle methods that's how they were able to get over to functional components with a user effect um so here we have the user effect so we need to import that at the top before we carry on so use effect so what are we currently doing right now we're trying to connect to the database right yeah so we want those people that you added inside so yes yeah let's i'm going to show visually what we're talking about here so guys what we're going to do is all of these people so like here we got jeff bezos so we're going to have jeff bezos popping up on our app our our app is this one so we're gonna have jeff bezos popping up here pretty soon then we're gonna have uh elon musk popping up on the app pretty soon so you know be on the lookout for that yeah and we've also got a special guest after that popping up what the hell oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yo we just got another donation did we i don't know if we're gonna cross five dollars but if we cross five dollars i'm gonna lose my [ __ ] because we've never in my life i've never crossed five dollars on live stream chat nice that's insane dude yo guys we're at 19 967 views right now okay sorry let's keep going i'm killing the replay value here so now what we are going to do guys is um we are essentially going to do use effect and then we basically just want to have this so the way we use effect is we have a function so we broke five dollars by the way i'm sorry we five we got five we broke five pounds we broke five dollars we're five dollars and forty cents thank you guys appreciate it and we just broke twenty thousand views twenty thousand views so much guys five dollars this is amazing holy crap that's not the same dude we don't even get that sometimes oh my god that's insane damn it okay so use effect right so inside of the use effect guys we have an arrow function here right so inside here this is where the code runs right this is where the code runs right now underneath there we have this special sort of this is where we put something called dependencies so by leaving it blank this means it's going to run once so by leaving it blank this is going to run once so this will run once once when the component loads and never again right never again so if you have this blank this this the code inside of here will run once when the component loads the tinder cards when it loads but it will never run it again after that right which is really powerful but yeah if i was to put something like people so so just just to be very clear guys what this will do right now is like if the header loads will it run that's my question to you no no it will not run if this thing loads right there or sorry if this card loads right here will it run yes dude somebody just donated five dollars what min chan kim said make it 10 damn dude thank you yo somebody else just donated five or something what is happening oh my god that's insane thank you so much the livestream i think right here thank you guys i'm gonna i'm just i just can't take this anymore it's the early retirement right now dude what is thank you he says make it 10 yeah and then rd and danny just put five dollars yo this is so crazy this is so awesome um i mean i'm just having a lot of fun but it's just it's okay yeah dude we love this wow thank you nice so this will run now when we have uh when it when the component loads once as well as whenever people that variable people changes so it's really powerful code snippet right so what is hold on so what does that mean so if i swa what does that mean if people variable people changes if i swipe will that what does that mean that people change or does that mean well only when people get added to the database yeah so this is a very careful thing to be uh you have to be really careful here because if you had for example every time you swiped uh then it would mean that the database were or like what like say for example here i had the dependency where i said yeah so yeah exactly so here we've added people right so every time i swipe people would change if i've manipulated what the p what the list is right rani just put 1 000 that's 10 yo they're at the top right now what the hell what is happening oh my god everyone's insane today dude this is great we love you guys oh my god this is so amazing thank you guys i don't i don't know how to like really react to this this is wow oh man thank you guys says we love clever program we love you guys too yes seriously guys thank you this this means a lot really appreciate it yeah a hundred percent right so this would mean yeah whenever people changes it would refire this code off right so once when the component knows that when people change it but we don't actually want this at the moment we just want to run it once guiding the component so here what i need to do is quick question for you guys if you're watching this because i really do want you guys to engage and get value out of this how can you make this piece of code fire every time the header changes okay how could you make that fire or maybe some other variable actually header is not a variable in this case right yep so if you guys want another variable how would we do that like let's just say we had a variable called messages so you guys see how we have people let's just say we had one called message okay how would you make this fire every time message changes so think on that i'll give you five seconds five four three two one you would put message right there and it would watch out for that exactly so you would have something like this yep messages yeah like at some points i kind of want to hammer over and over again because like they're like use effect right here and use it use state are like two of the most like common and important things with react if you guys get this you get so much of how react works yeah honestly and that's no joke guys like if you know use state and use effect and you master what props are and how to use props those are literally going to be your fundamentals into building entire apps like and that's not an exaggeration like once you know those things and you know how to use that and for example what we're going to show next is how you use a use effect to put in information from the uh from firebase you can see like there's so much power in just those three things use state use effect and props so um really really amazing uh to so the next step guys the next step is we basically need to import that database that we created earlier right so what i'm going to go ahead and do is say import database from and then we say forward slash firebase so that's the firebase file that we actually created so we're going to import that database so remember the one that we created earlier guys with this one over here we have the default database here the chat revenue is at 25 oh my god guys i think what i we will actually make a shirt and then send it out as a giveaway every time i think if it gets up to 30 or 35 we're gonna just send it out as a giveaway for you guys i think we should and we should do it like based on like wherever we like today it was tinder yeah yeah yeah it could be like a tinder yeah exclusive one of one tinder yeah nice um so we have we import the database at this point right so now what we're going to do is we're going to say database dot right this is where the magic happens right so we say database dot collection right collection was uh it's referring so so if you open up firebase on the right this would be a really nice visual representation of what we're about to do here um so cause if you go to firebase on the right yep so open up firebase and now we can see that we have the uh so so go to the collection yep okay hold on let me expand it real quick yep right here add comments so you mean add document no no so you can see here guys when we what we're doing is we're going to go to database we're going to go to the people collection and then basically i want to listen to whenever anything changes inside of that collection so i want to basically go ahead and grab all of the documents and attach a listener so that if anything ever changes yep um it's going to pull in give me that new document right so if something gets added to it it's going to give me the new information if something gets deleted it's going to get information right so let me actually highlight that so people you can see it in that little uh i'm going to click here yep so right now he's selecting people by doing this so that's when he says this people collection that he's getting access to that entire um document at that entire collection of people so in this case right now it's elon musk it is jeff bezos and then it's nas exactly exactly that so we're going to go ahead and say collection people and then what we're going to say is on snapshot right so on snapshot is going to be your best friend and it's a really really powerful thing and basically what it's saying is go ahead and listen to or like take imagine like if you literally grab a camera and you take a picture of the database right so you take a picture of the database and it's going to give you back all of the documents inside of a snapshot right yeah so we now have that snapshot with all the documents inside of it what i want to do is i basically want to say snapshot dot docs so i'm basically saying with that snapshot it's like yo get me get me literally all of these in this case it's literally these three okay so right now this will get you all three of those and then you can loop through it after exactly so we're gonna say snapshot.docs.map so they say go through every single one go through every single doc and basically get me the document data and return it to me right now the document data is documented document data is this guy so if i click inside of here document data will be this it will be this object that we get back here name is jeff bezos and then the url okay so that's what it will simplify to exactly so it'll be those two things and then what we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and wrap this entire thing inside of set people and what this magic line of code does is it's basically saying right so anytime the database changes take a picture of it right so on snapchat it's always going to be listening right so take a picture of it send me the new document so so here is where the magic happens right here and these in this line so we say snapshot.docs.map it's going to go through all of the documents that came back with that new sort of snapshot and it's going to set all of that in inside of the people array so instead of pulling it now from here basically we can actually confidently go ahead and get rid of this and leave this with a blank array and now how many of you guys do you think is if this works first time i'll be super pumped i'll be happy but now if we go ahead and open up our localhost uh 3000 as in so localhost yep now if as soon as i hit save it should reframe that would actually be crazy if that works so guys now we're about to actually just connect straight up to the database like it's going to be pretty freaking gangster like we're literally just pulling all these people real time and gonna be populating our app with it so we don't know if it's gonna work right this second but let's actually try it if it works that's that's pretty freaking gangster yeah i think if it works i think it deserves the thumbs up nice so let's go ahead and get the app on the right mmhmm um yeah so as soon as i hit save so i'm going back to i should see jeff bezos or elon musk or something like that yep so it's refreshing oh somebody even better no should we send this to his mom like what is he doing on tinder nice dude then swipe through it and you can see like now they've all come through so and even the name tags you see that hold on hold on dude that is so cool so i'm just gonna put the database on the left hand side guys take a look at this right right so beautiful so here we got nas domonsky look at that he went from an array to a real human being that is cool i love that about coding he went from a url to an actual person now i'm going to swipe and we are going to get elon musk next whoo nice right here and take a look at that elon musk yep and then next up is going to be jeff bezos so let's swipe right on elon musk because we like him and now we got this guy yo he's gonna be like ranked number one on tinder exactly who else thinks he kind of looked when he was younger like who else thinks he kind of looked like kevin spacey like i i feel like he looked like do you feel that when he was younger kevin spacey who's kevin's face he rings the bell he's kind of spacey uh he used to be in house of cards and then he had that controversial stuff happen yeah yeah i can see it i can see it right yeah yeah imagine kevin spacey shaved his head off yeah yeah like but now he's more badass you know because he once you get i think billions and billions of dollars you kind of get jacked and bald and you become very badass yeah there's a good meme with it yeah um dope okay so that that works really nice guys and just to show you a little cool trick now if we actually keep that open and open up firebase on the left again so let's open up firebase on the left okay you want me to open it up and put it right here yeah yeah now if we go to jeff bezos and let's just go ahead and have the app open so you see his name field right let's try something let's type in so it's right yeah let's type in jeff bezos in there right here yeah let's just type in amazon god or something guys watch this as soon as he clicks update it will take a snapshot and it you know without refreshing without anything and it's hosted on slash kazi let's go yeah oh my god all right that is nice wow look at that hey dude wow that is so cool love it okay yeah hero blessing just said this thing is becoming interesting right yeah hooray i love that all right so there we go we have it working now um what we are going to move on to next is the so let's go have a look at look our app.js so i think the next step would be to actually go ahead and build the buttons underneath the tinder cards all right so the buttons before before you go on let's actually show what you're talking about yeah okay so when we say buttons these are the buttons we're gonna be building guys underneath the tinder cards yeah because we don't have them right now if we go to our app you can see we don't have them right now exactly cool so just to clean things up i'm going to get rid of the h1 which says tinder cards and you'll see you'll immediately start looking a bit more like a tinder app so there you go it's clean and you see that back shadow that back uh box shadow that we added really really nice yeah okay so so his now amman says say now that we've made the use effect please explain what what when a clean up process is necessary so really good question i actually do want to cover this one quickly um so you see here guys um in a use effect right so let's say for example here right what we what this is actually a really good use case of where we can actually use the cleanup method so use effect so so this this is a listener right which means that every time the database changes it's going to tell us about that change but let's say i had like people in here for example it's going to keep on attaching it attaching a listener every single time this changes which means that in the end of it you might have a hundred listeners which trust me will start to slow down your browser right so what they do is on snapshot actually returns us something called unsubscribe it returns us something called unsubscribe so you can actually do this you can say cons unsubscribe right now what you can do with a user effect is let's say before let's say so every single time so let's say people changes before it's going to reexecute this code you can make it fire off something called a clean up function and the way you do that is you return an arrow function right and anything in here so this is the cleanup right so this is what it's called a cleanup right so this is really important and basically what we can do in here is we can say unsubscribe so this basically will on it will detach the old listener before so imagine what happens right so let's go through the first time the component mounts it subscribes it starts listening to the database perfect let's say kazi swipes and he goes through and he swipes through the person right now the people changed right so the people variable update which means that right you would think it would just go ahead and attach another listener but no first we need to unsubscribe and then it will reattach another listener so that's a perfect example of when we would want to use it so in this case it's very good practice just to have it like this so very good question and um yeah so if you guys don't want your app to just break because it'll have like hundreds of listeners or thousands of listeners over time just make sure you unsubscribe your listeners after they're done listening yeah exactly the only thing that's confusing about it is that like it's kind of like you're calling the function unsubscribe but like really what it's doing is actually displaying a snapshot of every single person that's why that's where like whenever i read that unsubscribe it would throw me off because i'm like wait that's not unsubscribing that's actually showing and pulling the data from the database you know what i mean so this is going ahead and pulling the data from the database right but what actually happens is that this is a like it's a chain of it's like a promise right yeah but so it's a promise which basically gives you back this but it also like after all of that it gives you back as a function which you can store in a variable so what we are doing is we actually calling that function and that would detach the listener in the browser got it right okay yeah so that's that bit there so now what we're going to do is let's go ahead and create the uh swipe buttons i like to call them right so in apps.js what we can do is just go ahead and what we're going to do is we're going to say underneath the tinder cards let's go ahead and create something called the swipe buttons right so swipe buttons right now swipe buttons suggest so what we can do now is we can go ahead and create that file so i'm going to go ahead and create a file called swipe oops i'm going to create a file called swipe buttons.js yep now we're in here and i say rfce oops wait rfce there we go swipe buttons now here i'm going to say h12 i'm saying buttons go here oh nice yo justin what's up man he is actually a high school friend back when i was actually playing chess and he we i used to go to the chess club and he was there and he goes damn i walked into the wrong level of class where's 101 at loving this though but seriously yeah i love that actually but seriously real talk justin and everybody who's here even if it doesn't feel like 101 that's okay um it's kind of a weird way to learn like this but i actually recommend you just build these things with us by literally copying code and like kind of following along because you will learn a lot more through just a sheer pattern recognition then even just to so much theoretical way of like slowly building up to this so i we know you won't understand a lot of it but i think it'll just like start giving you a lot of that pattern recognition which over time will start to make sense exactly really good point there yeah like guys even if you're not following word for word you'll start to notice the patterns you'll start to realize the sort of okay that's how react works and this that's what react router is and then over time it just gets stronger that knowledge and it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun because you're building real things at the end of the day exactly and these all can sit on your portfolio guys and it really will help you get a job and it will help you sort of push further in your career so no loss by doing that yeah nice so now um oh nice some somebody said sonny try rafce next time for the react snippet so if i do this and i do rafce oh dope nice it gives you the cons that you've been looking for the arrow functions exactly please if you're coding with me don't do that because i like seeing function this throws all right so you've got the swipe buttons here right so now what we can do is we go here but we need to import so let's go ahead and import it so boom boom there we go important and what we can do now is we can say so you see it goes behind right so let's go ahead and make the code uh oh yeah so you can see it's actually behind us right now it says it says a b can you see it says like there's a b next in ours yeah yeah yeah i see that right there right so instead now because we've got this sort of weird dynamic sort of way of laying things out we're going to go ahead and follow that same dynamic layout when it comes to um the but the swipe button so firstly just to prepare ourselves let's go ahead and create a swipe buttons.css so here i'm going to go ahead and create a file and do swipe buttons swipe buttons dot css somebody just said tick tock clone for devs dev talk oh my god you dude this million dollar ideas today dev talk tinder instead of dev talk tick tock just got banned in india so i think we can pretty much swoop in at this point that's hilarious yeah that would be amazing to bring all the developers on tick tock yeah that'd be insane nice so we have swipe buttons.css right so we just pulled that in so now what we're going to do is we basically we need to set a class name here so class name of swipe button swipe buttons okay and then what we're going to do is so all of the icons that we see in our demo the ones that we showed you right all of them that we saw we essentially have oh i'm actually just trying out a few of the stuff that uh some shortcuts that naveen is actually suggesting and i'm like oh so he said to try sfc i think is he saying rsfc i can't find it and lmr but okay keep going my bad i'll do these fun shortcuts later nice so now guys we've got a bunch of different um icons right so i'm gonna go ahead and show you i'm gonna save you a bunch of time so i'm gonna actually go ahead and import them all in one go so the top these icons right here right these are all those icons that you saw in our demo right so at the bottom these are all the icons that you saw in our demo now these are hold on just to be clear these icons guys right there are all the ones at the bottom right here that's what he's referring to exactly yeah cool those are those ones right now what we're going to do is what i'm simply going to do is i'm just going to start popping them in right so here what i'm going to do is i'm going to say boom we get that one we're going to have the clo so we have the replay icon we have the close icon we have the star rating so that sort of that sort of star icon we're gonna have a the heart icon is is called favorite icon and then the sort of lightning icon is something called flash on icon right so if i save that now what we should see is it will go behind nars but we'll see that the icons actually pop up they're there right if you swipe away a few times you should be able to see behind it we get those icons right yeah so what we can do now is firstly we can increase the size of oh no we've actually done that already so we've we've gone ahead and gave it a font size of large right so what we can do now is we can actually go ahead and fix that styling of that the sort of where they should be so we're going to swipe buttons and here we say target that container which is carrying everything and basically go ahead and say it's a position fixed so i'm going to give it a fixed position by the way one thing i wanted to say guys is sunny when are we building we're building the youtube clone on wednesday right uh i think so yeah is it yeah wednesday con yeah so guys we're building the youtube clone this wednesday so make sure you mark that on your calendar it's going to be around 10 a.m pacific and then this thursday we're actually building the tick tock clone yeah so mark that on your calendar as well those are two things that i want to let you guys know exactly and guys there's two big builds right there so i hope you guys are excited for that uh we're definitely being challenged with those two builds so it'll be some fun right there um so nice we've got a position fixed then what we're gonna do is we're gonna say bottom and i'm gonna use something called ten view height so i want ten 10 of the screen i want to push it up by 10 of the screen right and then what we're going to say is right now they are sort of tightly chucked together right so i'm going to say display flex which means that they're basically going to still be tightly chunked together but i'm going to say justify content and i'm going to say space evenly right so space evenly so i'll do this actually i'll get rid of this first i'll do width of 100 so i'll show you guys exactly how this looks firstly so if i save this now we should now see that the um that if we open up the yes you should now see it's on the bottom right bottom left sorry yeah it's on the bottom left and that's because it's right now it's um so we've gave it a width of 100 but we've said that everything's next to each other so what we need to do now is we say display flex and then i want to say justify content and i want them to space themselves out without telling it anymore so i'm gonna say space evenly and if i do that look at that so sunny on the cheat sheet for this one i think we should do like space evenly and have this at the bottom yeah exactly you can have space between you can show like the different variants of it which would be awesome yeah that is clean okay beautiful now we have that right but what we want to essentially do is also have it so that these are all buttons right so right now they're not clickable yeah they're not clickable buttons so what we need to do now is we actually need to wrap them in something called icon buttons remember what we did earlier so i'm going to go ahead and import that so icon button and what i'm going to basically go ahead and do is go and actually do this so i'm going to say i'm going to basically say icon button and then i'm gonna go ahead and wrap that oops the icon button and i'm gonna wrap that now if i save this first one right so i'm gonna save that first one notice how the first one is slightly different to the rest of them and it's actually clickable now um so if you actually go ahead and click on the first uh bottom left ah nice so that one's actually clickable now which is nice right now so i'm going to go ahead and do the same thing for every single all of them and wrap them in this icon button got it exactly yep so i'm going to go ahead and do this i'm going to say button and then i'm basically going to do this boom and what i'm going to do is to save time here what i'm actually going to do is i'm going to copy a snippet where we've done this previously and i'm going to actually go ahead and also give them all class names which are applicable to each of them right so i'll go ahead and explain that now so i'm gonna paste so now we have the icons but each one has got an appropriate class name so we've got the swipe buttons repeat swipe buttons left for the cross right swipe button star for the middle ones white ones right for the love heart and swipe buttons with lightning for the right right so now they're all clickable buttons but obviously we want to style them more differently right so we want every single one to just have a bit more of a different style so and now what we can do is we go into swipe buttons.css and pretty much we can go ahead and give them the following so we can actually go ahead and say that so i want to target all of the swipe buttons but all of the material buttons right so if you actually inspect them and you can actually find the exact css cast to target but i want all of those to actually go ahead and have a box shadow because right now they kind of they're just kind of like hard to tell that that's a button so right now what we're going to do is we're going to say go to the swipe ones and this is the special class the material ui adds on for all of the buttons right so it adds on adds these for all the buttons what i'm going to do is i'm going to give it a background color of white and we need to give it a box shadow but after the box shadow i need to say it's important because we need to override material ui's box shadow so as soon as i click save notice the buttons on the bottom right so boom they get that nice floating effect right which immediately colors yeah if i look between these two they're looking great and that's just one of the big differences i see between the two exactly and now you can see like as soon as we do that like you actually get this really nice like it's a very sudden visual sort of cue it's like these are clickable right these are actually clickable things right so the first one we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and start the first button so the swipe buttons repeat right is the left button and for every single button i'm going to go ahead and give it up this is actually pretty awesome i've been outside i've done amazon netflix instagram covid19 tracker uh and youtube thumbnail clones hey that's amazing dude that is a solid portfolio in one week yeah and if you do guys if you guys have done that so if anyone else has done that make sure you do shoot shoot a story on instagram tag us in there and we'd love to see it because that's the easiest way for me and qazi to go and then actually go ahead and check it out so our tags are right here you just need to go shoot a video and then tag us and we can then have a chat with you guys which is always awesome to do that um so yeah we're going to add a little bit of padding around this the first button and we're going to use three view width which is basically going to say depending on how big the screen is i only use three percent of that screen the width to determine the the padding around it which is really nice it gives you a really nice uh responsive design now as soon as i hit save you notice how the first button got a bit bigger but the rest kind of squeezed up right so what i'm going to go ahead and do is firstly i'm going to change the color of that button so i want it to be an orange one because that's the one that they have in tinder and i match the colors perfectly so now you can see it's got a nice orange color to it right so it's got a nice orange and even when you click it it's got a nice little orange hue so it gets this nice sort of orange like ripple effect as opposed to what the sort of boring one that we had before now i'm going to do the same for every single one but i'm going to copy this in here same for every single one i'm going to change the colors so you can see i've copied in a snippet here so the same for all of them as soon as i hit save now watch how the app suddenly gets so colorful so as soon as i hit that boom save and set of icons right now it's looking very similar to this app and this app the only thing i stink is like the drop shadows a little harder on this one yeah to be honest the height in the second build is actually better so the height is more centered yeah so we actually went ahead and fixed that i made it less drastic because the first time we did it we made it a bit aggressive all right yeah so awesome so now we actually have the buttons complete right so the buttons are quite visual a visual cue uh we can we can if you guys enjoy that we can actually go ahead and upgrade that in the future to show you how we can code the button functionality but for this case we've just done the swiping functionality and now we're going to focus on what happens when you click the messages icon so that one right there that's the functionality we're going to be building right now guys right there boom yeah so what happens when you click the messaging icon right so what's our goal here we want it to essentially have it so that when we click that it's going to direct us to another screen and on that screen we're going to have it so that you can have that uh the list of messages right so the first way we do it is we go to app.js and here we basically have we firstly define the root okay so the first route that we're going to have is called chats okay so let's go ahead and say chats um so whenever we go to four slash chats we want to have the header and we also want to have the ch sort of rather than saying i'm a chat page um we want to say well so firstly let's actually keep it as i'm a chat page i'm going to show you now how to link that button to that page right so i'll show you how to link that button to that page so um if we go over to our header right now so we go to header.js now we have the uh icon over here so the icon is right here so jose asks can sunny can you change the color passing the prop color to the component you can i believe uh the best way to do it is by using something called a material ui theme that's the cleanest way to do it um but i think you can do that yes you can also pass it as a prop yeah got it yeah um so there's a few ways you can start with material ui um so the way that we're gonna do we're gonna connect this now is basically we're gonna wrap this in something called a link so it's a capital l link right and this link is essentially just gonna wrap so it's going to wrap the icon button so this is the button for the messaging so wrap it and this has a prop called two and all you've got to do here is basically just put in the url that you want it to go to right so as soon as i do that it's going to freak out it's going to say whoa whoa you didn't define what a link is so in this case all we need to do is go ahead and import it here so get rid of that so we say import link from react viewer dom right and save it and now we should be able to see that if once this uh loads up so you should not use link in outside of a router uh okay so this is a good point right so if you guys run into this issue it says you should not be using link outside of router so we go to app.js notice how the um the header is outside the router this has to actually be inside the router but it has to be a child because then it gets access to all the routing right so if i click save now now it shouldn't it should stop freaking out now um it should actually work quite nicely so if i go ahead and refresh there we go so now if we go ahead and click that messaging um that top right icon top right icon got it yeah the only reason it's not working is because you called it chats plural oh yeah there we go save it to regular chat and i click it now boom it goes i am the chat page perfect perfect right so that's a good catch um nice i don't know how i cut that but yeah nice so then what we want to do is we also want to have it so when you click the tinder icon it's going to take you back to the homepage right so let's just have that as well which would be kind of a neat functionality so what we're going to do then and this will show us that this will give you a demonstration as to how we can do routing so we can do link to and then we can say forward slash and then we close it i don't know why that does that um yep let me do this i'm gonna go ahead and drop the image tag inside there so boom there we go and now if we save this so if you go ahead and click on the messaging icon it will direct us to the messaging specs section and then you click on the tinder icon and brings us back to the home page nice nice right so now we have brewing we have pagerank right which is awesome all right so i guess what we could do here is we're actually going to go a step further we're going to have the uh you see where it says the profile of a person right we're actually going to go ahead and have that change to a back button arrow right so it's going to basically be like a back button right now the way we do this is we basically go ahead and we use a prop so i'm going to go ahead and go to app.js app.js and basically i'm going to move the header now so that it doesn't appear at the default here at the top i'm basically going to push it in at these two points so um just for now as a demonstration i'm going to pass it in at this point here so here and i'm going to pass it in here so it's just rendering at these two points right now there's a reason why you can also make it so that is it's clean and you can do it the other way but for now we're going to do it like this and basically i'm going to say a back button prop is going to basically so the back button here is going to take you back to forward slash right so whenever we use the back button here it's going to take you back to forward slash where's the back button what back button so this is where we're going to implement it so if you go to the messages so go to your messages and then here ah the back button i see i see when i click messages it comes up right there yeah okay we want that right whoa somebody just donated 10 euros dude whoa max hey nice thank you dude wow guys 10 euros what is happening on this stream guys this is the most donation already that we've ever gone in our entire life 25 we were up at 25 and now with 10 euros coming in hot from max zeus i think that puts us at like 37 bucks or something yeah i mean that's insane damn yo that is awesome guys by the way guys if you are watching this and you're enjoying this drop it in the comments below let's keep that energy pumping because i see that that that little trend dropping down so i feel like you know the energy just needs to be lifted up a little bit also like a video and we're almost at 25 000 views this has never happened before so my dude super super exciting oh warden says hello sonny and kazi i'm from the philippines oh no it did i oh yeah so the nightbot sometimes we have an automated bot guys sometimes it will delete your messages if you use too many capital letters so um try to stay under that yes yes please okay so now we have the header right so what we're going to do now is we go back inside of header.js all you need to do is go to the um we're actually going to pass in a prop so we passed in that previously so here's where props goes but we can use es6 to destructure props at this point and say go and get the back button right so go and get the back button um and what we can say here is we can do something very clever here now we can say we can say if so firstly we need the arrow the back arrow icon right so the back arrow icon i'm going to go ahead and import is this one right here so this is the arrow back icon and what we're going to say now is i'm going to say some jsx i'm going to say if there was a back button that we passed in as a prop then render this surrender the um the uh render this right so render the arrow back icon okay got it got it so you basically are saying so hold on hold on what are we overall trying to do like if we're on the messages then render back button otherwise just keep it the person icon so it's not if we're on the messages it's saying if you passed in a back button prop so in this case you see here we passed in a backbone prop oh when we're inside this route i see yeah yeah yeah we passed this one it doesn't have it right nice it knows so you could do this and then basically we're going to say at this point um we just want to have this one here so that's kind of cool that we're using like uh if condition to render this that's that's cool yeah exactly it's very clean way of doing it and i will just clean this up for you guys in one sec so priya will do its job now here we go so now i'm saying if there's a back button then do this so if the background prop has been passed in do this otherwise do this right now what we need to do is on the if we pass in the back button we want it to actually go back to the page that we said right we want to go back to that page so how do we actually implement that so uh reactor or dom so reactor actually gives us a very nice thing over here called use history so use history hook and what this does is it gives us the browser history so what we did we said if you say cons history equals use history for uh open parentheses close right so it gives us this it gives us the browser history right and what we can do is we can say when i mean the browser history guys i don't mean your entire browser history i mean like you're literally your session so like how if you went forward and back a couple of times that history right um so now what we can say is we say on click and then here i'm going to do an anonymous like an arrow function and then i'm going to say history dot replace so i'm saying replace all that like the history with the back button url so the back button url now this will make a lot of sense now when we actually demo it so what's freaking out here i think everything's fine um yep so now if we go it's working hey look at that clean right wow yeah so look at this guys this switches between person and then it switches between that other um the other back button so i'm gonna click click here boom right there go home nice yeah awesome so that's a really clean way of doing it guys and that's actually going to give you um a very very nice ui user all luana says i love the way you guys make your content to even allow babies to follow along that is the goal that is the goal because i go to so many live streams and i watch so much content even on react and like it doesn't make any sense to me and i'm like i'm a developer and i'm watching react js tutorial or live stream if it doesn't make sense to me there's something wrong and so i'm like yeah i want to make it as what's up oh my god all right guys good talking to you i'm closing my laptop thank you for coming here oh that would actually be bad if i did that because the whole show don't close it yeah that would actually be so awful jesus naveen just yeah guys that's 20 euro i mean what i don't even know the chat revenue is like 50 or something now guys seriously thank you this is insane your guys's love is just it's freaking awesome yeah so so cool he says this is so cool guys when i started my career this is what i was missing i'm really enjoying this thank you so much dude you're welcome wow yeah and that's naveen because yeah and he seems like he's a developer and he currently has a job but yeah naveen would love to even have you on the skype call if you ever want to jump on just uh i think it's kazee underscore one one five something like that so you can skype me uh you can hit me up skype oh that'd be cool yeah that'd be cool right so guys we showed two ways of rooting we had the link to and we also had the uh on click with the history that replaced right so um that's pretty much the two ways that you can do it so we've showed that now so let's go ahead and build the chat the chats.js right so chat.js so if we go into app.js i'm actually going to change it so now we don't it's not very cool to say i am the chat page when we're on the chat page it's sort of like it's ugly so i'm going to create something here called chats so it's just going to be a component called chats this is why i love react it's super clean it's really nice like you don't have to worry about a very high look at this guys a high view so clean like it's so clean you can see exactly what's going on there's such a high view just render the chats that's it right i love that it's just so clean like i can never get over that so i'm going to create a new file now called chats.js and what i'm going to go ahead and do is do rfc yep i'm just going to say are you going to call it chats or chat no so this one we're going to call chats um reason being is because we're going to i'm going to actually have several chat components inside of it which are going to resemble the rows got it right so if we go ahead and look at the demo you'll see um okay uh yep so let's go ahead so we've got the chats here now what we're going to do is i'm going to say so chats is not defined so we go over here and we say import uh okay so it still doesn't work it's really annoying so i'm going to import chats from chats and now here i'm going to actually start coding up what the chat is going to be so remember guys always stick to your bem conventions so here we say class name equals chats nice and then we're going to actually go ahead and while we're doing this let's go ahead and create the css file so we're going to say chats chats.css there we go and i need to create that file so chats.css boom and we should pop into that file in a sec there we go nice so we've got that there and now what we're going to do guys is we are going to create so one what i'm envisioning here is that rather than having like the same code again and again and again and again and again we kind of have something like this we have like a chat right yeah like a sort of chat um it's a selfclosing chat component but it will take something like this it'll take a name in this case we could have saved we could say like the name is like let's just say like mark for example the message could be something like yo what's up oops yo what's up the timestamp could be something like 40 seconds ago right the profile picture could be whatever it could be like you could just we could figure out what the profile picture was where it could be a url now at this point you would have a mess you'd have the name you'd have a message you'd have a timestamp and a proper picture and then this should just render out the row so if we go ahead and open up our app um because if we just go and open up our app what do you mean the the one we built already sorry yeah it goes it looks so much like the actual app but i forgot yeah we got this one so yeah what is this guy doing just busting my balls for no reason if we go to the one that we built though so the one that we yeah so the other one the one that's hosted online yeah yeah and then we go to the messages yep yep so you can see now we have four so so if we go back a level so if we have four chat components does that make sense we're passing different props in and this is just one component right yeah exactly cool so you see what we're doing here right so this is so this is going to be the this is going to be the chat component that we're building right now yes so why is it called chats that's what i'm not understanding like isn't it just one component like product and then you just keep you know like chat and then this is one and then this is two or three also called product products you could you could call it uh you could call it anything really in this case we could call it chat row maybe because this is going to be chat row and then the actual chat what i had is i had chat uh and then i actually had chat screen was for when you're on the chat screen all right okay got it this is all this is all down to preference guys like that's fine that's fine this is all good keep it keep it this is it it's all good yeah so here we could do this but basically the component that we're building chats is going to be this thing right here that's what chats is going to be exactly okay and then everywhere we call this like one word chats we'll have either ellen thing show up or sandra things show up right exactly got it yeah so now what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to go ahead and copy the snippet of code which had the which had basically all of those uh props in right so this is this we haven't created this chat component yeah we haven't created it yeah awesome naveen says definitely kazzy and sunny i'm working parttime right now and was having a parttime break yeah because i saw his message just a little bit earlier and yeah i think he's a professional developer who's working and he and he's like i took a break and i was watching the stream you guys made me happy thank you so much and then immerse frank frank just dropped 25 dude what where i don't see it whoa thank you dude it's at 86. it's like going what oh wrong maybe we just [ __ ] live stream and that's it don't even worry about anything else somebody also dropped five dollars um emerson did um it's it's just pen five i don't know what that means i don't know what currency that is pen five but thank you but he says react.js and aws amplify greetings from peru thank you thank you so much amazing jesus frank frank um hit hit us hit us up hit me up on instagram you know um that would be great i would love to have you guys even come on this and that on the show and jump in here yeah that'd be dope definitely um okay so we have the props here that's amazing thank you so much dude so we have the the four uh chat components with different props that have come up um and then we have so these this component isn't built yet right so let's go ahead and build that so let's create a chat.js so let's go ahead and do chat.js and this is going to be for each of those rows right so each of the rows that we spoke about so we're going to rfce um boom there we go chat okay and here what we can do is remember wait so there is a chat.js and then there's a chats.js yeah so chats is the one so chat is the view you're looking at ah that's what i was trying to get at so chats is what this entire box yes exactly and then to the rows got it okay okay all right but this is a component right yeah even though we're not really going to be reusing this component yeah so so this is a good example guys of even if you're not reusing something still build everything in a componentbased fashion yes yeah first lead alone for speed alone and what and it's a really good point cause he brought up guys is um literally if you have this situation yeah what what we tend to do is we actually kind of have it as chats we usually have a pay a pages folder instead and that would be called like the chat screen or chats page if that makes sense and then you would have a components folder and that would be the chat component like you can make it very you can make it very sort of clear in that sense right um but let's carry on so we've got the chain so we've got the chat.js so here now what we're going to do is that took five different props right so i took five props they took the following so we had the following props inside of there we had name message profile pic and timestamp right yeah now inside of there what we're going to do is we're basically going to have the following so we're going to say uh firstly we're going to do bem so we're going to have class name equals chat and then what i'm going to say is inside of here i want to actually have the following so i want to have the um so i'm going to have the oh by the way by the way frank frank says he's a long time native app developer but all my new work is now react and react native and he goes this and the ig clone helped me kick start my mvp for an app called million fans oh frank frank he actually sent me an email really nice yeah he sent me an email oh my god this is the same guy nice dude yeah he sent me an email and he he said this exact same thing like he's he's building he helped him build his mvp fan app called million fans and his um his instagram is actually at francisco that so you guys check him out he seems like an awesome person and he seems and he's a developer so you guys can probably connect with him and learn a bunch as well and um as he launches this app maybe we can like go in and actually give that app fivestar reviews and things like that just to support our community exactly 100 yeah vishal s just dropped another donation thank you so much dude jesus holy crap this is insane wow thank you guys thank you very much appreciate it thank you nice um awesome all right so now what we're going to do is guys uh you see on the left we have those like we have sarah ellen's andre in this hashtag they all have like a circle image right now we could do that so now that now just to be very clear chat is going to be this component right here yeah exactly okay okay got it so yeah now every time i do chat like ellen will come up okay cool got it yeah so we're gonna we really want it to be just about that sort of that circle right oh no sorry so the component right so now instead of hard coding that sort of circle and doing all the work around how do you get the radius to be a circle and stuff like that we can use material ui and material ui gives us something called an avatar right now avatar makes our life a lot easier so basically what we can do is we can import it like this so we just say import avatar from material i call avatar and then what we can do is we can actually go ahead and do the following so we can say so i'm going to go ahead and pop it in here so i'm going to say push an avatar here so an avatar the class name of chat image the alternate tag should be uh not it should be a name so basically they're very clever here so what it will do is it will take the name so let's just say it was rafae kazi and it would show an rf right if you if you don't have i see i see what you're saying so okay i'll let me draw that out so um this is pretty cool so how he's using this also it's like if you have an icon right normally it will show your face right here but if that face is not there then you might want to just have it show your initials or something so for me it might just be req so you guys have probably seen even on your imessages app on your you know iphone you'll see that p next to people's faces if you don't have their profile picture it'll actually just say something like this that's what we're trying to do right now exactly yeah exactly that that's a really good explanation here so it's like the uh the imessage stuff right um so what we're doing now is i'm actually going ahead and importing it into chat so it doesn't break so now what we can see is uh if we go ahead and check uh right now i'm actually passing in a profile picture for everyone but what i'm going to do is i'm going to deactivate that one and we should see if we open up our app now so the one that we're running locally yes give me one second i am you want me to okay i'll open that up right here yep we should be able to see so um it says name at the moment but name we do oh yeah i need to save it oops there we go let's save it so now we should see if you go to your messages nice so the chat component is actually starting to load so actually let's just compare them against each other so the component is loading yeah but the sarah one is not doing that thing we want it to do right now right yes it's strange it's not doing the thing that we exactly wanted it to do but if i would just want to test it i could just say something like let's say rafa kazi and let's just save it let's see how that handles and see what that does so interesting doesn't seem to do it so i think at this point there is a prop that i might be passing it incorrectly but we can go ahead and check that out uh a a different time but i think it might be okay that's okay let's just yeah that's all good yeah so in this case what we're gonna do is we're going to say the source is the profile picture right so if i go ahead and put that picture back we'll actually go ahead and we'll have everyone back in there so um there we go that should be yep there we go nice we've got that right now what we want to do is we want to have the uh the name and the the message that is that they sort of sent so here what we can say is i want to have it sort of containerized so i want to have three sort of children here so i want to have the um so if i create a div and i'm going to put inside this div i'm going to have a h2 and i'm going to have the name so i'm going to have like whoever it was and i'm going to have a message underneath in a p tag so here i'm going to have a p tag so if we go ahead and save this now we should see an update and we should see some stuff okay that's clean and then let's have outside of that this have a timestamp so let's go ahead and say this is where the time stamp will go okay so now we have three children we have this we have this div and then we have this as a third chart okay so now we need to get this to look exactly as we had it previous in the other section right so how do we get that to work in the way that we need it to um we can basically go ahead okay so it's looking similar so basically so far we need uh just so we can have a clear roadmap what's happening but 35 minutes ago we'll probably need to go over here kind of like how we got it there yeah um okay i'll probably the text color i feel like needs to change a little bit and become a little not as dark black right a little bit lighter yeah exactly the 35 minutes ago is even lighter it's like almost like fading yep and um and i'm just i don't know i don't do much css so i'm just like calling it out kind of visually that's literally perfect yeah and even the spacing from the sides you see it's not exactly touching the side yeah yeah yeah that yeah exactly because here it's like touching in a super tight so like the spacing needs to change the image size i feel like is the same right and then got it and then there's like bunch of space right there padding or something margin right around here yeah and uh yeah and it seems like it also doesn't run across all the way it only runs to here exactly so it's got some like padding around the entire thing yep okay so i think the guys is that clear for you what were like how we're going from here to here like i i think i kind of understand what we're up to now yeah that's awesome nice okay so now what we're going to do is before we actually go ahead and start that let's give things that we need to sort of target appropriate class names so that way we can target them so here we're going to go ahead and say this is the chat details because it will basically have the name and the message right here i want to give this one a class name so i'm going to say this is a class name of timestamp so it's going to be chat timestamp right and that is actually should be everything that we need so we have the chat image the chat details and chat time some okay nice now we're gonna do is we're gonna go over to the uh we need to create input so we're gonna we got two new donations by the way uh super chat thank you guys so much for that that's enough as one appreciate that and then uh miha space gamer actually hrk 10 which is croatian um creation money so thank you from croatia thank you amazing thank you so much now what we want to do is we have the uh oh yeah we need to create the css so chat.css here so we pull that in and then we do chat dot css so we're going to pop into that file now there we go so now we need to style it guys so we've added all the sort of class names that we wanted so here's where the magic happens so now what we're going to do is if we have it open next to it we can see like how every sort of thing is going to die is going to affect it in real time which is going to be really nice right so here i'm going to do dot chat right and i'm going to say that's sick how we're doing this right now by the way this is like every css course i wish i had literally and this is going to show you guys perfectly like as it does it and when and it's going to do hot reloading and show you everything as it does it so display flex is going to do the following so it's going to push everything next to each other right so there we go really really nice way of doing that is display flex then we say align item center right and this will actually get the this will pull everything at central along the horizontal axis so so basically the spacing thing this uh no this one will actually get the timestamp to drop in line so everything will become centered along the horizontal axis so as soon as i hit wait wait wait okay hit it now do that so if i undo that you'll see you see that it pulls everything in the row to that center so and even the image came down right got it okay yeah and then the next one we're going to do is we're going to say justify content space between so space between yeah and now if i save that oh another cheat sheet moment space between so you're getting much more so it's already starting to get quite nice here so now i'm curious how you had you kept this more towards the left side yeah so that's actually a really good point that's coming that magic's coming so what we can do is we can say padding should be 20 pixels around this is this is what this is so that happens that little space on the left side of the photo that is looking clean bro it's good right and this is super clear for everyone guys if you find this sort of demonstration useful let us know by hitting the thumbs up button because that really is like this is we can definitely do this more often because i find this is actually super useful this is actually yeah crazy i mean i'm being blown away but elizabeth in the chat is like cs is my biggest nightmare and she goes thank you for this and then she also goes any tips with grid slash flex are welcome oh yeah group i mean we should definitely do some videos on grid soon because even i'm uh i'm sort of using grid and this 20 pixel by the way guys um i'm garbage with css and front end but this 20 pixels is like 20 in every direction right it's like freaking 20 and south east west north it's like 20 width height you know all of that 20 bottom top left and right right exactly yeah exactly and then now we're going to do the height and we're going to say it's 70 pixels so i'm going to have a height of 70 pixels and that should space them out a bit more so nice we actually had somebody enroll in profit with python right now oh awesome i saw yeah my phone pained nice beautiful and what we're going to do now is we're going to add a border bottom so this one's going to be super difficult to see but they actually have it on the app right so it's a very light gray so very very subtle gray um and then you actually couldn't see that pop in too well but if i go ahead and make it red you'll be able to see it so i actually added a line there but it's actually a super subtle gray so we want to make it this like really subtle gray here can you guys tell that it's like this really light gray really hard to tell i mean what we could do is we could i'll zoom in like insane i mean yeah now this should be able to tell yeah if i do a light gray you see it's too dark right like it's just yes it doesn't look too dark yeah so that that subtle sort of gray is gonna make a difference so there we go nice so dude front end is so crazy like how it goes from like looking like crap like i kind of never want to use it to like all of a sudden all i want to do is like click on it exactly it's crazy right like yeah so now that so a good point cause he brought up earlier is that we have how do we get where it says sarah and the message where it says ellen the message or it says sandra the message how do we get that to take up the majority of the space right so i read that's like a main reason as to why we wrapped those two things inside of something called chat details so we we made we got a div and we not wrapped in chat details so what i'm going to go ahead and do is say chat details flex one and what this will tell you is that container precedences and then give that container like the most weight right so now if i do that boom whoa wait hold on undo that i want to see what i want to just see what the hell happened you can comment the whole thing if you want okay all right so so many more wait wait hold on only this thing has the details thing on it the details class or whatever the chat details that's the container exactly with chat details but but that container doesn't have no that container has all of this right no so if we look back at the chat or js so you've got a chat then you've got chat image chat details is name and message and that's okay name okay hold on before you continue so chad details is basically these two things right here exactly these two things right there right yeah exactly now guys the reason why i did that is because if i get rid of this container i'll show you what happens right then we have four children inside of the chat uh container right which means okay that look what happens now so you now get a row that is not nice yeah we don't want this uh so what we do is we we bundle that those two items into its own container and then they start they they abide by the flex rules so go back go back okay okay so i got so i got what chat details is now go back to the css or whatever yep um okay and now you did flex one so what the hell does that do so that yeah takes this thing and and what makes it as long as it needs to be you said imagine imagine what happens now is each of those so the first imagine there's three children in each row the picture that chat details and then the time stamp right so okay before you continue so this is your child one this is child two and this is three is that what you're saying yeah exactly okay yeah now what we have is um so we have one somebody just said your live stream is already number one in youtube oh crap oh are you serious holy crap we might be we might be going yeah because we're at 27 000 views so that is amazing damn it dude and over 93 dollars in chat revenue that means multiple shirts as giveaways for you guys yeah dude that's insane that is bad all right so we have the flexor so right now we have those three things right and we said space between them right so it's good okay hold on hold on hold on so this is happening because of space between so i will just do s b cool yeah yeah uhhuh right so space between yep right now if i do flex one imagine what's gonna happen is the chat details i'm applying flex one to the chat details right so what's gonna happen is it's going to push as much room as it can and take up as much room as it can so this so imagine the whole for the chat detail so so basically we're saying give higher priority to chat details which is the second child and make it take as much of the room as it can exactly so we're basically so it looks like what i circled is it looks like this but it's actually taking up all this room here so if i go this is still the second one this is one and then this is three right there right yep ah so oh that's really good yeah so this shows you after we apply flex one so before it was actually before applying flex one it was actually like this then after applying flex one it actually becomes this big thing exactly nice okay i yeah that's a really nice visual way of showing it yeah that's awesome and then like now if i go ahead and do if i uncomment here watch how it snaps and it takes up as much room as it can this is awesome i'm gonna take a screenshot of this literally let me let me undo it and then you can do it so there you go there you go you ruined my screenshot no that's right all right cool i got the screenshot i'm gonna drop it in my slack just so i have it actually i'll drop it in both of our slacks so we have it nice cool right so the next step guys is we're going to use that but then you see the spacing is kind of off right so yeah people are saying like this is wow this is amazing maurice is saying i think they're really enjoying the visuals amazing love that so now guys what we're going to do is we're going to say that the chat image should have a margin right of 20 pixels so to the right of the image push it 20 pixels so uh oh no so let me uh unsave that so keep keep the app up yeah so now if i if i save it so i'm going to put in margin right of 20 pixels and there you go wow yeah now oh prasad said that it's true your team is god's of god's hat software hey love them yeah thank you yes uh and then what we're going to say is that so now we're going to show you how you can target something um slightly different in css we're going to say inside the chat details target the first uh child which is a um what are we doing what are we doing why are we doing this hold on before we continue what's happening so so what we're doing here is you see where it says hey how are you we're trying to make it like lighter yeah we're trying to make it lighter got it okay so okay so visually what's happening is i am going i'm gonna select this guy here chat details and then within this guy i'm going to select hey how are you exactly okay so because it's a p tag got it got it so chat details get me gets me access to that higher level thing and then the greater than sign and then p basically says hey get me the p tag which is this guy here yo beautiful got it perfect all right and then if i do command s is all i mean save so boom it's so crazy it's like i get it what you're saying and so that's how i'm able to then draw out the visual but once i see the visual is actually when i really get it for the first time yeah no it's true and honestly like when you're doing these visuals i think it's benefiting so many people right now because um yeah it's it's really going to help and guys just worth noticing that that little uh crocodile sign the one next to the p tag is saying it has to be a direct child right so steve mccarthy added that a really good comment has to be a direct child which means it has to be right inside of that container the first child of that container right yep exactly right so next we're going to say the chat time stamp so you see where it says 35 minutes ago it's slightly dark right now right so i haven't saved this this line yeah so as soon as i click save the timestamp where it says 35 minutes ago is now going to become that light gray just like that one right there yeah okay yes hit it like save boom unsave and save do it a few times so unsave and save there you go nice okay beautiful perfect yeah so there we go that that's really really nice and that works pretty clean right so that's cool so now we actually uh have finished there so the one that is done yeah so i think that's done yeah awesome um we need to actually have it so that each of these are clickable right now yeah so two questions here one how do we make it clickable we use something called react where we use that same link that we used earlier second thing is where does it go to what url does it go to right so what we're going to do is we're first we're going to define what url it goes to so by the way guys just real quick if you guys are enjoying this you know let us know in the comments below let's keep the energy moving every time i see a drop i just want to come in and make sure all your guys's energy is high because that's how you're going to be able to retain all this so energy up if you need to stand up stand up you need to grab water go do that right this second come right back but guys we're almost at the finish line we're gonna you're gonna see the entire completed version right and it's gonna be very satisfying to be able to see how this entire app is built so just don't lose sight of what we're actually working on we're almost there so keep the energy there uh smash the like button so we can actually like just keep breaking this youtube algorithm where we are at 28 000 views and just drop a comment below you know and keep the energy going so thank you guys yeah exactly thank you so much guys for the support and all of the all of you guys who have been there for most of the video like appreciate you guys so much seriously so damn much thank you nice so now what we're going to do is we're going to add the third room right so this is going to be the route where when you're on that chat screen and you click one of those rows you're actually going to go into that chat right so you're going to go inside of that chat so yeah for example when you click that it's going to go inside of that chart so that's right what we need to do is i'm going to define a root so oops so what i'm going to do is make life easier i'm going to copy this route paste it and i'm going to change this one now so it will have a header inside of that but this one won't go back to the home screen it'll go back to the chat screen wait what wait wait wait okay so what's happening okay okay so just to be clear so when i'm in chat and i'm in ellen then when i hit this back button right here it shouldn't take me to the home screen right it should take me back got it so if i hit this back to chat cool exactly if i hit it back that way and then what we're going to do is the actual path right so when we're on that ln conversation that path we actually want to have a dynamic wild card here and what i mean by that is i want i want anything to be able to go in front of here and this would be a valid url right so this could say ellen this could say sandra this could say mark this could say jeff right it doesn't matter at this point but i want that to be a wild card so here what i could say is i could say person right and this little colon represents um a wild card so it's saying like any value can go here and that would be a valid url so now let's take a look at what's happening here so if i go into some person it actually says slash chat slash ellen got it exactly yeah which is really nice and it also gives like a very clean fill right so now what i can say is just to test it we can say h string say it works right so now if we go over to say forward slash chat and say forward slash um let's just do four slash sunny or something uhhuh oh nice it says it works right here at the bottom awesome right can i can i use that person variable right here uh you can um how we extract it would be easier to show inside of a in a component got it okay yeah mel mela okay man i'm gonna butcher this name but i'm gonna give it a try melilani says you guys are amazing guys you are amazing guys i probably wouldn't have started this journey without all your inspiration and no developer on youtube is putting massive content like you guys um thank you so much but really our goal right now is just to like provide as much value as humanly possible for however long we do this we've completely changed the standards for ourselves we're not even looking at what other people are doing we've changed our standards to like what if we just did it the best anybody has ever done and just provided the most amount of value in the developer world and produced the most developers on the planet i think that'd be pretty damn cool yeah hundred percent like the fact that we've already getting so many people coding like that's enough of a thank you for us like that we can see like we love that guys and we love that you guys are enjoying this and finding value in it yeah thank you awesome so now guys we have this uh chat for like person and it worked right obviously we don't want to show the chats again we want to actually show a chat screen so in this case rather than saying it works i'm going to render a chat screen here right so this is going to be the actual chat screen all right so we're going to render a chat screen so i need to actually go ahead and create that so chat screen dot js yeah yep there we go chat screen.js and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and firstly import that so go here boom let's just quickly change this to chat screen and save and then we go to chat screen and then we'll do rfce because we love that little trick and then there we go now we have the chat screen right so the chat screen is going to be the screen that you guys saw wow it looks nice yeah so it's going to be that screen that we saw earlier hey expected an error oh nice yeah so now like this is going to be the chat screen so if we do h2 say like i was about to type in error chat screen so now we should see that chat screen pops up on that page right nice which is okay and the chat screen is this screen that we're trying to build right now yeah exactly that yeah yeah so we want to get to that point and um so now what we can do is firstly let's go ahead and apply some cards we need to do the class name let's just say chat screen that's always our sort of goto habit we want to form and then the second step now is we actually need to build that chat screen so here what we've done is we actually need to basically what i'm going to do is i'm going to draft it out right so firstly i'm going to say um we're going to have some some piece of like we need to keep track of the messages that are going to come in right we need to keep track of like if it says if like if ellen sends a message or if something like that we want to see who's actually sending that message in right so at this point what we can do is we can say const and we can say messages and we can say set messages so i'm just creating music and creating a piece of state here for to keep track of the messages that are being sent back and forth and we're going to have an empty uh we're going to have an array here right now each message is going to be an object it's going to have the user's name so we can have the user's name so in this case let's say allen it's going to have the image of the user so this could be the source of the image and it's going to have a message so in this case it could say like why do we need the name of the oh so we could actually pull the name from but i'm trying to mimic what the database what you would actually be pulling in you know okay because i mean i'm just asking because we don't show name anywhere in the chat screen right oh yeah we don't actually show the name well we we do kind of because it says you matched with that ah okay got it but but but you're right actually there we can actually grab that from the not the message so yeah at this point we can get rid of this yep cool um actually no okay so uh no just leave it leave it leave because it seems like we're we are using it so that's great yeah so here we could do it we just have something like this and yeah so what's up and then we could have another message saying um let's just do this and then here it could be something like um what have we got on the other one we've got how's it going so how's it going yeah and then we've got another message so what i'm going to do is just to show a demonstration here guys this is going to be pure we're going to show you like a a sort of a mock of how you can pretty much get it to a point if you can style like the difference between a sender and a receiver so if you're the person sending it or if you're not show you the logic of how you can do that so let's imagine if it was you you're not going to have the name and image you're just going to have the message so this is going to be the messages from ellen but this is going to be the message from you right and at this point in time it's just three objects and they're just all of them resemble messages one two of them have the name and the image and one of them just doesn't have anything it just has the message itself okay so what i'm going to go ahead and do is firstly i'm just going to go ahead and actually get an image but so that way this makes a bit more sense we can go ahead and do this so that's a huge image for for ellen so we can do that okay perfect and now what we're going to do is we're going to actually start coding this so we've got the preparation done and what we're going to do is the first thing we're going to say is you matched with like let's say in this one we're going to so we're going to hard code it a little bit here just for demonstrations we're going to say let's have a p tag at the top right let's have a p tag which says you matched with ellen on some random date right so let's go ahead and say this so you matched with ellen on 10th of 00 20th or something like that right and what we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this so now if we bring up our app quasi so we show r1 right so it says use state is not defined so we actually need to go ahead and import that so use state oh god whoa what the hell just happened there there you go oh nice somebody gave us a another super chat he's a give us a video for react virtualized i need to write virtualized group gallery i've heard of react virtualized you can definitely have a look at it and if it's something that a lot of people are interested in we can definitely have a look at and build something like that yeah sure um what is that um i've used that i think it's like uh some kind of list thing so react virtualized was it react proficiently rendering large lists and tabular data i see oh retail uses it yeah oh nice oh i mean rito renders his list quite small slow yeah it's super slow yeah um nice so you match with ellen on this day okay so that's cool now what we could do is um so let's go ahead and just do okay so it says you matched event so if you go to our app quasi so if we go to ford so forward slash chat forward slash ellen by the way somebody said we should do some machine learning stuff on here we should that'd be sick but oh nice i see that you're pulling you mash with ellen yeah awesome and i'll show i'll show you how we can actually uh grab it from the um the url right so yeah we'll do that afterwards we'll just afterwards i would i will do that at the end though but we can say you match with ellen on this day and now what we're going to do is we're actually going to render out those messages we are only 1 000 away from 30 000 views no 1 000 away from 30 000 views what the hell guys text your mom like hey jump on this text your brother like literally get everybody on this let's break thirty thousand that's never happened before and just right now just smash that like button because that's just gonna keep pushing it out thank you thank you thank you thank you so much yeah amazing so now guys we're going to render out the messages right so we're going to say for every single message so map through for each message i want to oops i want to render let's go ahead and say um i want to render out a so a div because i'm just going to have a container around the message itself so i'm going to say a div with a p tag so oops my image is not working so deep with a p tag yep and then i'm going to say that's going to basically just say like uh it's going to use the message dot message so you see this one here just looping through them and then we're going to get that message and i'm going to get it and say message dot message right so now if i save this uh we're freaking out here because we've got a unclosed um unclosed here there we go so if i save that now wait hold on i wasn't talking about your code but your code is awesome too i was saying um somebody just in instant money allstar just donated uh 11 in super chat and he says y'all guys your guys and work is amazing trying to keep up lol this is why i choose the computer science career i could never be satisfied with just using web applications not knowing how it was coded that's insane thank you so much instant money all star this is why i choose because i like number seven nice yep this is why we show you guys how really all of this works behind the scenes and the logic behind it you know so then you can then build your own yeah exactly but thank you really love the support and i think we're about to break um i think we broke probably a hundred dollars on the chat so that's freaking amazing thank you guys thank you right nice did we just break the ak no 29 000 on views hundred dollars on chat revenue which has never happened before i mean both of these are just freaking crazy dude we started the chat with like we were getting super pumped about nearly five dollars and we're just about to hit 100 that's insane that is crazy thank you guys i mean like we love it anyway like we would be doing this but it's just so much more fun like i don't know like there's something about them as long as they're making us feel good is a major priority right now you guys love you guys so much thank you um aluano you're amazing yeah all right yeah this and this live stream will be here forever guys i know a lot of people keep asking that but yeah we we leave all of our streams recorded here for all of you guys yeah so we'll be here always um okay so at that point what we can do is i'm gonna go ahead and style this a little bit so it looks a little nicer than this so right now we've got three messages and it says you match with ellen so we may be getting there somewhat but it's not like i do right it's not what we want to get to and as an end result so what i'm going to do is i'm going to give the uh div i'm going to give it a class name of oh we've got some nice new donations in thank you awesome thank you uh and we've got to screen a message so we've got a chat screen message and you can see um yeah so we're gonna start that one there and we've also got the uh yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and start starting this one so what we need to do is in order to style it we need to do a little neat trick so we need to actually import a chatscreen.css file i'm going to do that and save it and then i'm going to go here and actually go to chat screen dot css and this will pop in nice and what we want to do now is actually go ahead and make it a little bit more uh nicer to look at so i'm just going to pull up some codes with a chat screen.css so here now what i'm going to do is i'm going to say that the message itself should actually have so right now we've got um this this this code up so it actually looks a bit more like how we have it so we have the avatar then we have the message and then we have that nice little bubble around it right so to get that little bubble next to it the way we do it is we basically have it so that oh the bubble when you say bubble you're talking about this bubble here yes that beautiful little looking message bubble and immediately when you see that it looks like a message right yeah so and also a little avatar with ellen on it right so we have the the message so we put we imported the avatar and then what we're going to do is we need to go ahead and um i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to basically pop this in here inside the message so next to the message itself i'm going to have the avatar and i'm going to say that the class name is chat screen image and i'm going to say the alternative thing is message.name so it's going to be lenny says i can't believe i have been here for more than three hours and i'm learning every minute amazing nice that's great so amazing love that kyle says i'm sorry sunny but they're these are too good guys guys says can't wait to enroll for the javascript course i'll dedicate my next two months and want to create my own website yeah whenever you're ready that course will really take you up to the next level uh keep watching our content here but if you want to also get coaching with us like in person on those zoom calls and things like that then yeah the link is in the description guys for the profit with javascript course so check that out too yeah definitely they'll have calls with you right sonny yeah you have calls with me uh you have calls in nars jacob like every week uh we have weekly coaching calls so you're pretty much gonna get a chance to ask whatever questions you want and to really like dial in on those pain points that you're having when it comes to your development journey yeah awesome nice so now we've actually pulled in the avatar by saying use the message image if they have it otherwise use the name so now it actually pulls in the images we've got ln popping up that's nice nice from right here exactly so you can see image that's really cool yep and then what we want to have is the actual um so right now yeah so let's go ahead and give that little that sort of bubble around it because that bubble around it gives it a nice sort of fill to it right so now let's go ahead yes the bubble so let's go ahead and say that this p tag has a class name of chat screen text right so it has chat screen text and now what i'm gonna say is uh let's go ahead and style it and i'm gonna say for chat screen oops for um chat screen underscore text so for that oops for that what i'm going to say is we wanted to have up so if because if you want to bring it up to the left i love doing css when they can see it you know that as it pops yes yes yes yes yeah so here we can say margin left right so margin left um and then we can say margin left as 10 pixels so as soon as i hit save you'll see that this is going to pop some margin left right there okay but before we actually go ahead and carry on with that what i'm actually going to do is where we've got the um chat screen itself so not the chat screen we need to actually go ahead and do um chat screen input form okay yep so what we need to go ahead and do is actually style it so that the um have i done that i forgot i've completely forgot for a sec yeah there we go yeah so now we actually got the chat screen here and what we want to do is we basically need it so that each of those things is going to be so you see where it's got ellen's picture right we want that to be next to the text not underneath there right so and so the way we do that is we actually go ahead and target chat screen message and here we go and say chat screen message and we say display flex so now if i do that boom it should go next to it nice now we know if they don't align in the on the vertical side item yeah hey i'm picking this up that's it dude there we go nice and then we have that and then we can also say let's give it a padding of 20 pixels right so that way it has some space itself and it's not like all scrumped up like that there we go we got that space that's looking great yeah there's already signs look really clean really nice um and now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and give the text a background color of gray light gray so there we go so by the way guys here is the url so you guys can play with this a little bit i'm popping this up here so you guys can pause it and go but we're not gonna be putting it in the description because youtube took down our video last time for popping it in the description yeah they didn't like that and just for disclaimer this is not the real tinder like this is clone fake this is what we built for demoing geez we're not about to get another strike on this channel yeah the youtube gods um so we added a background color and now guys this is the magic of front end right so let's let's go ahead and have both apps open side by side so that we can see as we code the css so right now look how ugly that looks right oh wow that is that is nice two lines of code so by adding a padding of 15 pixels yeah so if i add the padding of 15 pixels what and add water just with padding it already works yeah literally it's crazy and a border radius to 20 pixels and boom oh man that is crazy that i got to actually see the magic behind how to make text look good and that's so easy that is so easy and it's crazy wow like it literally just like blows your mind and like how small things can really make such a big difference like crazy damn that is nice i love that okay great and now what else is left this needs to be centered this needs to be lighter uh and the blue thing needs to be here yeah so for the user's messages comes up on the right so it's not a message like is ellen's right yep so now what we're going to do is we're going to go here we're going to give a class name to this one so i'm going to say class name class name is chat screen timestamp and i'm going to go here and i'm going to go back and say for the time stamp we're going to do text align center and that will pop it into the center i'm going to give it a padding of 20 pixels and a color of gray got it and look at this wow lovely to see beautiful literally like slowly comes together right so satisfying yeah really really nice like um so that's awesome we have that done and now what we're going to do is actually implement the logic which will show us that if it is if they if there is no name inside the message so if it's if it's one of our own messages let's actually go ahead and make it look a bit different so it pulls to the right as opposed to pulling to the left right so the way that we're going to do this and it's very sort of simple way that we're doing it and obviously in production apps like you can change this and it might be different depending on how you set your app up but in our case what we're going to do is we're going to say if if there is a name inside of the message so if it says like if it has a name key then it's a message from ellen right but if there's no name it's a message from us so imagine this was the back end this was how our database was set up that's how it would be passed through so what we would be doing is we would be saying if message dot uh user so there's a name sorry message.name so just just to like at a high level is basically like if it's not you then it's gray and if it is you then it's blue right yeah exactly cool okay so we're basically gonna check like hey if it's the user who's currently typing then blue yep okay cool exactly that so if it's your message it comes up as blue right so we're saying if when we're iterating through it if there is a name property then it's going to be the um then it will be a case of it's the um it's the user's message isn't it it's the it's ellen's message think of it right now we're just checking without we're not checking based on ids right we're just checking based on like name so if like if the name is sunny and okay then it's okay so right now we're just checking if the name is passed in so imagine we had three we had three uh messages here two of them had a name right so it was ellen because we were speaking to her but the one with us didn't have name it just had a message right so the data structure was slightly different and this could be different depending on how you set up right as in like how you set your app but we're just doing it as a demo to show you like this is one way right so now what we're doing is so you see like the one that the one that we for the message that it wasn't so for the message it was for us you see like i got rid of the avatar so it's already working our logic is sort of working here so now you can see the third message doesn't have an avatar so it falls into this code bucket here right so now what we can do is we can actually go ahead and just apply a different so instead of applying text i'm going to say apply text user for that one right so this is the normal when it's sort of ellen sends a message but when we send the message back it's text user so now you can see it's basic because it's lost that styling right yeah so for text user i'm going to apply the following so i'm going to say and we'll have this open on the side so we'll say chat screen text user so just green text user here i'm going to say i'm going to give a margin left of order so this is the magic to making it push to the right so let's have it um let's have it open yes if we do margin left auto oh wow left auto interesting whoa because margin left is saying like you determine if whenever if you ever want to push something as far as it can go the opposite direction if you want to push something right do margin f o you're going to push something left do margin right or interesting so it's pushing it by this much until it's like all the way to the right yeah now what's stopping it what's stopping it from going all the way to here like literally touching the edge what's stopping that from happening so remember how every message has a padding of 20 pixels uhhuh oh i see that's what padding is kicking in got it and it's in every direction left right bottom top got it exactly yeah so that's why it has that right so now what we're going to say is we actually want to go ahead and give it a background color of blue so this is the blue i found from the tinder's designs so we go ahead and do that and remember look it looks horrible right now right so i'm gonna go ahead and do that padding and border radius and it will suddenly look very nice and there we go and then the color of the text should be white so we could do that and there you go like there we have it so we actually have the message coming through on that side nice so it automatically starts to look really nice you know and that's from very simple rules in place right now yep um so that's that pretty much done so the messages in that case are pretty much done in terms of the design now before we do the input so the input is on the bottom so we can see the input is like the sort of bit where it says um input field it type a message etc before we get to that point um what i'm actually going to go ahead and do is if we go back now so to the chat screen it doesn't actually let us click through right so it's not actually letting us click through right so you see it's not clicking through so we need to actually quickly implement that bit so let's go ahead and do that quickly so if we go to use a chat dot js so if i go to chat.js now what i'm going to do is i'm basically going to just in order to get this working all i need to do is wrap the entire row with a link oh nice link yep right there oh that's clean yeah and i just need to import link from react router dom so if i go up here boom we do that and what i'm saying is i'm saying link it to forward slash chat forward slash name oh nice okay so it'll be ellen yeah to be ellen right so in this case it says unexpected token because i've got an error here so if we can get rid of that save it and now if we click on ellen right there yeah so you see that yeah you see it and it works right look at that can the styling looks horrible right so yeah automatically so we're going to remove the underline text decoration right exactly that exactly that so now we're saying here what we want to do is i'm just going to apply a generic one so i'm going to say for the anchor so for all of them apply a text decoration of none and what this will do is this will get rid of the underline but the blue is still there right to get rid of the blue you need to do color inherit yeah and that will fix that and now you actually have that clickable functionality oh nice so where is it inheriting the color from oh just the okay okay got it got it like the whatever it was previously nice that is a very clean hack so now it's a link but it doesn't even look like a link got it yeah awesome right that's cool and we actually have that working so that's really nice and all of the header stuff it still works which is really clean like everything still works and it's really nice right so um like you can see we have a full functioning sort of app running through it like uh the messages we have the ui done on the messages all we need to do now is actually add the input box uh we're not gonna actually implement the the sort of the pushing the messages in and stuff like that um we can uh if we get time but what we can do for now is actually go ahead and do the input which is the last part so how do you send a message to ellen right so let's go ahead and have a look so now what we're going to do is we're going to actually add that input box to the bottom of chat screen so going back to the chat screen that thing right there hold on is it actually even showing so i think you might need to resize your uh yeah because i'm showing at the bottom holy crap that is difficult to catch that so what we could i got a hack there hey there we go so you just want to pull that a little bit lower there we go so this is what we're gonna be building right now you guys that thing right over here exactly yeah so in order to get that built guys i'm gonna first have a div so i'm going to first say div and then i'm going to have a form because i want to have like a forms behavior and then i'm going to have two things i'm going to have an input field and i'm going to have a button right so i'm going to input field and i'm going to have a button and the buttons it's going to say send right so a very basic level now it looks ugly but it's right here so i can now chat with ellen hey exactly so that is we can start to get some kind of like sort of like hope to that right so we can say like now if i'm gonna add a placeholder so it says type a message so now i should say type a message in there okay so it's just a styling now which needs to be fixed right yeah so the first thing that we do in this case is we add some class names so we can reach everything in our css so the first one i'm going to do is class name and we'll say equals chat screen input next i'm going to say down here the input here should be class name oops class name chat screen input field right so i'm going to add it here input field so this could be input container this could be input however you want to name it is completely fine and also here what you could do is you could do a class name uh input button okay so now we've had some the appropriate css to reach everything in us inside of our css um so now what we're going to do is i need to go ahead and create the oh no i've got the chatscreen.css we're going to jump into chatscreen.css and we're going to go ahead and grab the appropriate styling so what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually first say that the i'm going to target that form i'm going to target that form so the form this one right here right so what we could do here is we could actually say i could actually move this so i could move this from this outer container i could actually just put it here so i can say this right i can actually maybe possibly get rid of this so we actually we just have a form instead right so now what we do is i'm going to target that so i'm going to save it and then go back and we're going to say now we're going to say go to chat screen input so that and i'm going to say display flex so it's already in a row but we want to display flex because there's a reason why we're going to display flex in a second so display flex and then what i'm going to say is padding of 5 pixels because everything's too bunched up right now we don't want it too bunched up so you can see it gives it a bit more sort of padding there um oh wait no have i done that right yeah position we want that to stick to the bottom so i'm going to say position fixed position fixed and i'm going to say bottom is zero so this will stick to the bottom guys if you do position fixed bottom right so now you see that it sticks to that bottom which is exactly what we want right and then i'm going to say a width is 100 so width is 100 and you should see okay so it width we said width 100 but it doesn't actually know like what to do just yet right and it'll make sense in a second so border top i'm going to say um where we're going border top is border top i'm going to give it a border top of one pixel solid light gray and at this point we can't actually see much oh yeah we can we can see that light gray i added there right so why did i make it display flex if i'm not using justify content if i'm not using any of that stuff the reason why is because i want to use the flex one rule that we used earlier so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to say oh yeah it's just going to expand the whole thing yep the input should take up most of the room so rather than doing any hard work here boom beautiful next one it works out everything for us right i'm also going to say that input field is too squashed right now it needs to have a bit more padding so i'm going to say 10 pixels padding all right and there we go like we already get that nice little paint and now we don't actually want to border around it so we say border none and then we do that and we can see look at that it's already getting like a super clean ui nice right and then the input button right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go in ahead and add the following so i'm going to say for the input button i'm gonna go and say i wanna no border so border none i'm gonna say a margin right of 20 pixels so it's not touching the side then i'm going to go ahead and say i want a background color of white so it blends in i want the font weight to be bold oh let's say boda so let's make it quite heavy and then i'm going to say the color and this is the tinder color so i'm going to say color should be the tinder sort of pink right so boom there you go and just like that guys we get a super beautiful looking input field right now hooking that up in a lot of the tutorials we've shown you guys how we actually hook those things up and then we sort of you can you can watch that and map that but what we could do i guess quasi is we can actually kind of hook this up and push it into the uh into the message i mean should we should we get that try and show how that how that works yeah like writing here and then sending a message yeah yeah sure yeah because i think that we could be able to we can get that in quite nicely so what is i'm going to create a cons so we need to keep track of the input and say set input say use state so this is going to keep track of what you're typing inside the input field right so this right here then what we're going to do is we're going to go down here we're going to say the input value is going to be equivalent to the input state so the one that we just created and then we're going to say on change i'm just going to say by the way um is it possible that we would be done in the next 15 minutes or no yes yeah okay okay cool all right don't mean to rush it though so that's fine so we say set input of and here we say set input e dot target dot value right so then now what happens is is every time we type in the input field it's going to update and then when we what we do is we set the button type to submit because it's inside a form but what we want to do is we do on click so when we click that button we're going to do a handle send function so we're going to trigger handle seven functions so we need to write that function up here so we say const handle sub handle send takes an event so this is an arrow function guys and you need to do this line you need to do e dot prevent default otherwise it's going to refresh when you press enter on your keyboard you don't want that right you do not want that to have so basically what we need to do at this point is it's very simple we just need to say set messages to an array of whatever was currently inside of messages as well as a new message with whatever you've typed inside of your input and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say set input and i'm basically going to block out whatever input was so i'm going to do this and now this magic code right here would actually if we've done it all correctly should allow us to so imagine what we refresh and stuff like that and then um we get to this point again so now if we type in and we say like uh nice dude try out type in whoa nice awesome right yeah that is sick how's it going guys whoa that is beautiful really cool right hold on my face is hiding it that is beautiful nice so that's clean right so that's just to show you guys like how simple is sort of like you can use that um you can use state and you can sort of implement it and like you afterwards you can reset the state by using set input to blank right so that's actually a super clean way of showing you guys and i think with that said that's actually a really nice point where we can wrap up at that at that beautiful right so like well i think we've actually covered most of the bases there and guys like if you thought that was useful please let us know in the comments now please smash the thumbs up button if you did find it useful like i mean kazi what's your thoughts on that so far like with that build man i think this was pretty freaking awesome like being able to just build this and watch it happen like live from start to finish and i don't know if there are any other ones like this online that is really really cool and it's just amazing front end we're using firebase to actually connect to the date like this is being pulled from a database so like you are learning that stuff too uh yeah front end is chris yeah so front ends crisp we use react rear i think with the last like five minutes what we can actually go ahead and do is show them how to deploy it wow yeah let's do that let's actually do that yeah so if we open up the uh terminal lenny is pumped he's like wow we have uh already and danny is 100 useful and bulim says he goes not useful he goes beyond useful hey that is amazing but guys it's not over yeah it's not over yet guys we're about to deploy this live so if you are excited to see this live and then even to go and use this let us know in the comments below exactly guys when we when we finally do this like i'm drop it live we will share the url guys pick up your phone shoot a story tag us if you enjoyed it and that would be an amazing way to like sort of end this with a bang right like it'll be like all of this hard work and everything it'll just end it with a nice crisp bang at the end of it so let's go ahead and yeah we set it up actually we did we did so we did already did that so now it's just firebase and it and all that beautiful stuff yes exactly okay so we're going to do firebase in it yup and then what we need to do is so firebase in it is your magic sort of keyword here guys you want to go down to hosting press the space bar and then enter that's it cool and then you'll get it will say use an existing project yep and then we got our tinder clone right there and then now here is the tricky part but guys make sure you say build so build just make sure you're in the right directory which i am then this one here is going to be yes yep single page application and then on the left hand side a folder just got oh please don't tell me no i did it very good yep so there's this folder called build i just got created dope exactly and now we're just gonna build and deploy yep so the magic command here is mpm run build uhhuh okay let's do that npm run build so now you guys are gonna see this build folder that we have all of that stuff is gonna go in there this is now ready to be deployed in just a little bit as soon as this command is done running exactly damn where are you guys or what yeah like let us know right now if you're pumped to see the app live so all the work that we just did right now you guys can play with that you guys can mess around with it and see what how it works and sort of uh test it on your own browsers and see if where we were lying this whole time yeah yeah yeah yeah it was just photoshopped the whole time like everything even your code just actually just photoshop yeah joystean says you guys are taking this live stream a level up uh people are like yeah this is awesome muhammad says wow
