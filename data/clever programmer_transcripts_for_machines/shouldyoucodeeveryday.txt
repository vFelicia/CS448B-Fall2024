should I code every day what kind of personality do you have if you're somebody like me who likes to just go all in like 10 15 hour days what's going to be best for you is not coding every day but rather coding and just going all in I also know people who can just jump into something and just give it brutal Focus for one hour so if you are that type of person then you should add Focus coding blocks for one hour every day and you're gonna make great progress
