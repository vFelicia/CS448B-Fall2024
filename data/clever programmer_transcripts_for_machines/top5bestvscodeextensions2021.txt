top five visual studio code extensions for you to learn in 2020 and 2021 i'm so excited for you to watch this video there's gonna be tons of tips and tricks that are gonna be extremely valuable for you with that said let's jump right into it yo what's up guys this is your boy kazzy from cleverprogrammer our number one goal here is to help you get a highpaying job as a developer with the tips and tricks that we share with you now if you want to help me and my team beat the youtube algorithm smash that like button it really helps get the video out there and so that'll be really helpful with that said let's get straight to the value now here are the top five visual studio code extensions that you need to learn number one prettier this is an absolute must when it comes to formatting your code this is the one that you see all the time us using in our coding projects where as soon as we hit command s or control s if you're on windows as soon as we hit save it formats your code it's a must if you code in javascript react.js python or really any other language so when it comes to visual studio code and new coding and you need things formatted prettier is the way to go number two bracket pair colorizer how many times are you coding in javascript or react.js and this happens to me all the time where you can't find the freaking closing parentheses or the closing bracket it's frustrating or you can't find the first opening and you can match them that happens to me all the time especially when i'm coding in javascript because i'm from python so we don't have any parentheses or semicolons or stuff like that so in the javascript world when i'm like always putting a closing paren and then a squiggly and then something else that's when i get messed up i know a lot of people do as well this is a lifesaver for you what bracket pair colorizer will do is it will find the opening one and it will give it its own color so like two pinks will close together two yellows will close together two greens will close together so you always know which one is the start which one is the end so that's what i recommend as the number two bracket pair colorizer number three live share this one is the one you see me and sunny me and nas nas and jesse all of us use when we're building these big coding projects and everybody's like what is the plugin they're using to be able to code together sunny is in uk i'm here so how are we building our projects together with no lag sun even gets access to my local host so how can you give access to your local host to everything all your ports and your terminal we use live share this is one of the best features of visual studio code and honestly this is the clearest reason why everybody should get on visual studio code and actually use it one thing that no other platform has is this live share functionality unless i'm wrong let me know in the comments below maybe i could be wrong but that's the thing that i believe for visual studio code that's the best and so live share is definitely something you want to have and when you're coding with people it lets you code together in real time you can see each other's code you can see who's typing when you can give access to your terminal you can give them read or write access you can give them read or write access to your local host i am a big believer in life sure so that's my choice for number three number four es6 snippets this is useful for you when you're writing a lot of code and you need it to expand automatically and for your code to know what the hell you're actually trying to save especially if you want to turn your code into es6 friendly code so you know those arrow functions things like that that helps you be able to actually expand and use those snippets if you want to improve your code the ease with which you write it and the ability to have nice friendly es6 shortcuts then esx snippets is for you number five debugger for chrome we all are using chrome hopefully we are don't tell me that you're a developer and using safari or anything else if you're using chrome for vs code you need to have this extension because it allows and makes your debugging a lot easier those are the five plugins that i recommend for you guys if you guys have enjoyed this video so far guys please go ahead and smash that like button if you want to see part

that it will take your career to the next level as a developer and other developers will love you because they'll be like oh my god this person knows about things like live share and finally i don't
