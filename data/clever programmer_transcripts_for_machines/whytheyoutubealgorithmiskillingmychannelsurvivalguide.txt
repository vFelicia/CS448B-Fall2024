what is up guys this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk about why the YouTube algorithm is killing my channel why it's killing most of their channels and what it actually incentivizes this is Erin Burnett guys and we're gonna be talking in this video so let's kind of jump right into it okay so let me explain it to you guys on what is happening on all of this on our channels right so take a look at this the YouTube algorithm is taking output and channel down and this is happening live we have 370 1000 subscribers let me turn the volume just a little bit lower might be too loud we have three or sending 1000 subscribers with 13 million views right so how come our average daily subscribers were 400 okay yeah every day we had about 3 to 400 subscribers yes and you lay there have three and now all of a sudden we had yesterday seven and three even though we livestream 50 and 132 and we've just been consistently going down now I get it some of you might be like hey but maybe what's happening is that you're not producing a lot of content and that's that's good but you know we've been producing con content probably the most consistently we've ever been yeah you know like video is cued up premiere and waiting to get some nails everything everything's ready to go and it's still choking up right it's still choking us and it's just taking us down and there's very little that we find that we can actually do about it and so yeah so we want to show you we're loving your support and oh by the way guys your support has really been helping us I'm gonna pull up some of the comments from yesterday so here we go okay so Joshua silver yesterday and left the comedies like lucky for you your ads have been popping up on random videos that I watched so for a lack of a better word don't worry I believe your increase is coming if it wasn't for you I wouldn't have been accepted into my local community college this week in fact I got into letter on my bed at home today so awesome Joshua that's amazing and this is the reason why we want to survive as a channel because we believe that when we have to share what the world is valuable and maybe it can help a person or yeah or 100 or 100 or more that's really our goal but like real talk guys like this says everything for us this is our livelihood this is what we do with 12 hours a day seven days a week do you take a day off rarely my family yeah I work seven days a week Frankie how about you seven seven days a week we come in seven days a week we put in 10 to 12 hours of work trying to create content trying to create something can you back locking and clocking out it's just this is just what we what we do but then when this starts happening right and you can't control it and this is a whole year right to you it might just look like one little line that doesn't mean anything but this is 2018 to current and after being as asked and asked consistent as possible and after putting in as much work as possible things going down that's a little scary right let's see what other comments we got because you guys have been really really great and supportive and I just want to thank you guys for all of that Jonathan says I think the channel was better in my opinion last year for sure that's totally true that's possible too this is happening all over YouTube patrick has gotten some conspiracy theories and goes only corporate content is getting pushed by the algorithm Michael says where's your yeah I don't know about that right I think Michael goes where is your PHP on account how can we help that would be really really awesome guys we're thinking about maybe launching the shirt or something that could do it but we have coding courses so we're trying to make do from that for now Honda says I like your earlier videos okay maybe we'll think about more focused but there's something deeper that we want to get into this video that's been expose a lot of what's going on and we want to go deeper into what is actually happening but we want to open up the discussion and invite all of you guys in like we're gonna put theories forth like we're gonna see how like some things work and some things don't but I have some videos and some channels like right debunk those theories and let yeah there's a lot like nobody understands about YouTube completely and it's just kind of weird so oh we have some really interesting stuff to show you guys I just think insights in we're just gonna keep trying Joshua flew thank you for leaving a message yesterday my man that meant a lot he's like you got a strain more thumbnails are huge and he's like also asking questions up front so he goes give away a good dude mix it up make it work then repeat Thank You Josh we appreciate him a man yeah we are we are gonna try to strain more because yeah we've discovered it growing right he's been gross he's been running like crazy and and and he streams and I see garyvee streaming and I see Grant Cardone streaming and the the biggest reason I think is that YouTube prioritizes watch time who as one of the most important things yeah watch time is just um it doesn't matter how many views you get it's more like like all like how many minutes total video because YouTube has seen that if people spend more time on its platform YouTube's revenue grows and YouTube grows itself so that's why they changed the algorithm yeah they want to be they need like to eat the girls they need to survive ya know you got to put like the right video is on for YouTube they have to let the right channels go yep videos based on watch minutes and so whichever videos being watched a lot that really really does well but the question comes you know people are like yo that's obvious that makes a lot of sense if you have great quality then you are gonna grow the fastest right if you have great quality of content and your content is like really dense and it's providing value well so we want to question that theory a little bit okay so we want to question that one just for a quick second let's take a look at a few channels here let's throw on some music let's take out a few take a look at a few channels here okay so this video by veritasium was really really informative and in this video he basically says like he says if you are you know he made this video recently about having 36 million balls in a lake as you can see over here and this video just went completely viral okay 36 million views and when he went to speak to mr. beast about it you know mr. beast right yeah the big big channel money guy right buddy yeah right so when he spoke to mr. Bies mr. beast was like yes this video is gonna do really really well and or like very something like what up to him before he posted the video yep yeah and mr. beast was like this video is gonna get 30 you know he's didn't say 36 but he's like this videos gonna be a banger yes then he went and posted it and then it ended up getting huge and you guys have probably seen it it's that one yeah that one down there right so he has a lot of theories around what is making these channels tick what is actually making these channels continuously grow but one of the things that we are finding and this has happening to his channel to his channel is actually on a downward trend a lot of big channels are on downward trend right so that's what that guy said whatever Taylor is something that one comment mr. beast game or commented on I think hey baby so with this happening you know we're we're really trying to figure out okay how do we actually turn this around how did we make it so then our channel can actually not be one of the ones that that dies and so I think what's gonna be cool is we wanted to bring you in on the discussion I wanted to share all these things with you so if we figure a way out you can watch it live if our channel dies you can also watch that happen live but see we're screwed up and see where we screwed up right so let's talk about the quality of content so some people people say man it's the quality of the content and that's what at this game so okay cool content is King content is why channels grow we have 400 videos okay but I would like to turn your attention to this new channel called Janelle Eliana okay she has 1.7 million subscribers she's going at a rate of about 300,000 subscribers a day 300,000 subscribers a day and he has three videos she's posted three videos since June she didn't have an instant had a very small following on Instagram so people are like oh maybe she used the email list she didn't have an email list people are like maybe she used Instagram she had 10,000 followers on Instagram how many of those followers would come to one of the videos maybe it's ten thousand ten thousand turned into 1.6 million yeah no I'm not gonna happen yeah so so she's getting 13 million views on the videos so clearly it's not the Instagram followers another theory might be oh maybe she's using Facebook or YouTube ads well when YouTube ads you would have to spend about 500,000 to a million dollars okay to throw away a million dollars just to grow while you live in a van I find it hard to believe that she has a million dollars to throw in ads just to get views but she didn't just get views she got a lot of engagement so we know that it's probably not yeah she pushes just as she pulled some trigger that probably she doesn't even understand to somehow catapult her this kind of right there's 64,000 comments okay I'm a bot and I endorse this video but most are real comments right rip independent content creators on YouTube that's funny she got lucky probably to some extent but I mean she got lucky but she did something we're trying to point out the fact that I'm talking to one of his comment lucky lucky me a llama lucky la llama but she obviously did something something catapulted her to that kind of growth pass everybody else like I don't has any channel girl in this fast you know what I came to be literally of its kind she's literally growing firstofitskind mean shield if she keeps growing like this with 300,000 subscribers an update like right what's her thing Janelle Eliana yeah for uploads 1.6 million views because of course videos about being in a van that subs 24 million all right this is the content by the way I'm just gonna like skip through so you can see the content this is the content yeah she's in her pajamas it's literally like a webcam okay twelve thousand subscribers a day that's not a bad number of subscribers sixteen thousand subscribers a day okay fiftythree thousand subscribers a days her average she's slowing down her channel has time not 300,000 anymore but I mean 50,000 subscribers a day think about that think about that okay and now this is not just we're we're streaming on Twitch right OneTouch cool so now we're not just like she's not the only person but living in a van who also happens to be a female there's other lots of other channels this is just one example this is somebody who's been producing content for years on her channel right consistently and a lot of her content is also solo female van life in the van and making blah blah blah but clearly didn't trigger the algorithm somehow and she's at 300 and 1000 subscribers the similar thing happened to jarvis johnson's channel right how come he had 20,000 subscribers and then the next day he woke up and he has 150,000 subscribers literally overnight so when YouTube algorithm favors you there's no rhyme or reason when it wants to you there's also no rhyme or reason they will just destroy your channel and there's almost nothing you can do about it right there I mean you can try to fight it but if the algorithm is not on your side it makes it very very tough so what we're trying to do is not whine about it we're trying to figure out strategies to actually survive it so for example one of the things that we're focusing on doing is doing a lot of live streams because live streams get a lot of good watch time and if our channel has good watch time then maybe our channel can survive okay let's take a look at this right so people message me and they're like cause II you need to make let's see what people are saying in the comments what's going on in the comments let me see I'm gonna read through Donuts fine okay poets Malloy from what I can tell your subscribers are not interested in your content I know because I haven't wanted a single piece of content from you in months along with your average news for sure that could make sense except that our videos don't even get shown to our subscribers you know yes you could be one of the you you could be one of the subscribers that doesn't watch our content but if our video is not being shown to our existing subscribers and subscribers is actually not where the growth happens subscribers has nothing to do with where the growth happens right this girl her growing and getting 1 million 1.6 million views has nothing to do with the existing subscribers most channels that you know don't grow because of their existing subscribers if they grow because their videos are being shown to new people yeah that's how you get more subscribers yep if I show the people that are not your subscribers exactly ok so that's one of the things so I didn't understand that average amount of views for your videos are extremely low yep the average amount of views for the videos are low because they're not being shown in the suggested videos suggested videos you know how like if you go to watch a video of somebody right you're watching like a coding tutorial let's say then on the side of the screen it has the suggestions that's where the channels grow from another place channel to grow or home and recommended things the home page if it's not showing there then you're not gonna grow nobody's gonna see the videos that's why lower views on videos the only reason that video we did yesterday on YouTube is killing my channel got 6000 views in one day it was because it started being recommended on people's home page that's the only reason and that's pretty ironic because people love to instead of ways okay maybe she's not a person think about it boy she was doing something that people wish they could do there her niche for sure totally there is a niche but again there were a lot of other people who are doing the same thing and we're women so how come it went so viral for for her right Hritik says I'm a JavaScript developer because Clara programmer I tried Python I loved it I've shared this channel with my friends that's awesome right they thank you for doing that really appreciate it so let's go deeper right people are like hey cause you if you made coding tutorials you would do really well except we made an entire series on coding tutorials this year 30 days of coding tutorials and it performed horribly right barely any of the videos even got more than 1,000 views and there were great quality tutorials I mean great indepth tutorials right here is another channel that's doing really well programming with mosh and here's what I want to point out right this video it's a good video but I want you to just see for yourself how much depth there is to this video okay so it's like you're gonna learn all a JavaScript or you're gonna learn JavaScript in one video and if you scroll through this video right and you go through it and you get to the end the most that you actually get to is a pretty much like console dot log statements you're literally pointing things you're not making a button in JavaScript you're not making a project in JavaScript you are literally just learning the syntax of how to call oh my god of the screen yes 1 million views YouTube is like one really some read this thing oh he has more than us okay well well he grew because he was small Channel but his things grew and he did something really smart so he made coding tutorials that were like 1 or 3 hours long or 4 hours long and he just put them together there oh decent tutorials ok there they're not very different from a lot of the tutorials that are out there he put them together to make one three to four hour video then it's learn Python in one video type of thing okay learn JavaScript in one video and then that video just hat ends up getting what no no I'm just putting there guys I acknowledge again cuz he is it right and then that video what ends up happening is that it just gets really high watch time so when a video gets really high watch time YouTube then puts it out in front of other people so that's smart that he took one thing but what happens in the process is it's picking randomly what chance to make grow and which house to not man grow right so I'm gonna so random um who knows yeah so now I'm gonna do for example right I will go to let's go to creator studio and let's see if we can go to I want to go to our livestream that we did just recently we did a long live stream that was very technical it we would create a full application right so for example take a look at this live stream so I'm just gonna kind of skim through this okay and you can kind of decide for yourself if there is value in this or if there's not it's possible this could have zero value to anybody okay testing to see if this works then we keep coating we do a little bit of a Django we start adding in we do some flexbox stuff we start actually building our patient that looks like this is supposed to be like a Craigslist clone and then we end up hosting this thing on Heroku at the end and this can this thing can do a lot of things right you can search up anything you want it connects with Craigslist so it's a threehour thing so we are going pretty indepth technically with our content yeah like biting an entire project but if it doesn't get put out in front of people then there's nothing there's nothing that you can do okay because it just won't get shown so I would like to argue that this has way more value than a video that talks about printing console the log statements with hello world definitely but so what gives that that's the question and like there's there's there's countless Kodi videos that are like like on point they're just like by random people that have so much value in them that are probably way better than this and those don't blow up so I don't really understand yeah now come says but your ads help grow your channel not true ads don't actually help grow your channel they're really big it's negligible right a little bit but it's negligible it's it's almost nothing like seriously it's almost nothing it's very very very tiny like most people don't know because most people don't run ads but if you actually run ads it's like so a tiny that it's very negligible like you said it's almost as if YouTube incentivizes channels with easy dumb easy dumb down clickbait when it when hat when has it ever incentive that people who want to teach and learn right so that's kind of the thing that we're sensing here so what's happening is before if you subscribe to the channel YouTube would be like okay I'm gonna put this video out in front of you now what YouTube is doing is each video just stands by itself so you could have subscribed to a channel but it might not put their video in front of you right no it's only putting videos that are like since you know so other something that's really important on YouTube that to win you have to know this is how the CTR is actually one of the most important things so the click through rate CTR clickthrough rate that's the amount of people that click on your video if it's if they have the option to like if this if the video is on the screen at some point even if you're just like scrolling through really fast whoever clicks on an actually quits into the video and the percentage of people that do that that's the CTR yep so yeah so people seeing your video and clicking on it that's just clickthrough rate right and it's determined by two things one your title and two trying to block your face as much as possible I'm just kidding and two is determined by your thumbnail okay so if your thumbnail and your title aren't something that people want to click on then your clickthrough rate will be really low so what happens in that case the only videos that start to do well in such a sense in that or videos that are very sensational right because it's like a newspaper and now everybody's competing for the most sensationalist headline because now my YouTube video is competing with like all these other videos that you're watching right there it's competing with like if you're watching hiphop content I'm competing with that and because you subscribe to my channel and my stuff isn't coming straight to you you'll never think about watching it right because most people will just watch stuff that's in their home or their recommended that's how Frankie you were saying you want YouTube like that too right that's like that so if you're not being shown based on your so your title and thumbnail have to be super catchy and then on top of that your content obviously has to have a high watch time which is why their channels like free code camp has learned this trick right so I want to point this out so if you go to youtube and you go to these channels right they're smart like in really pattern you know what's going on right which channels are doing well it's not a lot of times because that's the best content but free code camp literally has my tutorial on here Django Python so they have my tutorial on here right and they have all these other tutorials and even with my tutorials what they did that was smart was they took my tutorial and they just turned it into one video right they just connected all of the pieces and they turn it into one video and they have 120,000 views yep and so what that did is that it got them really high watch time on that video when that video gets really high watch time it grows this is why now it's stupid to have playlists on YouTube and people are just putting everything in one video if somebody actually wants to help us out and this would be really appreciated if you like somebody can take our Python course on YouTube like the whole playlist yeah put it as one and then we can post a hunt YouTube you know and then we're gonna be like yes we're back so we're the answer we're gonna be focusing on that so then our watch time on each video can grow because now it doesn't matter if the overall watch time of your channel is increasing okay let's see what's at what people saying I watch most of the time it's very like about seven houses as don't get you anything for the YouTube algorithm yep John that is pretty true subscribers don't either the amount of people that hit the belt does a lot more yep yep a lot of good words well wash that's clean yeah your channel yeah I've taken washes courses and for sure they're great try to improve your presentation if you want more views yours isn't bad but can be improved for sure so we're thinking about making lots of crash course content soon and just make like bunch of really highquality crash courses I think that will be one thing that can help to channel more so what crash course would you want to see in and drop it in the drop in the chat and we can try to make crash courses around that your channel shows up but I haven't been watching they can do that yep oh and this I just want to point out for fun that Python interest has dominated the JavaScript interest so I just want to shove it in everyone's face python is king this is we're talking about 2004 to 2019 look at this Python is like a snake that just ate JavaScript this makes me feel so happy I started my channel right around 2016 right around here and then it grew and it's still growing coincidence all right think not okay let's see what else we got so this is what I was talking about right the clickthrough rate so our thumbnails haven't been clicked beta enough that's what we've discovered so going forward you are going to start seeing some of the most click baby thumbnails now it's gonna be big we're gonna be putting some meals that just get the most clicks so we're gonna be trying to like gear towards that we don't want to keep like I don't want to keep creating top 3 programming languages to learn in 2019 or what programming language to learn first but YouTube incentivize us that YouTube that's how we grow and survive as a channel this year we actually made the least amount of click baby titles this year we had the least amount of growth so if we focus more on that then we would grow so again with the clickthrough rate ok 3 percent clickthrough rate that's not that great right and so 56 million impressions right if out of 56 million impressions you have 3 percent clickthrough rate well these are the views you're getting 1.7 million if this was 6% we would have about three point something million right if this was 9 percent clickthrough rate or 10 percent clickthrough rate well we'll be seeing over 5.6 million views which is 5 or 6 times where we're at right now is this total for the channel 1.7 million this is this is for 2019 got it January 1st right this is for 2019 yep hunker is like because you create boring videos I'm sorry about that we do that nothing we can do about that trying our best year yeah found you guys okay people are saying me okay so they're saying a Django rest API crash course yeah Django rest Django rest framework I think we can make that yeah we can make one Frankie can you actually write these ideas down or you or somebody just write this down somewhere because I think these are great ideas slate 34 says Django rest API crash course so yeah I think even api's could be pretty good lucky says fine you guys because Python Django crash course can you learn Python before HTML CSS and JavaScript yes you can Hritik says ecommerce Django crash course yeah that could be good too Jose says that predict you will be fine just keep grinding I really don't think you have anything to worry about in the long run possibly series for kids like teach your kid to program to incentivize adults to learn code to teach kids what if you creators have made it so that could be great then the problem is that we are trying to help professionals actually get job promotions and things of that nature you know so we would want to help kids that we're really geared towards like we the adults I mean yeah there's this guy who plays with little kids in parks like his channel is huge you know we're like toy channels or not I hate that guy's creepy which guys that the old dude I forget his name but I he literally just goes to like parks and plays with kids I guess I'm like what the hell I'm like parents hide your kids from him what are you probably he's looking like a little you know like those if you go to McDonald's or something and then they have like with playgrounds yeah he'll like jump in there and he's he's like a 30something your old creepylooking dude and it was like playing a like 70 go I don't wait it makes it even weirder right if he's 30 because if you're 70 you can get away with it yeah you're too old no jazz crash course yeah we can do something on JavaScript as well yeah I think so yeah lucky I think that's pretty yeah Eva Barra Carta I think we can try it some content with JavaScript and see how that does and kind of really like go hard at it and just make like an unbelievable learn JavaScript video could we title it learn JavaScript 2020 like pi JavaScript crash course for beginners or JavaScript tutorial for beginners and then like 2020 and like release it next week because that'll do probably well this year and then I'll also do well next year going right now give you like the biggest JavaScript is in one hour learn javascript in two hours and this make it really good like an unbelievably good older wooden performance good is programming with moscow like his crossover a man I I always wonder bro see you pedo I don't know I think the premiere thing he doesn't work cause I've noticed when running videos never shows up and recommended list but if a channel upload something directly then it shows up right away mmm interesting mmm that says my big struggles with classes and inheritance how can I fix this we just released our course Python LP and then enrollment for that just closed but if you DM me on instagram at her cause ICI le ve R Q a Zi you know maybe there's something we can do for you maybe you didn't know about the promotion that we were doing so just DM me there okay and then we can talk from there okay so that's what's happening right let's go forward to to what is so again so let me go here right so we're for the JavaScript crash course JavaScript crash course is gonna be good that's awesome if you definitely do that yeah yeah okay and then um with with our thumbnails we're trying to we're trying to test a lot of things that people would want to click on or how they're performing and kind of we're gonna be going from there so we're trying to create content that is deep that's really helpful for people but then also we got to find the balance of what actually gets the channel to grow so the channel can actually survive you know that's our main goal we just spent we just spent a lot of time and effort for it to just go down and not survive okay let's see if there's anything else we had for you guys yep so those were the main things that I really wanted to hit home on so what are the strategies if we have to kind of break it down to be able to survive the YouTube algorithm I think that and what are we gonna be working on at clever programmers so you can kind of be in on on the end okay more comments are coming in I want to engage with everyone here maash collaboration that could be pretty smart like maybe we could do like a crash course twenty20 like with Marsh that could be cool how this is continuing your passion about try to be as genuine and liked it as possible for sure yeah we'll keep going for that we I mean we have been super passionate and we try to be genuine and never lie or anything and yeah so we'll keep going with that because this year we have been the most consistent actually of almost all of the years of doing YouTube titles like build an app in three hours using JavaScript are the type of tiles I get clicks that's actually pretty good Venkat that's smart yeah if you see a video with that title in the next few weeks well conventional youtubers get hammered yep that makes sense Jango or machine learning first more live streams collaboration with Joshua fluke yeah that'd be great too yeah we're thinking to even do live streams like learning JavaScript right because I haven't refreshed my JavaScript in a while and so I think me learning like would it actually be helpful let me know right so I don't know if you know but like have you seen if you have ever seen my coding content or recording tutorials but let me know what you think of this I'm thinking while I'm refreshed before I make my JavaScript crash course or a Python Django crash course to go through like let's say JavaScript learning and to actually livestream me learning and you and I can learn together I can livestream it so everybody could watch you guys could be on the end I'm thinking that that would actually help you learn it really well cuz you're learning with us and after that live stream is over we can actually create a fullon package just boom boom you know crash course and then release it out onto the world like a masterpiece yeah machine learning is a great loss collab right hue series on machine learning he's always doing a huge series on machine learning his channel is a series of machine learning isn't it it's great who's right for machine learning yellow Suraj Suraj from hall how about interviewing somebody live yeah that is sexually good we've thought about that right Frankie yeah you've actually done that I've interviewed a lot of people like on a live stream that's what they mean I see right all right okay how much frontend JavaScript should I know is backend developer oh that's very interesting I mean if you're a purely backend developer you probably don't have to know yeah I mean a little bit here and there but overall and it says Kazi you have come across a boot camp and udemy for coastal for just it's a full package very organized hmm Patrick says you're making too much stuff and people don't have time to watch it all they're oversaturated that's the interesting point it's an interesting point but I mean Joshua fluke has been growing he posts two videos a day I mean Gary Vee has been growing a lot of people have been growing by just consistently actually grinding it out and I I do think that these platforms are now incentivizing that behavior for creators like to really be like live I think is great and then to produce content that just gets a really high watch time okay any plans on courses for data science no no plans on data science I've seen that YouTube search algorithm doesn't promote programming videos when I searched live programming videos I see like ten results that's it yeah maybe yeah exactly so maybe I'll push it out maybe not we'll see but the only thing we can do is just keep going honestly and be consistent so this week's plan this week's plan is for us to go alive everyday and then this is day two and then if you guys have questions for us we want to take your questions and answer all of those questions as well so we want to be live we want to provide you as much value as possible as possible and I think that will be a lot of fun this never this never gets old this never gets old and I like it so much live stream learning in the live stream hackathon Travis garnet that's actually pretty smart I can live stream the learning part of it and then then maybe a hackathon like creating a project with JavaScript HTML CSS JavaScript I can live stream that too we can actually do like full day live streams that could be fun like a 12 hour long livestream we're creating a JavaScript application or a Python Django application that could be that could be a lot of fun Joshua Luke posting at a at a primetime at night when everybody's watching honey llama luckily llama oh the Tony just dropped a bomb it's called YouTube for a reason he was not there he goes that's called YouTube for a reason if jus is not there in the tube then dude this car drops bombs right he caught us off guard he's the most genius out of the entire group yeah we love Tony Tony this yeah seriously that is powerful that is powerful yeah so I guess we have to be there physically literally physically on the daily we haven't created three videos a week but YouTube is like you guys three videos a day yeah but we in turn the last room two videos so I'm thinking live every day and then I'm thinking one video a week that's like a bomb value like H CSS crash course the ultimate CSS crash course the mother of mothers the ultimate flexbox crash course you know things like that Bruna says you need to update your profitable programmer course I'm having some issues with it yep perfect we're gonna update it are you having issues in module four module three and module four I believe right visa black sees nothing reply flick at 30 second nonsense channel says first time here a great combination of Asian creation I guess somebody somebody noticed I was Asian what's up Zaki Talib how's it going my man PI qt5 that could be fun to to make videos on hi cutie fivecard cutie that's the GUI right the cutie cutie GUI framework but in Python or something yep I've never used it meruna says why's your followers or droppings tricycle yeah that's a lot of SS does he have ass at the end of every word what do you say no when you scroll here I think it spills on here that's more my life no what are you talking about it was it's it's scrolling because when people send a message it automatically goes up that's react for you son I don't like react is dirty cool a beginner with Python how should I advise okay Bruno yeah yeah we're gonna work on module four and I'm dating it for you okay yeah if you're having an issue on source layer with the 502 gateway back gateway error you can make sure the jingle server is running before you click the view public URL preview page make sure it's running there's little play button because if it's not running then the URL can't access to your code because the server's not running so if your got issue we resolved that and make sure it's running before you view it and then there's another air table issue that we're currently working on right now me and Kazi and another one of our developers is working on in we're gonna try to update the course with some like screenshots or something but we're getting that is ASAP just be patient if you can you can move on to further further modules because the course is modular right yeah we can move on to module 5 or module 6 and learning JavaScript and HTML and all that step and then come back yeah we're gonna be updating module 4 yep that's definitely right you can definitely go to module 5 in module 6 because every module is kind of selfcontained we have the ultimate JavaScript crash course in a profitable programmer module we have like literally if we release that crash course for free on YouTube that would grow to millions millions maybe we should do that one day but right now it's in our paid program so we won't cool let's see livestream is a good Zacky says for sure that's awesome thanks bro I'll begin with Python how should I advise give it a better approach as far as coding okay build projects passion projects even if you suck and even of those projects but things you built that are not based on you know you're just doing somebody's home you're doing homework assignment or you're just doing like a coding tutorial what I recommend is find a coding tutorial that helps you host the app online follow it like to the dot then once that app is online then start tweaking it and changing it to make it into something of your own so for example what I did is I remember I followed coding for entrepreneurs channel I built up a Python Django tutorial app and then I changed the I built a blog post app with Python and Django and then I changed the code to turn it into a youtube app like basically all I did was like instead of the word each thinks that blog post instead of that it just showed like a YouTube video so I turn it into like a YouTube video cool right so do that into something that you're passionate about or you enjoy and you're gonna become a lot better really fast Ronald Ronald says what you guys up to height Ron says you talk too much I'm sorry I mean what else are we gonna do nobody's talking back to us too much stop talking I hope they do no no it is it is at five it goes really wanted okay okay cool breaks over back yeah back to talking what are your plugs you can just keep watching that like little segments over and over again hiya bro your stream is lagging sorry we'll try to improve it how much do I pay you to mentor me so you can come to live to LA if you want in person and the deal that we're doing right now it's kind of pretty unofficial and it's what we're doing is threeday inperson boot camp for about two thousand dollars so you can come right here in this apartment you won't live in this apartment but like you will be doing about eight hours or ten hours of just full focus intensives for three to five days straight that will be for about two grand and then if you're looking for other type of mentorship we do have mentorship programs but those are like those are like four months long programs so if you're interested like DM me on instagram at clever cause II see le ve rqa SDI but I am super interested in like hosting live coding programs with you guys why do people make courses on Apple and everybody got Windows I hate Windows I don't think developers should have Windows I genuinely don't think that this should or they should learn how to use vagrant because Windows command lines it's just really bad and so I won't really got better easily did they release something I disavow it still knows no it's always terrible yeah you don't to use Mac use Linux bring ease Linux bro how can I get good at Python programming create projects lots of projects I'll help you Zacky Apple is popular for business for sure I love the look of Aaron thanks Urban says you could give just the first half of the or quarter of the course free on YouTube to up ratings with a javascript course yeah that could make sense yeah where we can we can make definitely make a brand new javascript crash course I think that would do really well your average programmer says how long did it take for you to get your YouTube channel to this point three years three years absolutely yeah it's about like exact crash course on web RTC what is web RTC lucky says that's fine I don't know what that is I forget lucky llama says this dream popped up on my phone randomly and I'm glad as a viewer we could have a convo keep it up y'all I'll be tuned in that's awesome yeah thank you actually this is yeah I think this is what I like about live streams you and I can actually have a conversation so if you drop a message we're reading it and we're responding right back at you so even if you're on this live stream they're like really like are they actually gonna respond we actually are if you drop a message or a question will respond to it oh Jesus loved the music okay I'm bringing it back there we go I love you outro song oh you guys like my outro song let's play that right now man that thing needs to that song mystical viral baby maybe we need to make music videos about Python and rap about dictionaries in Python ok love the look of Aaron I hate windows thank you Jeep for hating windows that's that's one hate that I would love to like combine like unite with people on I finished my Python internship it was great I just want to know how should I make my own program should I just follow step by step direction following some YouTube videos yeah identical you can literally watch or go watch my last live streams live stream or my secondtolast live stream we rebuilt a Python Craigslist clone and in that we built this incredible app in three hours the source code is in the description the link to the working application is actually in the description go and use that you that tutorial to build something for yourself you're gonna be very happy any advice for a 16 year old to do freelancing it's simple just get your skills good and then start applying like a maniac on up work and before you do that apply to teach coding and earn your income from there you'll be able to make good amount of income from teaching coding Zaki says you should do another stream where you're doing live coding for sure that's the that's another morning we should do that on a consistent basis I think that's really really good yeah we might do up yeah we might pick on the fly all that might do something like that tomorrow I think that could be good let's do it cool for freelancing which is better frontend or backend or full stack full start because that's both volsang is pretty good you know for because if you're a freelancing they want you to be a jackofalltrades and so a full stack it's pretty good for that be able to translate an idea or goal they have and just get it done so knowing more is good nirvan says how about converting some courses of yours to memberships for recurring income that's pretty smart but we have stayed away from the membership model and the reason is that when you do a membership right for example the same course you would charge $200 for from a membership you're gonna charge $10 a month well you're assuming somebody's gonna stay with you for 20 months for you to get the same amount of money back almost two years two years and if you're a small business like we are you can't wait to get your cash two years from this day you actually need that influx of cash today like as in yesterday and that's what actually helps you survive and keep going right because you know Netflix is not a business as profitable I don't know if you know that I didn't know that Netflix is not profitable at all the business knowledge right Netflix is there's no profitability in that business because they want to grow maximally so they keep the subscription model that's super low so they can just keep breaking even over and over again with each customer to get each new customer that break even with each customer and then they just keep going so then they just rent and repeating and growing and then at some point it can pay off once they have a following Bexley if they ever wanted to pay off you know but right now they're just focused on growing aggressively very aggressively so that's the problem with the recurring system that it it um you don't get your cash upfront you just have to wait too long and that is it ends up not being really great for a small business jeet says I love this one too coding Hall daemon yeah dual arm says these streams are just as good as the hyper produced and edited cast episode keep this format up this first produce Oh our first year awesome okay that's smart yes right here these streams yeah that's actually really smart maybe we should just focus on doing these types of streams you know basically cuz podcast it's just a live podcast yeah that's true and everything just check it out you will love it I've created a video called web app awesome I prefer your other tunes yeah this is one of the ones that are really very respectful opinion this yeah I prefer your other tunes yeah I'll prefer your other tunes I like it slid 34 dannika says yes you should what are you replying to tena koe yes you should what soy Sasha says sounds like a terribly good idea rap about Python dictionaries I think the only time I use braces that's it yeah dictionaries that's right yeah my teeth too up but my Python is clean I don't even need Listerine denna cuz it looks pretty good right I clean Listerine and I'm saying mr. bean we're like stop talking to me like that Kazi you're mean no I was singing the song I was doing lyrics let's remain mean oh yeah we gotta do okay we also have a segment on Python news which is gonna be awesome but look creating Python Tina's we're gonna talk about breaking news this week in Python news I think that's gonna be fun we're gonna be doing that blonde says on the full stack developer how to get the first freelance project an upward one you've come to the right place we have a course called AWP you should definitely look into that because that of course is strictly about getting projects up and running and then applying on a upward and landing them yes you can the type of projects that are on of work actually doing them literally taking a project from up work bringing it down and then completing them right completing it and then showing you how to send in proposals and whatnot and actually be an upward developer or freelancer freelance developer yep so that is one way and if you want to figure it out on your own which you totally can just apply to up work a lot ok the simple advice that I will give is apply to upward and as many jobs as possible with a personalized oneminute video message for each never do spam messages hold on to that whoa wait I forgot to zoom out there oops Netflix is troubling dead what are you an advocate of Jack of office or master of one I am advocate of jack of all trades or a god at one or how about both be low and know a little bit about everything and know everything about one thing I think be dangerous in a lot of things rather than be God and one thing because here's how it works okay so let's talk about like your value in the world let's say you're a I'm just talking about like just the world in general right let's say you are a Python let's say you are like a really crappy developer so you're like here if you become a little bit of a better developer you go here now you're making like $15 an hour then let's say you go a little bit higher up you clean up you're like Django rest framework skills and your API skills and your frontend skills now you're like making $30 an hour now you you become even a better developer you're making $15 an hour now you have like five years experience and maybe you can get to $60 an hour $75 an hour now when you become a really highlevel consultant you're gonna get capped at a certain point right and we're talking about like now you have five six years of experience but if you are a developer and you're dating you're dangerous enough so you're not super high level but you're like right here you're dangerous enough you know though you can do you can make full stack apps okay then you actually know how leads work in a business you know how to grow a business and you know like what return on investment is and you understand like how do you actually make profit and how to sell things well if you understand business skills now you are here the same place as a guy who is making who you know has like five years and experience as a developer with those two skills do you being dangerous enough in you are now somebody who can charge $75 an hour if you on top of that learn the skill of let's say copywriting a developer that can do copywriting and understands business now you can charge $150 an hour or $200 an hour so I like to think that either you can be an expert and go from here to here or you can be good good good good good good and like five different things and add up to that okay so I like to say be dangerous enough in multiple things and that's what makes you a killer that's what makes you a replaceable completely replaceable or be a god at one thing yeah but then it's risky choice yeah you're not diversified yeah you need to be like Einstein or Steve Jobs or you on the bus kinda but even then there are gonna be a world leader like Elon Musk is good at everything he can come in engineer he'll come into the room of the engineer solve the problem they couldn't solve then he'll go and like speak on stage speak on stage then he'll go into the room of CEOs and solve a business problem that they couldn't solve right then he's an incredible visionary he's good at multiple things we're running a business we're good at multiple things I like Frankie who's sitting behind he knows how livestreams work he knows how content creation works he can edit a video so like for example if he was just a video editor he would just max out right that's just one skill set but he's a good video editor he's dangerous enough he can create content for Instagram that he's dangerous enough in like a second thing right so now I'll say like he's put up here he also can do Android development now he's up here a developer that can create video content in today's is a killer because you can have your own channel and teach these concepts to other people in growth simple programmer Brad Hussey Rob Percival programming with mosh clever programmer Joshua fluke Derek bonus Sir Roger of all all of them are developers who can do video right so now Frankie is like up here do you see what I'm saying like with all of these things you keep getting added up and you stack up very very high so that's why specialising in one thing leaves you very vulnerable in a vulnerable situation I like to say be dangerous and many many many many many different things okay Danny come on you guys are like my digital mentors that's awesome my man's dream more says tips to be a fullstack dev I'm a beginner knows Python basics and bit advanced tips take our profitable programmer course that's paid tips free tips are here build applications that you actually enjoy follow tutorials like coding for entrepreneurs or mine to tour like go watch my video go watch my three hour life thing that we did building a full application with Python and Django stuck on whole stack right go watch that it's free it's on YouTube yeah and then join the course right after that because we need to survive josh says yes cause he packed on his phone but javascript is strong at shirt javascript is super super popular Aaron says first project to do first time nice one bro what's your favorite programmer what's his name the one who said yes he said somebody should be retro actively aborted some engineer made a bug and then he told that engineer that engineer should be retroactive should have been retro actively aborted at birth we have one viewer and twitch is that you Frankie damn it got me really excited doubt it was Linus porn vaults linus torvalds he developed linux he's probably one of my most favorite developers only because he's like a crazy big and it's just kind of funny because he's like Conor McGregor of coding it talks a lot of he's really good you know I plus I got to watch like videos on him and like a documentary of him I'm sure there other developers I just don't follow a lot of developers you know I just don't listen to them or read their stories Torvalds was one of the only ones that I found and I was like oh this is actually really funny I'm blocked blocked at Java through what if you did a podcast or invite coders or addressed open problems interacting with us is awesome showing how close you and team are involved everyone that supports you loved it orbán that would be awesome I totally love to do that with you guys where you guys can actually come on the channel and talk about what you're building and what kind of problems you have and I'd love to address them what I would even love to do is you can submit your applications to me and every week we do like a weekly review of your applications and I react to your apps so if you have a horrible app then I'll react horribly I'd be like believably and hysterically I'll be like this okay I'd be like like that that's so cool man Thank You Evan sulfur stuff sir for iron what's pub G again is that fortnight just I keep hearing people keep saying pub G what is I'm gonna look it up right here oh this is fine dude yeah I've played this yeah this was fun I'm also thinking to maybe play video games and livestream coding and then like another livestream coding I mean like play video games and answer your guys's questions on YouTube about coding is that something that would be interesting like playing video games and then answering your questions about you I think that could be pretty fun Kazi why should news Windows is mindblowing JavaScript unfortunate ha Java said please suggest some projects causing bunnies why should we not use windows for programming I because everything that you try to do windows it's just much harder than Linux command line Linux command line is just clean more control but more a loop arguably a little bit more freedom but I mean if you want freedom gold Linux so like if you want free yeah I was gonna say like if you want true freedom go Linux if you want install build failures and errors go Windows yeah like it's very simple it's really simple watereddown middle ground between Linux and Mac right if you can't afford a Mac or something like okay here's why I say don't go Linux because I went a bun okay for example the problem and a bun is that it's really under developed as a OS you can't you I don't even think you can have VLC you can't play a video you don't have a BS on it you can't have like normal applications that you want in your computer you can't have on there so Mac OS is a much more mature and mainstream operating system on top of that they have unbelievable command line so then you combine the two and you go Mac if you can't afford a Mac and you're on Windows and you're stuck then get something like vagrant and learn how it works or get or someway someway virtual machine yeah some virtual machines get a big rent get vagrant yeah vagrant is really good one because virtual machine what I don't like about a virtual machine is that you got to go completely off your computer and then it requires so much processing power and slows you down and everything whereas with vagrant it's in your own operating system and you're using a box from somewhere else and you could be coding in your own favorite coding editor I actually have a blog post I wrote which is really good and it's like let me see if I can vaguely a medium clever programmer I think you should be able to find it if you type it in the ultimate guide to starting with vagrant and the why so if you're a Windows user and you want a second chance at life then go and read blog post this will teach you how sounds like what your life will be like after vagrant okay use your favorite OS since you SSH into this you'll know what SSH you get to be on your favorite operating system okay I personally hated having a bunch of VM ware on my Mac OS because OS is way more mature than the freebie and bad Ubuntu plus VM wares are not native so they slow your computer down and are clunky ok once you learn how to use vagrant you'll be able to follow every tutorial and learn any new technology without any problems no environment problem just because you have Windows or that your Ruby virtual environment is broken or that your pads are all screwed up I remember way back when I couldn't get ipython to work or I couldn't install NPM because of some random stuff being broken in my computer I remember PI game took me two years to install I remember trying to install an UMP I took forever right it's painful yeah okay everyone in the world will be able to use your code if you learn vagrant your higher ability will skyrocket plus you'll be your resume you'll save years of your time and you'll be able to stick with your favorite editor and if you're not sold yet if you're not sold yet you're just a wannabe developer and you should quit with that said this guy takes you through how to install vagrant so just go through this guy's it'll help you a lot okay and it's a really good guide I built it a lot of love okay application min for highlighted when switching been using for over ten years what has he been using for over ten years how that went searching hmm I don't know what Phillip means I'll be streaming on twitch everyday the fool says awesome to fool Linux oh he's been using Linux for 10 years yeah Phillip that's awesome yeah the great thing about Linux is it super super budget look into a Raspberry Pi just running like an Ubuntu or even like uh or any probably we want to it's probably best so you can get that for like super cheap what are the same would be interesting yes Toby what did we say damn I hate this youtube lag what did what are we talking about Frankie when enemy may be playing games and answering questions ah playing games and maybe answering questions that could be somebody said game development tutorials that's cool too I use sent OS do you recommend using it basically I have integrated docker is there a way where we can show these messages on the screen like what's the click of a button I think that would be cool strike that was no over to go or yeah a screenshot Oh no ii ii ii ii guess actually you're right that's probably the easiest way i was thinking of like a smarter way to do it alright so we've got the live chat here the wonder how we can learn from facebook facebook life too but most of them are youtube okay I'm gonna try to hide away hey whoever said that wasn't was Malcolm fuel hello can you specify what would be interesting that would solve all our problems Thanks okay I'm gonna make the skill really huge hopefully they'll help boom nice dude that is helping right awesome okay cool dad I didn't create a separate you're doing a flooded with tutorial channels and tons of books I mean I'll do it on this channel yeah oh this is don't burn your stuff out cool rap Python dictionaries damn where are we vom she says I used cent OS do you recommend using it basically I have integrated docker environment to my PI charm ID yeah docker is good to vagrant if your isn't pretty good yeah docker is really really good if you're using scent OS and you understand how to use it then cool just keep using it and if you're if you have it integrated to your PI charm awesome I don't even know how you'd figure that out but that's great I have a JavaScript and Java Java course coming up next semester excited to learn about it what python syntax be similar would Python syntax be similarly Java it's not really similar but if you understand concepts of programming and one then you understand them in another yeah the syntax is completely different actually right the syntax is very different but like different words if and else statements exist yes while loops are the same for loops just idea is the same or loose right so like most of the ideas are the same the syntax is different I like Python because it doesn't it lets you be more productive as a developer and you can run things and test things faster and then you can go and actually put your code in Java when I was going to a Java class I actually learned Python first and I would test everything out in Python and then I would quickly put it in Java just because every time I had to run my code I had to compile it in JavaScript Java whereas in Python I could actually just run it in my interactive environment you know yeah which is insane why doesn't don't have just an interactive environment to be able to just run your code that's ridiculous to me and what I'm talking about guys is like you know I can just do this it's a very it was very like and I can just like run code even their programming let me just have this I can remember and I know there's a few I have like these virtual environments like this right I got a notification for your live hello moment you do also review frontend stuff backend stuff and all the other crazy thing when you do a review session okay cool thanks a lot man what's your favorite National Team soccer team Bruno is always screaming in all caps but I love Bruno because he's also in our course the profitable programmer so we love you for that Bruno thank you supporting us in these hard times my man I love you what's your favorite national soccer team from South America besides ARLA and Tina oh that's funny because I'm running at happiness shirt I mean Brazil is pretty cool you know but uh I'm gonna have to go with I'm gonna have to go with yeah Brazil is pretty dope yo Frankie South America Mexico is no what is that it's no it's North America really no it's Central America he wouldn't know he's from Mako he's from the fake Mexico the Calexico come execute all right so Brazil for me Daniel says hi man you are the best no Daniel you're the best and thank you for watching this live stream because you guys are literally helping the channel survive the longer the Watchmen is the more we can survive it's like if you want to help us I'll just leave this running sleeve this running go do your if you have to leave you've got to meet your girlfriend you got to go on a date you got go and relax just leave this running I'm gonna go do another stuff yeah watch this with your girlfriend watch this with your parents put us on a TV you know will answer your parents questions they'll be fun Gary if you recently made a video on IG about the YouTube algorithm are you serious or is he making it up or is Gary V posted too many videos already and it's gone that was so last hour I don't see anything but he care when he says recently does it mean like few days ago because Gary Vee few days ago is like you'll never find it recently made a video on IG used all your content film it for video content leverage your guests audience oh I think podcasts are a triple arbitrage money on creating content here's why you have an audio formal call that people listen to you can fill in the podcast and have video content distribute your guess is another arbitrage they could promote the content on their own channels and bring the awareness our potential is creating written content oh man this is too much it's too much I can't find it Victor moving on stuck at learning JavaScript what to do don't worry we will make a crash course soon and we will destroy everybody else I don't know water I mean your support team is not replying to me related to the course please messy please be just a little bit patient because we have a lot of students who just join a lot of our courses for example we just did two product launches one for Python LP another one for Johnson misses audience so we have bunch of new students enrolling in our programs so gov't job Academy leave a message to our support team and be just a little bit patient and you can reach out to me at clever cause II see le ve our QA CI on Instagram clever Kazi and I will personally respond to you okay if you DM me I respond to almost every single person that leaves something thoughtful so I will respond to you Java is a compiled language exactly 20 cent Josh would learn them a bit Sheikh says to what extent Java should be learned to be able to work on Android studio to a decent extent right I mean it's in Java yeah so this like learn the basics of jungle and be able to build some basic stuff for Java Thanks a Travis thank you for actually answering or responding to Zdenek oh that's awesome I appreciate that yep a UI UX review on your website maybe yeah I can I can do it yeah I can do a UI UX review so if you guys send me your applications I will make a video on them in the live streams and actually do a review yeah we can do a review okay what is shebang and Python I don't know I've heard of that I've heard it this is more informative so I don't miss any episode of this channel okay you got it Chris says I'm just here to support the YouTube algo hack crush a trophic ozzie Chris Russo I saw your comment in our last livestream you said you're a marketer and you would be able to help us dude that would be phenomenal DMA please on IG and I will respond to you thank you so much I appreciate it Philip says this is it that I can what programs you have that I can enroll in Philips week I mean Zdenek oh we have profitable programmer which is our program that who who's who was talking earlier Bruno right that Bruno is in and I think he's really enjoying it we just have to update our module four but profitable programmer is our course that's basically like a 16 week bootcamp full stack development ok but at a fraction of a price of a bootcamp like thankful is $500 a month I've been in thankful it's a great program you have a lot of other programs that are like range between 5,000 to 15,000 dollars profitable programmer is between 400 to 500 dollars okay so if you're interested let me know or message me on instagram at clever cause II and I'll reply to you we're gonna be launching that course actually soon Chris says yep that was me I'll message you awesome Chris just thought you you maybe could do how to do progressive web apps with Python yang of content I don't know what progressive web apps are but sure I I haven't I don't I don't know if I've made any progressive apps oh sorry I was supposed to be showing all of this so I was I just responded to Danny ko he says what programs you have so I responded to that Thank You Travis Chris says yep that was me what is bootcamp coding stuff you know yeah promote says I'm a big fan and he goes I have enrolled to your Python program awesome my man loved it what's the best bootcamp you guys have joined looking for recommendations who would ask that yeah that question I'm not answering that question oh yeah who's that guy Francisco oh who's that guy we're not answering that question for that guy let's just skip over that question let's just skip over that question yeah skip over that guy yeah I'm gonna skip over that it's the black cyber network no no so my profitable programmer course is not 2k it's much cheaper than that the 2k thing that I was mentioning was we are doing in person oneonone or like group boot camps with people so you can come in and we'll do three days in person with you or three to five days in LA in Hollywood and for that it would be around 2k we're still working that out but once we have people coming in I know it'll go more than that but for now that's where we'll keep it almost like a bootcamp like a coding boot camp with cause II and my team how can we learn best to kinter programming my Opie course is pretty good for that that goes a lot over Opie programming electrons so you you can message me at my Instagram is at clever cause II so you can message there that work my parent yeah cheese cheese they're like things like whoa it just went to all platforms let's see for work it's crazy should be there probably damn I got three messages from your channel it's working what does that mean it's working oh the multiple chat or something speaking of ways a doctor queen mention energy says hello speaking of ways of how to win against the algorithm are we yes we are yeah we're trying to get past the algorithm and get ahead of it and beat it and so we're gonna be creating a lot of content that's gonna be like clique baby type of titles and images except it's gonna be like really good content and we want to make sure our clickthrough rates are really high we want to have high watch minutes so what we're gonna do is like instead of creating a series of videos we're gonna just create one video that's like a full Python course like 3 or 4 hours long a lot of smart channels are finding out about this and that's what they're doing to grow their channels yeah tech leap collab I'd love to collab with tech lead if any of you guys want to message him on my behalf that would be so amazing but yeah we'll reach out to tech lead at some point should I learn app development and suggest me okay yeah AB development school I got peeps moving out there when I'll be ready thanks for that cool that'd be awesome man yeah black cyber network let me know if you're ever interested in that role gots has just got in what's up roll what's up my man why are you skipping my questions I asked for a github repo for some inspiration can you come on Kazi then why are we skipping his questions man this must be a part of a bigger conspiracy than we know why why are you leaving Satish out could it be could it be just to attack against the tsh I don't know man I think it's possible Kerrick carry over the water oh yeah hold on hold on keep going hold on good this is to like that's funny okay let's go back to it all right so my github is clever programmer type that in and you shall find it my friend yes and some inspiration go out there and kick some ass and quit being a to teach let's go baby code why can't you code for ten hours a day just code for ten hours a day okay code for ten hours a day I'm actually not kidding I got really good in a very very short period of time at coding because I actually code it for 15 to 18 hours a day for three to six months and then I got the same results and most developers get in about four to five years that's how I was landing clients for 50 to $100 an hour and that's how I was actually making 104 thousand dollars a year while I was actually going to Community College as a 21 year old so that's what I would say for motivation just can you can you hit this at the right time can you go back there we go this is awesome I left alright next one okay so teach got us worked up so the satiation knows how to push our buttons progressive web apps work both on desktop and also exactly like native apps on mobile with local sort of push them to something in the future that may kill native mobile app development for sure and for mobile app development I believe flutter is also gonna be super powerful right flutter is gonna be pretty awesome really but I mean oh if I'm not showing the messages please let me know so we got flutter all these changes I mean there's a delay but it'll come back change what yeah yeah it'll be there so flutter is gonna be actually huge for app development so everybody this is if there's a trend as a developer to follow this is one of the hottest trends to follow and be on top of so if you do iOS and you're trying to look into Android development specifically don't do that use flutter Google released it Google is pushing it forward like crazy and the reason is because for flutter you don't need to know Java to create Android apps and you don't need to know iOS to create the iOS or sorry Swift to create the iOS apps you can just learn flutter and it natively builds it for both at the same time one language one language so this is them all really huge fast development okay maybe we'll make a course on this too expressive beautiful you eyes okay native performance so really Alibaba is using it Google Google Ads and so you know I mean Google rolled it out so it makes sense that they're using alibaba's app has 50 million plus downloads per reflect Li whoa a beautiful Journal and mindfulness AB driven by artificial intelligence I'm actually curious what reflect Li is now Jack needed to let her reflect Li of course what is it dude mindfulness yeah he's checking it out because of that he's uses machine learning for journals okay I don't know about it let's stop wasting my time on riff luckily what is it well reflect Li yeah what's Aaron's position in the team Aaron is our product development and he's a friend he's a you what any what who are you why the are you here Frankie throw is that sour actually just live in his closet like I just not needed a place to crash one day so I'm just around you know I don't really add anything to the team I'm just here seven days a week eating his food eating enraging his life's true drinking my coffee exactly invading the live streams eating my trip never bringing my trail mix no you actually did I'm just another guy that creates content for the channel I'm just another content creator I provide a different flavor and style that cause he does and I create some product I have a product out oh yeah are you creating a product that's totally forgot WP yeah that was actually meaning that con so you so does it matter if you create a product does it matter if I created product yeah does it help the world does it help yes it helps the world of course Wow finally earned being confident I was waiting for some weird self deprecation joke huh so Victor Aaron is actually rolandic client so Aaron sucks at explaining who he is I'll do it for him Aaron is an incredible badass he's a product of and he kicks ass on our team okay he is not only good at coding and development he also is part way through done with his master's at what is the Oh Georgia Tech and okay he's not only a developer he can create content which is incredible and he's built a brilliant product at over a hundred students plus enrolled in called automate with Python so he's pretty epic but he's just very selfdeprecating and he can never get those words out of his mouth it probably is hurting him from the inside right now he probably has to say something shitty to just feel okay right now your titles are man I wish we had airtight and now I miss not having Aaron title and no okay your titles are very good thank you great I'll be tuned in for the Python course awesome we'll make something make sure you bring coffee respect lead man okay I'll bring something well how do these guys speaking in cannot all caps so aggressively and also I don't have a you in my name what's up with kuzey what's up kuzey what about light you me what's up ibuprofen [Laughter] that's how Frank he says ibuprofen he says I able proven ibuprofen I okay so what was the question what's the job to get home link that's cool yeah pycharm it's awesome my charm is awesome oh okay oh that is a good way to work around instead of negatively misleading the viewers you're positively misleading them to content that should be beneficial to them clever exactly yep what they want give them what they positive manipulation so here's so I don't know if you guys know but do you know what's the difference between a leader and a manipulator a manipulator only one thing or what's the common thing between them right what is it they influence people they change people's behaviors that's it they post manipulate one does it for the benefit of him or herself the other does it yeah the other the leader does it for the benefit of the other person yeah that's it yeah that's the only difference manipulation is the same thing as leading is just one is done for benefits both which is he so that's why there are people who are scam artists and then there's people who run businesses both can be really really profitable what does he bless platform if I ever don't have that please just remember just look at it actively if I ever don't have that screen put it up because then they can't read the comments best platform you get app development courses I don't know actually rolls has enrolled in your Python Opie course excited to learn yeah that's awesome roll I love it my man Danica says nice job thank you what are your thoughts on hold on ha ha thoughts or Bulger that's how I read all the so yeah it's good you know blockchains oh I don't have many thoughts I think I think everybody's a liar who says that actually understand it here's simple terms there are no simple terms for it no all it is if you push it up nobody can take it down that's simple things I understand like that it's perfect nobody can with you if you put stuff there and then Bitcoin works off of blockchain technology so it's like traceable supposed to be secure is supposed to be foolproof but like Who am I kidding okay if anybody actually understood it they would be creating their own cryptocurrencies from scratch very few though very few and even the ones who are don't have to understand how it works they're just creating it like none of us actually know at a very deep level how electricity truly works like how deep Newton knows it but guess what we don't have to right this is how I think about like blockchain like I think if you get truth really deep nobody really knows except for like Satoshi Nakamoto you know but like everybody else is just just like you'll be is is is earth flat right maybe so so you know the answer is like you you know that the earth is revolving around the Sun right but you don't know that you just heard it you just heard it you have no idea but I have no hunger center but you but you're even 99% sure because of just what you've been hearing from people what you've been hearing from your teacher yeah we're flattered with those guys you haven't figured it out from scratch right you don't actually have the tools to figure it out most people don't I don't I believe that it's true you could because people said exactly that's the problem right you still create apps right kickass apps yeah so those are my thoughts on blockchain DTaP SAS is it necessary to learn Java in 2019 I don't know if you need to do Java jobs you probably got to learn Java if you don't want to do jobs in Java you probably don't have to learn it okay mogera says we'll be fine breath 371,000 selves I believe in you thank you so much I believe in you too never heard of flutter is it anything like the Mannion I've heard of them or in it what do you mean $1.99 whoa somebody send one dollar ninetynine cents one twitch whoa whoa dude right there oh uhhuh how do I stop being a little and just crush it I sent you to do dog Charlie garnet was he the one whose question I answered earlier or no no I was it was no no okay there's somebody else okay I have a solution for you no no it was a minion guy Oh Victor asked about Aaron what are you trying to show us on here I have somewhat of a solution for you hold on hold on what do you do oh yeah go for it did that help Victor yeah and if that didn't help we got something else for you coding is not hard you just have to solder is good in five years in only three months funny there you go that's your answer hopefully that answers it learn Python bro gonna take off soon as the number one language oh hell yeah like it's already crushing JavaScript and interest yeah also Stack Overflow now the number one and most asked questions are around Python and then the number one most used language unless you Sparkfun yep when you when will you be releasing your Opie course and on what price we just released Opie course so the enrollment is closed but we will be releasing profitable programmer soon and once we release profitable programmer course we will be releasing it until 2020 it's the Illuminati they're censoring their channel those are Plutonian alien demonic hybrids Jesus Christ probably Wow nice he says Wow nice Wow leader inspires he dance right now okay well dance oh my god you're controlling us guys will do anything for views see we'll see how low we've gotten see your leader yeah you're benefiting us by dancing it's healthy right it's healthy right humiliating you're a leader humiliating but dancing I mean but fine but healthy fun imagine somebody just jumping in the live now don't hit my mic he'll blow somebody's ear off wash can you go back to having the master class well we had the master class it's kind of over offering the class oh maybe I'm confusing something Joseph K PyCharm or a V s code PyCharm PyCharm is my favorite vehicle have to agree with him on that one yeah Mia's code is cute Aaron what are you specializing in in your master's program if anything at all if anything I'm Isis my specialization is interactive intelligence which is kind of a weird term I'm just required to confuse the weird collection of classes but pretty much it's just a bunch of AI and a little bit of what development some hyper ones computing and a little bit of computer architecture that's why it's like it's like a match of everything and I like how people on the track of computers it's just kind of like a mishmash I mean well what's that what what nothing I'll get it you'll get it when you watch the stream Aaron's new haircut is not wait hold on I'm sorry I put the emphasis on correctly two seats but it's easy there's new Ron's new haircut is not cool hold up hold up what it suits him pretty much good Python Loki taking over Duke it out of us Hussein yep I mean Python is taking over I just came whoever says I think he means like he just got here on this live stream yeah what else could he possibly mean you know these kids just now starting to watch a master class part two awesome master classes awesome go enjoy it I meant the program you said just clothes noona coding would hate to miss out for finding about you now yeah Joseph Spencer if you join our email list by going to clone a programmer comm and signing up for anything free you will be hurting your ear if you join the what is it that's okay if you sign up for anything that's free on clever programmer will have your email list and you'll find out about it by the way a Kazi bro what's up bro it's funny because messages retracted here but you can still see it on our chat so he retracted it but this is by the way Kazi bro yeah sorry I was saying your hating on my hair so they can retract the comment is no longer retracted you can run but you can't get retracted as this is the real blockchain yo this is yeah this is blockchain this is a blockchain words will have Python news for you guys too coming up in the next livestream that's gonna be pretty freakin awesome I'll even do some stuff on like I'm thinking to even do something like stuff on the whiteboard for you guys at some point what we have here is some cloudy weather here hold on what else oh yeah I don't know cleavage for this come on we have some cloudy weather here what other content yeah we have a little more cloudy weather here Python more cloudy over here AI and machine learning those are some things we have to talk about at some point oh definitely how it's gonna be fun that's gonna be part of our news between AI machine learning shall we shall david says it's better to get good with code HTML CSS javascript before going bananas with python is it better to get good with HTML CSS javascript before but as if I just want to get entrylevel web dev job so to get an entrylevel web dev web dev job yeah it makes a lot of sense to go HTML CSS JavaScript it's totally fine that it's not gonna hurt you at all it just depends what you want to be working in and what you like where you're at right if you're a complete beginner I like to say goal Python Lauren Python if you are past being a beginner and you already have some experience would say like JavaScript or something then just keep going and like go for the job and start applying to places and also all of us don't be afraid to go on up were calm guys like go to up were calm okay watch how this how easy this is right this is how you should look for jobs click jobs click Python this is like freelancing jobs make sure you type in correctly unlike me Python okay and then you can like look for what jobs are out there somebody's looking for Django developer oh okay look for something that's like easy right numpy expert maybe you're not a numpy expert maybe you can't do that but Python code integration from two scripts that looks easy apply for this Django software update apply for this if you want to do something with web development type that in and see what kind of like web development or web developer jobs are out there so we're press developer to rebuild and launch a series of pages okay this is easy let's go apply for this right now and you can try on this this is easy but the pro tip that I give here to everybody is send a oneminute personalized video if you can or a personalized message always personalized okay developer need it for converting web designs of Squarespace and blah blah yep so see this stuff is not that hard let's see if there's any JavaScript stuff which I'm sure there is xamarin developer needed for long term projects oh yeah I had to look up a xamarin was JavaScript pry sticker widget right I breathe it out so you could do that what's the difference between flutter and xamarin then okay so let's see flutter versus the shortcomings of native mobile app development traditional mobile app developers slow and more consist business have to develop a separate app for each platform so xamarin is arguably one of the leading opensource crossplatform technologies flutter and comparison that's what I care about okay okay so a lot of people are using zamarons more popular as if now Microsoft has one point four million xamarin engineers wait what hold on dance how many employees is Microsoft have googling that just blew my mind how many so how can you have I think it says Microsoft claims that 1.4 million xamarin engineers o users people who are using it not people who work for them right oh my god that would be scary please anybody hasn't maybe working for them floater community isn't large enough yet some engineers recognize Florida as a budding alternative so making tutorials on Florida could be pretty cool too below we'll take a look at the characteristics and major features of the two frameworks so the insights aren't fully conclusive okay so flutter kind of uses one language portability ios and android ocean stammer and uses everything man that's a good point I don't know why somebody would use flutter or versus xamarin I'm literally trying to figure it out oh yeah because you can run away from sea shark that's one good reason dart is a much simpler programming language paint your life paint your UI to life with dart VM instant hot reload maybe we should make some stuff on this bro this would be fun let's do like we make a we learn maybe we will learn flutter alive and then we'll make only yet you know let's look at this so class segment in links equals four to string okay it's looking very java ish you should not really t9 Java it should kind of looks Libya sh to me a little bit in Java I don't know much reading class segment Kotlin swift okay so we're gonna look into flutter at some point maybe a app that uses Django rest framework for the API and then use this flutter for the mobile app development and I think it could be cool to have an app right here that people can see and then some Python I think that'll be a fun tutorial but yeah this is what I would do to look up like you know this type of stuff with JavaScript and everything yeah this is a honestly I think flutter because it's just maybe a little bit easier that's the only thing I can kind of point to as if now let's see what else is there so flutter has a framework called so here's what I get out of it right flutter has a framework called skia which everywhere as xamarin has mono and how i think of it is like python has flask and then a python is flask and Django and Django has more batteries included so I think flutter with skia it's saying that the framework has you know dart framework which has most of the components inbuilt so it's bigger in size and often does not require so Dart okay is a little bit bigger then I guess what xamarin is using so so that means that you have more batteries included you can create stuff without actually having to bridge everything creating it from scratch mostly which I usually like you know this is why I like Django because you I can build apps a lot faster my mic is about to die so just be very aware of that and be very aware of that to Frankie if you can just like tell me once it's done how's that one doing there okay let's see if we're getting questions from people flutter is nice how's it going yeah how's it going oh I was on there today for chatbot jobs awesome Chantelle that's great leaving the computer urban surfer says leaving the computer running off to work one day maybe soon I can enjoy my job like you and your team much appreciation to your team Aloha Aloha urban surfer and thank you for that oh my goodness that helps us get more watch time and if we get more watch time we can survive Ruben says thank you I really need to video you are the best Ruben you are the best as well my friend thank you so much what type of tips would you give someone setting up your page what page when I say personalize Chantal I mean like send a personal message to each person don't send copypasted template messaging whoa we're just changing one word in there make very clear that you're adjusting exactly what they said like with they use certain terminology Ranger like Oh literally it was that background this issue and my name is this address them by name and used as many words as they did so they know you read it and but then also give value and video form and that you care yeah yes and the video format it's what I've been max out your human skills and that's the best way to line clients no matter what yes because it's a human that's reading it on the other side okay very important on a computer fulltime job versus up work I'm a fan of up work I hate anything that ties me that's my feed me personally I just hate schedules I hate being told what to do but I do stuff by myself I will work 15 to 18 hours a day no problem I'll work hundred hours a week no problem I just like doing things on my own schedule so that freedom is incredibly important to me like in two week since my dad's birthday I'm gonna be going there in Chicago you know like if I was doing a full time job I couldn't do that so that matters to me over almost everything so that's why upward for me Sam Ryan is kind of a pain okay there you go just Java Harun says they really need to solve one problem make web application live cool they'll be fun make color programmer mobile application that would be really fun I want to do that let's learn flutter that'd be fun let's take a look together clash crash course on flutter could be fun flutter is nice dart awesome awesome up work yeah up work is great digital ocean yeah Chantal I'm glad that you dig it it's good digital ocean is a good technology to learn too okay guys my girlfriend is not feeling well so I'm actually gonna jump out and I'm gonna go see her so I'm gonna be ending this livestream and then we can do more live streams and get more wash time but more importantly also answer your questions and bring value straight to your face okay thank you guys so much for watching thank you Chantel Thank You Akash thank you roll thank you a mirror Thank You Aaron thank you Haroon Thank You Reuben Thank You urban surfer AR SN so thank you all of you guys for actually being here we love your face this is cozy this is Aaron and as always we'll see you in the next video this was how the worst like this mouths words we act like it's over here all right guys
