do this at clever programmer it's always a banger we did challenge one and we had over ten thousand people in there we did challenge two we had over ten 000 members joined from all around the world and it was a mindblowing experience this challenge is going to be nothing short of probably one of the best experiences of your entire life guys we currently have i'm not kidding we currently have literally 10 000 people in the facebook group and these are all 10 000 developers potential aspiring developers who want to change their lives who want to go ahead and and raise themselves up in their development career or want to switch their careers so guys if you have not joined just want to say make sure to click the link in description join the challenge join this epic now here's what we're going to be building in here just so you guys know for this challenge okay so remember day one we're actually going to be talking about the entire road map to becoming a react javascript developer this is going to be how do you go from a complete beginner to landing your first job now day two three and four what are they going to be building now they're going to be building an epic amazon clone as you guys see right there this amazon clone out not only looks just like amazon but it's going to have functionality of add to cart so if you like for example add to basket you will see in the top right corner you will see that there's a two right what if you if you go ahead and another one add to basket right there's a three now in the corner right so this is live data live updating data on top of that guys inside stuff what sony has prepared for you is you will not only be able to view your shopping cart but you will also be able to pay using a payment process that is going to be very very powerful and for those of you who are maybe a little bit more advanced and you're thinking how are we going to do that with firebase well guess what you're going to be learning about cloud functions they are actually one of the most powerful things and serverless technology is going to be one of the most popular things you can learn and if you are a beginner and some of that frightens you don't worry we're going gonna make it extremely simple for you to pick it up just like how we do kind of everything yeah on top of that guys don't worry you know everybody in this in the facebook group everybody in this challenge is pretty much a beginner we are all here to learn we are all here to inspire each other and we are all here to grow and build in something amazing so yep and now check this out right you guys are probably aware of some of these features on the amazon clone that you're going to be building but i can add all of these things and then it gives me the total and i can take this out now those are going to be on day two three and four with a lot of additional functionality so we are so excited for you guys and um let me give you what we're gonna be doing on day five day five you're gonna learn how can you make a hundred thousand dollars a year or more as a react javascript developer now guys with that kind of knowledge right from our previous challenges we've had the javascript challenge if you maybe you've known we had two javascript challenges at this point and with that knowledge we provide for the students we've had people landing their first clients not kidding within a day to two days and actually starting to make money with the knowledge that we provide it's absolutely insane yeah we were getting people who were getting clients in literally day one day two of the challenge before anything else even so just this challenge in itself it just packs such a freaking punch oh yeah it's pretty ridiculous so that's why come prepare tomorrow to the react javascript challenge and again we're going to be going deep into your roadmap of becoming a react javascript developer which means you're going to learn things like what technologies do you need to learn to become a react.js developer how long do these technologies take and we're going to be talking about things like you know you're going to need to maybe learn how firebase works or material ui how important is responsive design what is react.js what are the top companies using react.js and we're going to be talking about things like why an engineer and netflix makes 306 000 a year why is that happening it's insane powerful tech is what you're going to be learning and it's also what facebook is built off yeah and i would say it's also like the most important thing most important thing is this is real world knowledge okay this is not theory this is not theoretical this is real word applied knowledge you can later on apply add to your portfolio go ahead and then go in and take that right yeah use that as experience and then go out to for example to clients to jobs right and you know and get your first jobs or get started on your kickstarter basically your career as a developer 100 crazy raw says are you really doing this at this time damn oh yeah absolutely so we did the javascript challenge a few months ago then we did challenge two for the

right now what are you trying to play here man um i don't know um all right if you guys got questions definitely start popping them up and we'll address them what's mx 50 i don't know what that is 50 but oh mx50 but this is um a sure mic i don't know if you guys asked that uh isal says hey guys i'm from brazil and i want to improve just not in a framework but in javascript just here to say y'all are awesome great if you pick up react react is just a library it's not even a framework so you will be perfectly fine and your skill level will improve we're gonna make a new link for slack for you guys guys so don't worry about that we will take care of you guys and help you out you you actually will actually receive in an email with the new slack link so don't worry says i know you're going to send an email right yes okay awesome renuga says i already know node should i learn react and we should also send out an email right after this live stream yeah let's do it let's do it um if you know node i think you should still learn react it's only going to supercharge think of reactors just like supercharging your javascript or node.js skills i mean it's really if your node you're using you know the end if you if you learn react then you learn the front end and so now what do you become you become a full stack developer and the value of a full stack developer is 10x yes aditya says guys you are amazing please do a video on setting up eslint prettier and typescript in a react project it'll be dope so during this live challenge we're not going to touch too much on typescript but we will show you eslint and prettier for sure yeah inside of the course we are gonna at some point touch into typescript and profit with javascript course and guys keep in mind that um it did during this challenge right after the challenge ends we're going to be opening the doors to profit with javascript and we're going to be releasing it at the best price possible to so mark september 13th on your calendar because it's going to be a big day and after that day the price of profit with javascript will never ever come down again because we consistently have too many students and people saying hey this is worth more than a 5 dollar coding boot camp this is worth more than the fifteen thousand dollar coding bootcamp i just took in new york so the value of it is just too much and the community is epic and we really wanna make sure we give everybody results and delegate a lot of resources and hire new developers because we just want to reinvest into making this the best program on the planet profit javascript oh yeah so just want to let you know as a courtesy to everybody who's watching this on the facebook or instagram or youtube right now um that you should just know that so then that way you can get the best deal on profit with javascript as possible because it's going to go up in price and so if you want to get that best deal guys join the challenge below make sure you're in there make sure you're following along doing your best and just you know come along for the ride i have this this really cool thing emily emily from slack said i finally found a mission to be an amazing mission to be a part of i love that i love that all right how about this we got 535 comments on our facebook thing yes maybe we should address some of them right now let's do it and bring them up let's go and share that we got 500 comments going hey oswen just dropped something wow okay let's go here um osman says i'm your subscriber from 10 000 subs damn osman thank you man you were there before everybody you believed in me more than probably not so i appreciate you yeah that's true and and i'm really glad that i know this channel i'm a beginner at javascript and react javascript and want to know this is friendly so yes this is completely beginner friendly we will make sure of that so don't worry about that just come in with a good mindset and we will help you out okay thank you osman appreciate it paul mason says so we asked all of you guys why what's your number one reason for becoming a successful react javascript developer and we we got over 535 comments and paul mason was like to start a career career and something i love to do rather than be in a career where i do something i have to do to pay the bills now how many of you guys actually resonate with that i know that i totally resonate with that and that's actually one of the reasons why i started coding in the first place nice sean watt says i was always coding i was always into coding as a kid and as the years went by i got into it more and more until i found the love of my life web development i've learned all the basics and now i'm currently learning react.js thanks to you guys i learned a lot over these past few clones so you guys have probably seen us make the slack clone the tinder clone the tiktok clone you guys have probably have seen us make the amazon clone but this is going to be different because now the amazon clone that we're going to build is going to have a back end and it's going to have the ability to accept credit card payments using stripe it's going to have serverless architecture which is the modern way to develop any app so then you're not making these monolithic apps you're making these extremely lean and mean applications that's how people at uber want you to develop or instacart want you to develop apps and he goes and i'm currently creating my portfolio using react and i will for sure be adding the clones to it to ensure my chances of getting a job brilliant that is awesome all right let's see for me coding is not just for getting a job but it is a reason why i want to live damn from the first day when i stepped into my college development was my passion and now with your help i'll be able to achieve my goal love you team cp let's go team cp i love that you said let's go in real life and read this you also said let's go in the comments oh yeah sure right over here which is so funny i use that word too much man i love it georgino says i want to be a great developer with react because i love javascript and want to get a great job as a developer that is absolutely amazing i am literally rooting for you let's go here we go so guys this is a phenomenal group after this live stream nas and i and aaron and frankie and the entire clever programmer team we will respond to every single one of these 500 comments that we actually got nothing in here will be missed no stone will be left unturned no corner unchecked we love you guys and we're going to show that to you with our passion commitment and our work ethic because we want to support you and we're rooting for you to get a job as a developer we want you to be our next success

never been to a situation where in five days i could actually build something so crazy you know no not even happen to me no yeah man and then and if you're intermediate or even more advanced right and you want to learn a new framework or a new library this is still the way the way to do it right yeah the more tools you've got your tuba just kind of like a handyman or anything anything you got the

coding team on youtube period period period pretty much in the world in the world in the world yeah i'm i'm so excited leaf says bring water food and do not miss a second yeah bring everything you got maybe get some peanuts or whatever you got almonds you know yeah you got some novels you know for us to chill and maybe maybe last place with your legs if we do some dancing but we'll see hmm just playing some sounds here i'm not gonna hear that yeah i need to plug in here and then you'll be able to hear everything all right let's bring this bad boy back are there any prerequisites of react as long as you know basic javascript or you've experienced even if you've experienced nothing that's gonna be fine we're gonna help you learn it people try to make it more complicated than it really is i remember one of my mentors i'm not gonna name him but when i wanted to learn it he would just always be like no no don't don't learn it give it give it a few give it a few years few years until you go through all these theoretical textbooks don't even start don't even start just gonna waste your time and i remember i used to listen to him on everything right so i thought okay he's right i probably shouldn't start i don't know what i'm getting into i'm just gonna be confused and i'm gonna be lost so i listen to him years and years and years passed by and guess what i just never touched react because i made it this thing that was going to be like the most complicated thing on the planet then i met sonny he was like hey you should learn react this is like awesome and it's fun and started picking it up with him and guess what in a week i had picked it up to the point where i was starting to build projects and things on my own and i just kept going with it nice thing you know guys this guy became addicted i waited the way cozy is when he learned something he was going to be addicted he they built like a analytics platform with react he built like uh some kind of a platform for videos it was crazy man yeah i just never stopped i just kept coding and react like for every day i was just like coding and react um i mean if you even look for zap if you look at stack overflow like react is like number one uh library for for you to go ahead to learn and need it right now it's very yeah very needed many people are looking for it and if you didn't know who made react you know did you know who made a reaction facebook facebook made react and facebook is not going on you anywhere so so there you go but yeah like what i was saying is i was so intimidated by learning react and then i picked it up and i was able to pick it up so fast now granted i had some experience in coding but guess what even if i didn't have any experience in coding and a lot of the people who are coming to our platform are beginners they're just learning and picking it up and building these projects and by building these projects they are learning people try to make it so complicated don't listen to them just don't listen to them trust me just yeah yeah it's actually funny like for me for example i didn't know react at all i knew javascript right yeah i didn't know the react but then i got a work it's actually funny i got a client right who wanted to react i told them like listen i don't know react right right they're like okay that's fine that's fine uhhuh i failed their test for react i got like zero percent right but then guess what they still still took me in yeah and then within a week or two i was building react applications nonstop like seriously bro i told the guys i'm like guys uh i literally i failed up i failed their test and they're like yeah you definitely need to learn a little bit more but still oh damn alex whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa just donated 15 freaking dollars let's go alex popping sounds i'm gonna put air horn let's go thank you so much alex you are the real mvp so thank you so much i appreciate you brother and here's what he says he says

calls so the coaching calls we have in the pwg course and he goes the youtube channel after two months exactly i got what i borrowed twice back so meaning like he invested into the course and he made

idea at some point will on this channel that's actually fantastic that's a really good idea willy rosa wonka says so we'll have more backend features it means we are only going to care about the full front end with react we're gonna do both in this one willy we're gonna do front end with react and back end because on our youtube channel sometimes we don't have enough time to do back end so we mostly just do front end in this one we're gonna be going deep into adding back end functionality along with the frontend functionality so when you put this on your portfolio this app will be good to go completely working yeah patricia is asking what time tomorrow guys 11 a.m pst 11 mps 11 and if the slack link is not working don't worry we'll send you a slack link in the email soon after this
