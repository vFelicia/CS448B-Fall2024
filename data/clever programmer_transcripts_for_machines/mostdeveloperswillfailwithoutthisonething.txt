haejoo what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer not calm also known as Papa Python in this video we're gonna be talking about why pressure is privileged this is a very important epiphany that we had I had and my friend had what's dev we are in Miami Florida right now actually and this happened at 10x Rose con conference with Grant Cardone and it was beautiful with Jessie it's lection he said and he says that pressure is actually privileged so what the hell does this mean have you ever wanted to achieve the things that you only can dream of if you ever want it to be like hey I want to go to code for X amount of hours and be consistent with it but I keep falling out of it have you ever been in a position where you go okay I want to get a job but I'm gonna like dillydally and drag on a little bit but basically the idea is that you know the potential that you have you know what you could be doing what you should be doing which you will be doing you know what your potential could be but you don't actually tap into it and we fall really short of it right so if your potential is up here you're falling a lot short shorter of it so why does that happen often times that happens because you don't allow enough pressure to actually be applied on you right pressure is privilege so what does that actually look like most of our lives we try to do everything that's comfortable so we stay in the same location we stay around the same people we are around the people who make us feel comfortable with what we do it we are recently in my life you know what has been happening is I was around people who weren't doing a lot of things so they were just like relaxing spending a lot of time just hanging out which is cool and awesome and I'm all for that but they weren't living every moment and a so for example that means out if you know what happened to runs in families why not make that time a hundred percent when they're with their loved ones they're not on a hundred percent when they are at their work at their job or trying to work on their dreams they're not at 100 percent ones they're hitting the gym they're not at a hundred percent it's like all these moments of their lives are not at a hundred percent why is that happening well that's happening because they aren't having enough pressure that is applied to them for example when I was around them I didn't have any pressure applied on me so what was I doing I was dillydallying having a good time spending lots of time on social media consuming content and material but not actually outputting not producing not putting stuff out there that's actually helpful for you for anybody else right for the programming Ross or clever programmer I got more and more complacent I got more and more comfortable I had friends who also were okay with just not going to the gym so what happened I kind of stopped moving to the gym I'm like you know what this is all good everything is good life is good and then there came a point especially starting in 2019 I was like okay I need to change this because if I keep living like this I'm just gonna be a loser all right and I don't want to be a loser I don't know about you but I sure don't want to be a loser my definition of a loser somebody who doesn't try and commit 100% and they persisted but what they actually want to be able to do in their life right staying congruent with who you are I in 2019 and as 2018 was coming closer I wanted to hang out with people and spend a lot of time with people who apply pressure to me so for example I have my friend Brandon who will apply pressure to me in business because he's a monster when it comes to business he's killing he's crazy doing millions of dollars at product launches and whatnot and when I'm around him he's just like you're not making content you're not doing this you're not running ads you're not showing up for the people like what the hell are you doing and he'll just need to look at me that way so I feel so much pressure that I keep thinking about it and it's almost like there's biological pressure and so that makes me go back into and hit it harder it's like I have to elevate my normals right I gotta elevate my normals and go to that next level where before my normal was one video a month Mannion that's pretty good but now I'm like that let's do one video a day how about that all right then I have this friend she's amazing her name is Amber Lee and she's in spots she inspires me so much because she's a badass as what she does she's like running his freaking marathon she's killing it she's passionate she's energetic she has ambition and goals and then I go Kay another person around me was so driven with their mission right Brandon is serving with her mission my friend you know Tenzin you guys might not but that was actually recording this video she's so driven in his mission so Brandon Tenzin is like focus on making content focused on pushing myself harder focus on creating more products for students a clever programmer that they will find valuable do coding challenges do coding courses like go allin and stop just passing it and like oh I'm gonna do like a little bit of content you know this week and then I'm gonna like do a little bit of coding but you know let's not do like so much it's not over do it that'll be too much at this point to be honest like I'm not even doing this for you I'm doing this for myself so I could show they'll up all the time write a lot about a lot of the beautiful thing about your goals is who you end up becoming by doing them not what you get out of it I'm gonna repeat that one more time the biggest most important thing about your goals and achieving them is not what you get but who you become so my important thing is like I'm gonna show up and be a person who people want to follow be that leader but I have to leave myself first all right and then I hope and it's my privilege and I thank you for being here and actually following along and my dream is that you get a lot of value out of this but if one person gets value out of this my job is done so going back right I have these people who are putting pressure on me you know like I selling about my friend Amber Lee she's like going to the gym every day so in my brain there's pressure on me and I'm like you know what I should be going to the gym every day or I should be going like five to six times a week when I see another one of my friend who's really killing it it's a mother aspect of life work this friend is completely full of life when he's hanging out with family and friends he's like all in and he just loves them makes me go you know what maybe I should be doing that maybe when I spend time with my family and friends instead of just being on my phone or just being around them talking like actually show passion like show physiological passion be there 100% mentally emotionally put my phone on Do Not Disturb or airplane mode be there for them same thing applies when leading my team same thing applies for if I'm sitting down to code and write and make applications I want to just be able to focus go all in but to be honest a lot of what changed for me and everything turned around especially in 2019 not like I wasn't doing I was doing a lot even in 2018 and stuff but you know I'm like a normal human I have my highs and lows and I had a pretty low low low you know try to get a low type of low in 2018 and so now I have to bring it back and come around but I am so on fire and I know I'm gonna keep being on fire but I'm just looking for pressure and just forcing myself into those situations okay other examples are about to get on calls with people I scheduled them in my calendar and I force myself to be able to show up for those calls to code for an hour with a buddy or to talk with a buddy for an hour for a specific agenda or even to just have a normal conversation whatever it may be I'm finding ways to have external facing accountability and a private apply pressure to myself even this is video 15 I believe of day 15 of that challenge that I'm doing where I'm doing one video every single day by always saying this is day 15 of the challenge this is day 16 of the challenge there's more pressure being applied to myself because now you are holding me accountable you the person is watching this video and I'm putting it this out there and I'm saying this so now when I go home and I'm feeling like I just want to scratch my ass and go to sleep and not do anything before I'll actually knock out it'll go you know what I need to actually create something like okay like let's go after after I get it done that always feel amazing but at that time maybe I'm thinking man I don't want to do this right now like really knowing I'd rather just go to sleep but I'll do it because now there's actually pressure being applied and this is the good kind of pressure all right this is the healthy kind of pressure it's a pressure that gets you to do what you are in line with your life to do okay this is not the kind of pressure that will burn you out and personally I'd much rather be burnt out than dillydallied out you know then lukewarm doubt if that's a tournament giving 10% for 1015 years uh I'd rather give a hundred percent or half a year or one year and then just completely change it okay so for example if I give this channel a clever program one year and I just go allin and give it my all done if I want to change directions that do something I'll be so happy else I'll do it but I can't give it my 10% of what my potential actually is and then go oh you know what now I'm gonna change like my business plan and like now let's do something else because you know I feel like everybody else has made all these videos and anybody who could get help it's already gotten help that it's not even about that it's about what have I put into it what kind of effort have I made into it right that's why I had my simple programmer so much on sanyas because this guy has produced for killing 2,000 video zones and if you ask him I promise you while his audience was one of his goals to grow in all that it's who he's becoming by being able to do that right now he's on some crazy shootings like talking to Dan Locke and whatever but that's why this dude has inspired me so much to actually even start my channel in the first place was cuz he doesn't make excuses he just focuses on the process he just keeps doing it and he keeps becoming a different person right he's changing with his goals so this year all my goals are processoriented focus they're not outcome so for example process oriented meaning instead of saying oh we're gonna I want to hit 1 million subscribers this year that's not my goal I don't care if I hit 10,000 subscribers in this year or I hit a million subscribers this year I mean it before but my main goal is I want to produce minimum 200 videos many a month 200 videos I want to produce I want to go to the gym minimum 200 times that's it does it matter how hard I go alo I go it doesn't matter if my squats at like 400 pounds or 500 pounds none of that matters what matters to me is that I show the up and actually get discipline structured manner so for you my friend I hope what you get out of watching this video is like look I'm on day 15 of video 15 challenge this is the same guy who makes one video every frickin like few months in a blue moon okay it's hard to be able to do this you should come up with full energy just give you all I have every single video it's hard it's not easy but I love doing it I know it's the right thing it makes me feel good after I do it so I'm committing to it and I apply all kinds of external pressure forces me into it so for you if you want to be able to pull it every day you want to work on a project every day you want to try to apply to a job every day whatever it is make a goal talk about it to your friends hold yourself accountable but then apply pressure on yourself from external facing accountability get your friends to apply pressure to you if they're not gonna apply pressure to you get yourself some friends who have the balls to apply pressure on you okay don't be with people who don't apply pressure on you they're here to make you feel good but they don't they're not actually there to help you in your life okay so this is something really important be around people who applied that pressure on you please because that pressure is gonna like honestly the best way I can put it is I'm the most on fire I've ever been I'm not missing Jim I'm not missing videos I am actually you know I said day 15 video 15 but in the last 15 days I've probably made 30 videos okay and done a lot more stuff than that but it's but what I want to the main thing I want to tell you is that the pressure that's being applied to me what it makes me feel like is that I don't even feel like I'm actually working mustering up the courage to do stuff it's literally like a biological pressure applied to me that makes me go to the gym make a video so what I'm telling you is that once you apply it in the right way it doesn't even feel like you're actually doing so much of that external conflict fighting your inner demons you just do it it just happened all right it's the same way as life you probably just go to the bathroom every day are you probably to drink water every day or eat every day no matter what you will do those things there's this biological need to do that that's kind of how I feel right now with so much pressure of life to me from so many different directions I just feel the need to be at my hundred percent BMI potential and it's kind of addicting it's kind of excited so my message today for you is that get people around you who applied the pressure on you be in a position you know have yourself goals make yourself accountable be in a position where you are trying to live up to your 100% okay and because I'm doing this challenge as well follow along on this journey with me this is day 15 out of 30 days of videos that I'm doing in a row and instead and you know follow me a clever Kazi on my Instagram because you can follow behind the scenes exactly how I'm doing this thing stepbystep and plus you can actually tag me in your stories you know add clever Kazi and do hashtag 30 days coding challenge 30 days challenge and I'll repost that on my story as well but this way you will feel that you are also accountable for something right so that's another way for you to apply external taste accountability but you can do a coding challenge with me for the next 15 days or next 30 days whatever it is the commit to so okay with that said thank you so much for watching as always I love your face subscribe to the channel if you haven't already like the video really helps and really helps out the channel as always I love your face and I'll see you in the next video have an incredible video that I want you to go and see that I've put together okay this video is unbelievable this video will show you how I went from being a dumb broken Community College student to making hundred and four thousand dollars a year as a developer I forget what it mean for you if you made your first $1,000 from coding what would it mean for you if I reveal to you my stepbystep system that I use to go from being completely broke to then learning how to code in just a few months landing my contract as a freelancer with Python and being able to make twenty thousand dollars while I was a terrible Oakland Community College student and to then being able to live the lifestyle I want on my own terms and have the ability to have my own time freedom money and have the ability to make an impact on the world and at the same time travel with my friends be there for my family you know when we hit 300,000 subscribers go to all these events even now I'm in Miami 10x growth Han with Grant Cardone how does that lifestyle come about as a Python developer I was able to create that lifestyle for myself and in this video I want to show you that how you can do that for yourself to take the students like for example John Navarro who went from working with me from complete zero to becoming a senior data scientist or nazar Molly who landed a hundred and thirty thousand dollar contract and now he has moved to Germany with his family and living an amazing life or a foreign Sheikh who was able to make twenty thousand dollars after she took one of our programs but before we continue I do want to talk about the opportunity that exists in 2019 and moving forward as a Python developer so please go watch this video it's an epic video put together click on the link below in the description and it's gonna take you to it with that said thank you so much for watching as always I love your face and I'll see you in that other video so go click there I'll see you right there click there do it do it do it do it
