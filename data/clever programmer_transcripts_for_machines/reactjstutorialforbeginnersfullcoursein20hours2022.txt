react GS crash course 2021 are you excited about building projects like Tesla Clubhouse Disney and Linkedin these are some of the most powerful apps out there in the world and we will show you how to build these applications completely from scratch using react.js now react.js right now is the number one most popular JavaScript library it is also the number one demanded Library out there for jobs so if you want to get a job as a frontend developer learn this Library build projects like these and you're on your way to get your first job as a frontend developer now an average react Jazz developer makes over a hundred and ten thousand dollars with a lot of potential to get that up to 150 and 200 000. now if you are someone who wants to take this seriously and become a developer in 90 days we have a completely free training for you where you will learn the necessary skills it takes and the stepbystep process you need to take every single week to actually get that first job just click the link below pop in your name and email and we will send you the whole training but guys it would be amazing if you can smash that like button we worked really hard to make these videos really appreciate that so that this video can get out to a lot more people really helps us out with the YouTube algorithm now to thank you for smashing like button we got a baby kitten right here you see there you go all right continue watching the video and enjoy foreign this is Nas from cleverprogrammer and today I know you're already I know you're excited we are building the Tesla cologne check out this amazing Tesla clone here's what we got here it is a Tesla called webpage you guys know Teslas are amazing uh they're really amazing cars so what have we got we're going to use react GS right that's part one it's very Jazz to build this okay with all this happening we're going to do a few things to style all of this we're gonna use style components it's the one thing you need to understand right so style components are going to be used throughout here on top of that look at let's go ahead and take a look at some of the pages we got Model S page the model 3 page you know uh so forth if I go to for example this model 3 page right here if I scroll down oh look at this beautiful beautiful page that we can see now you can see how we have all these animations right now right when I scroll down we have this beautiful animation to kind of pop up well that's using something called react reveal react reveal which is a really really cool module that we're going to use in this one of course as well we have ourselves a nice sidebar right here okay and to make all this work of course in to save the data the car info data there will also be saved in where well we're in something called react Redux so you guys get the chance to kind of create your own react Redux component here as well right so look this is going to be one of the most amazing clones you will get to build um we should be able to build this in one take no problem whatsoever right so if you're ready let me know give it a thumbs up go ahead and smash that like button for us it honestly means the world to us it tells us that you are excited that you are you know that you like what we're doing and this allows us to do more of it as well of course right and this of course allows YouTube to get this out to more and more people so of course we can go ahead and teach more people at the same time and so forth all right all right other than that let's go ahead and get started right away who's ready who's ready who's ready I see all of you amazing people right there all right let's go ahead um so the first things first that we need to do let me go ahead and put this beautiful music kind of in the background while we're working let me see you make sure is how is everybody doing oh hello hello hello we have so many amazing people we have uh penguin hello hi we have pumped bhavik says beautiful I love it Nas what's up what's up how you doing good good good good let's go hello Diggity Adrian I like it too all right let's go ahead and get this party started to build something like this will of course require a few different things right we just start up first is the react Redux application right this is the code as you can see nothing crazy we have the home page the header page the section page this is our goal in terms of where we need to get to um but for now a few things let's go and open Finder right now right uh if you're on Windows of course it's gonna be for you it's going to be a different situation um just open up your what is it called my computer whatever it has to be and let's go ahead and create a new folder I'm going to open up a new folder inside where well inside pretty much something called a terminal hopefully you guys can have that it's at the terminal right there beautiful and I'm going to zoom in so you can see it much better okay all right and let's go ahead and do the following thing for this you of course need node.js right so hopefully you installed that if you have not installed that install node.js on your computer and everything will be good from there all right so we'll do npx create dash dash react Dash app will give them a react and name so let's go ahead and do 10 Tesla clone Tesla clone beautiful and we'll do dash dash template and Redux is the name of the template right right there hit enter there we go it's kind of compile it's going to do all Necessary Things it needs to do it's gonna work it's gonna go this until okay anyways I'm just you know passing time as it's kind of loading so as you can see it's creating the initial repository that you need right for for what well for basically for your application okay that's what it specifically needs somebody said hi my name is teslaco that's funny Happy hacking is what we currently have happy hacking beautiful it's exactly what we need to get to right that means our application has been complete not completed but it's installed all right uh once that you can go ahead and close this out no problem no problem and at this point let's go and go ahead and open up vs code I will do new window on my side I do not need this portion of this right here that portion goes somewhere else for me uh I could probably do it somewhere else let me go ahead I put this portion desktop too there we go all right beautiful all right so this is our views code let's open this up on the left hand side and put my testicle on the right hand side so it's a little bit better all right I like it as to file open file open beautiful go to GitHub and then go to Nas and then there's the Tesla code that we just opened up right so I will open up Tesla clone here okay beautiful all right so okay and let's see what we've got so far all right there's a Tesla car there you go beautiful um what do we have well to actually start this let's go right click this go ahead and open in the integrated terminal all right and what we will do is we'll do yarn what yarn start so we're going to use yarn this time because it's okay you can use both npm and yarn are both amazing so and yarn start oh that's going to start our application hope you guys can hear me all well yeah it's going to start our application uh this is not pretty cool this is actually live guys by the way this is I'm live I can see you I can see you right now in the comments if you say hi I say hi back to you as simple as that all right let's go ahead and do that the beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice okay let's see let's see let's see okay all right so this is our webpage that we have right now this is not the technical don't you worry okay uh this is just a starter application that react usually comes with right um so at this point uh what are we going to do all right we need to erase some of this stuff let's go ahead and go to app.js right here and let's go to the header blah blah blah and let's remove this stuff honestly we don't need any of this stuff right here sayonara baby done you're away all right now we have a white screen which is pretty good too right we've got ourselves the white screen all right hit enter all good let's go to some index.css some of this stuff we don't need as well so we can remove some of this stuff which is just unnecessary too okay all right beautiful and so here we go now at this point a few things that we need to do as well is we need to divide this into application into a few different pieces correct and what kind of pieces would you divide this into well let's think about this right if I will if I have something like this right here's we have we have this application this might be like the whole app right so this is the whole app after that what do we have well we have the header right we have the header which is this one right this header might be divided into a few different parts as well we've got the logo we might have ourselves the menu like maybe we call it like the left menu icon or the left menu bar and then we have the right menu right there right underneath that we have the actual content or which is this we will call like a section right and now this section has a few different things right let's think about it okay well the first job is like this text component so this contains Like the Model S the order online and stuff like that right so that's we'll call the text component okay then what do we have we have a button component right here okay it's a button component that will contain the buttons like custom order existing delivery and so forth and our last one is going to be this really fancy bouncing don't bouncing bouncing bouncing uh Arrow okay um and that's pretty much it and our goal is to repeat these components so forth and so forth as you kind of go forward and so forth I see right there see right so that's pretty much it and as a repeat uh you know there's nothing else to it um and of course after that we'll figure out how to create the other Pages like a detail page and so forth okay all right beautiful um so let's go ahead and get started all right beautiful so as we said the first we need to create is going to be the header component and let's go ahead and do that so I will do Source new folder and I will say components on that component components uh commandantos componentos componentials okay let's go do a new file and we'll say header.js okay all right and I'm going to use something called react Snippets as you can see right here we have something called es7 react snippet so hopefully you guys can install that as well on your side um right if you install those don't have them go ahead and click install I already have them installed but what they will help me to do is if I go to ahead of that GS check this out all I gotta do is type it the following rfce done hit enter right like this is pretty cool what do we have ourselves well we have ourselves a function component that's what we had so ourselves right here okay and if I say header here right here right and then I'm going to import the header into app.js so let's do that right now so we'll go ahead and do import what import header from from what well a few things components so we'll have to hit the components folder slash header voila beautiful all right and we'll use the header now like so okay save that and let's go and see our new beautiful what is it our beautiful header component which is just pretty much just a head of text um let's actually make it much better right so here's what we can do now at this point guys is let's go ahead and go to indus.css and a few things I want to do is to change right um let's go ahead and Target everything right now right so again nothing crazy so far let's go and Target everything and the first thing I want to change I want to change the font family all right to make it more robotic It also says Rubik Rubik's Cube whatever's gonna be all right that's gonna be the first one let's go and change the color of also of this specific what of the specific um code of this webpage so this will apply to everything pretty much right this color will apply to every every any type of text right as you want to keep it consistent I'll give it a margin of zero so that there's all these headings do not have all these crazy margins which I don't like I give it a padding of zero as well okay good all right awesome and we're going to use something called something called border size oh no box sizing border box now for those of you who don't know what this is it's basically when you say the width of something it's going to include the padding within that div it's a little bit confusing but basically uh this will allow us to better control the width of the actual dips that's what that will allow us to do box sizing will say border box border Dash box there we go so I know I have a hard time typing sometimes guys so you can see all right let's go and focus on the body now so the body and we'll give it a width of what width of a hundred percent right here okay good and honestly that's pretty much it okay with 100 that's all I need so far okay good uh let's go back to our this okay you see our header now looks a little bit more different which is completely okay after the header what do we saving to create we need to create the actual home home page right so we have the home page and we have the header okay um let's create the home page now and components do a new file and we'll do home.js right all right and we'll do rfce again I love this one rfce and you got yourself a seat I don't know whatever all right uh same thing this one let's go ahead and do home okay we'll import inside app.js right here and so forth home Dash like this okay import it right here so import ante import home from what components componentos componentos component National home okay don't judge me all right good let's see what we got so far and we got ourselves a home components now I'm going to come with the header one for now just temporarily because I'm going to focus only on the home component right now okay and again I just want to make sure this is clear if you cannot follow along don't worry about it you know this is you know this will be available after you know the this is done so don't worry about if you cannot follow along just go ahead and review it again all right beautiful so the home component is there which I really really like um now let's focus on a few different things within the home component uh and let's go to home.js now for the styling we're going to use local style components and we need to install them first so go to your terminal let's go ahead and click Plus on it and we'll do yarn add and we'll do styled Dash style Dash components style Dash compo components there we go nope yarn oh yeah yeah but yarn add yarn there we go okay so it's going to go ahead and add the yard all right save that that's all good and we will now import import styled from what okay imports from styled Dash components good save that all right now for this component the first time we're going to create is something called the container component so we'll do is container no not container container okie dokie okie dokie container there we go container so that's going to be our first component that we'll do and with the container component let's go ahead is equal to style so this is basically will give us allow us to style the specific div right that's the power of style component instead of doing it inside CSS we do inside JavaScript and so it just makes things a lot easier for us right and now we'll do a height height of what 100 VH 100 VH good how are you guys doing by the way all doing good is everybody doing good everybody's still kind of on track with me if you guys are let me know let me know let me know let me see everybody's doing amazing somebody uh somebody says I like how Nas uses the different boxes to show us the different uh yeah different things that's amazing awesome thank you thank you I appreciate you guys all right so a height of 100 VH so let's go ahead and save that and let's look at what we have so far nothing okay it's kapusta it's pretty much nothing right now okay again what we're making right now is the what well we're making the component that's going to be this component right here so it's this whole component right which is this yellow component that's what we're working on right now right this whole yellow component that's the home.js okay um and within this home.js let's think about kind of well how are we going to create all these sections right we have this one section another one section another section and you can see the style of them was just pretty much the same you see they're pretty much the same right there so logically speaking what if you just create another carbonical section and that will allow us to reuse it every single time so if I right click on it let's do a new file and I say section section yes okay good yes and we'll do rfce here too and enter okay section is what we need to type in go to 100.js and let's import our first section so it's an import section from what from from what well because our current home.js inside the components folder we don't need anything else besides that right um we don't ask anything else besides that instead what we need is is just simply dot slash section like this right because we're already in the components folder okay let's go ahead and type in section to actually use it okay good beautiful all right awesome and then let's see what we've got so far nothing well we've got this section which is good all right in this section that GS now I promise now this is where the magic happens okay the magic happens now here all right okay so if we go to our section.js a few things that we need to really consider okay just how we consider this what do we say let's go ahead and create this text component first uh that's the first one but before even doing that I'm going to create a wrap so here's what I'll do I'm gonna create a wrap here right there wrap and that's going to be component we'll just call the wrap we can call the container whatever has to be and so forth all right let's import style components so import I'm going to use here we go import ante import installed styled from what from style Dash components okay good all right that's so good and then uh let's go ahead and create the wrap so const wrap is equal to what styled dot div okay start.dev now this is where again our fancy styled div component you know is gonna happen well they were almost at 496 likes if you can get us to 500 let's do that guys 500 likes they'll be amazing and I just want to also let you know guys by the way uh one really important thing down below what's gonna happen right now is we are we have a fulltime Master bootcamp that we've launched a while ago and we have a new class starting in June and so there's a limited spots to go ahead and join and so we have a limited availability for new students to join um full stack Mastery we have a lot of students join fulltime Mastery in the previous classes and it's been amazing so many positive results so many people getting jobs and so many people just getting results in general if yourself are interested in actually becoming a developer and you want something that will push you give you kind of a kind ability to give you some guidance give a give you proper guidance a proper road map like a fullon road map for six seven eight months right but you will stick with us the whole time you get mentored by Me by Kazi and the whole team here at clever programmer right like I said full story Master bootcamp is what we've created to help you do that um if you're interested go ahead we have a seat reservation down below to reserve your seat all it is is just a seat reservation and then we figure out all the financing leader this tells us you're serious and that's pretty pretty much it right like I said link is down below right but the most important part I just want to let you know not everybody gets in some people get denied unfortunately because you know you might not have either good energy or you may you might not be positive or you might just be you know not might not be a good fit so we look at a lot of different things for people to be able to join something like this it's a very much it's a very serious thing that we we um of course we take we take care take this very seriously of course so if you're interested come in there with good energy right put down a your sea reservation link down below and after that we'll get a call and then we'll figure out how to actually get you into the boot camp okay awesome that's pretty much it let's go ahead and continue on beautiful all right uh uh section okay what's gonna happen in this section uh the wrap is nothing nothing crazy the rep is going to be width of a hundred percent width of 100 V we'll call it VW VW it's like the car VW you know but that was my first car actually 100 VW which is the full view width right that's the full view width that's what it means okay then we'll give it a height as well and we'll give it a height of what of 100 VH right here 100 VH so 100 vertical height pretty much is what it says okay all right let's give the background color background of like orange just so you can see exactly what we are working with all right there we go right so this is all working right right the whole view with the whole view height okay all right um at this point let's go ahead and give it a background image and the background image should be this one right here now where you get this background image again what's going to happen is we have a Google drive folder with all the images down below right so if you all you have to do is just simply open this on this one up you open the Google drive folder the images folder and you put it inside your public folder like so so right now I have no images folder of course I can actually open it open up the Google drive folder inside my application let me go ahead and take a look at it where I can do that let me see where do I have it one second I think I have right here actually I have the images folder right here open and find wherever you'll find her there we go so I have my images folded right here right so this is the one that that you guys will get um if you go ahead and download the Google drive folder just go ahead and go description below download it from there and you'll be all good and then all you need to do is need to unzip it of course and then once you've got that just grab that and then drag it into the public folder right like like so just drag it in done right and now it's all in here right this is a lot of different stuff for you um you know between the model S the model 3 all these different images that you need to use okay so if you got that let me know down in the comments and then we'll make sure to take care of you okay beautiful all right uh let's continue on okay all right so when we do the background image well we have a background images called models.jpg so hopefully everybody was able to get those images like I said link is down in description below all right uh background image so far nothing's showing up which is completely fine I was going to remove this background noise I don't want that so hideous there we go um the image is actually there we just don't see it because we need to send out a vertically so we need to Center the actual background image and to do that what I like to say something like background Dash size is equal to cover not covered but covered boom you see now all of a sudden this becomes a very different image right there see okay now let's do at that point let's go inside this image the background image and to do that we'll do background um position so background background Dash position and we'll give it a center boom voila center right I'm acquisition back you know I I did this one back go round position there we go see now this car is pushed in the center which is exactly what we want to do then let's go ahead and make sure it does not repeat itself so we'll do background repeat now repeat so we'll do back round Dash repeat I will say no sorry about that repeat there we go now repeat but no repeat no right there no repeat all right so I'm not just going to change this point right if we still have ourselves everything we need to have and that's pretty pretty much it okay okay that's what I want you to focus on for now now let's go ahead and add in the text component stuff okay what we need to create of course is not going to be this text component which is right here and we're going to call something called like item text so item text okay and inside this item text a few things we need to go ahead and create is of course if we look at our Tesla clone what do we have we have a header and we have like a sub header and to make that happen here's what we'll do we'll do an H1 tag each one and this H1 will have the title for now let's just say the title will be Model S this is the one the title so model has for now this is temporary data placeholder data okay Model S okay beautiful and then uh we'll do another one that's going to be what the P tag P tag let's go ahead and remove that right the P tag and this one's gonna have order online for touches delivery right there boom it and I'll be honest with you it actually is touches delivery when I ordered the Tesla it's like it literally it was like Christmas morning I woke up in the morning and the car was there on my driveway it was pretty insane I will say like they bring it into you and you you don't have to do nothing you just sign and you sign in on your on your Tesla account and then you just say okay take delivery it's pretty cool I will say Okay order online for tattoos delivery all right and then once we got that let's go ahead and save this of course and we need to create the item text component here so we'll say const item text is equal to what styled right here styled dot div okay good all right and with this one uh what do we need to need to do nothing nothing too crazy we're going to give it some padding top so you can see you already have it here it's pretty good it's all we need so we'll do padding top Dash top and that will be 15 VH 15 VH V hush that's pretty funny okay and then we'll do text line Center because you know just to align the center technically already is centered but it's okay okay that's not Center there we go you see now Model S is right here right that part is done let's look at our next part that we need to figure out which is going to be the what that's going to be now the buttons right so that's going to be these buttons right here okay button group okay uh all right let's go ahead and create that component we'll create the component that will actually wrap these buttons right so uh the buttons that we need to go ahead and wrap are these buttons right here right so this is going to be the button group that we're going to create right now okay called the button group right button button sorry my horrible handwriting but I'm trying my best button group okay all right so say button button well I'd like to say button in Korean means bread you know button group and then there'll be a few bundles that we need to create inside here the one is going to be left button and then it's going to be a right button as well so we'll say left button button you like my accent and then the right button right button okay good and then of course all these buttons will have a few different uh there'll be one it's gonna be custom order so let's go ahead and do the custom order one so this could be custom order no I'm not I know what that was honestly custom order save that and the last one is going to be existing inventory existing existing inventory inventory inventory existing inventory that's the one that we're looking at okay beautiful all right existing inventory and let's see what we have so far um well that we need to create the actual components groups of course so we'll do that right now all right so we'll do the what we'll do const button group is equal to styled dot div uh that there for now okay uh nothing crazy so far let's go ahead and create the button the actual that button so we'll do const left button is equal to also style.div okay boom and now for the right button the right button we're going to now use the left button as a reference so what does that mean if I say right button put on is equal to as I've say style that divs can be styled button left button you see this love button why because this allows us to inherit all the CSS of the left button that's pretty much the reason okay now put the button group what are we going to do with the button group uh nothing too crazy so far um let's go ahead and actually focus on the left buttons that's what I want us to focus on right now specifically okay okay so left button all right um okay let's do the following let's see what happens here nothing oh we have some stuff we have custom order and stuff with that okay that's fine all right um for this specific section well here's we'll do we'll do background color of this left button is the following right background color is this color right here okay good that's the background color all right let's remove this stuff right here on this side that's the background color and then what do we need to do is let's do a height of 40 pixels height height of what 40 pixels okay and then we'll give it a width of 206 pixels width of 200 256 pixels okay good all right save that okay show is all good and let's see what we have so far and so far like it's just it's nasty right so but it's okay don't worry about it right and then what we'll do is we'll give it a color so color of white so white okay now yeah white so that's gonna be the text color so you can see now we have the text color right here that's a white text color okay now these are two divs and let's go ahead and Center them in the center right so the mini will do display Flex on them Flex it always likes it ah display facts and then we'll do what uh we'll do Justified content to Center horizontally right horizontally means Justified content Center so we'll do justify let's go ahead and do it this way justify content that's gonna be Center good all right and then we'll do online item Center as well all right items Center as well okay good okay now what do we have so far right justify content online items Center okay um now these are two buttons right so let's go ahead now to make them more look like buttons let's go ahead and add a border radius so we'll do what border Dash radius right and that was going to be what let's go give it a 100 pixels oh would you look at that now we have something now we like to look at right uh it's going to get an opacity and it's going to be 0.85 right okay so now we have an opacity that just kind of stays there which is pretty pretty cool okay all right then the next one is going to be what well uh let's do text transform make sure it's all up okay so text transform all uppercase okay nice that looks sick that looks amazing let's give the smaller font size as well so font Dash size it's gonna be watched that's pretty much just 12 pixels something's nothing crazy yeah there you go good good I like it I like it all right so that's that's the font size and then what um we need to stack that from left to right that's what we need to figure out how to do right how do you stack them from left to right that's the big question right so to do that uh well a few things we need to go the button group and say display Flex on this one boom boom right there you see right away we know what right away it Stacks from left to right that's what this display Flex allows allows us to do okay now how do we put this custom order this is that's the inventory kind of from more at the bottom that's the question I want us to ask right well this happens a few ways well because if we go to the wrap right the wrap controls what let me go ahead and remove this portion now at this point the wrap controls what controls this whole thing right this whole thing right this whole thing right and if I do display Flex on it I can actually push these away so that this goes all the way to the bottom right that's what my goal is right so on the wrap I'm going to say display Flex display I will say the flex Flex it Flex it Flex it Flex it don't forget it display Flex beautiful and then at that point what's going to happen is we'll do what Flex Direction column right so basic column means we're going to put it from top to bottom that's what that means okay nice Direction column there we go see now it's back to normal again now to actually fully make it work all I gotta do and actually push this to the bottom well I do something like um Justified content space between so justify content right and then space Dash between boom oh would you look at that it's like all the way over there you guys see that right there that is beautiful all right let's go ahead and do a line item Center to align it horizontally so interesting part is you need to know is justify content usually does alignment for horizontal section right so if you want to align something horizontally right that's what that's the content is for and usually align items is going to be a vertical alignment okay but when you switch the flex Direction it switches it flips now justify content is going to be for is going to be for this one is going to be for vertical alignment vertical and then align items now if I do center right here that's going to be for horizontal alignment whole horizontal you see what I mean so it flips when you do five Direction column you can see now the custom order they're actually they are actually properly aligned right now okay beautiful uh but I want us to focus on now is gonna be the the button group let's go ahead and take this button Google let's give it a margin bottom margin bottom margin bottom off uh about 30 pixels so it's kind of it's a little bit better now there too okay so I like that a lot better now right and what else do we have let's for these specific buttons let's give them what let's give them a cursor pointer as well so left button it's gonna be cursor cursor pointer okay save that all right so now there I can let me see Cur sir cursor okay save that I see I can it now exist as a cursor as well all right now a few things open passage is 0.5 that's all good opacity is good a few things I want to focus on um let's add this specific portion remember this one this this like well that is just simply an arrow that's all it is nothing too crazy um so to do that what we'll do is we'll create something called a down arrow as oh that's just an image right so here's we'll do we'll create it outside the button group and we'll say the following we'll say down Arrow like so source is equal to what source is going to be equal to images down here let's face G so we have to inside the images folder again if you want the link to it down below okay boom down arrow okay down arrow images down here right here is that defined again it's going to create that let's create that I need to create to create so we'll do here we'll do what const down arrow down arrow okay is equal to what is equal to styled dot image right there okay on this image a few things we need to go and create you'll do margin top margin Dash Dash margin Dash top that's going to be 20 pixels to give some spacing right and then I will give the height so a height oh height of what 40 pixels okay nice so it says styled style styled styled there we go all right so the arrow is now there the custom order is there so it's not the best solution as we need right so um don't worry we'll fix that in a second here okay so you can see what do we have now here's the issue this is now here and this is now here bad right because why because when we did justify content we did space between meaning it's going to create as much space in between every single component here right that's what space in between means right but how do we fix it well very simple by actually making this making this one component right right so for example if I say generous buttons if I give like this buttons okay check this out buttons okay boom what's gonna happen now what do you think oh new component correct yes yes yes yes that's going to create new components so called buttons we'll say const of buttons but is equal to style that div save that right there see you see what just happened right see this just became like this right see but they're beautiful right it's exactly what we need what we need for this for this right there right there see beautiful and let's go back to now our page application now um how did that happen well because this whole thing became one component that's what happened right this whole thing became one component and so this just pushed it down like this right all right uh up next let's go ahead and create a little margin between every single button so if I go to my left button I will do margin what I will go ahead and do the following which is margin I think we'll give it 20 pixels I think it's pretty good um either that or they only just maybe eight pixels see margin margin 8 pixels like this okay much better much better now I would like for this thing to hop so uh we're gonna make it hot how uh well we're going to create an animation we're going to create animation okay uh to do to make that happen here's animation it's going to be animation called animate down and if I go to my down arrow in here but right there check this out so right now nothing's happening because we have not created animation you see so it's just kind of like it's like meh right it's meh right now but don't you worry we got you okay don't you worry we got you um what I'm gonna do now at this point is very simple is I will go to innis.css right here and I'm going to create the animation myself right this is using keyframes right using keyframes is what it's going to do and I'm just going to copy and paste it here because I'm going to type it out all for you right and what these are is very simple here's what happened imagine like for example that you know uh so keyframes are like percentages of like uh of the actual um or the actual text or the deal for example right so at zero twenty percent you know nothing now at 40 we're going to translate translate basically five pixels up you see right there you see then at 60 I'm going to translate three pixels up now at 50 we're going to translate to zero so that's what creates this up and down feeling so if I save this right now boom see that's what creates this upside down up up and down filling to do you see right that's okay the upper up and down kind of like feeling type and so forth right um this also creates a little bit of an issue with overflow as you can see right here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give overflow hidden on this specific down arrow right here so this down arrow you see how it creates overflow well we can do fix that by just going a section right and I'm going to say overflow hidden overflow overflow X overflow Dash X is going to be hidden boom okay overflow overflow axis hidden let's see down arrow is that let's go ahead maybe fix it using what what can we use fix it using what if I maybe I remove this portion let's go and remove this okay I kind of like that I don't want that margin top it kind of pushes way too much all right so that's good overflow x hidden uh if I go to body let's go to index.css oh okay I need to also do overflow overflow Dash X it's gonna be hidden boom boom see to make sure we don't have the horizontal scroll bar that was there which would look hideous which I don't like all right so there you go so we got now our translation which is really good okay so we have a translation what's the next step we are going to work on and that's going to be let me see what you guys are saying something is awesome that's awesome sweet uh SCS is the way to go yes we'll actually go into scss at some point as well on this channel too uh are you building that using react yes I am change my Butters are not all the way down there what you put but yeah so now they're all down sweet now it's all good now it's all good now it's all good okay sweet all right everybody still with me everybody's still with me yeah beautiful of course you are because you guys are amazing that's all I can say to you all right and again guys let's go and hit that like button smash that like button to help us out with the YouTube algorithm that's it that really we're at 673 likes let's get to 800 that'll be great all right um all right so we got that portion look at this let's go and change up this button now the existing delivery button because it actually is different here um pretty simple because we go to our section.js here's our button all we gotta do is just change the button color so the right button instead of doing here nothing the right button will be the following the right button will be back on color of white background doesn't mean white boom oh let's go I mean we're gonna give the opacity to opacity right 0.65.65 there we go okay and that will give the color of the text it's gonna be more of a darker side colors will be black there we go nice you see there you go now we got these two buttons and they look pretty good look at that look at that that's it that's all we just did we just did everything we need to do look at this huh how cool is that huh awesome all right so we're almost there now if you check this out all we gotta do now this one is just replicate the same situation right so if I go ahead and go to sections now apologize if I copy this section and paste everywhere all right if I paste this section check this out what's going to happen we have more section of the same sections there you go that's it now I want us to really figure out the one is like for example if I go small you see how the custom order just kind of like goes outside the boundary we can fix that too actually we can fix that very easily using like media queries right so so basically what we can do is on uh let me go ahead and take a look at it go to section here you see button this button group right here this button group is it's actually a flash Direction row but if I would go ahead on the media which is what I can do I can do media width like this so on the max with basically four four like small uh Max width of 768 pixels those are like small um screens I do flash actually column and so they go into column basically meaning from top to bottom like this all right so to this side you see that just happened look at there you see right and how this happened because when the width becomes 768 pixels you see it applies this right here CSS flag Direction column that's what allows us to do this and that's it there's nothing crazier than that honestly all right so now here's the question now um how do we go ahead and make these Model S stuff and make have all this stuff working differently right because what we have right now is just open the list and of course we have model y by the way this is the one oh this is actually the one I have by the way such a beautiful card look at this oh so good Ah that's such a good car I love it the Special is in this blue color it's so good wouldn't you guys agree with me like in a blue color like that's my favorite color by the way yeah uh anyways uh let's go ahead and do the following we have all these sections right and they're all the same so the question is like how do we make them different right how do we make them different so they're all different I guess I can say um well we could just pass in something called props right and what are props props are like parameters for a function that's pretty much all it is it's a parameter for a function right so if we currently have the model S right and we have one section we can reuse this just change the title here so here's what I'll do I'll go to home or let's go I'll go to home here and for the section here look we'll pass in a few parameters it's just kind of like you're passing parameters for a function that's pretty much it inside here I will pass in two for three parameters so let's go ahead and do title okay not like this title is equal to what and this is going to be Model S right and then the description is all gonna be well pretty much you know delivery so the screen is going to be ordered online the description right here let me go ahead and make this beggar for you order online for touches the description after that let's go ahead and do what let's do background image background image that's with the model S1 then we'll do the left button text right we have a left button that's gonna be the custom order and then the right button text is going to be existing inventory there you go okay let's go ahead and comment this portion of four temporarily okay because I want to show you how we're going to do this so this gets passed into props if I go into the section itself let's go hang on the section itself okay and I have props here they're basically like parameters if I just click install login cancel the log prompts don't visit I'm gonna show you this for a second here so look props right clicked inspect element on this one and I will show it to you within the console right here good all it is is props just an object like that's all pretty much is and look at this all this stuff has been passed in right the background image the description the title and so forth and so now all I do is something like for example I'll do this under the following what I do I do props props that What DOT title all right I save that Raza title look at that look at that model S right here see that title like it was replaced by the actual title within the actual what the actual component right that's all we pretty much had to do okay now we can't even be smart about this by doing the following we can unpack this using something like this so I can do it like this title boom right there how cool is that okay okay how cool is that check this out so title is right there and I can replace this with title and all this done is this basically just unpacks this whole object this whole object has key and no key like background image and so forth but this right here is called unpacking and we're unpacking the object to include to actually just get the get the actual Keys that's that's all pretty much does all right so let's say let's go ahead and stop this for now good all right so we have that next one that we're going to unpack is which one that's a description good description which is which one comma description and we can use that here now boom boom description boom right there awesome you see again shows up right here okay beautiful just just the way we like it okay next step is going to be what the actual left button text so this is this one left button text right here that button text is going to be this one and then right there and then the right button text is going to be right here right button text so we'll use that as a prop as well okay right by text of course we do unpack them as well so we'll do what left button text copy that left button text right here comma right button text command C command V all right so we have unpacked all of these items inside here so if we save that right you can see you know still and nothing really changes but here's what we can change if I go to home and if I uncomment some of this stuff okay now I have three different sections what I can do is just change the actual data so here's what I can do here inside this one I can give it the following here's my data here boom this one is title model.p what model y p y model dot y That's the uh they asked the other one description order online background images now model Y image and then left button text custom order and same thing here so if I save this oh look at that you see model y has changed now one thing has not changed is the actual image and we'll focus that we'll we'll fix that in a second here next one let's do model three okay let's do model 3 now same thing you see so all we do is we're showing the props we're just passing different props and we're using the same HTML that's the coolest part about react.js good boom there we go save that let's see model three now again image does not change we'll change that in a little bit okay next one model X let's do the model X1 Model X all right we'll do the following there so Model X okay Papa there we go okay model X all right same thing look at this model X you see it all just kind of works you know automatically no problem whatsoever now the one big thing we need to figure out is okay well how come the images are not showing well in the section because the image is the same right the image is which image it's uh it's this image right here that's a background image right um to fix that it's pretty simple actually let's go ahead and go to the home.js and inside actually let's go to section.js my bad section and we need to pass in the actual background image you see we pass on this background image let's go ahead and copy this background image go to section and we'll go ahead and unpack this right here comma unpack it right here unpack it so now we have it you know we can actually have it inside our component and we need to use it somehow actually okay how do we use it well we use it by actually passing in um well passing an actual component or a prop into a style component because you can do that too serious audio BG background image background emit background image and we'll say what equal boom right BG image they could have background image that's all and now all we do is inside what is inside our actual what our actual BG image will wrap see how we have the wrap here basically instead of doing this here's what we'll do in this case do like this we'll say background image back on this image okay let me just do it properly so you guys can have it so right here background image okay and instead of doing like this I'll do like this okay props so we can actually get props inside style components we'll do props okay and after props what are we gonna say check this out okay we'll give a URL here so say URL that I actually will do like this we'll say URL and we'll be uh Dash images Dash Dash the actual prop that we just passed in Dash what that's what huh boom look at this look at this one that's pretty cool I will do props Dot perhaps.what WG image right there after BG image WG image okay so let's see what happens now so okay we had this images URL and that has images inside of that okay good okay let's see let's see let's see and then we of course I think I think we need to close it as well let me go ahead and make sure it's all good so that's all good that must be all good URL is right here that's the URL icon image yeah I don't think that's an issue all right let's go and say this background image okay cool now you're ready let's see if it actually changes anything so what's gonna happen here we pass in the background image here voila okay then we what happens then is that gets passed into the rap style component right there see VG image then that gets back to the prop so we have we get props from the actual style component now we have props and we set the background image using the prop so Props URL images browser BG image that's it save it oh let's go look at this look at this guys model 3 Model X how cool is that right we just pass in the prompts and now we have all of these different components that are there for us to use look at this is that that is pretty insane I will say so hmm what do you guys think so far what do you guys think so far let me see what are you guys thinking oh everything is working everything is working almost at 800 likes let's go let's get to a thousand guys you guys are amazing you guys are amazing 800 like let's go so again we're passing in props at this point and here's what bill look at this we build ourselves a full on Tesla I mean we haven't built a Tesla clone just yet fully but it's getting there it's getting there it's pretty cool all right let's finish up the actual um sections so I will go to here and I will do the following so let's go ahead and go to home.js and we have a few more sessions we need to finish up right next one is going to be the solar panels section so I'll do a section all right it's a solar panel section okay and I have it right here for you guys so you can just copy this on yourself put them right there okay all right title lowest cost solar panels description money back guarantee background image is this one order now this done let's see it now let's see it oh it's so good it's so good guys it's just so good so good okay next one solar for new roofs so that's another one we're gonna also also create right now so here's another section we're going to create you see how easy this stuff is is so easy to create now right because all we're doing is just we're using the same component but but with different uh parameters what is now oh so good oh my God oh my God it's so good guys I don't know I just love these images I love these images though I can tell you next one last one is going to be the accessory section which is going to be this section right here last section at the accessories so feel free to cover this on your own by yourself as well title accessory description is nothing a lap button is nothing and then right by the text we don't have any of that as well let's go ahead and remove that instructor nice let's go ahead and see okay now here's one issue that we found right so here's an issue we have the shop now button right shut now button and then because we only have one button here this created one issue well the fact that this channel button is on the center which of course is bad so how do we fix that pretty simple if I now go to my section.js basically here's what I'll say if the right button exists only then will I go ahead and showcase it so here's what I'll do to this out I will say right button right button text okay then I will go ahead and do the following and then only then will I do this boom boom boom boom boom boom right there that's all save it look at this you see shop now button is exactly the middle because why before the right button was always there just it had their empty right button text but now now what happened is we just said hey if the right button text exists only then do you show the right button the actual right button but if it doesn't does not exist forget about it don't even show it and the last button is going to be the only one that's left and that's pretty much it okay oh yes look at this is so good oh my God you guys this is amazing oh oh yes yes okay okay next portion we're going to work on is the header are you ready with me yes or no yes yes yes hey hey all right let's see who's here still with us let me see let me see

be able to reserve your seat so if you are someone who's really interested in becoming a developer and you really you are maybe you're stuck in tutorial hell maybe you were just stuck and just you really want to become developer or you've never got the chance to become a developer and you really need that proper guidance fulltime Mastery is something we created a while ago to go ahead and get that for you right you have ankh for example who just got his first job making seventy thousand dollars we have for example Martin recently you know who got his first job making fifty six thousand dollars right it's crazy right and they didn't finish the bootcamp now I mean not they're still in the boot camp and we have two more people who currently have reacts internships are in the boot camp as well you know another one my name Liz she got her first freelancing client making 15 hours pretty insane right what you can do we focus on a foundation we focus on building up your developer skills and just give you the proper knowledge and give me the proper guidance basically the whole way through you get taught by me and then five other coaches it's pretty insane if you're interested in doing something like this like I said it's a very serious matter you have to be dedicated with a minimum of 20 hours a week 20 hours of work per week if you're not ready for that don't even bother if you're

closing actually in the next few days so if I just said go ahead and click down below and we'll be all good all right awesome guys all right let's continue on all right there we go so what do we got we've got this now I want us to focus on a v header that's what I want us to focus on now at this point all right uh let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and in our this this whole git do ad and we'll say sections sections for the Tesla that's pretty funny for the Tesla okay save that beautiful all right section of the Tesla oh it's good next up um a few different things huh what are we gonna say what are we gonna do we're gonna do head of the GS here's what we're working on now let's go ahead and put the header inside here right go let's go let's go the head is pretty big actually and it will require some a good amount of work guys okay we're quite a good amount of work oh 800 likes that is pretty pretty awesome pretty awesome all right header let's go ahead and import stock components so import styled from style components style Dash component there we go all right sweet sweet sweet good let's go ahead and do the following we'll do create a what create a container here like we always like to do container right there all right so create a container here as well all right let's go ahead and create this idea so import styled up no no const container oops is equal to what style dot What DOT div there we go that's going to be the container okay and now for this container a few different things and this container will have the first thing it will have is of course let's think about it what does it have initially well a few different things let me go ahead and show this to you well we'll have the header and so when you what we have the kind of like the um we have the logo that's part one and we have the menu That's part two and we have the right menu That's part three okay that's part three so with vitamin into three parts let's do uh first let's go ahead and do the logo okay I'll create an etad right because the logo will have will have a link and we'll give it a an image right here look at this out image right here this is the image their image it's only so image source images logo.svg that's it save that let's see does it show up somewhere uh not really why because in the Honda JS actually inside the app.js we're not importing this there we go let's go ahead and uncomment the hair.gs so we can actually use it beautiful hey you guys have the toaster logo look at that it's a beauty it's such a bad yes oh something happened that's really interesting I don't want that okay header nice all right let's go ahead and click on the menu so we'll do menu menu okay sweet so that's the menu okay menu is not defined because we're going to create this right now so as a const menu is equal to what styled dot div customer your style dot okay also nothing crazy here let's go ahead and give some data or some styling for the actual container the actual header so the header will have a few things number one let's give them in height main height of what of 60 pixels there we go okay 60 pixels okay good that's the main height right there see so it's a little bit bigger now that's good and you see it's white but we actually kind of want to be on the one position fixed so we actually want to be a in you know actually have fixed positioning and so to do that here's what we'll do position fixed right position fix means what means that it will just be here right here you see it's always there on the top no matter what it is no matter what no matter where you are okay next um but it's following the display Flags so display Flex to align a vertical here to align them vertically Center so this play display Flex right here Flex okay good all right next up we'll do online items Center oh I don't want God ah see the Tesla centered okay good let's go ahead and give some padding so we'll say padding 0 20 pixels done oh okay good beautiful all right all right so now look at that it's pretty pretty much there look at that the Tesla clone okay all right so that's all good uh the next thing we need to work on is going to be the what the menu the menu has a few different things um what does it have well we've got ourselves what Model S model 3 Model X model y that's what it has okay that's what it's got to make that happen let's go ahead and do this okay in the menu let's give it a P tag ptech and inside that that will be an ATAC ref is equal to currently nothing nada okay boom okay good and so that has the following that has let's go ahead and say for example like Model S Model S for now okay that's the model that's the thing that's the P tag that we're going to use all right all right let's go ahead command C command V command so though might be what model X there's going to be model what is it what are the models here what is it the model S model three model three who's excited for The Roaster by the way that's gonna be really cool Model X I'm really excited for the Roadster that's going to be a crazy car if model Y is a crazy car model S is a crazy car I mean all of them are pretty much crazy I just can't imagine what the rose is going to be all right okay good awesome sweet so that's pretty awesome all right let's see what happens now okay there we go okay um so what happens here is you can see we have the a tag which kind of makes it you know has underline looking very much easily fix that by going inside the index.css boom let's keep the a tank so let's target all a tag ATech and we'll do text transformation or text transform none what does that mean oh text equation not so text decoration because by default it's underlined where is it right here that's the default one but instead we'll just say what none so if I save that see it's gone nice beautiful all right next one is in the menu you see how they're kind of like one on one one on top of each other we can fix that also by using display Flex let's go to menu okay and in the menu all we gotta do is the following it's just a split flexion display Flex display Flex it that's how we do it and we'll do online items um no no we'll do display Flex which let's go ahead and save that nice beautiful we will do a line item Center good beautiful that's amazing okay nice nice nice lineup Center that centers it let's go ahead and also give it maybe some spacing I would say so as well uh and to do that let's go ahead and Target the actual uh uh let's see uh P within this here so I'll do what font weight I will do what can I do it here let's do find weight is going to be 600 okay good nice beautiful and we'll do a text decoration text decoration correlation that's going to be uppercase boom that now workout types decoration text transform actually text Transformer bet transform there we go Model S models three beautiful nice and then let's go ahead and give some padding so for every single Pita I will give a padding so padding padding is going to be zero 10 pixels zero this in this case means top and bottom so basically top about a zero left and right is 10 pixels that's what that means oh my Daisy right there see oh let's also do flags for app Flex um rap let's do no rap all right to make sure there's not wrapped because I like the fact that it's wrapping like you know and so forth um I think it's just no rap like this I feel like that ah Maybe I'm Wrong anyways so here's what we got so far which is pretty good all right um a few different things I want us to focus on as well what we're going to do is we're going to make this menu basically a full width so Flex one so but given a flex one we're giving a full kind of weight Flex one and then if I say something like this for example if I say just the content Center check this out justify content boom no Justified content what happens here no nothing uh justify content align item Center let me see here container display Flex let me make sure it's all good why is it not doing so justify content Center that's one why is it not because here's the goal I wanted to also fully be the full width here so if I do inspect element let's see what happens Happening Here Right Now okay we have this all it's actually not the full width it's unfortunate it's actually because this is not the forward oh so you see this right here this is why inspectile is so important sometimes guys you see the full header is not the full width of the actual page now to make that happen it's pretty easy actually check this one out check this one out so to make that happen all we have to do is the following um is we give it right here so this container you see this container the header is I do the following I say top zero right that will stick it to the to the zero to the top okay that's love zero will stick it to the left okay now right zero it will stick it to the right meaning it will expand you see right there it says what happened it will expand the header with the full width after just happened you see that right there the header is the full width how cool is that right how cool is that so that's what just happened so now we have these specific models okay great the last the next thing you need to work on is going to be what well uh that's gonna be uh this shop Tesla account let's go ahead and make that one happen too so that's pretty easy as well and again some of this stuff is also going to be like we'll change it up later on to make sure it's actually like you know the menu is right so now we'll do the right menu all right menu right menu okay and inside the right menu there'll be a few different things we'll have first it will have a schref is equal to what I'm gonna go ahead and actually um I think this shouldn't be P I think we should remove this stuff I think there should be just a tags honestly that's something you hear same thing with this boom remove this just so we have an attack there's no reason to have all these P tags so it just will consistent throughout the whole thing okay and you can use command D to make sure it's all consistent okay so a schref and then it's gonna be in the same course and this will be a shop okay okay next one's gonna be a schref a Shroff is going to be equal to what is equal to href is equal to which one which is actually Tesla account so let's go ahead and do that we'll be uh Tesla account good good good and the last thing we need to do is we need an icon that's like a burger icon right here so we'll do that in a second here but first i'm going to focus on the right menu That's What I want to focus on for a second here okay so let's do right menu so save that of course we don't that does not not defined right now so that's not a problem whatsoever so we'll do menus this menu okay so we'll do a tag here instead of P make sure you're targeting a tag now at this point you see okay good all right let's go ahead and do const right menu is equal to what style dot div that's all it is okay um let's see here right menu is not defined yes it is you just need to refresh it there we go all right same thing we can do also the same thing on this one and also Target the actual individual what the individual a tags using something like this boom you see save it hey let's go beautiful all right so that's that's pretty good I kind of like that so let's find ways for 100 text transform uppercase on the right menu padding let's go the only thing I will remove probably is going to be like the the padding and I'll set up to do margin margin right 10 pixels so now the shop that's a kind of more closer that's something I'll do at this point and then let's go ahead and remove this don't need this okay good I like that um the only thing it's pretty much we need to do is let's see let's see let's see it's going to be that the little uh hamburger menu that's what it's called so if I go to my Tesla account you see there's a hamburger menu we can fix that so we can actually make that work it's pretty cool check this one out to make this one work it's it kind of works like this um we're gonna use material UI so material UI icons let's go install that one let's go to here beautiful all right and here's I'm gonna show you icons and you just type in menu done here's our menu you see right there Dune let's go import this command C okay and then put it into our actual what right here so import that now how do you actually need to install of course immature UI so to install into install material UI core and material UI icon so let's go ahead and do install material UI right there there we go right here so the first thing to install is going to be I'm actually going to use yarn so I'm going to say yarn and material UI core so to do that let's go ahead and open inside integrate terminal right there beautiful and we'll do yarn add material UI course that's the core uh which is basically material UI save that add that beautiful very very beautiful we're almost eight 854 likes let's go let's get to 900 you guys are amazing as always 900 likes that'll be awesome okay next one is gonna be material UI icons and to do that we'll do yarn add material icons right here okay again command K boom boom chicka we're done okay well I do this I'm gonna drink my hmm so good so good so good all righty beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice nice while that's doing hope you guys are still with me hope you guys are enjoying the build all the Tesla clone is going to be interesting one I think I'll be really cool to build is actually the Tesla clone dashboard you know how there's a dashboard where the Teslas use inside there that'll be amazing to build and I we're working on that one as well so that's gonna be really cool um but yeah some exciting things happening guys that you have no idea there you go all right let's see so that's all good now to use material UI we've done already here look at this we install material UI and now we just import the menu icon that's the only thing that we now need okay let's see in the patient I thought that was pretty funny don't you guys think so yeah I think it's pretty funny all right guys let's go ahead and continue on you guys are always as always are amazing there was a party code you know it that's how we do it all right guys so is math important for coding no it's not I'll just answer that for you math is not a portable coating at all in fact it's you don't need it at all like zero zip knowledge nothing just so you know all right beautiful all right now at this point let's go ahead and add a menu icon we're going to create our own menu icon because uh we'll change the styling of it so we'll say custom menu custom menu right here right here and we'll use the menu icon like so so let's go ahead we'll do right here so const custom menu is equal to styled styled what styled nope styled what style menu icon style menu icon right there see style menu icon okay now what can I do with the style menu icon really nothing I'm kidding I can do a lot so here's what happened here check this out oh it's so good that's so good all right beautiful I like it um for the right menu let's go ahead and display Flex it so display Flex to make sure it's all align Center so display Flex display Flex okay beautiful and we'll do a line items Center just under the center or something there we go display flag Center align I'm Center there it goes right there on the menu icon will do a cursor pointer cursor that is going to be pointer good good good good good good good good good good cursor pointer refresh it oh let's go and nothing's happening so far I don't worry about that just yet okay now another thing I want us to focus on is going to be look look how by the way guys just want to say how good does this look already look at this guys this is sick this is amazing so proud about one thing I want to change you see how this model actually gets squished well we're gonna make the change that you know whenever you get to a small screen you just remove it now to remove it again how do we do the last time we're also going to use a media query it's just how we did the last time right and with media queries it's pretty simple you just do like this try this out so on the menu group and the menu on the menu right here so we'll say what media again Max with RS 768 pixels meaning basically when we get to 768 pixels browser wood we say display none on the full thing so save that boom right there see oh let's go boom now What's Happening Here you see that shop Tesla account for some reason is doing this thing where it's like going all the way to the left hand side and we can fix that by what go into the container and currently we say align item Center but to make them space out we say justify content content and then we'll just space between that's it beat win there we go look at that oh oh oh oh yeah there we go so beautiful I love it so how cool is this guys huh that's pretty pretty amazing 883 likes guys you guys are amazing 900. let's go okay so that is all good that's cool good all right the next I want to focus on is you know how inside if I refresh this page it has like this really slick animation and it's pretty cool I kind of like it you guys want to install the animation I think so too so how do we make this animation works it's gonna usually called react reveal check this out react reveal and all this is just a module it's basically just a module for react uh for animation Library you see look at this pretty much anything you want I mean we can even use different effects if you if you wanted to there's a zoom effect and so to create actually add a fade effect it's pretty simple you just you know you install react reveal like so right and then you do what then you do basically you add not zoom but you do see where's the fade I want to do Fade home fade fate fate fate fade effect there we go with their fade left you know you just give the Fate that's pretty much it that's it see that's all happens so let's go ahead and make that one work that's pretty cool um if I have my Model S here no matter why yeah that's cool all right so open up in terminal right here and let's do yarn add yarn add and what react reveal let's see one more time tutorials instructions react reveal right here react reveal so you want to add react reveal boom adding that to the react good good good beautiful nice okay all right now that that's happening oh it's gonna happen now at this point let's go back to our react reveal let's go into the fade effect we need to import the fade right here so import fade okay let's go and import fade here um this is the the let's go ahead this needs to be done on this section so import fade here two two two two boom and all we need to do is now just basically you know group the fade of what you wanted to fade it's as simple as that right so here's what I'll do on the item text I will say the following I will say fade where is it is it I will say here fade it I'm so faded fade bottom from the bottom boom and I will give it a round this could be around the item text boom okay let's see it now oh how good is this check this one out guys all right I like that next let's go ahead and do around the bun group right here so do the following so we'll do Fade same thing also bottom boom Tata oh God oh yeah oh you oh so good so good so good oh my God I love this this is so good oh I love that that animation is so good I mean who doesn't come on guys come on come here come on give me a break come on how good is this huh how good does this look I mean if you're not great I don't know what's going on with you you know so I'm getting very close Okay the next thing I want to start working on a work on is gonna be what is going to be the actual um kind of sidebar right so the sidebar that kind of comes up from here when I click on this we need to have a sidebar that comes up on the right hand side okay um so let's make that one happen sidebar is what's called a burger nav menu and for now let's go just let's go ahead and just create a program menu and that will be done so the hair.js right there so let's do this so Burger nav okay and this one will just have a bunch of like for example like items so here are the items that they should look like so we'll create a few items like this for example we'll say we'll use uh a Light Element so we'll say Li like this and we'll give an attack so we'll say a a schref is equal to nothing so far okay nothing so far but inside there for example we have things like existing inventory inventory right we also thinks that it's going to copy this right here so command C command V commit uh command V Command right uh we have a few different things that we're gonna say so invest in this inventory we have used inventory right so for example use inventory we have for example trade in right trade uh trade Dash in you know and so forth and so forth let's go ahead and maybe modify some of these right here maybe oh the Cyber truck who's excited for that one cyber truck right here there's maybe The Roaster that's gonna be pretty cool one too right there and so what we're building right now is pretty much the following right if we're building this menu boom this menu on the right hand side that's our building right there oh this one on the right hand side everything else will build now we just need to go and focus on that one okay uh you can see these were the model X use inventory that's just pretty much those items right there all right awesome sweet so we got that portion that's all good um and the burger nav of course not existing right now so we need to create that so let's say const const what const Burger nav Burger now is equal to what Burger nav is equal to style dot div Tata right there all right oh that looks hideous don't worry about it guys okay so don't worry about this so the Burger now right now uh let's go ahead and do the following we'll just put it on top of everything else that's that's kind of needed all right um so for one it's gonna be position fixed so position fixed why because it's always in the top no matter what right it's always going to be where on the right hand side right always going to be here no matter what page you're on okay so business fixed now where I'm going to say top zero right I'm going to say bottoms here to stretch it only the bottom and then I'm going to say write zero that will take it all the way to the right hand side boom okay so now it's on the right hand zero good next all right at this point let's go into background color back background white nice you see so it's kind of getting there a little bit all right so it's background white let's give it a width width of 300 pixels good nice okay I like it good good let's also give it a z index because obviously it's like kind of like I think it's kind of like the index so the Z index is like 10 100. let's see is it 100 um I think it's because in that case we need to go ahead and make everything else is the index of smaller that's what we need to do in that case so that means that everything else oh man that's a lot gosh darn it okay so the whole section now let's do this let's go to section how and this right here will say Z index index of 10 let's just say will that change anything because I want this to be on top you see what I mean I want it to be on top is what I'm trying to get to let's think about it here the index 10 that's going to be maybe negative one negative one no that's not it the index of let's just say the index of 10 . so what's what's being overwritten so let's see okay let's see let's see let's see let's see so ball for one is the item text so I think we need to focus on item text here so let's do item text let's do this one it's going to be Z index it's gonna be 10. come on give me something um so item tax C next minus one does that mean the home just had needs to have a smaller Z index I'm just trying to think here guys what do you guys think here so home maybe this is going to be easy index of 10 maybe no did not change nothing okay let's see how do we go ahead and make sure that this kind of works the way I wanted to so Z index of 10 what do you guys think have any suggestions and we have any suggestions some said refresh no home 10 it's Max but do 10 for sidebar okay so for sidebar let's try that for the header for the whole Burger nav let's try that I mean I can't do anything like let's see still not nothing how do we fix the Z index issue the index of let's try this the Innes of 16. I'm just thinking here let's see easy index oh maybe it's this so it contains really let's see if I go to here and I say this container is z index of one oh what the heck oh that makes sense oh so we actually so it was competing the weight was competing not with everything else it was actually competing with the actual header which is the container which is above it because this remember this broken app is within this so in order to have this show up above this the container I'm going to give this a small Z index and give this one a z next like 16 they say okay that makes sense okay so there we go all right so cool we kind of got that that's pretty awesome I kind of like that won't you agree okay so now let's go ahead and focus on we have the index okay let's do the burger now and top zero width that's good that's good now okay let's go and remove this list out because it's horrible Let's test Style it'll be none okay good next let's do padding 20 pixels to give it some padding all around good nice nice nice nice nice nice okay 20 pixels then let's go ahead and do the following then we'll do a background no no no so the list style is kind of like not the way I wanted to because why because it's centered which is not what I like so to make that work I just do display Flex on this one this place of display Flex on this puppy there you go good and then we'll do fly version column good ah it's still okay don't worry and then uh we'll do what to flex um justify content justify content a flex start good oh like this let's justify content like really come on really nothing is a text online text align what start okay never mind you don't need this livestretation column that case I mean that could still be useful actually oh we don't need this one so attacks the line start which is good which I like okay uh let's see where are we at so on this one we have model three Model S okay I like that so now let's go ahead and focus on each line so Li okay so a lie on this one we'll do the following and this all I will do so we'll have padding top and bottom padding 15 pixels for every single one and then left and right is gonna be zero for now okay and we'll give it a border bottom boom right there good okay good and then we'll give it an a tag so on the let's go ahead and see let's see now oh let's go that looks good that looks good okay I like it I like it I like it let's go ahead and give it and the etag let's just give it a more of a font weight so we'll do font weight wait font weight by the way we're almost at a thousand likes guys come on let's get this party started fund weight 600 good a let's go now of course now the thing we need to work on is how do you actually make it work so that it actually shows up properly you know what I mean because right now it's just kind of there right so right now it's just kind of there um yeah it's top right bottom zero you know and we just hide it somehow so how do we hide it well for one let's go ahead and add an x button so in a material UI icons let's go and find material icons let's do material UI icons material and let's find an x button X there we go close okay good exactly what we want So Close icon all right like oh look how good this look guys oh my God it's so good okay let's go ahead and input our close button here okay so inside the burger nav we'll create we'll actually go ahead and do this close button right here oops oops so we'll do um we'll do what Custom Clothes so we'll say this custom close custom close so it's going to create a custom close button and how we're gonna do that well by using stock components so let's go here const custom close is equal to what styled no start what you see style close icon right there there we go close icon nice okay good good I like it okay uh allowed me to actually make sure this one gets aligned not there but actually somewhere else so to do this one we'll do let's see let's see let's see just kind of thinking here and this one um we need to wrap it in that case so let's do we'll create a closed wrapper clothes wrapper because we need to actually shift this to the right hand side right so if I go ahead and do it this way so again this is Bishop to here right we need to put that here in order to shift that properly how is it going to work well to shift it properly right I'm going to create a div around it a wrapper and then display Flex it and put it here that's I'm going to create it okay just so you know and that's a pretty good way of doing this kind of stuff right so just so you know custom close okay so if you want to like align something remember this rule wrap it if you want to align something wrap it you need to there's always needs to be a parent wrapper in order to align something vertically horizontally left right whatever it might have to be right okay close wrapper let's go ahead and create that color wrap right here okay so close wrapper so const close wrapper is equal to styled dot div now look at this one now you see check this one out okay all I do at this point is very simple I say the following I say display Flex flex and here's what I do check this one out okay let's play flex and we'll say um justify content content what Flex end boom right there see just as simple as that that's it and now that's there okay next up let's go ahead and do the following we'll do um let's do on the actual custom close we'll do what cursor pointer pointer save that nice right there there we go beautiful beautiful good good good good good good awesome sweet look at this oh my gosh this looks good guys this looks so good all right who's still with me you guys still with me I hope so let's go all right all right so we got this portion now we need to figure out how do we close it well we're going to use use state to make sure that we understand when is there when there is a closing factor or when there's an open Factor right so for example um let's go and do this let's use your state to figure out when I click on this I'm going to trigger a you state to say Hey you know close it right if I open it I'm going to say that we have an open State now that's what's going to happen now okay so let's do this I'm going to say you stay it's going to open import you state here you state beautiful okay all right nice nice nice nice and at this point you as few a few very simple things okay this is so clean guys by the way such such a such clean code which I really love by the way all right so we have you state and the side here is the following boom and we'll do const here I'm going to create our use state so we'll say Burger uh status of a burger I'll say open Burger open or set I'll just say Burger status I think it's good I kind of like that one status right there and with a sad Burger status a burger Stat or this right there it's equal to what use State and this will set it to false so we're now right now it's actually closed so story status is closed but there right so that's what's gonna happen Okay so recess is closed now how do you go ahead and make sure that you know that this stuff is actually closed or open well very simple is what we can do is the following so look at this on the burger nav I'm going to pass an error wrapper here I'll pass in a parameter here and this can be show is equal to the status of the burger status say Burger status Burger status right there I guess that is inside the burger now Burger now all I'm going to do is check this one out I'm going to say for example here um if we have so look at this one I'm going to transform it so I'm going to say transform check this one out transform okay I'm going to look at the props or props like so what about this I've done before and basically here's what we'll say if if it says prop star show perhaps.show right it basically says perhaps a show we're going to do what transform you know nothing so here's what we'll do we'll do even says props.show we'll just make it you know show basically um translate x0 so here's what we'll do so Translate translate X it would need to be like this right here translate X 0. and what does that do so if I go to translate X go ahead and do it this way otherwise we'll do translate x 100 percent Translate X 100 percent okay okay let's see so right now it's false okay oh now it's false Okay so what just happened let me see and make sure it's all good let me see I think I need to actually hey let's go so now now look you see so right now translate X basically if it's show we have translate x0 so translate x what does that what does that pretty much do um Let Me Go and show it to you Tran this is late X right here look at this one guys this is pretty cool right so I can move something basically so right here for example I can translate x 10 pixels I'm gonna translate 10 pixels to the right hand side right and so what's going to happen is is the following if I go ahead and actually if I do for example if I do show and I say here a hundred percent boom let's go and see this see this see this prop Style Show isn't working at all let's see am I missing something um probably show should be false if it's false I think it should be translate zero yes yes yes yes yes there you go so let's get this out so this will do if props that show basically you could not proper show is false right now of course so what's going to happen is it's going to translate what zero it won't move it at all right right so that's gonna happen if it's false it won't move it at all that's that's that's that's kind of what happened of course but we need to say this if it's false what happens actually if it's true if it's if we say props.show right then we actually need to move it not nothing because basically we do nothing right so if it's true we don't do nothing to this right this stays the way you should be right but the second is false this is false we need to move to the right hand side it's full width right here see that's why he shows it that way now check this out what we can do now at this point is we can have another click so when I go ahead and I click open so this com unclick button so unclick unclick is equal to what right I'm gonna say uh right well I'm gonna say what I'm going to do the following I'm gonna say sadbroker status to true that is too true so set it to true okay true so means if I click on this on you icon set the progress status to be true minions mini open so let's try this for now oh look at that see that means open right there how cool is that so that means open okay now close is now work right now because of course close is nothing right so now to actually change that to make that fully happen what to do on the on the click of this one what we're going to say is equal to what boom boom will say what status what cyberger status to what to false there we go look at this now right so now we change it to false if I do this oh how cool is this Guys burger status is now officially what officially now true or false now again this is where we now make it very beautiful look at this one let's go ahead and make it very beautiful now okay guys how good is it starting to look aren't you aren't you pumped aren't you like like excited for this and by the way we're almost at a thousand likes guys 977. let's go ahead and make sure we have that you know let's get to 1K it's not that much come on you guys got it's been working really hard now um all right so that's good 977 likes let's go all right to make it flow very nicely we just add a small transition to it check this out you see this transform all I do is look transition I say the following transition transition and I do what on the transform Factor Traditions form and I will say what 0.2 seconds and I'm going to say ease in right now your wife it is my friend are you ready for the reveal all right oh foreign look at that boom boom boom boom boom I kind of want to make it even better though I kind of want to make it look even better let me see let's see I want to say ease in ease out I wouldn't say easing ease dash out I don't like that better knock here oh that's not it hold on um let's see there we go much better I like oh let's go that looks so good how cool is that guys let's go ahead and give us a thumbs up for the following and we're at a thousand likes you guys are amazing as always just want to say something easy now thank you hey let's go oh how cool is that beautiful it looks so good okay now let's go ahead and actually add something to this right we're gonna add some Redux to this all right but pretty much look at this we're almost pretty much done we're so close to finishing this a Tesla clone uh it's so clean the coat is clean that's the really cool part about this all right um a few things now we're going to do is the following let's go ahead and add some data to it about like our cars right so as you can see here we have for example you know we might have cars for example car titles so here for example Model S and so forth right Model S model 3 Model Model Y and and so forth now let's go ahead and create uh our Redux store that will contain the cars that we will be using here okay we'll be using here so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and look at the Redix the component that we need to create so let's go features and the one that we have currently is like a weird one that's like a counter feature we don't need that one at all so we can actually fix that one but that's the hand side we can't fix that one um don't need the counter instead of go ahead and create new folder on the features folder and let's call it for example car slice car slice right there okay counter you can remove that one so let's go ahead right click um delete move to trash now we only just have car slice because that's the only thing we need so inside the car so it's gonna create a new file and what actually no Let's do let's see uh let's rename this to car rename this to car not car slice car and inside here we'll create new file called car slice car slice.js beautiful okay all right let's go to our app go to store and I've removed this counter reducer because we don't need that one okay okay good on the counter slice on the car slice all right we need to of course import Redux toolkit so let's go ahead and read the import Redux toolkit for create slice and what slice is basically in Redux is Imagine remix is like this whole state of data that you have right imagine Redux is like for example you know where this is this whole state right and a slice is just one smaller state right one small one piece of a state so in our case our slice will be for example just car for now and that's why it's called slices right it's like a slight slice of pizza right and every single for example when you're trying to save data in the global state of the whole website right you might have a car slice you might have an inventory slice who know for example right inventory you know and so forth and so forth and all that is just data shared across all your web pages websites all your pages on your site that's pretty much it okay so let me create a slice that's what's Happening Here all right beautiful let's go ahead and go next the next one we'll go ahead and do is we've got the car sliced that's great um let's create the initial state so we'll do const initial State and we'll give it a few cards so we'll say um cars I'm giving the cars right here and this will be actually an array of objects X just actually just honestly just an array of cards so say for example model which one what do we have Model S model 3 right Model S model 3 Model X model y so Model S Model S model three okay Model X Model X and then model y oh model y there we go all right so we got ourselves the cars okay um let's go ahead and now get this car so to create the actual slice we'll do const car slice car slice is equal to what's going to create the slides right we're creating a slice of pizza right create slice right there and that takes a few different things the amount we're going to name it as name the slice right there this could be car for now okay and then we'll give an initial state and initial state right there okay and then we'll give a few reduces now we don't need any reduces at this point right because our goal right now is just to get the cars that's it so we don't need anything like that of that sort that's way too complicated instead but instead will what we will however do is we'll get the cards themselves so we'll say export const and the trajectory or how usually you do it inside slices inside windows toolkit is you for example do select so it's like selecting a piece of object selecting a piece of data so in that case I'm selecting cars right here okay is equal to what is equal to state it's a good State and then it's gonna return to me let's turn to be the state that car the car is the name of the slides right here dot cars that's it and that's going to be this right here that's with this whole array that's pretty much it okay so this right here is mapping directly to this right here and Select Cars will have that for us that's it and of course we're going to export now default uh we could ask for the reducer because we need to actually export some kind of reducer even though it's empty default and we'll say car slice dot reducer beautiful nice all right once we've got that we need to actually import this so let's go ahead and go to store and we'll do import and this will be the car reducer so we'll say car car reducer right here from what okay when you go back then we need to go into features let me go ahead let me see this I need to go back let me go into features right here after that we need to go into the car right there car let me go car slice beautiful right there and so inside of this kind of reducer we just change it to car reducer car is going to be car reducer right there right so that's pretty much all you have to do on the Redux reducer side okay so just keep that in mind always okay guys uh you know the store you you tell what producers you have okay the slice is basically every individual reducer you can see right individual slice and this contains the actions and I'm not gonna go into go deep into redex of course that there will be another video of itself um but it Redux there's always a few different things we also have we always have the initial State that's a state that you will have when you initially start the application and you will have reducers and reduce strategies just functions you can use to manipulate the state maybe you have a function that will add a new car you know or something something else so that's what kind of the Redux reducer is there for right there's also actions but we'll talk about those later most important thing is the fact that we have Select Cars which will get us the cars individually okay nice okay so all right at this point we are pretty much almost done let's go to home.js and what we need to do is the following it's got a section here section here uh no actually not here header right here we're going to import our car slice so so let's go import okay I will say Select Cars right this will get us the actual car select cars from from what from features right here slash car slash car slice good and we need to actually import your selector so in order to select something that usually something called use selector which is a hook which is a react hook right here oh God right here so you selector and then we're going to select the actual card so we'll say const cars is equal to what use selector from what well Select Cars boom done you see that's it right we've started the cars from the actual you selector right so if we're in a consult login let's go to consult a load the cars cars okay console login right now let's go ahead and right click inspect them on this one console uh let's go ahead and see how this works out let's go ahead and refresh it says Legacy Collins API has been detected within the strict mode tree don't worry about this one but look at this here it is Model S model 3 Model X model y beautiful that's all we need to Do's I see this is some fade stuff we don't need to do this one should mitigate to the new version the old API will be 24 that's fine right so right there here's our array and now all we do is for example for this which so now here as we'll do if cars cars and and cars dot map right gonna get the individual car and then we're gonna get the index boom done all right and took automatic index and then that's going to give us what okay good so then I will go ahead and do a Shroff Doom right here I will give it some kind of a thing like this okay that closes that beautiful there we go so Model S okay now check this out all we gotta do now at this point is just be give it a car oops car and I can remove this now done so now let's see oh let's go another thing we want to figure out is give the key so because if I right click the Spectrum on this one go to console here see it says each child in the list should have a unique key the reason why they do that is because um react actually tracks individual Child by the key so let's say any changes happened it will not work to make those changes I'm curious about using the index like this right there see so if I inspect them by now okay the console and let's go ahead I refresh this again see the child is no longer that issue is no longer there beautiful let's remove this console of cars guys we're almost done so close to being done and finishing up this Tesla clone that is pretty pretty insane I will say all right and the next thing I'm going to do is we'll do the same thing with this specific situation here with this cars and I'll put in here cars are map but in my case I'm going to use it like this boom and this will be the actual car itself car right there and again a lie and I'm going to give it a key is equal to the actual index boom boom boom boom boom don't need any of this stuff boom right here that's it that's it and so this is gonna be that let's go ahead and take a look at that one so cars.map so let's go see oh oh would you look at that oh guys look at what we have got for ourselves let's go ahead and do add and that's gonna be uh Redux for cars right there good yes good be a look at what we have got for ourselves oh my God look at that guys look at this Model S model three we have some beautiful animations look at that oh my God accessories all this stuff and if you compare it to an actual Tesla page I mean let's go ahead and take a look at the Tesla page actual Tesla page let's take a look at it here look at that like what like okay just compare it here like hold on look look like what guys do you see the magic that we have just done like can you tell the difference I mean yes we have this fancy feature like the scrolling feature we can work on that later but look it's there I actually hate I actually hate this kind of um features of like where they you know they don't allow you to scroll I hate that oh let's go look at oh my God how good is this guys this is So Fresh So Clean You Know It uh guys that is pretty pretty insane wow wow wow looking dope Nas Jessica's dope that's awesome sweet howdy hello Colleen let's go let's go beautiful so what we've got like I said we've got everything we finished the application it looks so good it looks clean Model S model y model 3 Model X guys you put this on your portfolio it's gonna be a winning portfolio for yourself this is going to be a winning portfolio put this on your portfolio you're going to just it's going to be so good that's all I can tell you all right look at that oh my God yes oh my God it's so good that's so beautiful guys that's pretty much it for me uh hope you guys enjoyed the build like I said guys if you're interested in actually joining the boot camp and enjoying the boot can actually become a developer link is down below in description to go home and reserve your seat all it is is you just put in a small deposit just to go ahead and join the boot camp more information about The Bootcamp is on cleverpro.com you know uh on cloudpro.com which is actually right here if you go to Claire black cleverprogram.com let's go and see this right here go to coding bootcamp and you'll you can learn more about the Kony boot camp right here right so we've been at this for quite a while some of our some of our instructors and students have joined so many amazing companies look at this right and so forth so if you're interested go ahead and check this out and then you click the link below to go ahead and put in your and reserve your seat like I said see reservations close very very soon actually by June 1st we have reservations closing so you won't be able to join anymore at this point um but that's it from me in that case hope you guys have an amazing day let me see how you guys are doing let me go ahead and comment with you guys show astrology yes everybody says show us okay sure I can show that no problem GS so the GS resists of the GS right there that's it there's nothing crazy about this guy stole the GS that's it that's it storage right here like this car reducer that's all it is you have to import the reducer right here and then set it right there that's all you gotta do okay that's pretty much it guys and look at this by the way I don't know if you guys see this but this is also uh oh this is the actual Tesla phone this is actually also like user friendly too not user friendly but mobile friendly as well which is pretty insane looks so good so good guys who think this was an amazing build who enjoyed it let me know thumbs up of the video If you enjoyed this specific build I sure did I really did actually it was really really good it was really good let me see what are you guys saying here all right nice there's a building for Jingle clone that's gonna happen that's definitely sweetness thank you awesome Adrian I'm happy you enjoyed it Nas let's go Muhammad let's go super thanks guys awesome sweet thank you thank you thank you Lewis at elbow cough that's awesome uh but before you yes I do mean GitHub put this on your GitHub put in your portfolio because some people you might have portfolios where you showcase the actual application so definitely put that there let's see super clean super fancy I agree with that nice nice nice nice nice now let's go nice let's go luik is currently in a full stack Mastery let's go hey hey let's go look I love you too bro super clean now that's what I'm talking about but there's two kids that's actually an import that's going to take a look at this on google.com it's an import guys it's a new way to do Redux it's pretty awesome thank you so much I'm not number one fan oh let's go Daniel okay thank you I'm your fan I'm your number one fan number two maybe number two fan oh my God all right guys that's it from me uh hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you in the next video Disney plus phone with react.js that's what we're doing today look at this Disney plus that we have right now as you can see look at this let me put this making this full screen this is a beautiful uh that we we're going to build we're going to use Firebase we're going to use Redux we're going to use reactor Dom we're going to use let me see what else are we going to use we're going to use things like you know a react slick to be able to create this slick animation right here right uh so many different things we're going to use style components all is going to be used here okay and of course we're gonna be using vs code for to be able to build this look at all these animations if I go ahead and click on this I can sign out beautiful and then I can click login to log in again with my this is by the way using Firebase authentication so I can log in like this but oh we're set we're set hello YouTube Hello everybody I hope you guys are doing great all right so let's go actually get this party started let's get it straight into it um so a few things we need to do to go ahead and get the start like I said this is going to be a very detailed build we might split this up into two parts but this is how we're going to do it all right beautiful all right okay so now at this point what we need to do is the first things first is let's go ahead and build out our actual project by starting up a you know project using react so the opportunity to do of course for this you need a node.js so the first thing you need to do is you need to install node.js hopefully you have that by now so node.js right here very very important right that's gonna be what you need that's node.js all right so make sure you install the recommended version okay once you've got that of course you need to install pretty much this we use code and once you're done with that you're pretty much all set okay all right sweet sweet so let's go ahead and open up our finder or uh something where we go ahead and actually open up a folder I'm gonna go ahead new finder here new finder uh new finder window hopefully I can find it here where's my viewfinder window right there all right and now we'll go have a GitHub folder here right here and this is called Nas and I'm going to do new Services New terminal at folder so I'm going to open up a new terminal folder if you're in Windows you might have to do it differently you might have to use your terminal kind of like on windows so what I will do on this point is I will say type in MPX create create I'm gonna go ahead and make this a little bit bigger so you can you can all see it npx npx create dash dash react react Dash app dash dash template Redux right so we're going to use Redux for this specific application note so npx create react app dash dash template Redux is what you need to do so click enter on this one to see all options please specify the project I need to okay so the issue is are you specify the project name here so NPS queer react app and we're going to call it Disney Disney Plus Dash clone right here so npx career react app Disney plus clone dash dash template Redux hit enter all right that's all going doing so what's happening here is very simple guys okay what's going on is basically it's building all the scripts it's building it's initializing a the first project for us uh in order to be able to do something like this and of course hello YouTube Hello everybody I see all of you guys well we have a 20 donation from on let's go beautiful thank you so much um that is amazing let me go ahead and highlight highlight you on here where are you where are you where are you where are you oh whoa let's go beautiful thank you thank you appreciate it because of clever programmer I made over 100k a year thank you on appreciate it yeah he joined us actually uh he joined clever programmer a while ago and actually joined our boot camp and he was able to make a lot of a basically a Sunday key job and then make up more money from other jobs as well so pretty pretty insane all right now at this point that's that's it so what we've done here is we've created our project it was happy hacking once it says happy hacking you're pretty much done okay I'm gonna put up some music here so we can all be listening to a little bit of music while we're coding all right so happy hacking beautiful all right at this point what we need to do is you see how it created this folder called Disney plus clone right here and all we need to do is very simple we need to go ahead and open this up and we use code all right so let me put this use code on here on the right hand side and of course hopefully you can do this by your with by yourself as well that that all right I'm gonna open up a new new window with vs code there we go beautiful that's the new window just opened up I will do file open and then go to my ticket hub go to NAS here and then the one that we just did is what the Disney plus clone that's the one that we just opened up so let's go ahead and do that right now beautiful all right sweet all right and here's what we got now so right this is the project that we start out with with or basically react GS you can see we have source and there's a few files that you need to pay attention to the the one file that you need to really really pay attention to is kind of like uh well this one right here is we have app.js that's kind of like your main file right here and what we can do is if we do go ahead and do let's do right click on the yarn.lock and then say open inside integrate terminal right here and then do npm npm start boom npm starts to click npm Start beautiful that will start up your project guys okay that will set up your project and now at this point you should see it right here oh let's go this is our first react JS project reactor JS project okay of course you can click you can hit plus right here to add add it you can hit minus and the way it's working it's working with Redux is because we're able to for example click plus and minus with Redux right and Redux is a way to roster Save State and we'll talk about how that's done later on a little bit okay so subtract number three two one Z and so forth that's pretty awesome all right so this is our first project right here and what we need to do is very simple at this point is let's do some cleanup okay that's part one all right in terms of cleanup let me go ahead and make this right here uh at that JS don't really need anything here now just remove that sign out of baby let's go that's done all right save that that's what I'm talking about all right okay that's what I'm talking about so we don't need that all right so now it's clean right and I can type with whatever whatever I want in here so I'll say hello boom right if I say hello okay so really just anything I kind of want all right A5 for example look at these other things uh we have 300 views 300 people on YouTube Hold up what's up what's up what's up amazing to have all of you guys here as always as always okay beautiful hello hello hello great travel creation always helps me somebody somebody said all right so that's if I say hello here you can see we have hello on here next up let's go and clean up some CSS here um at that CSS just command a don't need none of this all right save it don't need none of this it's all I'm not going to say useless but it's unnecessary for us okay so that's done uh test.gs don't need any of this do remove delete this one right here too move to trash okay do not need that okay uh next thing logo you see this logo import logo from logo SVG don't need this either boom right here okay do not need that okay and that's pretty much it next up let me see next up let me see uh I will go ahead and do the following is let me go ahead and do this so we have that next up let's put you see how we have this counter we don't need this counter as well so that's not too more important local SVG remove this one unnecessary all right and now we have a pretty clean clean app now what I want to do is let's go ahead and create components all right I'm going to create new folder here I'm going to create a components folder right so the reason why we like to do that is because just it makes things so much simpler right so and just create a components folder and that's over all of your components will live now let's really think about how are we going to build this application right this application contains a lot of different aspects all right let's think about what it needs for us to actually build this um a few things as you can see here that part one is we kind of have the header right here that's part one and I'll always like to think about the structure of you know anything that I'm building so for example um if I do this so this right here is my header okay so I know that I need to build a header that's part one part two I need to go ahead and build a slider that's going to be another component I need to go ahead and create okay that's part two part three is I'm going to basically then build up this right here this viewer it's called a viewer right that's going to be what we will do with that so that's another component after that what we'll go ahead and do is we'll build this movies list that's going to be a third component and so what now has happened is we've just divided our application into multiple components right and this is how every single app works or basically on you know uh that's how every single app kind of works you know when we're going to build it in react.js honestly any app you're going to build online so let's see it so these are the coupons we want to build let's actually go ahead and build them right here now we know there's multiple Pages for here inside the app.js we'll create a component called header right here and this looks like a div but really it's kind of like it's a component so pretty much it is a div but it's a div that contains another component and what I will do is I will create a file inside click the components folder and I will say header.js that JS boom right there then what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the es7 code Snippets which hopefully you have when you install extensions which is this one right here you see esm react code Snippets right there right see esm red code Snippets right here hopefully you install that at this point and once you've done that if I click on here.js which is the one the file I created I will do rfce right and you can see this is our app.js so we have the header component inside here now that we've done that let's type in header in here so save that go to app.js and what's going to happen now at this point is well we need to import the header so I'm going to say import header from from what well from components folder from the components folder so I will do like this components Dash header done components Dash header okay I will go ahead and save this now at this point all right and once I've done that if if I look at my app look at that it says header right there had it right that is the header right so we've just created the header component using this okay all right beautiful now let's go to head.js and inside here we're going to use style component now what style components are basically CSS within JavaScript all right let's try this out um to use style components what I'm going to do is actually install them first so let's go ahead and do do Plus on our integrate terminal right here now we'll do the following npm install styled Dash components style Dash componentials done beautiful awesome style Dash components okay so this installed it is installed the components okay that's awesome there we go beautiful that's amazing and then what are we going to do now this point is we need to import it now right so I'm going to import styled from styled styled Dash comp styled Dash components beautiful awesome import style from the side dish components save that save that and look here's what we can do now check this out remember how we had this deal right remember this dip well I can replace this deal with it with actually a basically like a style component so check this out container our name is to container like so right to literally container right here right and you see it says container is not defined no problem whatsoever we'll fix it in a second here so I'm going to say now this point the following const container container is equal to styled dot div so really we're creating a div with JavaScript you see instead of saying div here we're saying container so we name it whatever we want but then we create a style.dip now check this out what can we do with that well a few things we can give it a height so let's give it a height for example let's give it a height height of let's say for example 70 pixels 70 pixels okay save that all right and then let's get the background color so I'm gonna say background background color and I'm going to give it this color right here and you know I want you guys to copy this as well by yourself okay so this is 0 9 0 b 1 3 that's hashtag right there all right save that beautiful and so for look at this right here boom look the header is created is pretty much created you see the header is now created right here which directly maps to just this container that's all all we literally had to do that's all we had to do right that's all we had to do okay beautiful all right next up once we've done that so that's in the background color right all right so let's go ahead and save this background color so that's in the header okay beautiful next up is the format it's going to now create another component called home now what is the home well the home will be this portion which is this whole thing right well called home component right right why we're going to call home component what do you think we're going why do you think we're going to call the Home component like let me know in the comments below right it's because we have multiple Pages we have a home page we have a you know a login page and we have a detail page when I click on a detail I have a detail page as well and so that's what we're going to call home inside components new file let's create home home.gs boom right there beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so that's that's our home.js let's do rfce again and again if you don't have RFC just kind of copy this portion right here to your terminal uh to enter your vs code okay and that's going to call this home boom right there awesome Okay add that GS let's import home of course we need to import it the cool thing about react.js is you can Import and Export things right just kind of how you you Import and Export with you know with trucks and you know in real life it's the same thing we can export just how you see if you go to home.gs you see you export a function or a component right you export it right here and then inside app.js we import it so I'm going to say here home from pom pom components Dash what which one do you think would do home right that's the one we're going to create beautiful all right next thing we're going to do is put the home inside here boom right there all right all right beautiful so let's go ahead and save this one all right I like it I like it I like it and if you go to home.js we'll call it home so really if we go to our react app boom we have home right here right now bars here home is here awesome all right so part one let's focus on just the header for now right our goal is to get to a hair that looks pretty much just kind of like this pretty much just kind of like this right here okay let's go just kind of like this all right so what are we going to do inside here well a few things right let's go and divide this up into a few different things well we have here this is the everything about this the divs is we have this is a div this is an image and now we have a connect menu portion right here right and then we call this a nav menu and then this is going to be like um a profile image right here so pretty much we're thinking about three divs that we need to go ahead and create beautiful all right three dips let's think about this now inside here in terms of container I'm actually going to change this name to not be container about I want you just to be nav so nav and by the way to actually make it happen to the cell you see how I just added it at the same time here's a cool trick click command d in vs code or Ctrl D and it will select all these things automatically for you and you just change on the Fly see for example let me see see it changes everything in the flight how cool is that huh give me a thumbs up if you think if you think that's cool give me a thumbs up thinking that thing that if you think if you think that's awesome I think it's pretty cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all right there we go beautiful beautiful sweet all right so now instead of doing style that div I'm going to do style.now so it's going to be navigation bar and that's just a little more user friendly with HTML5 that's pretty much the reason why once we've done that let's go ahead and do the following um well let's go ahead and create our actual logo so I'm going to create a logo here logo again it's going also going to be style component source with a certain image no image just yet okay okay logo let's go ahead and do this const const logo right const logo style the image logo right there of equals oh styled dot image right there that's an image right again and again these quotes right here these quote this code are called template little pretty much or I call backticks and this is where we put our CSS inside here all right beautiful and then aside here we're going to give it a width of width of 80 pixels so width 80 pixels all right now with now with guys okay with I'm not the best uh you know I'm not the best typer I will say that with 80 pixels okay all right so so we have the logo I can see there's nothing again does not show up on here but here's what we can do all right now let's go ahead and focus on the nav menu all right so we have the nav menu here nav menu let's create this other component now menu nav menu and we're going to create it into a div so it's the same thing here you see the cool thing about style components is that I'm creating CSS within the actual Javascript file I'll have to go back and forth between two files nav menu equals styled dot div done Zone done all right that's awesome okay no error so far now how do we go ahead and get this image a logo okay now um David or amanath hopefully we have a link down in the description basically towards a folder that has an images folder and you should be able to download that folder and maybe a month a day but you can go ahead and send it to me can you send it to me on uh slack or something like that maybe David you can send to me on slack the Axel the actual um um yeah then also I've dropped it into Zoom chats thank you so I'm gonna drop in the zoom chat for those of you guys who are on Youtube it'll be down description uh below okay and of course for those of you who cannot keep up right now don't worry you'll be able to watch this back for sure right this is a recording recorded uh you know coaching call kind of right uh we'll be able to rewatch there's no problem so if you cannot keep up with this no problem whatsoever if you can all the best to you right that's thumbs up but if you cannot don't worry right just watch it's about kind of understanding by the there's a lot that you will actually learn here just by watching and then once you watch just basically rewatch it a few times later on and then um you know and then do it by yourself kind of maybe after we finish this uh coaching call okay we'll finish this live right so there's a folder right here I'm going to open this one up for you guys all right this should be down in the description go and do this all right this is the folder done description or down the zoom chat just hitting that one okay there we go and this has all the images and all the videos and there's also like a Javascript file as well we will be using that tomorrow actually not so much today what I want you guys to do is download this one so download this one so let's see you're zipping up right now good good good good good and like I said if you cannot keep up just rewatch this video and you know just do your best that's it it's about having fun and enjoying the build with us okay all right all right beautiful all right let's go and continue on so it go ahead it will download it that's exactly what I want all right I'm going to open this up in my finder window let me see let me find it let me find it downloads and see downloads downloads downloads downloads two to two Okay I'm going to unzip it so this is the one that's downloaded I'm going to unzip and this is what I have you see these images right here and so what I want you to do is simply you know where to put it here's where I want you to put it so take out these images you see this images folder you need to put it inside the public folder right here inside the public folder right that's where you need to put that okay let me go ahead and try that but not just images appreciate yourself let me see no we don't need just images I actually need everything hold on because I did not download everything let me see I'll make sure done with everything Drive oh I only download the images I should download the whole thing download the whole thing that's what I should have done right there see I only select the images but that's okay download the whole thing here all right okay good good good good good good good all right awesome sweet and I'll open this up again and finder all right downloads where is it downloads right here okay this is the one we want extract it I'm going to double click it here on Mac if you're on Windows just go ahead and click on as well just extract it okay beautiful all right so all these things I want you to select these things right here and just basically just move them move them into into the public folder so these videos and images these ones right into the public folder done okay now we have images inside here and the videos inside here all right that's it that is it that you need to do all right beautiful because all these images that we're going to use are they're all pretty much just here okay they should be inside the public folder right here as you can see public and images and videos right there all right hopefully you guys got that thumbs up if you guys got that yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes again the folder is in the description below okay description below all right let's go ahead and create the image all right so what what I need to do is this for the source it will actually be Dash images Dash logo Dash logo.svg Now where's it coming from you see images right here along with SVG directly from here from here right here okay that's where it's coming from all right all right let's go and save this one refresh boom right there we got the Disney plus logo just like that how cool is that right all right beautiful let's go ahead and maybe add some Panic to this you see how it's all the way on the top I don't like that instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to center it so to center it I'm actually going to focus on the main nav the nav is this whole div right here okay that's the whole nap and I'm going to tell a display Flex right so this playfi is going to allow us to very easily to very easily very easily structure our code our structure our front end display flex and so save that see that puts it right there and I'm going to say align item Center item Center to Center vertically boom see now it's under vertical right here I'm going to give some padding I'm going to say petting 036 pixels all right pending zero through it now what is all this zero means top and bottom this means zero pixels for top and bottom 36 bit so this means left and right padding okay that means left and right padding okay that's what that means all right so let's go ahead and save that all right beautiful that looks so much better now guys check this out that looks so good all right I love that so logo is there let's now focus on the nav menu that one is a little bit going to be trickier okay and that menu will have a few things okay the first thing will be is every single icon here that you see right every single icon what it is is basically this right here is an a tag this is an a tag and inside here we have a logo and a span tag so let's take a look at this oh if I say here for example if I say oop let's go remove this for a second here boom I'm going to say a right I'm going to give it a that logo you see which is this image right here right this image right here I'm going to say here image source is equal to beautiful and let's do it go to images Dash home icon home Dash icon dot SVG done okay all right and then let's go ahead and do a span here all right and we'll give it home done so a tag home so if I say this let's see what this turns out to oh it looks so horrible that's okay no problem with Summer okay so you see the icon is there which is great but of course you know the fact that home page is here the homepage we don't really see that's mainly because of the color right we need to give it a color that's that's pretty much wide all right so a few things that I want you guys to think about is the following let's go ahead and focus on this home icon partially the Span needs to be color white so to make a color white we need to go to the following let's make the whole thing color white what I mean by that is let's go to index.css all right and this body let's give the full color to be white see this one white right it makes this homepage now white see right there it just showed up just like that just like that beautiful all right now let's make this icon be the left side of this home icon right how do we structure from being like this to being like this right that's the question well it's very simple it's all using display Flex so I'm going to go back to my header I'm going to back to my header.js okay JS and I will say the following where am I where am I where am I okay yes no menu so here what I'm gonna do display Flex Part One display Flex on this all right now that's not really change anything here right it's still home is like this uh instead what I will do the following I will say a here you see and then here I will say display facts again the a we're targeting this a tag that's the link tag right so a will say display Flex display Flex awesome save that boom you see now this icon all of a sudden now it's very different it's left to right instead of top to bottom just simple that all right so that's good let me kind of make this all right beautiful right there okay that's the blue flags then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to align this time so I'm say align items items Center save it done you see now this home icon is centered right here together with the icon itself okay next up let's go and add some padding to it some say padding padding 0 12 pixels and what this does is this is going to add Paddy on the left and the right hand side okay beautiful next up let's do the image let's go ahead and change this image because it's way too large right this is this is our this image logo so in size style components I'm going to say image now you may wondering now how the heck is like are we able to Target all these CSS like this well that's the power of style components what we can do is we can we can Target it basically our elements like a tree for example here we're targeting the attack within the nav menu div here we're targeting the image tag within the a tag you see so we can do that in style components right for images let's make the image here height of 20 pixels and whenever we give a height the the width changes automatically beautiful oh so much better so much better so much better all right so much better I like it so much more beautiful we got that portion let's now go to the uh the span tag okay so span okay and then here uh pretty much again nothing much let's change the font size here so we'll say font size not don't size font size font size okay font size 13 pixels you guys all good still on on Zoom yes you guys are still great yes yes yes yes beautiful yes give me the hands up hands up hey let's go beautiful that's what I'm talking about font size 13 pixels let's give it some ladder spacing letter spacing and the mom for David if you have any issues just speak out loud and I'll be able to resolve anything okay 1.42 pixels all right and so forth let me see so now you see it changes a little bit there's a little bit of a difference now in terms of how it looks like which is pretty great all right now let's go ahead all we need to do now at this point is very simple is well I pretty much just need to copy this stuff so let's go to here let's remove this let's put this all at the bottom don't need this at all actually we don't even need this portion too either honestly so a tag command C I'm going to duplicate this command V right and instead of down those this for example this will be search right and this will be instead of Hallmark it will be search icon search icon all right save that next up look at that you see how to create a search like on the right hand side just as we speak right here look at that done beautiful all right next one all right I'll just duplicate it here boom next one is going to be not the home icon but it's gonna be the watch list icon watch list dunzel alright so we'll say watch list icon in here watch list icon all right same thing going before this the third one or the fourth one my bad there we go oh another one look at that look at that Mighty look at that crikey oh no that's that's from a movie all right it's gonna be the original one this time original icon we're going to use and we're going to say Originals here foreign nose all right okay okay same thing again instead of doing this I want to do movies here movies let me go to movie icons icon beautiful all right same thing you see now we have movie on the right hand side if I scroll down to the right hand side yeah it's okay don't worry about that just yet you see beautiful look at that oh so good so good all right and then the last one is going to be which one is going to be series last One's Gonna Be Series right here so we'll say here we'll say series and then we'll say series Dash icon series Dash icon let's go ahead and save that oh beautiful look at that oh oh that's so good oh let's go that's amazing guys that's amazing that's so good there we go look at that so that's our going to be our navigation menu now at this point now we're not done yet I gotta have some fun sometimes okay all right next up is going to be the user image profile all right so let me go ahead all right uh the next one is going to be this one right here which is this little literally this little small icon right here that's all we are going to do uh let me do this here and this this is going to be called the user image so here we'll say user user Imager right and so forth now with this image let's go ahead and go down here and we'll say const user image is equal to styled dot div oh no not that they're actually that image it's going to be an image type component you see so with style components you can have different type components images you can have spans we can have divs right now but basically any HTML component you can have you can have that with a style component all right now on the user image the image we're going to use for the time being is going to be just this one right here it's going to be you can use any image you want technically but I have this one right here and hopefully we can have a monitor David put in the chat there we go and that's going to be pretty that's actually my image it's actually me that's not all right let's see let's see how does it look like oh let's go let's me if you have your own picture use your own picture I highly recommend that you use a square picture that's gonna be very helpful very helpful to you okay all right so that's gonna be sick okay so do that now of course we're not done yet uh we need to do is let's go ahead and make this a little bit better well let's go ahead and set the way so check this out guys if I want to edit the style for this I hit command and click on this you see anomalous Styles check this out how cool is that out command click on the actual user image I think in Windows is control click I think so or Windows click I'm not sure try one of those so inside the user image I'm going to say width with 48 pixels okay height height also 48 pixels done save it all right now it's a bit smaller which is great and then I'm going to get a border radius borders radius of 50 now what that does is that gives it basically a circle that makes it into a circle because the Border radius basically as the Cur the beautiful most beautiful curvature on there on all the corners right you see right here fifty percent of the full image is going to be basically curved up that's what I mean next thing I'm going to make it to cursor pointer the reason why we do that is because it looks like or it feels like a you know a button the youth all right oh let's go all right last thing look at this you see how this icon is all at all with the left hand side well what I can do is I can actually expand the nav menu the nav menu right here to push this icon all the way to the right hand side by using what what do you guys think we can do here let me know what do you guys think put in the chat what do you guys think we can do to push this now menu right here all the way to the right hand side well that's very simple actually I can go to the nav menu and I can say the nav menu hey you know what let's give the flex of a one look at this nav menu I'm gonna say Flex one and what that does that's biscuit says look at this that says hey this name menu is the most important thing right and you want to explain to as much as possible and so that's what that what that does okay I'm going to give it a small margin left 20 pixels margin left modular 20 pixels is tomorrow ah margin Dash left I'm gonna give it 20 pixels 20 pixels right here uh 25 actually give some spacing and they'll add inside there you go just to give spacing and then the last I want to do is for each a tag I'm gonna give it a cursor pointer all right cursor pointer and what that does is going to make you like a hand there we go now it's a hand you see that right there now it's a hand okay but okay we're not done yet I also want to make this into a line item Center so this basically will here will Center it vertically so I'll line items might not change might not change a little bit just see that does not change much honestly right here it's beautiful right there all right so align them Center and that's looking pretty good wouldn't you say so what do you guys think let me know let me know in the comments below let me know in the chat what are you guys think so far that's looking really really good so far all right I like it next up all right next one let's go ahead and make that a beautiful animation that we have just this one so this is going to be really really cool the way we make this happen is really cool really cool all right Monique says beautiful I like it thank you money all right let's go and check up on YouTube here for a second here all right that's what I'm talking Nicholas says awesome sweet Flex ah you guys are amazing I like it nice bro Javier says nice bro all right all right now a few things that we need to make to make it kind of like uh you know to make that portion happen so um check this one out this is going to be like a really cool trick that maybe you have not learned before but inside the um here inside this span this pan here's what we can do we can use something called um after so what does it do right here I'm gonna say here I'm gonna say this this after now what this adds is this adds almost like a div this adds a div right here so I'm gonna say after I'm gonna give a content and I'll explain what again what it does in a second here content of empty string okay and I'm going to give it a height so imagine it like a normal div height of two pixels I have two pixels and I'm going to say background is white background is white okay and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to position okay well for now it's going to see what does that do and let's see refresh uh nothing so much because we need to give the width so let's give the actually give the Contour like hello jello see there you go there it is right here it's called Jello see and it's back on color white if I remove this black and color white Jello now what it does if I when it's back download on this one here's what it does is it adds a div after the ending of everything so check this out if I go to span you see there's home and then there's a after imagine this after almost like a div like a div you see and it has the content Jello and a height of two pixels and with that we can actually be very very very useful we can actually be very smart with that let's go and save this beautiful all right let's go and do that save that all right and of course we don't need Jello at this point right no I mean unless you guys like jello who like jello here anybody likes Jello here I like jello I'm a big fan of jello I love Jello it's my favorite favorite type of food okay love jello all right beautiful there we go that's what I'm talking about so let's go ahead and do the following now so how am I going to position this you see how this position inside here especially at the bottom how do we make that work well let's think about it I'm going to use something called position absolute so here's what I'll do I'll do position absolute absolute absolute right here and I'll give a top of zero of zero and I was playing well how that works out a little bit top left of zero right of zero and then bottom is actually going to be minus six pixels so why mine is not you might be asking well a few reasons why save this as you can see right there it's still not show now because why we need to give it if you're going to position absolute something it needs to be positioned to what to a relative object well let's make the same the the span position relative and so you have to give it a parent to cling on to right so let's go ahead and save that position relative content High 20 pixels okay okay okay opacity of one background color white all right let's go and refresh this still not there let me see make sure it's all out it's all good let me see inspect that one and this one home oh because I did not put this correctly there you go boom right there you see now it's at the top okay it's at the top or why because I do I though this top zero don't need this remove this one type zero boo now to the bottom you see that right there look now it's at the bottom so we have this line here that was created how well we said that okay you have this div right here it's called a span okay we have this div and we said hey you know what let's all let's go ahead and create another div we're using after but let's make that div which is this one right here let's make the small div let's give it a height of two pixels a backup color of white unless absolute position it to the left where there's no space to left there's no space to the right and from the bottom it's like for example wait from the left create no spacing from the right there's no spacing and then from the bottom there's only negative six pixels meaning it will push it down it will actually push down the div below this band component that's really cool part you need to understand right it will push down below this Bank opponent okay let's go ahead and continue on all right awesome sweet sweet sweet you guys still good yes yes yes yes yes beautiful beautiful all right all right Derek I think you're still good Alex you're still a little good Jared I think look you're still good as well beautiful Leonard as well and same as Christian all right sweet sweet all right all right now the way we need to start out now of course when we go ahead and build stuff like this of course you see how that does not show up until until we actually do something about it right until we hover over it so how do we make that happen well um very simple very simple let's do initially we're going to give the passive zero passive zero opacity of zero and then we'll do transform skill X zero so what does this do scale x0 basically is going to scale the I'm going to go ahead and comments will pass it here for a second so it's going to scale the div to zero if I do 0.5 it's going to make it 0.5 you see that right there 0.5 the simple as that right all right if I make it for example 1 dance can be the full thing right there see but if I do zero it's going to make it zero okay now in our case I'm going to make a zero and also passes zero and then well here's what we'll do on the hover of span on the hover actually of the whole a tag which is inside here look at this I'll do the following this this this will say hover boom voila I will do spin after right right and the hover of this of this spent after was a transform transform scale X into one so we go from zero to one scale basically from zero width to the full 100 width that's what that means and then I'm going to give opacity of one for that all right let's try it let's try it oh oh does not work that's okay that's okay because we need to give it a transform from what to what so check this out I need to give this transform origin from left to the center let's try refresh again oh two two two that's not really happening here let's go ahead and see what's going on here so we have a tag that's on here on the hover of that ban we're calling the span which is that one right after transform transform scale X one oh right here right there that's the one boom boom boom boom look at that see boom boom boom so it shows up on the hover you see opacity wanna transfer scale works one but let's make it even beautiful beautiful look at this all right I'm going to add a transition and hear the transition this is a special transition and this says transition everything all all attributes at 250 milliseconds and this is a special type of tradition right this right here basically says what type of a transition there's like a linear transition this is this right here number has a special temperature it may be for example a month then maybe you can put it down the chat in the zoom in this specific text right here right cubic bizire cubic bizarre right here all right so it's a really cool transition that if I now apply this oh oh oh let's go let's go boom boom boom boom boom boom look at that guys how cool is that look at that how cool is that what do you guys think huh that's pretty awesome what you think so that's pretty awesome you can actually have this like I said it's this one right here pubic desire right a little bit desire use that one you can do linear as well but ah you can do linear but we don't want that that's not not not too much fun all right so save that and that's it our header now at this point is officially done that's it it's done done so that's it comprende all right all right so that's all good Hatter is finished okay header is finished and let's go ahead and go to here a git and I'm going to actually save it so I'm going to say add header so I'm going to save this inside the git and I want you guys to get used to doing stuff with this as well so add header that's going to save it into our get all right and that's it we don't have to worry about anything else at this point besides that that looks so good by the way that looks so great that looks so good well don't you guys think it looks awesome raise your hand I think this looks amazing yeah and it's the way it's done is very intricate too it's all using CSS you see right this transform origin is saying hey go from the left corner to the center right here you see kind of uh from left corner to the center that's the same the transition say transition all of this and the transform says scale it from zero to one that's it that's all I'm saying that's as simple as that all right let me see now disappointing YouTube we have 356 people on YouTube let's go 423 people on YouTube that is beautiful amazing amazing excited to see all of you wow wow that's actually pretty great all right so that's what we have this at this point okay I know everybody looks yeah it's amazing that's cool that's cool it's cool I like it okay so that's part one let's now look at the home page okay the home page now let me go ahead and focus put this on the right hand side and put it more on the right hand side all right home page is done check mark all right next up let oh header is done check mark next up is home page homepage is going to be a little bit more difficult but that's completely okay let's go to the home page all right um so the homepage will have a few things all right of course uh let's start out with a container here like we always like to do so let's go and import style components here import styled from from what style components Dash components all right sweet aimport stuff to the style components let's do the following so const container equal styled the what start that there for now oh actually no style domain so mean is actually a great it's a very HTML5 friendly basically it tells Google or any other browser that this is the main content right so it's the same thing as saying div except that uh you know underneath the hood Google likes to read that so that's why we say Main all right now for this one let's do the following for this one okay um a few things few things all right a few things we need to think about here uh first things first let's do a main height so we're going to do Min height main height here so what is the main height uh really is the following um remember how this height is 70 pixels so this right here is 70 pixels okay that's 70 pixels all right then that's mean that this will be what the rest correct so that this right here it means will be those will be the rest of the the height right so that's what that's what that means well to make that happen here's what we can do I can say calc so CSS can actually calculate stuff for you I can say a hundred VH that means a hundred vertical height 100 ago that's the full width from top to bottom of the view view height viewport that's the browser height minus 70 pixels right so that's the height main height is this full height beautiful we got that all right all right so we have that and then another padding to it padding padding and I'm gonna go to zero calc here and all this is saying is this is 3.5 view uh vertical uh kind of view width 2.4 or 3.5 actually 3.5 view width plus five pixels that's just pretty much it's nothing too crazy just a very soft calculation so this means top bottom zero pixels left and right is this one right here sorry all right now how do we actually see this well it's very simple let's go ahead and actually add a background color here back on blue let's see our let's see background blue okay does not show up on there background color blue blue is that there or no let me see inspect element in this one um let's see inspect Alma here uh body root app Dave home oh here's why the reason why it's not working is because remember what we did here is we forgot to put the container so container is actually being used here instead of div container boom container nice I like oh that's cool let's remove this hideous color please I don't like that okay so so that's all good now with the color that we do want to use however is going to be like a home color a background color it's gonna be actually this color right here so what I want you guys to do to add a nice background color is that CSS here in the index.css here and let's go to body and do here background color right here hashtag zero four zero seven one four it's a nice color that we're going to use for the Disney plus clone okay that's that's ever see nothing too crazy just just a very simple one okay just about that all right beautiful all right next up so that's all good let's go ahead and go to home.gus all right I like it I like it like that I like it like taking it anyways guys all right let me see so that's all good next up is gonna be watch next up is going to be we need to now add the background image now if you look at our Disney plus clone make it a little bit bigger you see we have this background image that looks that's in here see this as I scroll you see it's there you see that as I scroll there's a background image in there you can have to look very close in here you see it's a background image so how do we make that work well um let's take a look at it what we're going to do is we're going to use this after before stuff that we talked about before okay before that's that's a fun that's a funny pun funny punners before all right done before and it basically will add a div before the container check this out I'm gonna say background background here now it's a URL boom done okay I'm gonna give it Dash images Dash images a dash home Dash background that what that PNG done okay now so that's the URL I'm gonna say Center that's the vertically Center horizontally centered right and then I'm going to say what um center dash where am I where am I right okay sender then I'm going to cover and then I'm going to say no repeat and fixed so no repeat means do not repeat this no repeat do not repeat repeat uh this image right and it can be a fixed image now how fixed we'll talk about that in a second here all right now it's still not there of course it's not here right you don't see you don't you only see oh that's not good right you still see only this no problem whatsoever right so let's do this right so again it's URL images whole background PNG Center Center cover no repeat fix no changes so far don't worry I'm gonna do content here check this out now content nothing just how I usually like to do it okay now again if I add content for example like y'all save that yo see it adds a before right there see let's go ahead and do it like this right there I think I'm going to position absolute that's the cool part position absolute right all right right and I'm going to say now the following top zero left zero zero then I'm going to say write zero right and then bottom uh bottom zero right save that now still nothing happens why because the following because we need to make it absolute to what I need to make this position relative save that all right save it let's see let's see position relative background is this content is this and fixed the Mississippi absolute refresh this um I don't really see the background image yeah there's no bueno let me see your L am I doing this right bottom zero I'm gonna say Z index minus one all right I don't see the background image just yet don't worry about that we'll make that happen a little bit here let's see I think it has to put this back on let me let me try this just for a second here boom boom boom boom boom boom okay so there was a little bit of mix up here so I guess I did it wrong in terms of how we set the background so here's what we'll do background URL right there images home background.png Center this horizontal vertical Center this is basically the type of positioning here right this is background position cover right I'm going to add a dash here so Dash cover and after that we say no repeat and then we say fixed okay so fix means basically fixed on the page so if I scroll if I scroll it will always be fixed on there okay that's what that means guys if I scroll it will always be fixed on there that's what that means look how good this looks already so good so good I like it that looks beautiful and again how does it work again right because if you think about this let's look at our rectangle here boom there's a rectangle right that's our home let me go ahead and forces here this right here is our home component you can see right then what we did is when we did before we added another div right there's no name for it right and we give it a content of nothing and we need position absolute top zero left zero right zero bottom zero meaning here's what that means that it's going to be 0 pixels from the left zero pixel from the top zero pixels from the bottom of this from the bottom right the zip is from the right so when you do that you stretch the whole div to the end of this dip like so oops to this right here that's what you do and so now we have this extra div that blue chip salute it will not move anywhere and it will be behind all content all the time because we give it a z index of minus one that's why okay so I want you guys to really think about that Z is a big deal this is 0 minus one you will later on if you will see when I add content to it like if I do for example if I forget this music let's remove this for a second here see the home was gone right if I do see them as one home is out there you see that's why that's what that's so important okay and honestly that's it you're done on this container home now of course no you're not pretty much done but this is looking now very good raise your hand if you're still with it are you still with me raise your hand yeah you guys still with me how beautiful is this turnout to be just within about what one hour at this point within one hour we've gone so far now exactly it's beautiful all right and on YouTube guys I know you guys are killing it as well it's a lot of fun all right so we got that portion we got this I like it I like it like that okay anyways all right um so now next portion is going to be the image slider which is gonna be oh this is gonna be so much fun you guys are you ready for the image slider oh that sucks it's gonna be a fun one it's gonna be a fun one because I know you guys will be confused that's why that's why exactly why so but it's okay we'll we'll do this together don't worry about that so image slider so what are we going to use for this image lab well the first thing to do is we need to create the actual component so let's go ahead and do inside the components folder right click new file and we'll say what we'll say image image slider dot JS done all right let's do rfce to create our component all right and we'll say image slider here all right save that beautiful image slider and of course it's not here because we need to import it so let's go back to our home.js which is right here and let's import that right just how we always import we like to import so import what image image slider from what from from going to be from what is it guys what is it component what what is it well directly from here because our image slider is inside this folder components folder and our home page inside this folder so we'll say dot dash image slider save that let's go and create the component side here now so say image slider done all right boom image slide is right here all right so that's pretty good I'm pretty happy about that how that's turning out all right it's really really good actually I like that a lot all right so that's really cool so and now let's actually work inside the image slider let's go into here boom now we're inside here okay all right inside here a few things we need to do what we're going to use to do to do image slider is something called react slick check this out sorry let me get some water I'm dying out here oh yeah you know you guys don't want me to die right I hope so I hope not all right so there we go so it's called the react slick and it will give you some examples here but basically it's a react module that's been built for us to make beautiful sliders so right here reacts the documentation right there boom see you right there and this looks pretty much exactly the same as what we're trying to build and actually tells us how we need to build this there's a settings there's a component right here there's settings we need to give it and then we just return the div you can see we will use the slider component that's this one right that's like opponent and then we'll use it where we'll use it inside here right there right so that's how we need to do so the first thing for you to do is we need to install image slider and well to make that happens go back to here react slick all right all right so okay so npm install reacts like dash dash say let's go and copy that all right let's open up our terminal which we like to do by right clicking and then open an integrate terminal no problem right click on package.json or whatever you have to click right click on let's open up this okay so do npm install react slick dash dash save done hit enter okay that will install the react select module for you okay done that's all good we're not done yet though but now we need to do npm install slick Carousel this will install us the CSS we need to use so next one is going to be npm install slick here so that's next one and enter and look at this guys it literally has 746 000 weekly downloads this tells me that this is a good module to download no good no mods not good module to download basically it's very well supported that's what that tells me okay okay now what we do is we need to now import these CSS files here okay and need to import of course import the actual uh the actual as well slider so let's do that so here we'll say import import slider from react Dash slick fast slick all right save that right and then we'll do the following we'll save here or say lat settings ah don't let's not do that just yet actually I'll do that just yet get that for a second here and then we need to import the CSS files right here Imports like carousel right here so these ones are really really important so import and hopefully a monthly where you guys can take care of it maybe you guys can put in the chat something keep putting a chat hopefully uh Imports like carousels looks like that CSS right there that's the one that we need to use okay all right save that beautiful and we're not done yet so now at this point let's go ahead and use style components as well so let's go ahead and import style components of course we're we're currently here okay there so let's go ahead and do import style components import styled import styled styled from from what styled Dash components done stylish components all right so that's that's good and instead of doing uh div we're going to say carousel so command D just like both carousel done and let's create that stock component we'll say const carousel is equal to what not style that they have actually but check this out remember how we had to use slider remember how inside here we had to use slider component you see which came directly from here remember that well watch this I'm going to say styled slider basically instead of doing slider inside directly inside here I'm giving it a style component because then I can actually style it myself right that's the whole reason why that's the cool part about this so slider okay so that's there uh everything's gone everything's deleted that's okay don't worry there's a reason for it probably I know 100 hopefully I think it's because the fact that we import a slider and we have not given it any uh settings yet so don't worry about that so let's go ahead and quit some settings and we'll do let settings equals the following and there's a few times we can set there's like dots you know infinite true speed and so forth and first dots so that's the dots that will show up at the bottom so we'll say dots that's going to be true comma they will say infinite that's true basically you will infinitely should be able to infinite infinite that's going to be true as well all right then speed is going to be 500 that's 500 milliseconds that's basically half a second okay slides to show one to show ah my bad it's gonna be one comma and then we're going to do uh uh slice to scroll how many slices go for scroll biscuit slides to scroll is going to be one as well okay an auto uh Auto play is going to be true boom so this is our settings okay I'll place it with the true let's get the things now to here now the way we do that is using something this is called destructuring you see how they do it here it's called destructuring that's what that that's what that does so say dot dot dot dot settings basically it's put it puts in basically all of these all of these settings directly into the carousel div as a as a basically as a what's it called a so save that why is my thing not working that's interesting right click it inspect almond where's my header where's everything it's not it's not there at all the help Carousel they're just going nuts on me let's go and Spike down below here body the root oh there's something happening here it's very interesting some they fail which are like oh slider but we are recording the div component type is invalid expect the string for builtin components of a class function react Dom defined but you likely forget to export your component from the file it's defined in or you might have mixed up a default or name view okay Imports interesting style import slider die right through rightly let me see slider import slider from Carousel slick see import slider make sure it's all good guys and on YouTube you guys have the same and you guys have the same issue is it just me maybe it's just me it's okay we'll be able to solve anything we put on mine too correct cons Carousel that's fine that's all good we imported it correctly which is correct right maybe it's because we need to have an actual div inside here let's try let's see this let me let me try this let me try this for a second okay boom let me try this for a second here one second I'm gonna do the rap as a style that div don't worry about it don't worry don't worry I got you guys so const wrap is equal to style dot div okay let's see okay so all right so the reason why it wasn't working looks like is all right so oh I know I know it's fine don't worry about it it's gonna fit your fix okay so the reason why it's working because when we put it into the slider right there's literally nothing here right there was nothing to slide and so it gives us errors right because it probably expects us to have some kind of a slider right it's some kind of uh the actual image inside here because if you look at here right we need to give it a div right a div to slide through so day of H1 or H3 whatever might be right and so we're doing here is we're kind of did well to create a div what we're going to do is the following so let's go back to here right again it's going to be not going to work but we're going to create a wrap here a raptive so that's going to be it's just a normal div going to be a style component what should we create inside here constrap style.div okay then inside here we're going to create an image that's the images we were going to uh now that's going to show up basically so do the following so we'll say image here say image and we'll say source is equal to the following okay there's going to be Dash images Dash slider slider Dash badging that jpeg there you go and close it out all right so good that's image one and now I'm going to get another image let's go ahead and do another image there we go now we have ourselves a slider right I know it looks horrible I know it's like bad boom very bad right now would you think that's bad right right raise your hand that's that's bad right that's pretty bad yeah I'll agree with that yeah you guys want to make it better shall we make it better yeah she'll make it better I think so I think so all right uh this pretty much just requires a a little bit of CSS that's that's pretty much all it does it all requires okay um so let's go ahead and actually look at our CSS here I'm gonna put this here uh boom right here wrote that here all right so we're gonna focus on the curious so here let's do a margin top here for a second so margin top so margin Dash top is going to be 20 pixels boom all right that's gonna basically push a little bit oh they'll just go away the hell oh no this happened so save that so it pushes the slider over to the bottom which that's what I like to do that's what I kind of like right so I kind of wanted to put a little bit more to the towards the bottom okay all right okay all right awesome sweet so that's that all right and then what I want to do is well a few things um let's focus on the wrap here for a second here okay this wrap let's look at this image okay image let's focus on this image and with this image let's give the width width of a hundred percent and a height of a hundred percent okay boom right there see done so 100 and now it's a lot lot better would you give me that one I would say so um next up for this one let's change this one to not be slider badging let's change it to be slider b b a badag but that that's actually inside the images folder but dag the jpeg all right establish we have now two different images you see right there but dag but that's funny but Doug that's funny all right on the image side um a few things I want to give it a little bit of a curvature here so let's do the following so a little bit of a curvature uh we're gonna do the following so I'm gonna say image and I'm gonna say border radius okay border radius board Dash radius radius of 4 pixels it's going to curve a little bit of that of that kind of like this image a little bit maybe you see it you see right there maybe you see that right there see that you see how it curve is it a little bit I see that curls are just a little bit right there just right there okay okay then I'm going to give it a box Shadow now I want you guys to copy this one okay this box shadow check this out okay right there so RGB biscuit that's basically where the color it's coming from to the character where it's going so it's very simple right RGB right here maybe uh David Romano maybe you guys can put in this box Shadow for everybody in the comments below is 0.6 pixel 30 30 pixels minus 10 pixels maybe you guys you can put it it's basically just a box Shadow style that's all it is now I know it looks horrible right now it looks horrible now don't worry don't you worry at all okay so back shadow look at that oh that looks so good it looks so good all right I mean actually does not look good I'm sorry um does not look good at all actually so the reason why it does not look good at all because inside this right here this slick component it's called slick component we call it um we don't you see how in reality we're supposed to see all these other images you see all these other images on the right hand side and the left hand side you see that but we don't see that the reason being is because there's no overflow hidden on this dip overflow and biscuit on any overflow it hides the rest so to prevent that what we're going to do is the following so I'm going to say inside the carousel I'm going to Target the Slick list select Dash list and here I'm going to say overflow visible boom holy that made a big difference you see just like that look see overflow visible to overflow hidden right so before initially it was hidden by default that was inside their CSS that would they that they gave you see now it's visible visible visible done now it's visible okay right there so that's gonna be that but they're awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet oh that looks so good okay it looks so good look at that oh that's so guys how cool is that raise your hand with me if you're still with me yes yes yes everybody everybody beautiful I like it it's looking so good we're making such good progress I love it all right so that's overflow visible and then what we're going to do is a few things I'm I need to change up to make it even better okay let's give a small border uh so get a border I'm gonna say border four pixels here on this image I'm gonna say border 4 pixels solid right transparent now what does that mean transparent is the color you see it adds a small like just transparent color now again right here it's kind of like right here and don't worry we'll fix it kind of how it looks like again it looks a little bit odd right here I know don't worry about it we'll fix that in a second here I'll fix that a second here so it's gonna be a transparent border right um next thing let's do the following here um on the Carousel and the carousel so we have slick list and then we're going to add a color white on all these active buttons right so let's do the following to do that I'm going to say Li dot slick active so when there's an active button active button before right now how does this work out I will show you in a little bit here for a second here and I'm going to say color white white okay Ally it's like that's actually inside let me see the carousel okay I'm also going to do the following so I'm gonna say on every single button right here I'm gonna say UL Li button these are the basically the the next button right here and I'm gonna say like this before I'm gonna say here font size let's say font size I'm gonna increase the fonts decrease fans are just a little bit so font size 10 pixels right there okay I'm gonna say give it a color I mean you can be cool it can be just a white color right there so these buttons are here see see boom all right so but I'm gonna give this a more gentle color I don't like that actually too much I like this color right here this guy's a little more gentler I kind of like that a little a little better a little better okay so that's kind of that color white uh same thing with right there oh you see how it has like this white more of a more of a white look when on the active on the active button you see that right there see right there beautiful all right now you see how we have the next button but we don't have the previous button the reason why why is because of the Z index so if I do button here and I give it a z index of one a one check this out oh let's go you see right there that my friends is basically what we need right so that's that's pretty much that I'm going to zoom in on this let me see how does this look like what are you guys think so far it's working pretty good I think so too I think so too I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it like that all right that's looking pretty good I like the way it's going oh my God not save this I don't want that that's pretty pretty good and then the next thing we need to do is to make it work a little bit better is is the following so so check this out you see how here you see how that's like this border is within this image you see it's like a little bit better right that's kind of how I like it a lot better so what we'll do is this is called because of box sizing it's it's a bit a little weird but I want you guys to understand this a little bit here um it's all because of box signing border box so you see how these borders are on the outside here on the outside well to make them on the inside to make the biscuit included part of the whole image I'm going to go to app.css and I'm going to say everything that you have oops oops oops oops they have box size and board box save that boom see big difference look at that you see now what happens with this is basically it's telling for example uh border box when I say border box is 10 hit the content should contain the Border itself basically the width contains the Border that's what that means right and so that's way when I say with 100 right the width actually is contained within the Border that's what that means right that's what we can see the border which is much much better now and I like that a lot better honestly yeah oh let's go look at how good that looks guys that looks so so good oh my God it makes me happy all right let's go back to home.js let's go to image slider back to here we're not done yet we're almost done but not done yet almost there but we're not there we're so close but we're not there yet let's go uh the next thing um I want to give it a small hover effect so what do I mean by that on the hover of the image fully I want to change the small a few small things I'm going to be in here okay so I'm going to say hover I want to say hover hover and I'm gonna change the color the color of the board to be white so I'm gonna say border is going to be 4 pixels solid solid but this time the Border color is going to be this one right here oh we see this rgba 249 so it's almost like a white color with a little bit of transparency and then save that let's see oh let's go look at that right there see okay next thing let's give it a cursor point to the wrap cursor cursor pointer the wrap okay so when I hover it's like actually like a it's actually like a cursor right here you see it's good beautiful and then the last is give it a transition so the transition rate should be transition let's give it extra transition so we'll say transition duration oh look at that so much better you guys so so so much better that's so much better what do you guys think huh what do you guys think Hmm I like that so much better uh I need to fix this brush over here see this before I should be before in here okay there's the color white I'll refresh this oh let's go whoo beautiful beautiful and guys we have made ourselves a a carousel that's it the carousel is right there now you'll be wondering I want to ask you questions I may have a question do you raise your hand if you think you wanna you're wondering like how the heck does this work like imagine if you wonder how the hell does this work okay good so look so because this is actually part of this is within the actual what's it called This is within um um what am I say oh yeah we also need to fix this portion I need to fix this don't worry we'll fix this I got it we'll play this in a second okay here so if I right click on this inspect element let me put this here a little bit to the bottom here okay I'm gonna put it here uh this is the button here you see button see this button so what's gonna happen we have this you see here look align slick active so automatically basically JavaScript underneath the hood is adding a slick active class you see this to this Li bone forces here then it goes to here and so we're doing here we're targeting a CSS class called called Li slick active right there and then we're targeting the button now look at this see there's buttons you see this so button okay let me let me let me do auto play false for now so this stops here okay so it stops moving around right so you see here right there so button here so now this is a select active here I'm gonna say button and look before you see so a line slick active a button before and we've done this actually is done through the slit Carousel module right they do this themselves and look at that this before button has a color black what we did we said no make it color white that's what we did we overwrote overwrote the natural natural CSS that comes with react slick do you understand that raise your hand if you understand it with me yes do you see what I'm talking about do you see what I'm talking about yes we overwrote it but because by default by default the Slick active if you go to Slick active you go to that button they go to before so you select active button before by default it's just color black see here that's the default CSS that comes with the slick theme which is this one right here you see with this like theme CSS but we said no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no we're gonna change ourselves that's what happened here so that's what we did here color white that's it all right and that's what happened now funny enough let's go ahead and fix this portion because that's pretty bad uh you guys want to fix that yeah originally if you guys don't fix that yeah I think so too all right well that's honestly that's not that bad to fix so what we do is we need to go to actually index.css Js let's go home.js and all you need to do on the home.js is just say overflow hidden that's it so overflow here overflow inside the hollow.js Overflow Dash X is going to be hidden save it and so save that refresh is it still there Ah that's it and then also do the same thing on the header actually let's go to header actually so header.js same thing on the nav let's do overflow exiting overflow and what really this does is very simple guys overflow based basically means when some content overflows what your view your view with like if a Content overflows your view with we simply just hide it and you see right there we don't have that weird camaraderie going on anymore it's that's it it's done that's it awesome let's go back to image slider and let's go back to autoplay and we'll say the true now save it there we go awesome sweet all right we got that that's all good all right so raise your hand is still with me everybody's still with me all right next up look guys we have made our own image curiosa and it looks sick it looks so good it looks so good it looks so good boom boom boom boom boom boom boom wait was it false or true like this awesome it looks so good all right the next thing we need to work on is going to be uh these posts right here so this portion so this portion is gonna be really fun to make actually so we're gonna call them called they're go They're gonna be called viewers is what they're going to be called so let's go to here let's call them viewers so let's create a new component here and so new component new file it's called this viewers V e v i e where's that dot Js right there you're the Js all right so that's going to be viewers.js and what we need to do with this one is very simple is let's go and do rfce and viewers right there so save that awesome sweet save that and the following needs to happen now at this point is okay and we need to of course now input this I'm gonna say viewers here viewers let's go to import it inside where import inside the home.js so important Helm let's do import viewers viewers from from where from dot slash viewers ah this one yours right there okay let's also go ahead and say this let's go ahead and do add image slider slider let's go and save that all right that looks so good it looks so good all right sweet so that's amazing I like that import viewers and let's go ahead and actually use this one so we'll say viewers let's use this component let's use a component I like it not drivers buyers viewers all right that looks sick okay boom all right so that's that one and of course now if we go ahead to our racked app boom we have viewers right here you see of course that's not what we want to do but that's what we got so far understand comprende all good good all right let's now work inside the viewers.js file which is going to be pretty pretty simple it's not gonna be it's not gonna be anything too crazy or anything in terms of CSS uh you just learn some stuff so let's go ahead and do import style you know the drill guys import styled styled from what from stock components styled Dash components components save that awesome okay and let's go ahead and create the container oh oh container and let's go and create the the container component so I'll say container here so const const container is equal to styled dot div the div Denzel done Zone okay simple so all right now let's go ahead and do the following uh let's do at this point let's give us a padding for us so the container let's do padding padding let's do some stuff let's do container padding zero zero 26 pixels and what is this actually on about what is this 26 pixels well if I go ahead and take a look at this here let's go and say this right click viewers come on good okay so this one here right there so 26 pixels means literally petting bottom 26 pixels that's the shortcut for this one right pending bottom 26 pixels that's what that means okay all right now okay so that's all good that's so good now let's go ahead and take a look at what we're going to put in here well this one is going to have a few things inside inside here actually no I need to be inside here container no actually it's not depending but my bad hold on that's not right hold on so this is right here actually let's do margin top my bad margin Dash top margin top and we'll say 30 pixels here okay that makes more sense right 30 pixels that pushup pushes and more to the bottom um let's do the following now let's do um display grid so this would be really interesting now we're gonna go into grid now now what is this grid raise your hand if you know what grid is anybody know what grid is what is Grid or just yeah so what is grid so grid is basically it's kind of like Flex but it allows us to be very discreet it's like a it's it's a it's basically like a uh you know Flex on steroids that's what I'll call it you know that's what I'll call it and we'll give it a grid and we'll say here we'll say grid template columns so we'll have three so we have Falcon with template template columns columns and with query template columns well actually hey there before we do that let me go ahead and come with this portion out just so I can show it to you inside the container of course we do we need to have all these images right so we need to create the web so I'm going to say create wrap wrap for this one rap right so every single thing is going to be a wrap so this is gonna be your wrap that's gonna be a wrap it's gonna be individual dips right here that's what these are okay understand comprending good right wrap and every single rapper will have an image so it's an image image and we'll say source is equal to and it's going to be this one this is the image right here so hopefully maybe you guys see you guys know where to get it or maybe a month they can help you guys out and actually give you guys the image okay so images viewers Disney rap is undefined and we're able to find it right now so it's a const const wrap is equal to styled dot div that's what it's equal to okay Okay so style.div boom right there that's amazing okay and oh my God it looks so bad don't worry about it so let's go ahead and create a few of them okay so let's go ahead and do actually create five of them oh my God it looks so bad but two three four five okay all righty let's go look at this it looks horrible I know it's okay don't worry about it so now to fix that that's where Grizz gonna come in so let's go try this out so with grid and I'm gonna give it columns now so look at this great typical columns I'm going to say repeat so what this says create five columns so five comma min max and what this does is basically gives it a whip basically what is it what we should use well a minimum is zero basically about the 1fr simply means stretch it out as much as possible basically that's what one of our stands for okay boom all right okay now it's kind of like in line but it still looks horrible uh and so that's already to actually go to the wrap and actually fix that right because technically we have five grids if you look at it right look see one see five grits one two three four five you see it's there it's just a Disney the images are actually overflowing that's what's got going on right here so to fix that if we go to wrap and we'll say here image right I'm going to say a width of 100 so basically the image should take up 100 100 percent done okay oh boom right there awesome sweet right so I'm then going to say I'm going to say height of those 100 simply height 100 percent boom right then I'm gonna say object fit so rjfit means hey fit up the object as much as possible so object fit cover so fitted the image as much as possible inside this div awesome and that's honestly pretty much it now for this wrap let's give it some stuff let's give this this so we'll say here uh border let's give it a border and the Border will be look like a little bit like this kind of it's a very light border look three pixel solid rgba that's the RGB I want you guys to use right 249 249 and 0.1 so guys it's a very light border let's go save that Okay order is it not showing up let's see not sure not but just completely okay border oh that didn't real right we have border let's see border zero pixels oh solid solid right there awesome so that looks great so we have one two three four five things that we have okay now of course let's add some border radius to this one I'm gonna say border radius border Dash radius radius and let's give it a 10 pixel radius nice oh looks so much better now now it still looks pretty bad I don't like it did you guys agree with me this would you guys agree that it needs some spacing in between like in between every single column would you guys agree with me in that one should we add some spacing yeah beautiful all right beautiful so to do that we're gonna use a gap we're going to use something called Gap so check this out okay let's use grid Gap grid Dash Gap and I will say 25 pixels boom oh look at that so grid Gap is a very useful tool okay it's a very useful way to add a gap between every single grid item oh boom see so simple so simple right and now let's go ahead maybe add some uh let's get add some padding inside this container so we'll say padding let's say 30 pixels zero then we'll say 26 pixels boom so push it over the bottom so basically if you inspect down but on this one if I go ahead and go look at this specific padding you see this literally just means it's very simple padding top is 30 pixels petting your right is zero putting left to zero and then painting bottom is 26 but this is means Top This is bottom this right here stands for left and right that's what that means okay all right beautiful all right so that's that now let's go ahead and give it a box shadow okay I'm gonna get a box shot it looks a little bit kind of like this right there so again you can copy this as well hopefully maybe uh David and them can put it for you guys in the comments or maybe he'll push you guys in the comments in there there's a bachelor just kind of copy it for yourself here all right so that's that so it gives it you see that gives it that boxer which is really good by the way which looks so good which I like a lot actually it's a very light back Shadow okay and then let's do an hover effect so on the hover I actually want to make it bigger so let's do on the hover now by the way do you know what this does what does this do do I might raise your hand if you know what this does raise your hand if you don't know what this does so this actually basically concatenates the hover to the parent which is the wrap it's kind of like doing it's kind of like doing for example wrap wrap hover that's what it's doing so basically this is concatenating hover to the wrap that's what it's doing just so you guys know okay all right on the hover let's go and change up the temperature let's do scale it so let's go ahead and scale it in the X and Y Direction so transform scale so scale just simply means make it bigger okay and then we'll change the Border color to be a little more different as well yes boom okay so now if I say this boom you see it's a little bit different now but of course we can make it better let's add a cursive point in this one cursor pointer pointer save that okay now now to cursor pointer which I like a lot awesome sweet God it looks so good guys it looks so awesome I love it all right that's cursor pointer and then what I want to do is I want to go ahead and change up the box Shadow here as well just a little bit foreign box just a little bit here not not not too much so it becomes a big it becomes a bigger box Shadow but to make this actually cleaner we're going to give it a transition boom so this is transition everything with two by the way this number remember this number I want you guys to remember this this is a big number here this number is actually used in a lot of transitions this is if you if you give it to if you give it a number higher than this it became becomes too slow if you give it a number less than this it becomes sometimes too fast so actually this number is actually used by a lot of developers this number 250 milliseconds so just keep this one in mind okay and this is the choose that you want to use right here cubic bizire desire all right save that and look now look at this you guys ready for this you guys ready are we ready hold on oh oh my God that looks so good oh oh so good oh this looks so good oh that looks great that looks amazing I love this one I love that one the Border changes transforms it oh looks so good how cool is that huh so that's pretty much that for you so look we finished the views but of course let's go ahead and change up these images so they're a little bit better a little better so if you have viewers Disney and then we have what viewers and Pixar let's go ahead and do Pixar here Pixar okay let's do Marvel and then we'll do Star Wars Star Wars okay and then we'll do National right here to National boom save that oh let's go that looks so good oh look at that guys but this is our ours that looks so good raise your hand with me if you're still with me and you're ready to continue on because that was pretty sick won't you agree with me on that one don't you agree that was pretty sick I will say hey let's go appreciate yourself hey let's go beautiful beautiful so we've got our viewers ready we've got our slider the next dance we're going to focus on is just basically the movies so our goal is to get these moves right here these ones right here you see these ones these ones that's going to be our goal now at this point and it's very simple let's go remove this rack slick okay that's the next one we're gonna focus on okay uh let's do that so let's go ahead and go to our vs code here let's do add again I want you guys to understand this one so add viewers right here let's go and add this to git commit again hopefully you guys used your git commit properly all right all right so let's go ahead and uh create new component let's do this one should be called uh movies Dot movies.js all right so rfce you know the drill okay boom create the movies let's call it movies movies awesome sweet so that's going to be a movie here all right so that's movies here all right save that and let's go now to uh let's import this into the home page okay so let's do back to the home page by the home page and let's import it so we'll say import um movies from what from movies all right that's the next one we're gonna create right right there and let's go ahead and use that one so we'll say movies here okay beautiful beautiful beautiful movies all right sweet I like it all right so I like it like that um that's amazing okay so just like music right here so movies that's all good let's go ahead and go now to the movies let's focus on that one so let's go ahead and save this and boom now we have we can see we have the moves right here so we create a component that's exactly what we need to do all right now this component is gonna be again not that hard of a component as well um let's go ahead and do our normal thing we'd like to do which is import style so I'm going to use style components of course import Stout from where import styled from from style Dash components stylish components components okay and then instead of doing return dip we'll do containers so we'll say container let's go all right at the bottom we have const container so let's do the following const container is equal to what styled dot dip okay okay so that's good all right nothing too crazy here uh let's get a little bit of padding here and this Penny what do you guys think this this penny is gonna be bottom padding so don't worry about so much about that one right all right uh next one is let's do H4 so we'll do an H4 here H4 let's do so this is gonna be a H4 heading let's do here recommend recommended for you oh no that's not what I want save that oh let's go that's beautiful it looks great that looks great I like that I like it like that I like it okay beautiful I like it it's a little bit big I feel like no I feel like it's a little bit bigger than what I like it will like to be but it's okay we'll fix that later don't worry about that recommended recommended by for you that's okay so next up let's go ahead um and create our content so as you know why our content is actually going to be here that this is our content right that's our content and that's going to continue the movie so to do that what we'll do is to create a Content component so look at a Content component right and the reason why we're doing this because it's going to make us to it's going to allow us to easily use a grid for example to wrap up our uh you know wrap up our list of stuff right so list of movies all right um okay let's go ahead and create a create a contact content is equal to style.div boom okay save that save that as good all right save that okay and it's all good right there beautiful so content styled dot edif that is pretty pretty awesome okay so let's do the following so now we'll do uh let's create for that content now every single movie just like how it was here is going to be a div as well see how this right here so every single movie here is also going to be a div and we're going to call it a wrap so let's do that here we'll say wrap wrap rap okay I will say here image source is equal to something well our image is going to be the following maybe hopefully maybe hopefully um maybe hopefully uh we can go on and comment this portion out for you guys or but this is going to be a temporary image that I'm going to use it's the is this image right here you see now maybe a month you guys can put it into the chat right here uh or put it into the the YouTube comments as well nothing nothing too much of a crazy solution situation but wraps undefined let's create a wrap right here constant wrap is equal to styled.div Boom all right save it all right this is the image we're going to use the Simpsons image for now now you can get it pretty much any anywhere you want right just go ahead and for example uh you know I'll copy image address I'll knock you I can put it to you guys in the chat I'm a cop yeah I can do it here for example I can put you guys in the chat and maybe for example let me see uh I've been putting two guys in the chat so you guys can all have it let me see that's the image we're going to use foreign and then maybe a month you can place that into the actual chat on YouTube That'll be amazing actually if you can do that that'll be very very helpful for so many people all right so if we have this let's do the same thing now but let's do multiple like multiple times let's do it like for example how many times do we need well we need it to be one two three four so four times actually so four times so we'll do the same thing we'll do four one two three four save that okay you can see right now it's horrible of course it makes sense right why it's horrible it's from left to right well to fix that again we're going to use grid to fix that right again let's do that so we're going to go on the content side and we're gonna say display display grid a grid okay I will say grid Dash Gap okay it was to be 25 pixels okay pixels and then here we'll say grid template columns so just how we've done different colors before we'll say the same thing here so grid Dash template Dash columns okay and we'll say repeat 4 comma min max right there zero comma one FR right so again same thing but just while repeating it four times boom look at that though so fast we've got our thing finished that's so great okay so that's amazing awesome all right so that's so good so now of course now we have the four cons which is um which is exactly what we want but just so now we need to fix the actual images themselves that's not an issue whatsoever so that means we go to wrap here and now on the image side just how we did it beforehand let's give it a width of a hundred percent little 100 that means it will fill up the full grid see what there see just like that it's fixed height of 100 percent 100 percent there okay that stretches the image a little bit so to fix that we do object fit object Dash fit Dash fits could be covered boom see it just object Fitness it will cover up the image within a div okay so we'll it will stretch out as much as possible without while keeping the aspect ratio of the actual image okay beautiful so we got that next thing let's go ahead and focus on the wrap uh let's give it a border radius because I kind of want that so border radius there's also gonna be 10 pixels all right that's that's great that's amazing so I like that SN pixels and then you can see now I know that I know technically if we save this doesn't show 10 pixels don't worry about that we'll make you show a second if I do overflow hidden hidden then it will show it the Border radius bull you see you see what happens again because the image just goes outside the border right and so when we do overflow hidden well then it can continue inside the actual dip beautiful all right next thing let's go ahead and do it gets give the ER a border the board I'm going to use is this one so border three pixels solid rgba with this one right here right so feel free feel free to copy of this one maybe or maybe a month after David maybe you guys can go ahead and copy this one into into somebody some somewhere all right next up a box shadow that's this one boom so again feel free to copy this box shadow in here feel free to copy this to anywhere you want it to be okay hopefully you guys can see that all right so that's box Shadow and honestly that's that's pretty pretty pretty much it that's nothing more crazier than that that's that looks pretty pretty damn good wouldn't you guys say so I would say so I kind of like that actually it's pretty pretty good I like that a lot actually all right so now this point let's do the following here okay I'll do the following here so we have the box Shadow we have the Border we have all of that that's amazing that's awesome let me go ahead and wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what is this no that's good that's good that's good that's good okay next thing Let's do let's do a hover effect so on the hover again we're going to use this uh hover effect right here on the hover of this right boom right let's scale it a little bit a little bit just how we did it before previously transform scale okay save that boom and then let's do let's change the Border color of on this so on the hover of this all we do is we change the Border color to be this so basically it's a similar border color but it's a little more visible see it's a white white color that's what's gonna happen here so it's a white color that's a little more visible that's what's going to happen okay okay then we're going to change the box shell to be a little bit more prevalent as well all right that should be more a little more problems we'll do that to do let's go that's amazing I like that I like that and now see now boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom now right there that's exactly what we want but of course um we don't see you way too much because we need to do Transition so to do a transition we're going to see you use the same transition we used before transition all 250 milliseconds cubic bizire desire it's funny desire so feel free to copy this for yourself right here transition all 250 milliseconds cubic zire 0.25 0.46 0.45 is 0.940 seconds right there okay save that save that oh look at that and let's do a cursor pointer cursor pointer to actually do that it's a cursor pointer oh oh oh oh look at that how cool is that huh dude that's pretty slick guys okay okay that's pretty pretty slick okay I love that that looks so good that looks so good guys all right looks so good look at that the Box shot look at the transition it's so great I love that all right all right so who's still whipping guys you guys still with me yes or no yes yes beautiful I love seeing all your beautiful faces that makes me so so happy all right so we got that portion let's go ahead and look at this if I go ahead and copy this portion this whole thing and I paste it multiple times basically I just create more Simpsons so I create more movies that's that's all I'm doing so that is what our goal was was to create actually just simply just create this all right and uh well the home page I will honestly say is um kaput I mean in terms of design of course the logic not so much there yet but your design it's kapu it's funny it's done right so what I want to focus on so that's awesome so we have that and of course if these images are actually going to be replaced later on by images that come from a database so that's we're gonna we're going to do that later on a little bit but I want to work on a detail page now so let's go and work on a detail page now okay um so detail page so I will save this and let's look at the detail page now the detail page is basically going to be another component so let's go ahead and do here new file here and we'll do detail .js okay JS so that's going to be the detail detail one that we use so let's go ahead and do this so the rfce rfce beautiful create the detail component inside here which is exactly what we need and this will be detail all right sweet all right now how do we go and switch up between detail Peach and the home page good question um well it's going to be very very simple uh we're going to use something called react router Dom so what we need to do is we need to go to app.js and you see how we have the header home so by default it's just simply just throwing the header and the home well we need to change that to be to change to something called react water down so if I'm going to go to if I go to react router Dom here okay right right here you see that's what we need to use so this is what we need to do is react router down so we need to install into install install react water Dom again let's right click it open an integrate terminal right amp you install react part down beautiful nice nice nice nice nice nice nice I like it I like it I like it that's awesome okay all right let me show this hungry it's a lot you know um whoa that's what I'm talking about go left oh go before okay all right so that's good um so we installed we have a react rather down now to actually use it to use it as you can see we need to go ahead and actually import it like so so browse the router and software so let's go ahead and import that so import and you guys can do that on yourself here right there so you need to import right here browser router switch route and Link now the way this works is very simple and I'll show it to you here in a second how this works but red water is pretty much going to wrap your whole application around a route around a router and so we go ahead and we got the router um hold on right here I'm gonna do this router so the whole application is going to be right around the router okay but the fall to every single route will have a header page correct yes correct right so by default everything will have the header page right then what's going to happen is then we'll have multiple routes where either the home page or the detail page changes you can see for example if I click on the detail page here right the header does not change but what does change is this portion right that changes right so that's what we will achieve with this if I go ahead and if I click on this I want to say here now I'm going to say switch switch so again that's coming from directly from here you see that switch switch and switch just means it means okay you turn on this switch this to it this switch or this switch that's all it means and then we will go ahead and do a route so route if we see there's a the path is detail detail if the path is detail we will use the detail page so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to say import detail component from where components right components slash what detail boom voila all right next up so then we do detail like so detail so that will biscuit on the route where the path is slash detail we'll give it a detailed page however if the route is a home page for example like this or the path is actually just just home right there right and then it will have the home one a vhome component I just want to see how this works it's very simple right very simple we have a router that's this right anything that's inside the router will always be visible right so for example the header here will always be visible anything inside the switch case will always change so for example if I have a route here with the path details a path is basically the URL path as this path okay if it's detailed we go to detail page if it's homepage path is slash it's the home page raise your hand that makes sense does that make sense yes or no comprende yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes beautiful right that's going to be the home page and now let's go ahead and take a look at that all right so if I save this now technically I'm in the home page you see nothing really changed but if I go to slash detail boom we are on a detailed component you see the header still stays which is right here which is exactly we want to do right but the detail component which is this one says detail how sick is that what do you guys think you guys like that I think it's pretty cool all right so that's pretty cool so on the details now let's go ahead and focus on the detail page inside here well the detail page is a little bit longer than some other pages so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and do import styled from style components style Dash components okay so import style from style Dash components okay and a few things are going to happen here in the detail page of course let's go and make this a container as we like to do all the time so we'll say container container just like so all right beautiful not defined that's not a problem whatsoever so we say now const the phone will do the following so const container is equal to what oh is equal to style dot div right there okay start the div okay and this dialogue is going to be pretty pretty simple uh same thing we're gonna give it a Min height just how it did it for home so Min height I mean height I mean height I mean height is going to be calc a hundred vertical hey vertical height 100 VH minus 70 pixel step 70 pixels basically that's the that's that top bar right there okay awesome and then we'll get also pattern just how we did we give a pattern to the homepage too so padding which is this one so zero calc 3.5 for ver no VW basically means um width so basically that's the viewport width so 3.5 viewport width right there ah right there beautiful see all right so that's all good now of course if you think about this what does this have let's think about what does this specific thing have well it has a few things in terms of components well we have this this is the main component correct but this component is actually has a background you see it has a background image right so we can call the background image and then we have this kind of like logo and then we have I like to think of it as like a roll so right see you see I always think of I see things as rows and columns this to me is a row that contains multiple columns column of one button another button third button and fourth button right then we have another row that has this then another row that has the description basically of the thing do you understand that yes or no right yes all good yes yes yes yes yes good awesome sweet so that's what that has okay all right now and we can simply just honestly based on look at what we just have you can see we can do it so the first we need to create is the background is the background component so let's create the background component so we'll say background background boom background component and we'll give it an image source is equal to the following right and maybe if a monthly maybe because can help me out and actually give them this image source and this image stores again you can use any image source you want but in my in my case I have this one which maybe I can give it to you guys in chat here I'll go take us in chat boom that's the image I use okay that's the image I used let's just basically just this image right here all right okay that's the image and then so that's going to be the component if I go ahead and save that okay we have an error says background is not defined so it's a const const background is equal to styled dot div style.div the first other dip beautiful okay oh let's go look at that I mean it looks horrible but it's still it's kind of there right now adjust how I did our background image we're going to position it also fixed to the whole page so as we'll do we'll do the position fixed position fixed you see boom change right here we'll say top zero top zero right we'll say left zero just how I would like to do it left zero bottom zero right and then what a right zero right zero okay okay boom right there right zero okay now again it looks a little bit odd here I can see that right right there don't worry about that we'll make it work don't worry and then here's what we'll do in that case right so and then position fix about position fix to what well position fix to the actual container so we'll say here position relative remember if you're doing position absolute position fixed you have to use position relative because it will fix it to the relative parent kind of like you have to have a parent kind of like that you know you will have a parent right so position relative save that right nothing really changes here in the in those terms but what does change is the following look at this I'm going to now Target the image itself image right and I'm going to say here the image here is with a hundred percent with a hundred percent good and height of what of 100 as well okay I know it got stretched out but don't worry because what we can do is we can say object fit object Dash fit is gonna be what cover I want you guys to look into that cover boom see oh Moly Moly now you can see it just covered the whole thing right which is don't worry about that don't you know um so to prevent that from covering the whole thing it's very it's as simple as well I'll just put a z index minus one on it so that's it look okay Z index minus one and now the header shows as well and yeah that's it's as simple as that nothing too crazy you have to you have to honestly do let's add some more let's add a small opacity to something opacity fast is 0.8 oh so it's a little bit darker you see that a little bit darker and honestly that is that background image that is done comprende yes all good beautiful awesome sweet all right so I like that let's now go back to our what go back to our top and let's think about what else do we have well we also have this thing which is this which I like to call a title so so basically that's done now let's call let's you let's focus on this one right focusing down so that's going to be the title okay and we'll call it image title which title boom and we'll also give an image image source and I also have that source for now again this data will come later on from a database so don't worry about that okay then we're going to copy this image so you guys can all have it and I'll paste in the chat as well maybe a month a month after div you can paste it in the comments on YouTube as well that'd be awesome thank you okay I'm gonna paste it here boom okay all right so that's gonna be that all right let's go to our application here so it's the images are not defined of course we Define it in using style.div nothing crazy here let's do the following and we say what image title and no Define it first image title is equal to styled dot div done oh let's go that looks like I mean not that much but it's not bad again we can also use some really really cool things with that right so image Title Here we're going to give it a height of 30 VH protocol height okay right and don't worry about it we'll focusate on the image and then we'll we'll give the image so here's here's the thing with images give it a parent container and then on the image say with 100 and do object fit that is your recipe for any good image sizing give a parent container right a container to contain once you've done that on the image say with 100 100 and then give it an object fit that is your your goto that should be your goto okay so do image same thing with a hundred percent okay a height of a hundred percent yeah look at this object fixed this time the however contained right boom big difference huh much big difference much big difference right don't worry we'll make it a better even right now so as we'll do I'll do uh width of this one is going to be 35 BW viewport with right there see that makes it even better and then we give it a minute let's go ahead and give it a Min height just in case main height main height of 170 pixels beautiful and then we'll do a main width of 200 pixels men with of 200 pixels all right so nothing created just has changed but all we know is that this is working this image is great right so let's uh we're getting very close to where we want to get to all right next up what we need to do is next up is we need to go ahead and focus on what that's going to be kind of like this content right here all this content right here I want to focus now on the controls you see this on the controls so let's go ahead and focus on the controls here so I want to say the following I'm going to say here controls let's go ahead and do ah controls right here I'm going to create the controls con so controls oh controls controls container boom controls and all that will simply do is very simple let's go ahead and that will contain the play button and stuff like that right so let's go ahead and install that div foreign controls const controls is equal to styled dot div okay and inside here it's very simple we have four buttons here one two three four okay one two three on that side it's very simple now at this point we need to create four buttons One's Gonna Be the play button so when you hear the play button okay got crushed on it then we do the trailer button trailer button okay and then we have the add button so let's go ahead and add that one too add button beautiful and then we have the group watch button oh watch button go watch button there we go awesome sweet so that's kind of that so group watch button is what we're focusing on right now at this point okay let's go ahead and create all these buttons right right so let's go ahead and do the bottom let's go to the bottom we don't need any of this just yet okay let's go to the bottom and we'll just go ahead and focus on the buttons himself so let's do the following so here we'll say const play button right is equal to styled dot div right that's that okay next one's gonna be which one next is going to be the trailer button so it's a const triller button foreign same thing here NASA is going to be const which one the add button right here and that's going to go to styled.div as well dot div boom nice last one is going to be the group watch button oop oops oopsie Daisy group watch button is equal to also style that div all right let's see what these now have inside okay so let's try this let's go and take a look at this nothing they have absolutely nothing but also we made it with small mistakes because this needs actually be a button so we need to go call this button not this but but you see button button button button okay so that's it we've got ourselves a bug that have nothing inside them right now but we'll fix that here in a little bit okay so let's go and take a look at the actual buttons on what we need to have inside them well the button will Purge part one the bodies will have uh kind of like things inside of it right so every single button well let's look at the play button first for example here so play button has what the play icon and the text play so we'll give it an image here so we'll do image image source is equal to equal to what is equal to Dash images okay Dash the play icon black button that we have actually inside our images which we downloaded by the way right here boom okay so that's the one we need to use okay that's gonna be our images inside the play button and then we need to go ahead and create a span and that's going to say play right there play as component capitalized so it's easier for us yeah let's look at this oh let's go it looks so bad but it's there right let's do the same thing with the trailer Button as well so we can focus on two at the same time okay so do the trailer button at the same time same thing with this one that's going to copy this image put it in the trailer button right but this time the trailer button is going to be play icon White not black but white this one hopefully you guys are still with me all right and then we have what then we have the span right now spinning so old it's just a wrapper and that will be what the Thriller button that's it okay all right so now we have two buttons you can see here one is trillion one is played they have different styling for them so that's what we need to what we need to focus on now at this point let's go let's go now to our play button and a few things that we need to focus on on the play button well a few things let's think about part one let's think about the Border radius right so we need to go ahead because it kind of looks horrible right now so do border radius radius right and let's give it four pixels body radius so it's a little bit cleaner and software so what it is four pixels and so forth okay next up let's change the font size of this so we'll do font size just a bit of a more of a font size okay all right so it's a little bit bigger now at the same time now you can see how these play buttons oh look let me go ahead and remove this portion right here we don't need that you see this butt play button so you see how they're not kind of like aligned aligned uh horizontal vertically correct so we can do this use display flag so it's in display Flex foreign tically align them okay oh don't worry about that don't worry about that that's fine and I will say here align items a line line a line with their items Center boom boom you see now the play button is aligned now let's go ahead and make sure that all of these but are aligned horizontally as well to do that we do go to controls and I say here display Flex display Flex flex and what do we say you see that puts them in a in a row by row fashion because by default the flex direction is rho not column you see and so we go that puts them into like the it's one row basically right into one row all right so that's good Flex direction is basically in the one row now let's go ahead and do the following for the play button let's give it a height let's go to height or 56 pixels all right so it's a little bit a little bit bigger okay and let's uh do the following let's go ahead and give a um let's think about this here for a second I will go ahead and actually say background color it's good just change the background color for this one so say background color I'll just do this boom so background color should be that now of course it's not that just yet let's go ahead and remove the Border border border can you see how we had the Border that's a hideous right now hey there we go so much better look at that so much better all right let's also add a little bit species on the left hand side and the right hand side and to do that all we do is we simply just do uh padding right so we do padding so padding zero pixels on the top or bottom and the butt on the left and right will do 24 pixels simple as that right there see and now let's go ahead and add um uh let's add some margins so let's do margin right you see to make sure that it pushes this trailer one so we'll do a margin right here margin Dash right like this and we'll give it a 24 22 pixel margin oh boom done look at that it's already getting much much better than what we'll want to do let's also in terms of color the black color that's all good I like that uh let me think about what else do well so we think should we do let's add some lighter spacing let's change that up a little bit here as well so letter spacing just to space it out a little bit more spacing and we'll do 1.8 pixels right just spaces out just a bit more just more so it's yeah I like that a lot better actually yeah I like a lot better and that's good okay that's awesome and let's of course let's make it a cursor pointer too right so that means when I can click on it when I can hover over it because right now it's not a cursor pointer right so let's do cursor pointer cursor let's do a pointer boom all right oh something happened oh right here right there so now if I hold it see it's a cursor pointed now okay good so now we're not there yet okay not there yet I like that now let's go look at the back let's glue now let's think about the hover uh solution so on the hover of this we're going to use this again so on the hover of this on this whole button we're going to change the background color just a little bit right so here background see this boom so now oh boom boom boom you see it right there boom boom okay good so I like that that's amazing that's awesome now the same thing is gonna happen with the trailer button right with the trailer button now check this portion out the trailer button right has the same style as this except it changes a few things like for example the background color well check out what we can do we can actually import it we can actually use like for example it's kind of like polymorphism you know in classes but in our case we can actually kind of like import the style so I'll do styled play button look at this style play button see now it's the same great great great great way but all I gotta do if you need to know in order to change color all I do is the following I say background is going to be the following so it's the back is going to be a little bit more darker here foreign and we're almost done guys guys we're almost done for today by the way just want to let you guys know that almost done okay I like that let's do a little bit give it a little bit more of a border so I I like that too more of a border one pixel solid so kind of like a white border as well and let's go ahead and let's do the following let's do a color so let's go ahead and do more of a white color I guess like a more of a lighter white color boom look at that oh let's go now of course also I kind of want to if I go to here Ah that's fine that's great oh let's go guys how cool does that look now all right uh let's make sure this text text transform actually let's do text transform uppercase so make sure it's text transformed to make sure it's all applications text transform this form let's do uppercase to make sure it's all uppercase okay save that boom done holy man look at this guys that's so good okay so I like that so play Trilla that's all there I love that portion okay let me go let me go I'll call this close this out we have a few more ones which is going to be the add button so far let's go ahead and focus on the add button which looks a little bit more different right it has like it only has it's just one icon right so in the add button all we're going to do is just simply just an image so that's all we'll do so in the ad and the uh in uh the add button and all that will be is simply just like a background a background image let me let me think about this for a second here so in the app add list button uh it would just be like a plus that we need to go ahead and add and that's pretty much it so if you look at it here look at this inspect you see here we have this span span so it actually creates like a really interesting solution but I don't want to do it that way actually I actually want to do a little bit differently you see I'm going to just simply do a plus icon or just just simply just a plus that we're going to use inside our thing so look at this I'll see I will say here as I will say span I will say here span oops span plus right I know nothing crazy so far right but don't worry it's gonna happen right so to make this this one happen what's gonna happen is we're gonna give it a height and a width as well so let's go to the add button okay let's go ahead and give it a width all 44 pixels let's give it a height of 44 pixels okay good so that's that's awesome sweets that makes me that makes me happy next up uh let's go ahead and just how did it in the other one let's go ahead and do uh display Flex play Flex right okay and now let's focus on the span as you span here let's do spin and let's change the font size of this one to be more so font size this would be maybe 16 pixels 18 pixels let's see maybe maybe more what do you guys think 24 pixels 26 pixels yeah it's about that ah I would say 30. there we go much better right all right so display Flex we're gonna do now align item Center to align everything inside there horizontally or vertically align Center okay and then we'll do Justified Contest Center to do align it horizontal all right so justify content Center foreign justify content Justified that content is going to be Center done so that that's a very nicely centered uh so forth let's do border release to give it a nice circular border for this radius 50 of course nice look at that it's time to look a button right I like that all right so that's really cool that's really cool motor radius all right and let's go ahead and do a background let's do that let's do background let's give it a border actually border of white so border here is gonna be white okay so it's a white border that's awesome let's give it a different background color too a background color should be this as well done look at that right let's also do a color white color white on the actual span oh let's go look at that and then we'll do a cursor pointer on the actual full button so we'll do cursor cursor pointer boom right there and honestly that's that's pretty pretty much it we'll do here again there we go and then we'll do a margin right of 16 pixels to push the other button away so margin margin Dash right will be 16 pixels good so let's go ahead and save that all right save that all right it's going to refresh that beautiful oh it looks so good so good now you can see here that this button is not vertically aligned with all these other ones you see how it's kind of more the top versus more centered so how would we go ahead and do that to make sure it's fully centered well that's a very very simple solution honestly again display Flex so to do that we go to our parent which is the controls the controls controls the controls controls everything right so we go to controls errors and controls display flags and we do align items look at this Center and watch it boom you see this just became centered just like that it's so simple right so that's right there is going to be our plus plus button all right last button that we're going to focus on is going to be that's our button right there let me see right there last one is going to be the group watch button okay and I think it probably is the Sim similar button that we should use a music coupon button but this one's gonna have an image so let's try that right out so this one has an image right here so group watch button okay let's add an image here okay and we'll get a source is equal to okay is equal to what well we have a group icon that we can use right there so this is in your images folder if you downloaded it from the drive right there okay that's your image okay so that's good group watch button I like that that's awesome and again we'll do the same thing I think I think it's worth doing like the same thing which is also with 44 pixels and everything everything's pretty much uh you know similar so let's try that so we'll do I think we can probably let me see I can probably use styled actually this add button look at this guys I button oops no this other one okay so that's good all we need to do is just differentiate the color a little bit a little bit because you can see here it's a little more darker color here so we'll differentiate the color here just a little bit but giving it a darker a darker background color which is actually more of a more of a it's actually more of a background color black boom boom done done done that's it done look at that oh oh oh how good is that what do you guys think are you guys still with it yes or no we've got ourselves you see well very slowly we're turning out to have an amazing solution here an amazing product like you know little by little we have CSS going so far look at this guys all right look at all these CSS we just did all using style components that's pretty pretty epic I will say so all right and we're not too far off from actually being fully done right now we have a subtitle that I'm gonna do description and that's pretty pretty much it so let's go ahead and do that let's go finish this up let's finish it up with a button you guys oh oh all right let's take a bottle break all right beautiful that's amazing that's exactly what I'm talking about all right last thing that we go ahead I need to do is well it's the following okay so let's go ahead and take a look at it all right by the way how is Facebook doing how's YouTube doing by the way let's see we got 400 people 224 people on YouTube still let's go that's amazing good to see all of you guys so good to see all of you guys so many people you guys are commenting nonstop every single time that's awesome that's awesome someone said you had to hide the arrows while arrows no I didn't do not do not need to hide anything I've got everything here I need fully all right all right let's go ahead and do one last thing here that we need to go ahead and do all right by the way guys on YouTube can we please get to a thousand likes is that possible can we get to a thousand likes on YouTube That'll be amazing those of you on Zoom are you guys pumped yes or no with me raise your hand raise your hand if you're still with me yes yes yes beautiful that's what I'm talking about all right next thing oh we need to kind of focus on is going to be now this detail page which is a list page right here I can actually just copy this for now temporarily I'm going to copy this and I'm going to call a subtitle here so let's go ahead and create a subtitle component so let's go ahead and do this so we'll do subtitle here actually not not inside the controls but actually it's outside of control so we'll do subtitle sub sub title okay I subtitle and that's going to contain the actual text which is this is temporary text okay placeholder text that's what that's all we know okay and then inside there we're going to create the description and I'll give you guys you know the actual text if you need text but you can put anything you want in there right you you don't even need just put anything you want let's just that's temporary until we actually get it from the database so for now just put anything you want in there okay so that's Shin okay all right let's go and copy this right boom done nothing too fancy like I said right nothing too fancy at all all right of course when if we go back to our application says something that's not defined that's the normal usual thing so what we need to do we need to Define it so we'll say the following so do style.div so const subtitle go ahead make sure you guys can see the top here subtitle is equal to styled dot div beautiful style that dip awesome sweet nice so let's start the dev and that's amazing let's do something with the same thing with description const ipation is equal to styled dot div as well all right all right Maddie's oh what just happened what happened description the heck I did not okay good wait holy moly I will not just kill the whole application with this that'd be funny if I did though all right so for the subtitle it shouldn't be anything too crazy let's go ahead and um change the color just be a little bit more of a lighter color so I'm gonna do command click on this command click and this takes me the actual style so that's one thing you actually can use color which is this color okay save that it's a just very light color Okay font size 15 pixels find this if so let's go ahead make this a little bit there you go a smaller font size let's do Min height uh main height of 20 pixels as well okay let's also give a margin top margin top let's do margin top margin top 26 pixels to give it a a uh what's it called there we go just to push a little more to the bottom here you see just to push it more to the bottom right here I like that okay snap pushes more to the bottom and then same thing with description let's go ahead and do that so now if we're in description let's look at the description here okay awesome that's pretty simple similar one as well right uh let's do we'll change the line height here for a little bit so we'll do line height line height or say 1.4 so so it creates more of a spacing you see I kind of like that a lot more let's do fonts let's give it more of a font size a bigger font size so font size 20 pixels so it's a bigger text boom beautiful let's do padding top is going to be so we'll do margin top is actually going to be much top 16 pixels boom nice I like that awesome sweet let's do the same thing with the color right there same with the color ah yes and well I mean that's that's pretty much it look at that holy moly let's go that's pretty much it guys how cool is that what do you guys think we have ourselves a detail page now yes it does not connect directly to the thing that's gonna have the connection is gonna happen tomorrow the whole Redux all of that that's gonna happen tomorrow although Redux connecting right you know the reactor down with three Ducks actually pull and then data from a Firebase that's going to happen tomorrow who's excited for that let me know in the comments below who decide for that one that's gonna be pretty cool that's pretty cool it's not easy but we'll do it all right and the last thing that I kind of maybe want to touch on is potentially the login page so let's go and touch on the login page I think they'll be a lot of fun as well okay login page should not be anything too crazy so we'll just touch on the login page a little bit as well so what we have here well we have the detail page which is here boom okay we have ourselves at the detail page oh that's the home page then we have the detail page okay and then let's go ahead and create a login page uh well a login page as well with this all right let me see so to do this let's go and create a login component so let's go ahead first is first let's go ahead and do add detail page and uh detail page in our commit as always okay and let's do this let's do components let's do a login page so right click new file we'll do login .js boom login.js let's do rfce boom that creates the login page and so forth right okay so that's going to be the login page okay and then what we'll do is very simple we'll to make this happen let's go to our home to our app.js and if there's a route that says the login route we'll just take it there so say route path is equal to what let's just say login slash login and what do we do what do we do well we import the login component so we say import login from where from dot dash components Dash what login dunzo okay so marginal file you tend to import components let me see components of log and I create one oh it should be there let me see outside the project folder all because of this right here done done ah awesome sweet let's go and do that awesome so that's good and so now we go to this you should we should use the logging components let's try to try that login component oh done all right let's go and go now let's go to our logging component oh let's go login boom login is what we got and if we go to login in the in our actual build function sign out here's our login component you can see not you know nothing nothing crazy so far okay nothing crazy so far and this is where we will be very smart okay you can see how the header is still the same but it changes when the login point is different so we'll do that tomorrow that's part of Redux we'll have we'll make that tomorrow but today is we'll focus on this portion right here right we'll focus on this push we'll create this button which is beautiful we'll create this image right here and then this stuff right here as well so a few different things I welcome to create right now so let's go look into well what components do we have for this well few things we have the actual container that's the width 100 right okay then what I like to let me go ahead and put a rectangle here so we have this okay and then we have I like to call the content section why because it gets centered horizontally and vertically you see if I go ahead and look at the brush see it gets sent horizontally centered and also vertically right that's that right and then of course inside that we have a few different things we have well what do we have we have a few logos so we have a kind of like uh let me see I'm going to rectangle here the logo here that's going to become that's going to be component that we're going to use as well then let me see let me see then we have a button called get all there button okay and then finally we have a description get Premiere access and then finally we have another logo code like this that's it that's pretty much it so uh with that being said let's just look into what we do so let's go to login page it's got a login page I mean a lot of is hideous right now but but Logan page let's start up with the container okay so oh let's go and import style so import styled guys we're almost done we're going to create the login page and then we're almost done for today and then we'll finish up tomorrow okay so import styled from style Dash component okay all right from stylish components okay that's awesome and this one let's go ahead and create a container here okay let's do const container is equal to styled dot div beautiful style.df that's amazing okay so now okay a few things are gonna happen here at this point let's do the same thing remember in the con in specific container we need to one is we need to kind of change up this image which is a pretty cool image that's pretty pretty sweet and we need to add that background image in a little bit here so let's go ahead and add a uh well we can do a few things here the same thing we did before remember how we did that before let's do it right now so inside here look at this let's do a before just we'll do before so we'll do position relative here position relative okay and we'll do the whole before thing which is what did the last time to add those background images right so we did like this put it like this before right like so right and of course number one I need to give this uh the container to give this a height so the height for this one is gonna be just how did the last time is a hundred VH minus 70 pixels done done okay 100 VH minus 70 pixels that's going to be just how we had to follow these other ones we do the same thing for this one okay okay good before so that's gonna be this relative now before with this specific specific one is we're going to add a background image so let's go and do this so we'll say here we'll say position absolute absolute absolute I will say top zero zero we'll say bottom zero bottom zero okay we'll say content is nothing comes with nothing right the Jaws that we had in the detail page right by the site is just in this case we had the background was like you know we used an image inside that which is completely fine don't worry about that right content is nothing and then we will say go ahead and then bottom left zero right zero as well zero good all right and now check this out now right all right that's supposed to and then we'll do of course this to hold the whole Z index now now this point that's pretty much good so position relative on that that's all good I like the height here nothing crazy here let's do a background image now so say background Dash image okay and we'll give it this URL that's the login we have a background image so we have a special login background image that we have which looks a little bit like this boom right now you don't really see it right now don't worry about that so what's gonna happen now this point is default position absolute top zero bottom zero left zero right zero okay let me make sure it's all good that's all great position before they created before all right let me see or maybe it's after no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's like this wait wait wait um it's after hold on before there's no before here that's interesting maybe it's after here let me see maybe it's after you guys see what I'm talking about let's see hmm see how did I do before let me see am I missing something here before no technically it's good like this before back on URL same thing that was the image slider right here before foreign fixed position absolute top right content zero position relative okay bottom zero okay that's interesting all right let's see so before let's go back to our login page yeah that's right but to our login page here do command P to go back to login okay so the content nothing top zero bottom zero left zero is your background image is that one so do like this okay let's see just don't understand why it's not editing before content let me see content hmm that's very interesting I don't understand why okay let me move this image for now okay what if I do exactly the way I had it before before I don't understand why otherwise it would just not work let's go to log in the Js log in the Gs let's see you guys do you guys see any issues that I don't see or no or am I blind to this wait now it has a before now I did so what was I doing before that was not right what what I do before same Ampersand Time same colon same before what oh man this is not cool anyway special absolute good okay well I mean I'm not sure without bite that hat but that made that that happens sometimes it's a cold not semicolon absolute is a colon not semicolon oh is that why because I had this one wrong okay interesting so probably because of the thing okay that's fine so let's go ahead and in our login that that makes sense okay so we'll change the background image I do not need this right now good it's a background image Dash image boom oh there we go so much better we'll do a background position top position top okay so start from the top we'll do a background size cover so it covers the full thing so background round size cover okay nice I like every size cover and then Becca said no repeat so does not repeat basically the whole thing at all no repeat no repeat beautiful and that's it we've got ourselves a background which just looks so good now again this right here we'll change later on okay the most important thing is now let's go ahead and change up this stuff so now we need so we have this portion which is great let's focus now on the the actual what's it called the actual content so let's create the content which I'm gonna call the content yeah I'm gonna call it the content box content box that's what I'm gonna call it the content box Okay so content box right here beautiful content box and inside this content box is where for example our logos will be so for example actually maybe let's call it CTA box some of this a call to action box SATA what do you guys think maybe call a CTA for now CTA and inside here we'll have what will have the following we'll have CTA logo one so let's do this CTA logo one as could be an image and then there'll also be a CDA logo two later on so let's start with the CTA logo one which has a source we'll say source is equal to first is equal to right here and there will be right here CTA logo one which we have in our images folder boom done right there CTA okay and I'm just so if you go back to here of course we have an issue here so CTA that means you to create a stock component so let's do so let's go ahead and do this so we'll do const CTA CTA equals styled dot div okay that's part one and then CTA logo one is going to be an image so okay const CTA logo one is equal to what style dot image boom boom hey right there it's okay don't worry this refresh this will work okay good awesome so that's fine that's awesome no problem whatsoever so now with this specific thing let's go ahead and I kind of wanted a um let me think about this here what height should we give it I think we should give it a a specific height I think we should give it I should give it a specific uh height and width so let's do this for the CTA let's do a Max width Max was good to do some Max with of 650 pixels for example okay awesome and I also want to give it a specific uh let's do a top a specific padding on specific padding so let's do padding so top is going to be 80 pixels top bottom 80 pixels and left and right are going to be 40 pixels all right there you see I like that okay now so you see this kind of becomes that the whole dynamic here uh but actually yeah that's right yeah that's right yeah so now to make it all work properly what we need to do is uh we need to on this container we need to give the position not position but display Flex Flex to make sure it's all centered and then oh well we'll just go display Flex I know where I just went and then we'll do a line item Center where did the thing just go where'd you go don't leave all right so I'll bring it back okay that's interesting so if I don't if I don't do display Flex it's fine this play relax all right that's fine that's a Justified content maybe as well justify content Center hmm Max with I don't like the fact that CTA is just not showing up just kind of like that so that doesn't make sense at all um this one said the DF that's this one before oh it's here just it does not have a width that's why that's fine we'll give it a whisp we'll give it with right now uh let's give it a width of 58 let's get a width with all let's just say 50 percent there we go let's do more like 60 or something there we go maybe 70. there we go I like that okay that's good I like that okay and of course it's centered right there but you know then once we put another stuff it'll be centered normally so okay just for kind of sentence that's basically it's fully center now in this position that's amazing I like that portion the next I need to do is create the sign up button so that will be inside here so we'll do sign up sign up so create a sign up button so sign up sign up right there and then inside here we'll say get all there remember just like how they had it here so get all there get all there let's increase this width a little bit more maybe like 80 I would say so okay same thing let's do const sign up equals styled dot what style Dot style dot it's gonna be actually it looks like it's an a tag actually it's an a tag right there done right there see all right awesome sweet sweet so that is all great um I like that portion nice so that's gonna be good next thing let's go ahead and actually make that make this into a proper button well to make that happen they get all there we need to give the number one a specific width so let's do that so we'll say width width of a hundred percent okay that's fine I will do a background color and we'll give it this background color which is this one bull right there save that okay again not not nothing crazy right now right but that's again nothing don't worry about that just yet okay we'll do font away here bold font wait bold okay and then what we want to do is inside this CTA is we need to we want to display Flex on this one so to the cell so if we display Flex on this one and no that's the only way to make this a tag all the way fully uh full width display Flex through this out right right so I know this one to the left hand side to the right hand side but to fix that what we do is do Flex Direction so Flex Direction column yeah column right that's not to fix the the top to bottom see now it's fully kind of like top and bottom and so forth okay so I like that PlayStation column and then what I want to do is I want to give it a some kind of uh what's it called the the actual sign up button I want to give it a a padding a top padding so let's do this so right here we'll do padding 17 pixels oops to give it a top and bottom pixel and zero picks on the left and right oh no not that one hold on not here not on the button here my bad good good good good good good good good I like it I like it I like it like Dutch oh yes I do like it like that beautiful so at that point that's all good uh let's go ahead and change the color here just a little bit more so we'll do color that's awesome let's change the colors a little bit more boom right there okay okay let's get a border radius okay again to get those curvature a little bit you can see guys like all we're doing is CSS right now it's crazy huh border radius and I'll make it four pixels nice look at that next let's go ahead and do a text align Center oh let's go look at that would you look at that that's pretty awesome let's give the boy a what's it called a I mean I don't know let's give it a border don't don't worry about the Border just yet so that's good let's do a font size let's change the font size here a little bit so font there's size font size 18 pixels so it's a little bit bigger okay I like that I like that let's do a cursor pointer so that let's do a cursor Point down here cursor pointer okay so that boom it's a button now awesome sweet let's go ahead and that's pretty good so I like that portion let's do now at this point let's go ahead and let me see let me think about this here let's do a uh yeah that's pretty good let's do a hover effect so if I go hover over on this now so I'm going to say hover hover what are we gonna change well what we want to change is actually the missing about this you see you want to change the background color a little bit here that's the that's what I do so let's do it right now so on the hover of this let's change the background background to be this specific one good save that boom boom boom boom boom boom we could do a small transition even at this point too so we'll do another example transition all and then you can do things like for example uh 250 milliseconds there boom you see much better okay awesome sweet I like that and that looks to be all good let's do letter spacing let's face this out a little bit so ladder spacing of 1.5 pixels nice so it's a little bit bigger now you see that guys you see that beautiful that's all there okay all right so that's I like that let's go ahead maybe add a margin top let's do margin top margin Dash top maybe like let's just say 8 pixels there we go just space that just a little bit more and let's do margin bottom 12 pixels so margin margin bottom for the next element done all right there we go awesome so that's all good next up next up is we have this kind of stuff right here nothing too crazy here so let's do the following so the description that's called description so I'll add the description here so we'll call description component corruption component right there description component and then I'm going to copy this you guys can go ahead and copy this for yourself as well again you can put anything you want in here like you have right here description and I'll post it paste on you guys for the chat let's go ahead right there I will paste the description for you guys here boom done all right that's the description I'm going to create a description component that's the next thing so we need to do const description right is equal to what styled styled that what that div right that's what we need to create and then once we have that actually knows do style.p a P tag let's use because you use it so you see when you style components you can use P tag a tags pretty much anything at this point that's awesome all right I like that so that's good let's go ahead and do the following now we do color colors girls could do font size 11 pixels 11 pixels make it a lot smaller there we go let's do um let's do line height let's do letter space actually letter spacing we'll make it um 1.5 pixels just spread up just a little bit nice I like it we'll also do text align Center text align Center nice I like it I like it like that oh beautiful nice and and then let's see uh line height 1.5 let's see line height 1.5 save that boom all right so much better I like that and then there we have finally at that point we have our last one let's go ahead and make this a little bit bigger again I keep wanting to make this like 90 or something you know I know why and then we'll move this up to the bottom we'll move this up a little bit too later on don't worry good awesome I like that that's not and then we have finding the last logo of the day it's gonna be CTA logo two so let's do that right now solder here so how did the TTA logo one I'm going to copy this portion right here I'm going to put it into here so CDA logo two and this is going to be logo two which is this one two done guys we're almost done almost done it's insane almost so close so glad you're So Far So Close you're so far all right all right same thing with this one CT basically it's gonna be the same one as uh yeah logo two go and do this all right oh wait wait I Define let's define His Image so CTO logo too const uh CTA oops CTA logo 2. equals dialed dot image there you go check this out now hold on oh it's not there that's okay let's go and take a look at it again CJ local to oh because PNG not SVG my bad oh let's go beautiful let's make it a little bit smaller I want to make it just a little bit smaller um and to do that I'm just going to add some padding on the right at the left and the right okay so let's do that around this one so I'm going to say here oh actually no this is good honestly I kind of like it though I kind of like this I want to start this more uh this is kind of vertically bonus out of this better a little bit better so we did do a line out of Center but I would rather do it kind of line items top here right minus top just how we have it here and then that's part one and then I kind of want to do it where uh that's pretty good I like that I like that and I'm gonna do opacity here opacity here let's say 0.8 a bit more 0.7 just a little bit more of a darker theme you see I like that let's do a margin top actually on this whole shebang so let's do let me see let me think about this actually I kind of like that maybe let's do margin top on this specific thing marched up on the whole container I'll do a margin top oops something just happened margin top I'm almost done guys here's some margin that's top monitors topless to 200 pixels no not this one on the content itself GTA here the goal almost done no let's do 150. no let's do a hundred and we're there guys that is pretty much it look at that oh that looks good maybe maybe make actually let's maybe make this image maybe make this a little bit smaller maybe let me see a width of let's see wait 90 percent and there we go and then inside here we'll go ahead and do T da da just like content is d8 so we'll do Justified content in the CTA to make sure it's all good Justified no actually align item Center align item Center you see how currently it's not aligned like this you see you see how let me go ahead and remove this for you guys um you secretly it's not aligned or horizontally well we can maybe we can fix it by saying item Center but yeah right there see but not see usually when you do when you do horizontal a line you want to use Justified content Center but because we did a flex Direction column right and then they switch align items changes to horizontal Direction just if a Content changes the vertical Direction so it's actually the switch in terms of uh yeah I know it's just weird like that for some reason but yeah that's pretty much it guys look at this we have ourselves the the image we have ourselves everything we have ourselves I know it's a little weird because we have the login so let's take a look at what do we have look at this we have all you guys who are on hold on guys we've finished we finished the login the home page we finished the the detail page all it's done is tomorrow we connect them all together all that happens is tomorrow we create Redux to connect the data we use Firebase to get the data from Firebase then we basically set the movies to actually basically so when I go for example here to movies here let's go ahead and do the home page here right I want to be able to see actual actual movies on here not just movies that are you know images and then I should be able to log in log out no problem whatsoever like when I should be able to log out from here log in using fibers authentication and you guys will learn all of that tomorrow how sick is that who's excited guys check this out we've done all this look at this let's go detail here slash detail page sagittal page foam oh not that one hold on detail holy moly this is exciting oh so good let's give it a command uh boom oh let's kill the action I need to give this a Max width actually yeah we'll we'll do that tomorrow don't worry guys the max width let's actually give the max to itself what is it what is the max width of this thing should be maybe 700 pixels 900 pixels I think so let's go to the detail page let's fix this for a second here just go here detail boom let's fix the description here this one Max width Max width what is it 500 pixels what do you guys think here yeah see now let's do a 760. I like that better but my dad that's so much better awesome look at that oh that looks so good let's give let's actually give this logo a little bit more of a margin top I like that this uh image title let's give that image title a little bit larger top so let's do oh margin top it will do 20 pixels oh now let's do a margin top Maybe 40. let's do 100 no 60 pixels oh let's go there we go that looks so good if we now go to our home page what do we have we have ourselves movies whoa look at that we can hover over them you can go to next ones this is application that we built I can hover over these look at this oh that looks so good let's go raise your hand if if you thought that was epic raise your hand Juliana did you were able to actually fully finish it with me Juliana yeah partially partially that's awesome guys for those of you who did not were not able to finish it don't worry this the recording is you know it's through zoom and it's also on YouTube it's actually on YouTube right here so if you were not able to finish it no problem guys that's pretty much it for YouTube people guys we are currently what we're still at what 200 people watching guys this is insane insane I will say guys pretty much the best the best thing I've done like this is I mean this is so much fun for me personally look at what we've built here look at what we have done I mean this is like hold on this is pretty much like the best thing of I mean I don't know I have so much fun did you guys have fun raise your have you had fun doing this raise your hand if you had fun building this application guys yeah there we go all right for those of you who are on YouTube guys for those of you who are on the zoom stay tuned make sure you stay on Zoom okay I'm unit no I cannot be hold on hello hello hello can you guys hear me can you guys hear me or no oh there we go I know what happened there but for some reason got muted on on the thing let me make sure I don't know why I just actually oh don't do it just yet bro not yet not yet bro not yet bro okay okay let me show because I cannot hear myself at this point hold on uh uh okay can you hear me can you talk okay good so yeah guys like I said for those of you guys uh those of you guys who are on YouTube this was a ton of fun right part two is gonna be for tomorrow if you want to join our react.js challenge that is where we're building this whole thing right if you want to join us go ahead and join us down below in the description below right join the JavaScript Challenge and we'll finish this up fully to the event we did this Disney clone part one tomorrow Disney Club part two we're finishing up this whole thing we'll be able to deploy it and actually use it together right on top of that on top of that we'll be talking about how to become a full stack developer a full stack developer with react.js in 2021 so go ahead and click the link below there should be a react.js challenge link to join if you're interested I got guys other than that it has been pretty it's been fun I would say it's been fun guys uh those of you on YouTube like I said a lot of fun thank you guys so much a thousand likes to reach let's go that's amazing thank you so much so much for all the energy you guys put into this right it has been a ton of fun I really enjoyed it guys so yeah have yourselves a great day today the Disney clone that you see right here we had day one in the previous video where we focused on building up the home page like this we focus on building the login page that looks like this right here login we also focus on building the the detail page it looks like this as well so right there and we've done all this yesterday and day one so if you're interested we have a video and down in the description below for you to go ahead and check out but other than that let's go ahead and continue with what we're doing so like I said our goal is to be able to get to this right we are building a Disney clone we have a react slick for react slider which looks like this we are using Firebase for authentication right here right we're using beautiful animations with CSS if you scroll down right here oh if you click on something to be able to get to the next page we are using react water down right here beautiful right and if we go to login so let's go and sign out here for a second if I click login again this using Firebase authentication beautiful and to keep to make all this work to keep the state managed we are using Redux for State Management common together it's all working so beautiful so nicely it is user friendly it is mobile friendly and so we're just going to continue on with building this beautiful um from the last time from the last time what have we done from the last time we have our project that's basically like this right here right as our project we have a few files we have the main files let me go ahead and show it to you here detail home page right here home page header image slider login movies and viewers right and all this contribute to application that is pretty much the way it is right now nothing crazy so far because right now our goal is very simple the number one goal I'm going to do is you see how these movies right now are just static files static images we're going to be grabbing them now from the database to make sure we have them basically from the databases what I'm trying to say right we want to have them Dynamic right we don't want to have them static all the time all right okay to make that happen to make that happen we're going to be using Firebase and deep database from the from there right on top of that after we finish with that part two we're going to focus on is go to the detail base when I go to the detail page of course we don't want to see just static content we want to see content that changes based on the mood I click right that's part two part three is going to be login so we're focusing on the login which happens to be right here when I click on this we should be able to log out and I should be able to log in and honestly that is pretty much it for today and once we're done we will go ahead and host our application straight on Firebase and you'll be able to play with it and use it and just be so proud of it to put in your portfolio and so forth all right so our project is here okay to do the whole Firebase getting movies let's do the following let's go ahead and go to home.js okay home.js I will make this a little bit larger home.js on home.gs we need to go ahead and grab the movies that's the functionality we're going to use now to Gap those of course we're going to be grabbing them from the Firebase and right now we have nothing with Firebase related that means we need to install Firebase so create a new terminal right here inside inside your inside your uh what's it called uh your views code and we'll do npm install npm install Firebase done all right we will install that and then we will also add the configuration for the Firebase so let's do npm install install receive install Firebase Dash tools boom voila Firebase Dash tools we got those so those two things NTM install Firebase right here and then npm install Firebase tools both are needed for us to work all right awesome clear this out all right next thing we need to create a firebase.js file because we need the configuration now usually what I would do is I will go ahead and actually show you how to go to Firebase clear your project and so forth but in our case we're not going to do that mainly because a lot of the data all this movie's data there is already prepopularly in our database and so we'll just give you access to be able to prepopulate your data as well right so it just makes it easier for us and for you at the same time let's create a new file here new file we'll do firebase.js and very important make sure this fiber suggests is not is not inside any of these folders like app or components or features or anything like that it needs to be inside the source folder very important next up as you know we down below we have a Google drive folder that has images and it has a few different things below it let me see let me go ahead right here where's that finder folder oh let's go to downloads here and we had a Disney clone challenge this was exactly the what's it called the the folder you can download down below in the description below okay download that and you have videos images and the next thing you have also is something called firebase.js okay I want you to go ahead and actually open this one up so it's going to open this one up either with Sublime Text or whatever that you use to open it up so I'm going to open up inside vs code right here this is the fiber suggest we're going to use all right so copy this one command C go to firebase.js and paste it in there done right and honestly that's all you need and again it's inside the folder Down Below in the description okay inside that folder the firebase.js okay download that and then paste it in say here so what's going on here in this file a few things we are importing Firebase part one nextly we have a Firebase configuration file right there and this basically just gives us access to the actual database next thing we initialize the Firebase app right here right and then what we do is we we need to tell Firebase so what we're going to be using well the first thing we're going to be using is Firebase firestore so firestore is the actual database we're going to be using Firebase authentication later on to be able to log in and log out we're going to be using Google authentication because like I said fibers can have like Yahoo and application there's like all these Amazon application Facebook authentication in our cases it's just gonna be Google auth okay and finally we're going to be using Firebase Storage storage as well right so those three things is well we need to make sure to tell our project uh to use once we get that does everybody have that let me see does everybody this everybody see the folder or see the file everybody has the file on the zoom there yes yes yes yes beautiful awesome all right next thing once we have that let's go back to now home.gs all right Honda GS and here we need to grab the movies from the database and first is a few things we need to use something called use effect to be able to grab those movies let's go and import use effect here use effect bomb right there use effect which is right here now what this is going to be used for is use the fact that says Hey whenever I load my component whenever I upload my page or all that I will be doing is basically just running whatever you tell me to do right so for example here if I say use effect place a use effect boom and I say it like this okay good and I'm going to put nothing inside here check this out if I simply just do comma and I do console log okay console console.log okay hello all right check this out cancel the look hello far save that and if I refresh this all I have to do refresh this inspect dominant on this one called a console see hello so what this is telling me is this right here is being run whenever this component this whole component it gets loaded right this whole thing is being run that's the reason we use users like otherwise if we don't use use effect it will be very messy a lot of calls getting being called if you want to avoid that all right next thing is since we're using Firebase database let's go ahead and import DB DB from Firebase we need to use Firebase like so so dot dot slash means go back up the folder because Chrome inside the components and then we need to go back up to the source folder to access firebase.gs all right that's part one all right since we got that all right let's go ahead and take a look at how do we grab the data so we'll do DB DB dot collection collection DOT book collection of what we have a collection called movies inside our database and we will say something called on Snapshot what does this mean on Snapshot means whenever it's not just kind of like a picture right you take a picture of whatever it is a landscape or you know uh yourself who knows right take a picture and it's a still picture right and it does not move but it's a certain point in time well what a snapshot does it says it's almost like taking a picture of the database and then returning that picture to you right at that point in time that you called it right the point in time that you called it and now what happens also with it is whenever the picture changes or whenever for example the database changes it will actually send a new picture to you every single time that's the cool thing about Firebase is that's why it's called a live database all right on Snapshot all right and we'll do like this snapshot called a function okay so it's gonna get a snapshot and then I will show it to you what we get from it snapshot oops let me go and times quickly snapshot snapshot snapshot okay good good good good good and well let's go ahead and install log what we actually get you'll see it's a little messy check this out snap shot okay done okay if I go ahead and right click this inspect that one on this one console log what do I get look at this this is what I get right here like I said it's really messy but what do we have here here we have Docs we have empty metadata query and then size right and the main thing we need to look into is docs you see look at this you see this right here it says array of 16 what do you think this means well this just means literally we have 16 items in our database right here look right 16 movies but again you don't see them fully it's a little bit odd the way it's made but you'll see that in a second here but we have this 16 elements in the database and we just received them right once we receive them well what's going to happen is let's go let's go ahead and capture them we'll do let temp movies here 10 movies is equal to snapshot snapshot dot docs remember how we talked about the docs portion map and that map will simply Loop through every single snapshot and then we're going to return something from it check this out right here's a little return so for every single dock every single dock that we have and put it on the right hand side for every single dock that we that we are going to use we're going to grab the ID and the data from it so return boom ID doc Dot ID comma dot dot dot data hold the phone as I understand what you're talking about this is very confusing what are we doing here let me show it to you console.log .data all right so the log and check this one out okay inspect on it boom inspect the element on this go to console again look at this you see every single doc that data is is what is the object look at this right here boom you've got the background image the card image description subtitle title these are all movie stored in our database right and that's exactly what we are doing here and so we're capturing that by using doctor data we're capturing that portion but also separately in order to capture the unique ID so we can later on use it for the detail page or capture inside doc.id as well right and this dot dot send simply means basically let's go ahead and unpack this object and put this whole dog the object inside this new object that we created which is simply just an object with the brackets right and then we'll return that back to the 10 movies so we're doing this right here let's go ahead and stop the so lock here I will do consult a log cancel the log temp movies okay save that all right boom right there look 10 movies is exactly what we now need we have the ID the ID of the actual movie the ID is used for identification inside the database we have a description the card image the background image pretty much everything we need for the detail page and also for this page as well and honestly that is it that is it my friends right but of course we're not done right we have these movies and that's great right how we go have it and show them now I'm here how do we do that well this is now where Redux comes in and this is the interesting portion okay and I want you to pay attention to this really quickly here a Redix is basically what's going to manage all the data so if you imagine this right if you imagine the fact that if you have a rectangle here and if you imagine that this right here is state I'm going to make this of course this for here State okay this is called State and state is basically a database DB for your app but internal app basically for your it's basically DB for database inside Chrome right and inside State we have what we have things like we have different um values maybe we have movies inside the state oop not here uh maybe we have movies maybe we have you know user maybe we have uh I don't know some kind of other list maybe right um all of that is actually being saved so for example here I'm gonna say movies movies maybe for example we have user right the application State sees all that and so and manages all that right and because we save it in the global state in the application State we can access the average weight that we need that is the important part here this is why Redux is so useful because otherwise if we don't do that then we have to pass down data from movies down to movies here and you're passing down data every single time and that's a lot right that is not very good that's not very useful and that's why relax is so important okay now at this point since we do have Redux let's go ahead and take a look at what do we create with it well if you look at Firebase and I'm sorry if you look at Redux readers has a few things when we did the Redux toolkit when we use the template Redux template right here you see it created a temporary one called counter boom let me go remove some force me Kana right here and if I click into it it has something called counter slice and we have the initial State here and so forth we're going to mock this up and I want to show you exactly how it works let's create a new file here a new folder actually we'll call it movie okay movie oh actually not inside here but inside the features so new photos inside the features not bad we'll call it movie boom not inside the counter remove this one delete this one I don't want that boom okay counter movie Inside here create new file called movie slice and I know you might be wondering what is movies like so why is why is it called the slice I'll explain a little bit why all right and inside movie slice uh a few things we need to do is we need to import create slice create slice slice there we go from Redux toolkit so from at Redux Redux right JS slash tool kit done all right so crease live for midax Slash 2 Kit and honestly that's it and so usually we have a three Ducks is a few things we always start out with initial State like when I say state is what do we have at first what do we have in our data in in our Chrome database or in our application database well we always start out with nothing so we say const initial state initial state is equal to bump initial state is equal to and we're going to give a movies key it's not right it's nothing right we start off with nothing initially okay once we have that we're actually going to create the slides for the movie so what does this mean so let's go let me take a look at this const movie slice will we slice is equal to create slice and you're like holy this is so much I don't get it it's as complicated as hell all right don't worry don't worry I'll explain this let's create let's name this slice here I'm going to name this slice called movie so name I'm going to name a movie boom comma and I'm going to pass the initial State that's going to be loaded with initial State boom comma and I'm going to give the a reducer now what is a reducer check this out okay um well very simple Redux is made of a few things actions actions reducers users and State right actions reducers and state there's also something called sagas but we don't really care about that too much here that was previous Redux okay actually this real estate and action is basically the action you want to do so for example right if you want to I don't know create a movie if you want to set the new movie if you want to delete a movie if you want to log a user out if you want to log a user in this is called the action this is called actions okay you want to log them in you want to log them out you want to sign them in you want to save the data it's called actions right now reducers reducers are basically is what takes an action and actually changes the state so it kind of kind of goes kind of like goes like this let me show you actions foreign call reducers reducers change the state and so forth that's honestly what happens right and now it does not make it's nothing more complicated than that right one way I can show it to you is really cool like this on the right hand side you can see here that this right here is an action it's called dispatch so we usually dispatch in action it's like you you're dispatching your driver right right you dispatch an action it goes to the action right here there's a type deposit it goes to the store the reducer the reducer right here changes the state to ten dollars see so again we click on something dispatch is in action oh let me go ahead right this budget is an action boom boom reduce or change the data the state now ten dollars that's obviously this is the whole thing dispatch right reducer changes the data in the state and that is pretty much it and we change it in the UI and that's it the coolest part about this is because whenever I change the state here right basically the whole app knows about it the whole app right so let's say for example I have a home page that has some data I have a home page that has some data right and the reducer said hey the movie's changed right so we uploaded new movies or whatever it might be what will happen is every single component will get notified about that and so now you can make the changes really fast and really quickly and you don't have to listen on everything and that's what makes it so powerful okay all right continuing on so does that make sense is this a better description of kind of what we like says this is a relationship does that make sense raise your hand is that a little bit better to understand yeah a lot better okay good good I know it's a little bit hard it's this one is usually a little hard to understand but all you have to know is we have actions that to basically what you want to do so kind of what you want to do let's say I want to walk I want to walk so I'm walking walking walking and then maybe I want to for example buy something or I want to buy something then the reducer is what allows me to do that okay all right so we have initial State let's create those reducers boom let's create those reducers all right all right we're going to create a reducer called set movies and what this will do is we'll take a parameter called state so this is the current state comma action right common action and this is a function right here pretty much right and what's going to happen is this is where we change the state so in the sample is function we're going to pass in new movies that we get from the database it's as simple as that so to stay the movies is equal to action dot payload actually that payload all it is is that's the actual parameter that we pass into the summaries function you'll see that later on that's what pill pillow carries so if I pass in an array into some movies I will get it here it's an action.payload that's what will happen next up in order to actually use the movie slides we have to export the actions because remember we dispatch actions right so I'm going to say export const right here const and I'm going to say here said movies right is equal to movie slice movie slice dot actions boom there right so this is the ash that we're going to export next thing is we need to now export the actual movie State itself because remember how do we use a component to access our movie State work very simply we have to export it so export and the gist of it is we usually like to say something like for example select movies right that's kind of like the the the traditional tradition but that's the way you want to do it select something so what are you selecting from the state is it movies maybe there was something else say for example like I don't know uh horror movies right movies in here right well you would do a select horror movies inside here whatever it might be right that's it okay so select movies is equal to here we'll take the state and we'll say it's state and all it is is state oh state DOT what state well the movie state right movie status is the reducer right state of movie dot movies done okay this will give us back the movies okay next okay we're going to export the actual slice itself so export the actual reducer export default so by default we're going to export the reducer movie slice dot reducer right the reason why we do that is because we need to tell the store we call the store the whole store that we have this right here reducer save that awesome sweet let's now go back to our app go to storage yes and we need to now import that store actually right we need to import that store or input that reducer and we can do that very simply just by simply going okay let's do it like this so import whilst a movie reducer right movie reducer from voyages are from features features Dash movie Dash movie slice okay and then inside of these counters because which came originally we just say movie is equal to the movie reducer and all you're telling the application is that we have this reducer at our disposal that's it that is all you are saying my friends all right that's great let's actually see if this works I'm going to save this I'm Gonna Save this refresh it all right so nothing's broken so far which is good nothing's broken so far the main thing is going to happen is when we actually use the movie reducer which we will do inside the home.js basically whenever we are right whenever we are getting movies this is we will be able to set the movies for the whole state the whole state because then it can be accessed everywhere inside our application right so inside our home page let's say we have a home page here right that's the home page the home page and now we have for example the movies component right two different components we have components movies component and a home component so let me say here this is for example the home component this is the movies component Right Moves component well they both share they both share the same store right which contains movies right so what happens is that inside the home functionality okay inside the home functionality all I do is I hey I set new movies right using this the reducer and then because of that I can actually get movies inside the moves component that's it that's all that happens all right boom awesome all right so let's go ahead and do that now to use the reducer we need to use something called dispatch so let's go ahead and do this we'll say import right and we'll say use dispatch right there use dispatch okay from Redux react Dash Redux all right and then we will import the set movies action so import right there set movies okay from what is it dot features Dash what movie Dash what movie slice right but there was a movie Dash movie slides right there beautiful okay we got the action which is set movies we've got the use dispatch which we're going to use to dispatch that action so this place like basically calling it it's like hey do this action that's what this patch is used for all right and then honestly that is pretty pretty much it uh we've got this badge we've got that right to use this patch we need to say that we say const dispatch is equal to use dispatch oop not that one this patch it's better good good we got that now so let's think about this right once I get my movies inside you know in from the database what I need to do well it's very simple at this point now I need to that's this that that aspect A dispatch in action right called set movies to set the movies for the whole store for the whole database that's what we need to do does that make sense anybody question does that make sense yes yes yes which is dispatch in action saying hey you know what let's we got these moves from the database let's go ahead and then store them inside the whole state the global State okay this is where we'll do like this we'll say dispatch dispatch right dispatch and we'll say set movies right and this will have temp movies inside here Tempo movies you get 10 movies okay and let's go and check out make sure nothing's broken let me see not does anything break let's rock the inspect element anything break oop I forgot to share here so here's what we did we did this batch we did dispatch right here okay and then we did dispatch submoo is right here okay that's we just did and we imported sub moves and use dispatch beautiful all right all right so if we go to console here no bad ears just good this is a good sign nothing's nothing's going haywire which is a good sign right but of course we still don't know how is this working well that's actually now use the Redux in terms of actual uses the state that we can use the same state between the movies component and the home component well go to movies okay go to movies and let's use select movies so when I say import select movies that will get us the movies that we stored in the database select movies from from what well dot features slash slash what movie slash movie slice right movie slice again where's this coming from I mean go to movie slides here movie slice boom look at this see select movies select movies all all that's doing is that's cool getting us the movie State that's it that's all it is doing that's pretty much it right let's do here that's all that it's doing so let's now go back to uh where was I at hours at Movies component boom all right that's good next up is we need to actually to use the selector we need to use a use selector so import I know it's a little complicated guys there's so much to it right but once you know it for the first time or want to kind of realize how it works it's not that bad oh come on you selector from again react Dash Redux beautiful okay the three Ducks save that there we go you selector and let's now grab those movies okay we'll say constant movies this is where we're going together with so constant movies is equal to use selector the one we just imported from here react Redux okay and the selector will be select movies that's on that's the one we need to use select movies okay and let's check this out I'm going to consult a log here to the log right there right there I'm saying this is movies right comma I'm gonna say move just so you guys can see it okay oh no no no no not that boom all right save that inspect element console oh look at that this is movies at Ray 16. we have the moves you see how it traveled between the global State we have the global state right so what do we do here we went down to the home state home component right inside the home component we grabbed here so the home component we grabbed the data right here okay we grab the the data from the database we dispatched an action we used Redux to save the movies inside basically the store right the react store right it's kind of like a store where you buy things right you can buy things you can put things in there you can buy things from there right we put the movies to the store right once we put that there if we now go back to movies component right we just now grab from the store we grab it from that store that is it that's happening here what do you guys think about does that make sense does that make sense kind of iffy yes or no raise your hand if it kind of makes sense right yes yes okay good I know I know it's a little bit iffy to fully understand videos it takes a few days it takes a few I mean sometimes it takes a week to fully understand it okay but we have the movies which is great all right we have those once we get those of course we need to replace these static images now right now how do we do that well that's pretty simple we can do that by doing a wrap a basically a loop through them so we'll do the following we'll do let's see this so we'll do movies so we'll check if the movies exist right and then if the moves exist we'll say like this movies and or say this movies.map check this out movies the map okay and this will take in a movie okay oh I should not not like that taking a movie and it will actually no come on now there we go thank you all right and the wrap is actually the rap which is currently directly the rap is what the rap is this right that's the whole thing right so doing it here we'll put it inside here boom boom boom boom okay all right there you go okay all right so what's going on here this functionality says hey if movies exist then you can go ahead and proceed with doing something about it right but if movies is null because in the beginning with the when the page loads the movies is no right we haven't gotten it from the database yet once we did get it from the database we simply just Loop through it right here that's it that's it all right and as we Loop through it we use a map function to Loop through it get the movie and let's now actually get the movie data right so we'll say the following the source image remember how we can still log The Source image let's go ahead and remove this portion don't need this that it will be what movie Dot what card image okay let me go ahead and just oh do you see what just happened right here guys look at that look at that just like that it just worked do I see right we love the most can you hear me Jesse that's amazing yeah I can hear you beautiful beautiful right so it's just all working the way you should be let me make sure that I want to give it to you there we go awesome you hear me Jesse okay good you can hear me yeah I can hear you yeah yeah and what did we just do here like I said we grabbed the move from here and I'm going to consult the log saw the log movies okay likely is an aspect element right this camera oh no console something happened each child okay we'll take care of this a second but here are the movies right we have the ID we have the subtitle right and what we use from the movie is we use the movie the car damage right so if you look at it here the card image so that's what we used that's what we said card image right here card image you see that's exactly what we need to use right there all right and honestly that's that's pretty much it all right but of course we're not done yet so a few things I want to fix together here it says here you see how there's an error that says here well each child each child in a list should have a unique key prop what does that mean well Redux underneath the hood tracks all of these components all these components right if there's any changes that happen to them but attracts them through a key like a unique key and to give unique key we need to do something like this so we'll say key is equal to and we need to give a unique key and what's the most unique thing that we have about a movie what is it put in the chat what is the most unique thing that we have about a movie individual movie Object it's the ID that's correct so I will say to get the ID well actually we'll grab the index here I mean I don't think you could move that ID so we'll say movie here movie dot ID that's it so save that boom let's see inspect element and let's take a look if that era appears still MC console okay that's the old ear so if I refresh this oh yeah no air you see no more errors now it's all working perfect the way it should all right so we have done that portion we've grabbed the movies from the database they're in our possession we have it all right only thing is left at this point is when I click on them I should be able to go to a detailed page so I can see the eventual movie uh object basically that's the whole goal about this right right there and of course let's go ahead and remove all all these uh Simpsons once because it just looks like our Disney clone is full of Simpsons which is not the case so let's go and do this so wrap let's remove all these Simpsons don't need that bye bye that's funny all right save that oh just happened I just removed all notes right here there you go all right save that okay good good no more symptoms thank God I mean nothing against sepsis I love Simpsons guys okay nothing against Simpsons guys all right next up uh what do we have is let's go ahead and add our code here so add uh add grab movies from DB we'll put that into our GitHub save beautiful all right all right number two that we're going to work on is let's look on the detail page so we need to create a link here when I click on this specific thing I should be able to go to the detail page of the specific image of what I clicked on so the specific right movie uh won't be that hard we will use react router down for that as well and the way we do it is something called a link this also will say a link here so import import link we've used reactor zombie previously but now we're going to use the link portion of it link right here okay from what react Dash router router Dash Dom that's dumb okay and really what a link is basically it surrounds the object with an attack honestly that that's all it does we can do that here so I will say inside the wrap I will say let's link it will do the link like so boom put the image inside the link of course okay save that put it like this okay and link to What specifically this is what we need to specify we'll link it to what well how do you think we're going to link it well we have the detail page let me go to the app.js right inside your detail page but what if we passed in a detailed slash ID a lot of times we will do detail slash and we'll do give an ID like this oh come on Rocket I don't need you right now right slash ID and this ready is going to be the parameter we pass in into our detail component all right let's go back to movie uh yes movies okay and we'll say Link and Link to link to and we'll give it the link so here's the link right so let's think about this right we'll say it's detail so slash detail right right detail slash what the ID of the movie so right here we're going to use template literals then movie dot ID boom right there so all it will tell us is it will link us to the detail and then division movie ID right so we're going to Loop to every single movie I get the ID from the movie and then put it inside the link towards the detail page and honest honestly that's that's it that's it we're done with that portion it's as simple as that let's go and right click this I want to show it to you guys right click on it inspect element look at this you see this Ace draft tag right here look at this see this no this one here right there detail page and this 30ay is in the visual linked to the movie If I go to a different movie the link will be different because of course the ID is different right so this is 530 aui this is 5n and honestly that's pretty much it that's all we got to do that's it comprehendo that's it right so if I go back to here we have our link right there beautiful okay say that Tata okay save that all right we have that all right so now if we click on it should technically take as a detail page okay are you ready for this are you ready are you ready so click on it oh let's go look at that it took us direct the detail page but of course it's not the correct image still right so like it's not the correct one so it's just the same one but the reason why that's the case is because if we now go to the detail page what right of course it's all static content right but look at this it's starting to come together really nicely is you click on individual movie right there it takes you to the page that you want us to take it to and honestly that's it that's all we need to know specifically look at that that's so good guys what do you guys think so far give me a thumbs up in the comments below if you guys are liking what you just seems so far give a thumbs up there we go beautiful beautiful beautiful all right all right now let's focus on the detail page right here okay um a few things since we're passing the ID you see how here we have the ID that's the ID okay we need to capture that idea because we need to get grab all the data about the specific movie so here's what we'll do I'm going to say like this okay Papa we're going to use use parameters from reactor Dom so import oh import you use params use programs from all right from what react Dash router Dash Dom save it all right next one const and we'll grab the ID this is the smart thing about react Rotterdam and knows this kind of stuff because we in the inside the app that GSB told it that the what's going to happen after the detail link is the ID it will save it actually in the parameter that's the cool part let's go back to the detail and we'll say use params use params right there and we'll grab the ID from it so now if I go go ahead and do console.log console.log ID so technically that's it technically ID let's go ahead and expect them on this one okay expect them on this one let's go ahead and go to console all right prop type the prop 2 is marked as required in Lincoln but its value is undefined no that's different okay there's the idea right here that's all we got to do see we got we grabbed the ID that's it all right save it beautiful okay next up we need to again grab the data for this specific movie right and we're going to use use effect so let's go ahead and code to react or say use effect here use effect okay again so let's do use effect because we need to grab the data individual data right right there and this needs to happen whenever we load the component the component the detail component specifically okay this empty bracket means call this functionality whenever you load the component I just want you to make sure you understand that next thing inside here we need to grab grab the movies the movie movie info from DB from the DB from database right there to do that let's import DB from Firebase import B from okay Firebase okay and to grab the data bit the movies database we'll say DB dot collection collection okay and with the collection we use it's called movies right that's coming from database directly okay beautiful we'll give it a specific dock we need to use so dot doc Doc and the ID that's it DOC ID right this is directly going to convert it from here right it's kind of like telling you hey grabbing the movie with this specific ID dog yet right there dot then so once we get it we're going to grab it and then we're going to use it now right the dog is going to be inside the functionality here and what we need to do is we need to check if this dock exists so we'll say if doc doc dot exists meaning if found the specific document or the specific yeah the specific entry with that ID we're going to use it now so if that exists we'll say what well we need to save the movie data save the movie data but how guys do you think we should see this inside do you think we should save inside the Redux or do you think we should save it actually inside the state what do you guys think Redux or state if you think it's going to be Redux raise your hand here okay everything is if you think it's going to be State raise your hand now what do you think or give me a thumbs up it's actually going to be in state here's why because this changes for every single right page this changes right we're not going to reuse the movie data anywhere else besides on this page so we don't need to save inside no the actual Redux instead we're going to use State okay to use that we need to you to use state you state right there okay we're going to grab it so we'll say uh what is that what are we going to do uh do const right there cast movie movie sub movie that's how we go ahead and I will say equal use state okay so you stay is basically like Redux but for individual components okay for individual small components if Redux is for the whole app okay and it's shared amongst all the components your state is basically for individual component so it's on a smaller scale okay and it was made for three different reasons it just makes things easier sometimes okay and what we get here this is the movie that we will use and if we want to change the movie we use sub movie so in our case since we get the movie we'll do set movie right I will do dog dot data that's it save that all right okay and otherwise however if it does not exist for example let's just say that I don't know the movie does not exist we're going to basically redirect direct to home page for some reason let's just say it does not work out right well in our case let's go and check out what we do so I will say here consult the log console.log movie is movie is what movie right here okay save that all right check this out inspect them on this one let's go and do console oh movie is object right there look at that boom right there so this ID right this idea give us a specific object we need right there this is the object we need holy moly that's so cool right pick up grab that oh oh that's not one okay I know what happened there so that's it once we have the movie right because again we use set movie to save us at the movie Object right here once we have that we now we need to use the that date the specific data right and now it's very simple inside here instead of doing a static image we replace that with a normal image so image source was a movie dot open now like this okay movie that's what background image but background image oh yes save it oh look at that this is the exact movie that we clicked on guys the exact move we clicked on is that background image right next one image title will do movie right there right right or say what movie Dot title image save that boom look at that guys now it's Tangled you see how it's doing all right next up we need to change now this specific portion right this specific portion so what is what is this going to be movie dot what that subtitle grab it movie dot subtitle boom right there okay oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait and then a spell right sub title which is going to be this one right here subtitle okay boom right there look fantasy animation and finally last I'm gonna be moved the description so we'll say here movie right there movie The What description done that is it guys that's it our detail page is now premium is finished that's it look at and look at how beautiful it looks you see the steps we took we grabbed the ID once we got the ID we grab from the database right like I said let me see look at a mistake let's think about this here two we got so here so here grab ID grab ID right then grab from DB right and populate populate populate data or populate UI that's it that's all we did we grabbed the ID from the top page we grab for you we use that to grab uh the data from database and then we populated you the UI that's all we did inside here honestly that's it beautiful that is all good guys are you still with me guys how cool is this you guys still with me that's pretty awesome huh you know who with me yes yes yes yes yes yes yes beautiful beautiful beautiful all right next one let's go take a look at how this actually works let's go back to our home page let's go back to our homepage I actually want to link the homepage to actually go back home because I'm getting tired of typing home I'll do Incredibles oh can I have the background image of undefined let me go back to here let's try this here again oh interesting let's go to here I think I know this is happening actually I know what's going on oh okay I got it so here's what needs to happen here um in order to for this to fully fully work right again this use effect happens maybe a little bit later on of course right so basically it initially we don't actually have this data at first right this happens later on this is why we need to do a little bit a little bit differently and in the detail page foreign image so here's a lot of times what I'll do for example the reason why it's yelling me is because the fact that we don't have the movie our disposal right now right we're trying to grip the movie back on image but whenever we go grab it from the database we're not actually getting it we're getting it a few seconds later that's kind of the issue there right so let me go ahead and look at this here for a second right there so we're still grabbing these that's no problem right I think the problem comes when we go ahead and go the specific movie so let me go and click this again that's okay all right to fix that here's what I usually do which is very simple fix I just do like this I say if movie exists like this if movie then we say uh uh no no and end right there right there eighth movie exists only then do we get all this data look at this oh come on come on holy Molina's holy macaroni okay my next only the movie exists do we actually show it in the database or show it on the front right there oh do you like this Papa don't worry don't worry guys it's gonna be fixed okay save that oh come on give me a break okay save that um must be wrapped in in closing tag you want to do this I did want a GSX fragment yes I did but oh I think I know why okay here let's do it like this and then this will be the closing tag right here we go fixed there you go and I'll show you exactly why this happened and what's going on and why we need to do this check this out okay good save that okay let's look at one oh look at that boom right there look at that boom boom boom oh let's go let's go let's go we fixed it guys we fixed this issue look at that that's awesome oh boom let's see we fixed the issue so what happened here guys very simple right well initially we got this errors because we tried to grab the background image for a movie that does not exist it's as simple as that right um does not exist because use effect it takes us a few seconds to actually grab the data from a database right so it takes a few seconds maybe like five seconds but to go to the actual page it takes a little millisecond right and so when we actually are executing this while this is trying to get the data right here right this is already being preloaded and is trying to do move the background image which is not right because we don't have it yet unfortunately we don't have it so we're not going to do this will give us an error but what we did here is very simple we said if the movie Object exists basically if it's this way he is not null right if the movie Object exists right then we will go ahead and execute and actually all put all this to your jsx in place right and then we got all these errors because why because we need to put this into this is called like an um an empty like tag an empty tag I forgot what it's called Anonymous tag Anonymous tag so it's not actually a deal but it's kind of like a div right when you put it inside here you have to wrap it inside of one container and anything else can go inside it it's a little bit confusing on on the react side but it's just some things like that they have to get used to unfortunately with react so uh yeah I know unfortunately that's just how the case it is you know but with it look we said the movies we say the data we got it if I go back to the home page boom right there oh oh so good oh oh so good look at that boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom done guys how cool is this you guys still with me yes or no let's go yes you guys you are beautiful as always love you all very much now was that was that understandable did you guys understand why we had all these issues do you guys get that yes yes or no give me a thumbs up for yes give me a thumbs up for no okay all right in the comments as well guys on YouTube as well too all right all right so we got that portion that's working now all fine no problem whatsoever let's now focus on the last part of our application which is going to be the login section this might be a little bit harder but I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out okay this is where now we have to use Redux yet again okay we need to create a user kind of State Management to be able to manage the user State and see if the user exists right if these exist we do this if it does not exist we do that right that's it okay let's go ahead and create a movie slice uh let's go ahead and create a user slice actually so a new folder inside features new folder let's call call it user done right inside here we'll go ahead and do my bad we'll do user slice so new file new file user slice.js done okay same thing here let's go ahead and import Redux just how we did it inside the movie slice and by the way just a quick note the reason why it's called a slice is it's kind of like a slice of a pizza right if we're creating all these reducer functionalities which are just slices of the big thing that's why it's called a slice yeah nothing complicated there mmhmm and pour slice nice then create initial state so const initial state initial state all right and there are three things we're going to say first one is going to be named right okay and this is going to be empty and then we're going to save email right also nothing and then we're going to say photo right that's the photo of the person foreign once we got that let's go ahead and create a slice so we'll say const user slice slice is equal to create slice create slicer create slice okay all right inside the crate slice give it some values like name in our case it can be user cool and then we will go ahead and give it the initial state right so our initial state is basically nothing nada then we have reducers this is where we will get our reducers and a few things we need to do on here inside the reducers um few juices the first we need to create is called set user so site user login so we'll call it set user login and this will of course take state comma what action right Papa there we go the second one is going to be which one which is going to be set sign out so set sign out because again when we sign out we want to be able to clear the state correct so we want to be able to clear everything here so it says sign out right there we'll say state okay no actually we're going to pass into here because nothing really happens and when we set to now what happens what do you think in the comments below what happens when we set sign out it's very simple we say state dot name is equal to basically nothing again or no okay we say state dot email is equal to null as well oh no boom and then we say State a photo that what photo is equal to what null 2 right beautiful now when we log in of course let's go and finish this one up again state.name is equal to what we're going to pass a some kind of action we'll say action dot payload payload dot name right there all right and then same thing is gonna happen with these other ones are here so there bomb in this case email and it will say payload.email right and then State DOT photo payload.photo all right no that's not the one save that beautiful okay so few things again set user login to be able to log the user in we save the user data okay then we set user sign out so we should be able to sign the user out so that we don't have the data anymore and basically we can't show that application anymore that's it all right give me one second I need to go ahead and take a breath so good so good okay okay after we've done that we need to grab all the actions right so we'll say here what I'll do it like this so it's a little bit cleaner okay so again we need to export the actions because actions will allow us to dispatch them right so we'll do what set user login and then set sign out so here we'll say right there oh no that's not what I want come on nope said user login comma set sign out is equal to what is equal to user slice user slice dot What DOT actions actions right there beautiful actions not action what actions are there actions make sure measure is plural all right after that okay we will go ahead and bring back the specific data so we'll say export right const and then this will be select select it's like what select user username user um also user name is equal to what State uh Papa state the user.wat.name right same thing is going to happen with these other ones but in our case we're going to do select user what user what do you think guys here user email here right because we need to select the email and we're going to grab the email from here boom and select user watch to a photo right there and that's going to grab the user photo done all right and then at this point all we need to do is export the reducer so we'll say export export uh default so by default we export the reducer default default user slice dot reducer Danza okay all right and that's it we've created our react Redux slice for just the user okay now let's tell the story that we have them so let's go to the store.js let's import it let's go ahead and remove this counter reduce because it's not useful at all oh there we go move this kind of reducer on unnecessary fully and let's do import user reducer from okay the features Dash what user dashboard user slice done okay and the same thing is going to happen here so say comma and then we'll give it a comma we'll say user here user user slice done all right so we were able to pass in all that data and now if we look at it here really no big area that's going on here we're pretty much all good on that aspect that's not what I want a view sort of you inspect element let's see yeah nothing crazy in terms of like actual errors are going on here nope we're good beautiful that makes me so happy okay of course if I go to here it should be all good as well okay so sweet sweet so so now in order to fully make this word we need to go let's think about how this works right we need to create a login button if we're not logged in right so let's think about this this will happen inside the header because remember if I go back to our app which is this app right here right let's go sign out you see the header changes right we have a login button right here right this right here and we need to be able to handle that so let's create the login button boom let's create the login button and that's going to happen inside the header header.js boom right there okay all right let's see so what's going to happen we need to be able to grab the username the email photo and see if it exists if the user does not exist we show the login button however if it does exist we don't show the login button and instead we show the user Circle does that make sense comprende oh good yes yes yes yes yes comprending good all right all right let's make that happen in that case by the way let me see here all right beautiful wow so many comments are going holy moly you guys insane all right beautiful all right so log in let's go ahead and create the login button in that case but first we need to of course need to import the select username all this kind of stuff so we can do that by doing like this import right here import select select user name comma select so that user what user photo comma what select ah user photo do anything else username and user photo we don't need their email that's pretty much it okay okay from what from no that's not what I want from from the actual user slide so from the features features comma or slash user slash user slice okay save that next thing of course we need to go ahead and import the the whole use selector thing so let's go ahead and do import watch use selector oh that's not what I want no use selector from what from oh my I forgot to show you guys my bad my bad my bad on YouTube how long was I on here I'm very curious hmm well here's what we did guys I said I went to here uh all I did is I imported this right here so like username is like user select user photo okay that's all pretty much did on YouTube Just so you guys know okay and then on the user slice I mean we did this whole user slide so hopefully you guys seen this I don't remember when did I put it on here hopefully you guys seen that one that's the one we did create okay let's now go back to I don't think it was that long huh I don't think it was that long it was not no okay thank you just to use selector okay let's go back to Heritage yes from and we need to import that from react Redux Yak Dash Redux three ducks react Dash Redux and honestly that's pretty much it redis Redux we've imported that that's all we now need at this point okay let me see make sure it's all good here react with us you selector import that uh let's actually now use that right so we use selector let's go ahead and use that so we're going to grab the username so const user name is equal to use selector you selector and which one you're going to use well select username right here so select select user name right there beautiful and then something const user photo is equal to use selector no um yeah so maybe on line eight yeah thank you Jesse you a selector awesome okay what do you select user photo beautiful so I'll use your photo it's exactly what we need and now at this point a few things are going to happen so here's let's think about this if we don't have if we don't have basically like the you know the yeah if we don't have the user basically then we you know login button and we can do that inside the nav menu so after the logo let's think about like this I'm going to create an if else statement so basically if there is no username user name oh this one if there is no username right if it does not exist then we will go ahead and show the login button so I'm going to say login that's it right log in right here and I'm gonna say login right this could be that's going to be a stock upon that we'll create otherwise otherwise otherwise we'll show the nav menu oh this one and the user image actually I feel like those two things are important okay otherwise we'll show the user menu and the login so to make that happen we need to make it again we need to use this call Anonymous tag like this right boom right so we need to put in the user image right there and then the menu inside there Papa Papa so we had another menu in here user image in here of course right uh to make it fully work of course we can do that so we have to do like this we have to do parentheses close parentheses right there Then over by the Seas oh hold on that's not right it's not right question mark so again if this is true we do this otherwise we do this whole thing understand that's all happens that's it okay so now let's go ahead and try this out I'm Gonna Save this let's go to our app it says login is not defined exactly perfect it's exactly what we need to do so let's go to our login button so we'll say const login is equal to basically a const uh login is equal to style dash dash we'll make it a uh I want to say it let's just say a deal for now okay I do okay I did this option button right there you see Perfect all right all right so at this point to make this fully work what we'll do is the following so let's go ahead and do that um login button will do we'll give it a border radius let's think about this where's our login button oh it has like a border so let's give it a border initially so we have border one pixel solid let's level like this 41 pixel solid good let's think about this put it here border one pixel solid beautiful all right and then within that we're going to uh let's see border then it's going to give us some padding so padding 8 pixels right 16 pixels so 16 pixels on the left and right hand side save that beautiful now it's a little bit bigger bigger button which exactly what I like all right right so we stretch it out let's give it a border radius now border Dash radius radius right here okay radius beautiful I that's going to be border radius of 4 pixels four pixels I like that uh so much better all right we're going to go ahead and let's go ahead and do letter spaces so maybe face the ladder spacing a little bit spacing right 1.5 pixels okay just make it a little bit bigger and let's do tax transform uppercase to make sure it's all applicated text transform transform right here right there uppercase bro good all right beautiful nice nice nice nice then we just need to give it a background color so let's give it a background color a little bit more of a darker side but a transparent background color so let's try that right here voila okay so it's a little dark darker background color okay awesome next thing on the hover of this button of this div right so let's do the hover so we'll say hover right here so now however what are we going to do well let's think about this right on the hover we're changing kind of like number one to White so we're kind of flipping the black to white white to black right so let's try that right now okay hover let's change the background color background color it's going to be more of a wider color so it's going to a little bit like this awesome and then the color of the actual text is going to be now black so let's see black okay all right and then border color is gonna be transparent as well so border color Porter Dash color it'll be transparent parent uh rent be transparent there we go so let's go hover go ahead and hover this oh let's go beautiful but we're not done yet because let's give it a small transition so we'll do a transition here transition all 0.2 seconds right here no oh let's go beautiful let's also get a cursor pointer cursor pointer nice ah oh look at that beautiful that's what I'm talking about now of course so we have to log in now how do we make sure that this login is kind of all the way on the left slash the right hand side that's actually a good question how do we make sure we do that how do we make sure that the login is all the way on the lot on the left and the right hand side what do you guys think because if you think about this right the login is here right I hit the logo here right is there anything we can do for example with I don't know uh with the nav what should we do what do you guys think we can do well here's my thoughts on this I think we should create a logging container here a container here login container right here like this here's why I can put the lock inside here no problem whatsoever right but the login container look look what I'll do is I will go ahead and actually basically give it a flex of one that's a cool part I as well do all right that's going to create a long container underneath this one so we'll say Okay const login container style.div okay check out this Flex one Flex one right no look I know I know I know don't worry don't worry about this so here's what we'll do right it stretched out the whole div that's okay so here's what we'll do Now display Flex okay you see and then we'll do what justify content check this out justify content Center or flux sent justify justify content what flex and boom right there you see login now shifts right to the right hand side which is exactly what we need which is right here right there see just just I'm too good I'm too good so there we go we got we got that portion right there sorry that's how fun you know I was proud of that that's pretty cool I did not fly you know so okay so the login button is right there okay now what needs to happen is we need to go ahead on the click of this button we need to log ourselves in right now how does that work out well this is gets a little bit more tough for guys all right so let's try let's try this let's go ahead and create a signin function so we'll do const sign in sign in right here is equal to a function right and this is where Firebase really it plays a big role here okay on the sign in function uh well we need to input off here so let's go ahead and do that so this is where really we're going to use a lot of you know what is this react find render compatibility type I don't need that right here all right so let's go and import import we're going to use auth so import auth comma provider Provider from Firebase right from what Firebase right there boom okay okay import that from the from Firebase okay now when we sign in the way it works is very simple I click on something and I will call a function that will sign me in basically so to make that happen I will say here auth DOT sign in with popup sign in uh I'll do cleanly sign in with no with well this is what right there it's only with popup and the popup so basically it's going to pop up something what provider right well we said in Firebase we're going to use the Google provider so we'll say provider here provider beautiful and then that then so when we sign ourselves in and it's successful we say we get the result and what result do we get well let's take a look at what we get here back okay we get results and we actually let's go into console log the result for now console.log the log result okay boom save that console log result and of course we need to make that happen when you do unclick on here so on click unclick is equal to what and will give the function the sign in function so sign in sign in sign I function okay so let's try that now so we have that portion done let's click login oh oh would you look at that how cool is that oh guys holy moly right you click login pops up a button click contact level programmer right and let's see what we get back inspect them on this one what do we get back here let's go to console uh blah we get an object actually here look at this and this object has a user object let me show you so you guys can see it better right there we have a user object right here right there see and the user object has a lot of stuff including some IDs but the coolest thing it has is right here display name email and there's a photo one here too photo URL you see so we can actually use that fully we can fully use that to grab that data let's try it okay let's try it okay let's go back to here okay let's go back to here all right we have the specific portion all right so now let's go ahead and actually set the user data so we'll do of course console.log.user so the log uh user but a few things we need to do because on the log no user is fine this is where you set the data in the Redux to set the data in the Redux to set all this username and folder and stuff like that of course we need to grab this from the user slice right here right because we need to grab the what the set user login so let's grab that right now set user login let's go and grab that go back to overhead.js let's grab that from the user slice boom right there okay okay and then let's go ahead and you need to dispatch it as well so let's go ahead and dispatch it too so that means we need to import this patch that means we need to import use right here use dispatch use dispatch comma with use selector as well and we do use the dispatch so const dispatch is equal to what use dispatch use dispatch okay use this patch and then after that once we've once we imported dispatch let's actually dispatch it so here we'll do dispatch right there right dispatch what well what we dispatched the set user login set what user login with what data what data right so when you dispatch so you should log in with some data but what data we're going to actually give it well that's going to be up to us to figure it out right let's do that right now we have name is equal to what let's do this right here say let user is equal to result.user right remember we got that from where from here you see right there right there so user result.user is this right here specifically boom okay so now we'll do set user login okay and we say it's gonna be name is equal to user dot display name boom again coming directly from the data here display name right here you see next up email okay user.what user dot mail okay next up is going to be photo so photo okay user dot what photo URL which is coming directly from where from here right there fold the URL right there so you see there's a reason for everything that we're doing okay boom so now if I sign in if I click sign in again technically I should have the nav menu appear in here technically okay let's go ahead and try that out so let's go ahead and see sign in all right so I should really kind of like so it's gonna happen is it still going to dispatch the user login that's going to save it inside the global State want to save in a global state that means this will be right here updated automatically and once this is updated you see this becomes what not truthy but falsy and so it's going to show us a nav menu that is it let's go and try this out okay all right let's go and click login oh did you guys pay attention to that did you guys pay attention to this look it just showed up oh let's go that's so good give me one of Applause everybody hurt anybody I might just applausing for myself that's fine too that's fine too yeah there you go right so we got that portion working that's okay it makes me really happy and honestly that is it that is it okay and once we have this let's go ahead and focus on the sign up feature so we need to be able to sign out as well right and the signal happens when I click on what when I click on this right here I click on this I should technically sign out all right let's go ahead and do that okay so create a sign off function so we have con sign in const sign out out is equal to right here right there it's also equals to a function all right and what's going to happen here is of course we'll remove we'll assign the user out and to do that we'll do auth DOT sign out like so right and once that's successful we'll say that then function well dispatch a functionality well dispatch and it will dispatch what well user slice dispatch set sign out right that's the functionality you need to use that means we need to import it set sign out okay save that beautiful all right that's all good set sign out so this patch set sign out functionality and honestly that is it my friends and one small thing we can do is once you sign out all we have to do at this point is just simply redirect you back to the login page so let's try that right now now to do that we need to use something called history so we'll use here import use history look use history this is part of reactor react router Dom history from react Dash router Dash Dom and the way you use this like this right I'm gonna say const history is equal to use history beautiful and all I do at this point is I say this history that push so basically after all is said and done I just do a history that push I would say my friends let me see where is there wizard where's it where's it where's the where's it right there here I do history history that push basically and I push to the the login page so we'll say login that's it login page so if I sign out now we need to of course we need to go ahead and click on sign now so let's go ahead and do on click on the user image so on the click of the user image we'll sign out the user so on click right there we're going to sign out the user foreign save this so we have sign in sign out that's all good okay let's try this now you guys ready for this are you guys ready for this all right boom sound you can run Applause yay yay I'm pausing myself again dang it okay so log in all right classic level programmer all right beautiful that's exactly what we just got right so okay now of course we we logged in no and what we can do is after you sign in right we can also after you sign in we can also dispatch you to a different page so let's go and do this so we'll say uh history.push now push what the push to where to the home page right that's it there we go so if I let's go ahead and sign out again okay I did that that's fine right let's do history that push to the home page which is this one log in because the clever programmer boom oh look at that you guys ah it's so awesome so look at that and then I click sign out again oh my God it's still good and then hey let's go so there is one issue here however and it's the fact that for example you see if I refresh this basically the user is gone that's that's the issue here and we can actually kind of fix that by by setting the user whenever we kind of like um on the Heather so the way to fix that is very simple and again the reason why this happened is because the state is gone the state is gone once I refresh the page the state is gone that's it sayonara bye bye baby that's it we're done right so to fix it we're going to use off on state changed right and we're going to use use effect with this one too so look at this we'll say use effect use effect right here I'm going to say auth auth on state changed so we'll say uh use effect use effect right there okay okay we'll say basically on the change of let me see when you first log into the page right here when you first log in we'll do the following we'll do auth auth dot on of State changed okay it could be async we're going to grab the user and basically it's gonna be really simple right all that happens here is the user exists right there right because here's the thing um a Firebase remembers the user in cookies in a cookie and so that's where we get this right here right it remembers the user in the cookie and so say if user user then we do what then we do again we do dispatch like the site user login again dispatch that user login again and then we do history dot push dot push dot push home page down there we go uh oh this is more important right there boom that's it there you go so you see let's think about if I refresh now you see you see the user is actually being set right there you see when I refresh the receiver here the users being set if I sign out I sign out I sign it back again classic color programmer let's go let's go to here oh look at that guys that my friends is pretty much it we have finished with more well all the functionality we wanted to get done in Disney plus clone you can my friends you can sign out you can sign in anything you can do pretty much so sign out login right because your clever programmer beautiful right there click on individual movie watch the movie go back oh god let's go yay that's what I'm talking about we have one last thing to do that we're going to try right now is we're going to try and deploy it actually as well I think it's actually deployed it's deployed on our side if you want to go ahead and deploy it on your site if you want to try it out because on our side is actually deployed already so um if you want to deploy it it's not that hard if you undeploy it just go ahead and let me see let me show it to you on your side deploy it right do Firebase deploy deploy deploy right with react right here right find that right here there's a really simple explanation how to deploy a Firebase application right you can do Firebase login Firebase in in it do hosting that's all you got to do right from that point on all you have to do is when it says or is it where's the where's the full Firebase project for this directory you select your project you created after that you do Firebase deploy and honestly that's pretty pretty much it all right that's all you got to do uh so yeah that's how you deploy a bar than that guys and that's it we are done we have our app fully built let's go ahead and log in yet again here so who's still with you who actually was able to kind of finish it with you is anybody able to finish your part partial with me anybody here anybody no anybody or you can oh Juliana you did let's go Juliana beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so guys for those of you who are on YouTube let me go bring you guys up on

thing hopefully you're able to follow along me out of that that's it I'll see you guys in the next video this is fun this is a lot of fun oh my God it's all good so good no try questions all the best I'm I'm so hungry oh yeah foreign here's the app that you're going to be building today the clubhouse clone all right now you're going to have a screen that's gonna welcome you like this so you go okay let's enter my username and get inside all right here you can put your phone number and hit next now it might send you a code you put that in okay it's dummy it doesn't actually send you a code and then you hit next well are you going to enable notifications to know when people are talking you know what I actually will so I'm going to hit allow boom enter the clubhouse clone we're done with the onboarding flow now we are on to the logged in user flow we have our header at the top with our header components that are going to be there no matter where we go and here is our app and we're seeing which users are talking with each other how many people are in the room how many people are actively talking right I can start a room I can hit social I can hit let's go and boom look at that a loader popped up and then the room started now I can see that there are two people in the room I can hit the mute button and actually mute I can unmute all right and if I wanted to I can just click leave quietly and leave out of there nobody even knows that I was there and notice that I'm actually using bottom sheet which is something I'm going to show you with the react that you can use when I click things change and I'm doing using the react hook for use state right State Management and I'll be able to switch between them and look the text at the bottom changes other things that are happening in this app is if I click the profile it takes me to the profile page and here rafikaze has zero followers 51 following clever cozy right and how am I making all of this styling happen right here let's go back and let's go to the explore page and look at how beautiful this page looks and how are we making this page look as beautiful right so how do we have this component here I'm using using Aunt D for this which I'm going to show you guys in this video we have our subheader component at the top Explorer with that back button right there okay I'm also using fire um icon so like boom we got this one right there all right languages how am I making all these cards appear and it looks really beautiful and look it's dynamically doing this right so I have data in a Json file and it's looping through and showing all of them so how do you actually do that with components and react you're going to learn how to do that so this is the clubhouse clone that you're going to be building this is one of the most advanced frontend projects and one of the most creative ones that we have done on this channel I think it's gonna blow your mind and I think you're going to be blown away by all the Advanced react.js Techniques that you learn so heavy front end build I'm excited I'm ready to just jump in and get some get my hands dirty I hope you're ready and I hope you're excited it with that said let's just smash the like button okay and subscribe to the channel because it really helps spread this video out if all you do is smash the like button doesn't cost you anything but changes my freaking life okay puts a video in front of people and our goal at clever programmer and so 5 000 people get jobs this year okay so I'm really really excited about that I love your beautiful face and we're going to be getting in to the video now let's go all right so let's just get straight into the build so first things first open up your command line so I'm just going to open up my um I term for you it'll probably be just regular terminal okay and uh you can make this folder wherever you want but I just like to go into my GitHub I have a folder called Banger projects that's where I like to put all of this and then I'm just gonna do create react app or you can do npx create react app okay like this and I will do Clubhouse clone and hit enter so at this point we're just gonna wait for the installation to be done as soon as the installation of your project is done and it's initialized then you're ready to get started okay and they're going to be a couple of differences between what you're doing and what I'm doing maybe you use npm maybe I use yarn so wherever I use you see me using yarn okay I'm gonna be using yarn add you're going to be using npm install okay so don't let that freak you out as we get into it now I'm going to go into my Clubhouse clone folder and you'll see hey that folder exists and I'm inside of it and now what I want to do is I want to open up my visual studio code and I'm gonna hit oh I'm gonna go to GitHub um I have my Banger projects folder and inside here I got my Clubhouse clone and you can just go ahead and open up your new folder that you made I'm gonna go here app.js kit command J to open my up up my command line and then I'm just gonna do yarn start and on the right hand side you're gonna see my server open up and I'm Gonna Keep it running right right there okay so at this point you should be at this part where your little circle is spinning and now another thing I want to do is I'm gonna go ahead and add so whenever I do yarn add what you should do is you should do npm install like that okay so I'm gonna do yarn add I'm gonna add bootstrap to my project because we're gonna need it okay so let's go ahead and install that and once that's done installing you should be good to go as far as bootstrap is concerned okay and then we're gonna go to our index file index.js and actually right underneath here I'm gonna do import bootstrap dist CSS bootstrap mn.css okay just like that so this will allow us to actually import bootstrap because we're going to be needing it throughout this project and next up let's actually just reset all of the styling so that's another thing I like to do so let's go ahead and just remove our index CSS s file completely I'm also going to grab everything in my app.css and just remove it and hit save and then let's go to our index.js file and let's remove this line where we have index.css okay because we just removed that file so of course on the right hand side is giving us an error about that and complaining okay so let's go to app.js sometimes when you run into errors just hit refresh usually what's especially a lot of The Styling errors that you're going to run into it takes care of a lot of those now the last part of the reset is going to be let's go to our app.css and in our app.css let's just add some styling okay so let's go to my root here and how I'm going to style it is I'm just going to say text color again this is going to be the text that we're going to need for the clubhouse style color text okay let's give it this text here dope and then I'm going to do button background color okay so now we got our button background color as well let's hit refresh that should be good okay beautiful and let's now go ahead and uh give it our HTML a scroll behavior of smooth and then body I'm going to do margin zero so this is so I can remove any uh styling that react comes with so that's why I want to specifically say margin zero and just like remove any of those okay even though we removed index CSS but it's just good to go ahead and do that for resetting purposes font size one em and then font family we're going to do new triff Pro like that all right now let's actually work on adding the welcome page uh inside of our clubhouse clone alright so the welcome page that we're going to be working on is going to look like this okay so let's go ahead and work on that so first things first I'm going to go to my app.js and we're going to remove pretty much everything that I have in here okay and honestly just for now let's just leave it with like a dumb H2 and just say let's build the clubhouse clone okay just so there's something here and of course because we um let's also remove the logo and hit refresh cool and here we have let's build the clubhouse clone that's all you should have right now now we're gonna work on and add some of our components okay so let's go ahead and add our welcome.js so I'm gonna build a page so let's go in our source I'm going to create a new folder and it's going to be called Pages just like this and inside of pages I'm going to have a file and it's going to be called Welcome JS okay and we're going to do import react from react okay now let's we're gonna go ahead and Link this file in just a second so I'm going to say export default function welcome okay and then let's just have it return something silly for now like I'm gonna say stew I am speaking from the Welcome JS file okay I want to just Hannah potato symbol because why not so I'm already exporting this let's go ahead back to our app.js and Link this file now so I'm gonna go here and let me actually just try to do this let's see how intelligent it is Boom so you can see that my import automatically happened import welcome from Pages slash welcome and I I'm speaking from the Welcome JS file so now these files and components are linked and let's go ahead and keep adding things uh to our welcome component okay so let's start off from I'm gonna remove all of this just for now we're gonna hit return and then I want to do and create a div and let's go ahead and give this a class name of I'm gonna do Styles and do style this autocomplete is aggressive style.welcome container okay and now it's going to be complaining about hey style is not defined well no worries we're just gonna go ahead and make the Styles now so let's right click into our source file and I'm going to create a new folder this folder is going to be called style and this is going to create all our styling and in here I'll create a new file and it'll be called welcome welcome dot module.css just like this so this is our page and this is the styling that goes with that page okay so they're just gonna work hand in hand now inside of here let's just add some level of styling so I'm just going to say welcome container okay and let's just add padding of 3 Em by 1.5 am okay just like this so I'm going to leave this as is until we run into our next problem let's hit refresh now it will still complain that style is not defined well that's because you probably have to actually import it at the top so let's go import style from style welcome okay let's do it like that and we're gonna do welcome dot module dot CSS okay so now it should be good to go okay so now inside of this div we're gonna add a H1 and let's just have that H1 say welcome so now there you go we got our welcome and the reason why you have that padding is because we added a bunch of padding probably three em padding from the top and then 1.5 on the side so you get the welcome right here if I went back to our styling uh where did we have the style here right if we change this up it's going to do something different if I change that to 1.5 it's going to be different so here our styling is connected and it's working and that's a really good sign okay now we're gonna have um this one all of these okay so we're gonna create a new styling for this so let's go ahead and do that so right underneath my welcome I'm going to create another div I'm going to give it a class name of let's go with style dot welcome info all right and then welcome info I'm gonna have a paragraph tag and we're pretty much going to start off with the with just some copy and I'll just say hey we're working hard to get Clubhouse ready for everyone while we wrap up the finishing touches okay we're adding people gradually you don't have to copy all of that with me but I just like to add it because this actually makes it look like a real clone you know so like just going one step further to make it look very very real okay so that's why you know if you want to do it just do it with me because your project is going to look freaking phenomenal all right to make sure because sometimes what happens is if your project is just too dummy of a project recruiters are going to look at it and they're gonna be like looks too dummy but adding a little bit of this even though it seems like grunt work might add a wow factor to your project all right so that's why don't get lazy here just work with me all right and then I'm just gonna say noting making sure nothing breaks cool all right so that's uh good and let's see do I want to have all of this I can I'm going to be lazy and I'm just gonna copy it okay I'll give you a deployed version too and then you'll be able to copy it from there as well so we'll put another P tag here and I'll paste all of that cool and then do I have anything else okay the last it's the last finishing touches okay so let's go P tag oh whoa what happened there P tag let's paste it alright so our second P tag all the all these look good but I think one of them might need a little bit of styling work so we're going to go ahead and do that in a second but right now more importantly this is going to need some styling so let's go back to our module.css all of this is going to need styling so now let's style our container so I'm going to go display Flex that's going to enable Flex mode and look at how pretty it looks yeah we're done I'm gonna do Flex Direction and uh we'll start off with column okay back to normal back to where we started and then I'm going to justify content with space between cool and then let's do align items like start okay hi let's try 100 VH so that gave it a nice little height from the top and then let's go ahead and add a background color and that's going to do magical stuff right that's going to give it that Clubhouse background color and it's going to start to look nice just like that pink all right so if I remove this background color looks regular looks white I added and now it looks like oh maybe a little clubhousey okay now what I want to do is now let's style the welcome containers H1 which is going to be that welcome okay so let's go welcome container H1 so I'm going to select that H1 and let's style that bad boy so fine font size I'm gonna go with the 1.7 em so let's make that a little bit smaller give it a font weight of 500 okay refresh cool font style I'm gonna go with normal and then margin bottom let's go zero cool and then color I'm just gonna use the variable of the color that I made for text color and then we'll be able to reference that dope okay and then let's style our welcome info class so welcome info height let's go with 253 pixels okay and I'm gonna go over flow Auto dope so now you can see I have like this little scrolling thing so now it just doesn't keep just going down I can actually like scroll up and down there's another reason why you should add the dummy content right even though it seems like grunt work to add all this it's good because once you have it you'll have if you don't have all of this text and you won't even have that like scrolling functionality all right and then let's go and um style the paragraph tag so all of this stuff that's wrapped in paragraph tag so I'm going to go ahead and style that now so let's go margin bottom I'm gonna go to em on this thing cool and let's go color and again we're going to use the text color font size I'm gonna go with uh one em on this thing and let's see font style normal should be good okay and font weight 400. so again when sometimes uh some of this stuff doesn't work refresh and you'll see the difference so for example if I change this to like something ridiculous like 900 it'll it should show you okay so this is just to make sure that hey like things are things are working as expected all right so now what I want to do is I'm going to actually take all of this and I'm gonna I want to put it in like a parent container and then style that all right so we will call that component uh plan layout so let me go to app.js so I'm going to take this welcome component that I have and I'm going to wrap it in something called plan layout so it's going to look like this plan layout okay but since I haven't made it yet I'm gonna go and make that first so inside of pages I will create a new folder where you will call it layouts all right and inside of this folder I'll create a new file and we'll call it planned layout.js okay epic now in here let's do import react from react all right let's capitalize that R and then let's go function plan layout and it'll have children okay and I'm going to return this and what I'm going to return is a div and it's going to have a certain styling okay so we're going to use jsx here let's go like this I'm going to go with 100 I'll go Max with I'm gonna need to put a comma here it's an object jsx object okay that's what we're passing in here let's give it 500 pixels and then I'll give it margin Auto okay and then of course let's go to where the div is ending okay we'll end the div here and inside of this will put all the children components there alright so plan layout plus all the children components will go inside of it now let's make sure that we go ahead and Export this export default plan layout just like this and let's wrap this bad boy Lester have you been a bad boy inside of a plan layout all right so I'm gonna hit uh return like this plan layout wait why the does it say plan layout J oh there we go plan layout still says J whatever boom boom so wrapped it up just like this and I'm gonna do import plan layout from and again where is it at it's in pages and then inside of layouts and then inside of there it's a file called plan layout alright so I'm going to get it just like that Pages layouts plan layout hey look at that starting to look a lot more clubhousey okay great progress so far and now let's actually start adding links on this page so then we can navigate out of the home page right otherwise we're going to be permanently stuck in the home page and uh that's not what we want okay so we're gonna add uh links to be able to go to the next page now so let's do that so first things first now we're about to start adding routing okay so what that means when you want to do that is we need to install things so let's go yarn add again you're going to do npm install whenever you see me do that and we're going to do yarn add and let me move myself away a little bit here so you can see what I'm typing yarn add and we will do react Dash router just like that and hit enter okay and then the next one we're gonna do is um we're gonna install react router Dom and what this will allow us to do is it will allow us to navigate back and forth between pages okay so that's going to be an important thing so now both of them are installed just in case you missed it yarn add or npm installed this one and also install this one cool so now both of those should be added in your package Json and I mean I'll just show you my packet Json okay let's go my yarn lock they look very ugly I thought they're going to look much prettier but there it is react router react router Dom bootstrap that's what I have you should have those uh things as well cool so let's add them to my welcome.js page um so let's go to this page here hit save and let's start working on it so I'm going to do import link from react router Dom so in in react you don't want to use like a tag that much you want to use this link and what that allows you to do is navigate between Pages without having to do any type of refresh it's really really powerful so take uh take advantage of that so let's go down down down and I'll go right underneath here underneath the Paul whatever section because we want to add uh we want we want to add these buttons and things right there so let's go underneath this and I'm going to make a new div and this will have a class name of and we'll do style dot action button okay we're going to style this in a second but let's just add it for now just so you can see how ugly it looks and then you'll see the prettier version afterwards so I'm going to say link exact two and we'll do get username and after this we'll do class name equals primary button and this is coming from bootstrap align items Center and just like this okay and now it's complaining it's like hey you gotta like close some of this stuff so we will close it in just a second but we have to close our link first so once our link closes then it will be fine okay save refresh all right so now it's going to give us a little error and it's going to complain hey you're using link outside a router so let's go ahead and fix that right now so let's go at the top I'm going to hit import browser router and we'll do from react router Dom okay actually my bad let's do that in our let's do that actually in our app.js file okay let's do that here and let's wrap our entire app in the browser router so let's go browser router okay and save okay so now our entire app is wrapped up in it cool so now let's go here so our link now is good to go and we're gonna add a few things to it so let's go to all right so right underneath this let's go and go get your username actually let's get out of the link tag and I'm gonna do get your username and we'll just kind of like leave this blank for now let's hit save and here it is right we can already see that link it says get your username and you can see that right when I clicked it it actually navigated me to get underscore user that's really dope it happened like really fast and without even refreshing of course we'll need to tell it to how do you route out of this page and then how do you render a new page we'll have to tell it and teach it those things and let's add an image okay and this image we're gonna have a source and of course I'm gonna have you guys get access to all these images Okay so let's go and get this image alright so for now I'm going to hold off on this image we have our username so that's good let's just actually work with the button first and then if we need to add anything we will add it later let's go underneath this all right and I'm going to make another link okay so we have this button here being a link and then we'll add another little button thing and then that'll also be a link okay and then um actually this one just will just be text so I'm going to say have an invite text sign in cool just like we have over here have an invite text sign in cool I have an invite text sign in so we got two links here but now we need to do styling because one looks like a button and one looks like text they're also Center aligned so we need to make sure that we do that with ours okay we need to make sure that we Center align them so let's go ahead and do that all right so now inside let's go to our styling and style this okay so I'm gonna go to my welcome Dot module.css and let's actually style our action button so let's go here and I'm gonna go action button and let's go align self let's go Center cool so now both of those are centered that's a really good sign we will do display Flex okay so now they look nice and ugly but we're gonna fix them in just a second let's give it a direction of column good um we're gonna need to align them vertically as well cool and then of course let's align them horizontally as well with justify content content Center okay cool and now I'm going to take my let's grab our action button class again and let's grab our last child of um of our a okay so let's go grab that and for color I'm going to do button background color like this font size let's go with I really want to make um this clone Pixel Perfect so that's that font size looks good to me okay there we go again sometimes when I'm doing this guys it gives me AIDS I'm like what the is going on change the goddamn thing and finally when I hit refresh everything changes and it looks good okay so if if your styling is not doing anything just hit refresh okay so Watch What Happens right when I add this color right it gives it this uh what is that like a weird ugly turquoise color okay that's necessary because Clubhouse looks like that alright so give it that color it's gonna be good font size we got it working let's add a weight and I'm gonna go with the weight of 400 cool refresh okay good good all right and then font style let's go with normal on this thing Okay cool so so far this is looking good all right now we're gonna add the patch for having an invite page as well so what does the invite Page look like well if I go to the finished version of the app and I go to my invite page it looks like this okay and then if I like you know put in uh some random dummy number whatever it takes me another page and then that actually takes me to this page and when I click it it takes me to the app all right so we have a bunch of screens that we want to work on so we can have a actual normal looking user flow because that's something important as a developer you need to learn how to be able to design that and build it okay and make it functioning so let's go and add that now so first I'm gonna work on the phone confirmation page so we're going to work on the page where if I go here it asks me for this type of stuff okay so let's go and work on that I'm gonna go to pages and inside of pages we'll create a new page new file file and we're going to do page or actually phone confirmation.js just like this all right so now let's start off with importing react and we're going to need to use um we're going to need to do State Management so let's also use use State because we're going to need it and uh that's good cool let's also import Style okay and I'm gonna let's comment this out for a second because uh we're gonna need to create styling for this in just a second okay and let's also import link so it can allow us to navigate without needing to refresh so react router Dom beautiful and let's go and Export default function phone confirmation and what export default does is at the bottom of the screen you don't have to add a separate line for uh exporting this and it allows you to use this component phone confirmation inside of your other files wherever you might want to use it so we're going to have a value set value okay a state variable okay it's going to keep track so just start off with use State and then we're going to do a return div and class name style phone confirm phone confirm and let's go container we're going to work on that container in a second for now now let's just add in this enter your phone so can we see that page right now well let's try Okay so let's try to go to slash invite all right or get user we can't really go to that page so we're gonna need to add routing for it so we can go to it okay so let's do that first so I'm going to go to my app.js and then app.js let's add routing for it so I got my browser router and I'm also going to get route just like this and within my app underneath plan layout what I want to do is I'm going to go uh let's delete this line here okay this is going to be something cool I'm going to do so route exact path and I'll say the home page should take us to this component oh this is such clean syntax I think this is new with react this is a really really clean syntax all right and then we have slash invite and this should take us to the phone confirmation page okay and make sure that you import that at the top so now it says welcome is not defined and it goes so welcome let's do capital W so now that's good and now it says style is not defined in phone confirmation.js so let's go back to our file guys a lot of this you have to get used to and comfortable with reading the errors okay a lot of the battle is like actually understanding what your errors are saying it says his style is not defined and that actually makes sense it's like style and it's complaining so probably we have to actually import style so in our phone con confirmation let's go ahead and do import style from and we're gonna do style slash phone confirm.module.css but now we have another problem it says can't resolve meaning like now I can't find this file and that's because we didn't actually create this file yet okay while we're making our or phone confirmation component let's also create the styling for it so let's go to our style folder and in here we're going to create a new file and this new file is going to be called phone confirm Dot module.css and let's just start off with some styling actually it's running already so let's go back to our code for now so now all errors are gone that's a good sign and if I go to the slash invite page I can actually see where we have written enter your phone and it's showing that right over here so that's also a really good sign that means that's really cool it means our routing is working and this component is being rendered based on the routing so if I go to app.js we say Hey whenever you go to slash invite then show the phone confirmation component okay and let's go to that component it's really really clean okay let's hit save let's hit refresh where did I add those stupid little tildas so we have enter your phone where the heck did I Anthem I can't even see them pretty fresh delete holy crap let's undo okay well I guess you're just gonna have to live with them now um all right well that's it okay let's let's keep going all right so um what I want to do now is I want to style style this thing okay but I'm gonna style it in just a second I don't know man some weird happens when you're demoing stuff but at this point I just don't care guys and uh we just gotta roll with the punches all right so inside of this div I'm gonna create a new P tag and uh we're gonna say by entering your number you're agreeing to our terms okay so I'm just gonna leave it like this you're agreeing let's go agreeing okay and then I'll I'll add a Spam tag let's not end our P tag yet and within my span tag I'm just going to say terms of service and privacy policy okay and then I'll say tanks outside of the spam tag cool but let's maybe give it a space let's give that a space dope so this is looking good by the way I discovered I added it to my entire app so now again a debugging session okay so if I add it into my entire app and it's showing up everywhere then it's not component specific it is global so Global I shouldn't be looking within this component because the Eric can't possibly be here so I'm going to look inside of my app JS and inside of my app.js I have multiple components right and if you notice I've actually added it right there okay so now that's permanently there no matter what page I'm at okay so you you could if you added a potato here it would follow you to the depths of hell it doesn't matter where you go it will follow you throughout the freaking app so the moral of the story is don't be a potato uh oh gosh what have I done now all right let's close this all right all right good cheese okay good good good good now let's go ahead and style this sucker alright so I'm gonna go to my uh phone confirmation module.css and we're going to create styling for this thing those Go Phone confirm and do container like this let's add a padding to it so I'll go 3M by 1.7 em just like this all right let's hit refresh have to refresh every second but that's okay and then we're gonna go display Flex oh so pretty Flex Direction remember call them that thing and you will be much better if you put it in a row you'll probably not be better because row is default and align items will go Center and um so that's vertical alignment okay and then we're going to do justify content Center and that will that will horizontally align things okay let's go height and we'll go 100 VH so that like kind of centers it okay and then I'm gonna do background color and of course we're going to pick uh rap what the what is a wrap color oh okay never mind there's like a weird shortcut that was totally unnecessary let's just add the normal color for Clubhouse clone so I'm gonna go F2 F0 E4 all right and now we'll have the clubhouse color okay just keep refreshing like a maniac and things should be good and then I want to go position relative all right so that's good now we're going to style the H1 just it just a little bit so phone confirm container and I'm going to grab the H1 of this and I'm going to say hey give me a font size of 1.3 am so we're gonna make that a little bit smaller it was really big font weight of 500 font style I'm gonna just have normal and then let's go margin bottom zero and we'll give it a color of our text color okay so this is our clubhouse style text color and then lastly okay actually there's few more things we want to do here but let's still go phone confirm container let's grab the text so the paragraph tags and uh we're gonna give it a different font size let's refresh okay so the that font size is much smaller as you can see here go font weight go font style will be normal margin of zero we'll go width of a hundred percent on it and then Max width I'm gonna say 270 pixels so it's looking more centered on mobile devices now and uh text align of course Center and then justify content and for this one we can even do space evenly and we should be good and then the actual last one where we have terms of service and privacy policy now this should look different than the rest of the rest of everything so let's style it differently okay so again let's grab the P tag and the span tag with inside of the P tag okay that's basically what I'm saying there and I'm just going to give it a font weight of 500. okay let's refresh and you can see it looks just a little bit Bolder than the rest of the things okay and for now that's that's pretty much actually let me go here yeah this is pretty good right now okay I hope that you're enjoying this so far uh we're gonna keep going and the next functionality that we're actually gonna add is we're gonna add um links so you can actually go forward and then eventually so you can also like click the back button and go back from this page otherwise can just be stuck just stuck on this page for the rest of your life alright so let's actually add the input for where people can put in their phone number so for example when I go to the invite page I can now put in my phone number right here okay so we're gonna add that to our uh invite page as well right now we just have enter your phone by entering your number you're agreeing to blah blah blah let's put that and work on that now so first things first I'm going to need to install a library from react so we're going to do yarn add or npm install both are okay react phone number input just like that all right not input input with an end hit enter so that's going to go ahead and install this library on your computer and you'll be able to use this okay and then let's go to our phone confirmation page here and we're going to add this phone input okay so let's go ahead right underneath the H1 I'll add my phone input and now watch I'm going to hover over this hit enter and it should have Auto completed it so or or imported it so you see right there it automatically imported it okay if it did and then just go ahead and import it and we're going to do phone input and inside of this input and actually this will be a selfclosing tag like this all right and you can already start to see that the input is showing up here I can choose International I can put a phone number in so really cool comes with some logos and stuff like that too we're gonna definitely have to style this I'm going to say International okay and then I'm going to say default country and us if you don't know what parameters it has you saw how it all kind of Auto completes it so that'll show you what kind of uh parameters you can play with and after default country we have value which we're going to set to value and that's again coming from whatever you might type in here okay we're going to need access to to this and then that's kind of kind of it actually all right now that we've added the input what I want to do is um I kind of want to add some of the arrow links that we were talking about and arrows for like being able to go forward and at some point being able to go backwards so let's go ahead and do that okay so I'm gonna work on that with you now so I'm gonna go into my phone confirmation.js which I'm already here so that's great and we're going to do a couple of things okay so all the way at the top or we have the phone confirm container right underneath that I'm actually going to add a link and in this link I'm going to say okay I'm going to do this and I'm going to give it a class name of style dot back button and then inside of here we're actually going to use that image well you're like hey Kazi where's that image let me show oh yeah so you're gonna have your own images file but in public images we have them all here okay so I'm gonna need arrow and next Arrow pretty soon so I'm just gonna get both of them for now whoops and um inside of my public right I can create a new folder and I can call it images and I can put my images inside of there okay so let's go ahead and I'm gonna grab my images again when I had them boom boom boom public images and I got my next Arrow and arrow cool take them drop them and now we got them both so I got my SVG one and I got my regular Arrow cool beautiful let me put my phone on silent so nobody can harass me like that again and let's keep going so now let's actually add that image I'm gonna do images Arrow dot PNG okay now let's go to the slash invite page misspelled it okay great we have that image showing up it doesn't look so good but it is showing up so that's a really good sign now let's go underneath here and I'm also going to add another link and in this link I'm going to say exact two and we're gonna go to code confirm and then I'm gonna give it a class name of let's see if I can um first add the the text and then the image okay so let's go here I'm going to say next all right where is that next it's all at the bottom okay so you will see this next Aldo at the bottom might be a little hard to see but there it is okay let's zoom out maybe just a little bit oh already the navigation is working so that's a good sign cool and now to this next I'm actually going to add add an image okay so we're going to say IMG Tab and then the source I'm going to give it is my next Arrow icon.svg and then let's now go ahead and start styling this thing slash and then I will say class name equals ml1 and that that made a little uh you saw what it did right so for example if I remove this class name and hit save the next button you'll see that it actually moves a little bit to the left okay and this is happening uh because of bootstrap now I'm also gonna add a class name to this at the top where I kind of left it blank and what I'm going to say is the following give it a primary button see if that does anything refresh okay so that's the top uh the next Arrow image it's the the next button right here okay so right now you can't see the image that's next to next okay it's really hard to see it it's right there and uh don't worry we're going to be able to see more of it once we style it more okay so for now just kind of like hang in there okay let's go here and uh that probably looks better for mobile okay so we'll we'll leave it at this okay I know it's a little uh kind of like a little difficult to see some of these things but I think you should be fine right now so that image is there now let's go primary button I'm gonna say deflects here and then I'm gonna go and align items Center and basically now what we need to do is go ahead and actually start styling this stuff so I'm gonna go to okay guys so a couple of things I want to do so one thing I want to do is I want to go to my app CSS file and um I want to make sure that my button here doesn't really have any styling so it doesn't come with any outline okay I'm just going to say important right here the next thing I want to do is I want to make sure that my link tags don't really have any underlines on them okay so that's why I'm adding this to my app.css file okay so we'll do text declaration none Okay cool so I shouldn't have really any errors going into this now you'll notice that I added this class name to this next Arrow image and I said primary button but we don't really have a primary button class so let's go ahead and add the CSS for our primary button and let's go ahead and do that now all right so now let's go to our app CSS success and add this code there okay so app.css is right here and we're gonna add it in okay so I'm going to say primary I'm going to grab my primary button class and we'll give it a background color of let's just start off with a pink background color and so you can see now it's highlighted okay the R button so I'll change this background color from that to something that makes much more sense we'll use our variable okay and I'm going to say a button background color like this so now you see that it has this like blue color behind it but it still looks a little bit ugly so let's keep working on it all right let's um zoom out just a little bit now I wanna I wanna add some color to this okay so let's make that how many yes we got here cool so let's make that white I'll add a border or radius and we'll go with two em on this one cool so that that gives it those like nice little rounded corners but it's still you know kind of hideous so let's you know let's make it let's make it work I'll add a little bit of padding to this okay wow that padding really made a lot of difference right you saw the button kind of just let me remove the padding and let me add the padding and that just makes a world of a difference so remember these patterns as you're making buttons as you're making whatever you're making just a little bit of padding or a little bit of margin can make such a huge difference and then I'm gonna give it a font size of 1.2 em okay and if you'd never see changes just hit refresh so you saw the font size get bigger and it's a little bit easier to see now we'll give it a font weight of 500 that's good now it looks a little bit Bolder and then font style I'm gonna go normal cool text align I am gonna say Center on this okay so I think that is looking really really good and let's go back to our app CSS file so now this is looking good now pretty soon we're going to need to bring this back arrow button and con into control because it's it's all over the place and honestly it's taking over our entire app and you know taking over my entire life so I'm gonna fix this now all right so now let's go back to our phone confirmation and here we look look we did we did value right but how is that value going to get changed you see the set value is still unused and that's really how you actually change variables that are like State variables in react right so I still need to do like on change what I want to say is hey call this call my set value okay and that's going to actually allow me to accept the new value and actually make a change happen cool and that's going to update our value in here okay so now let me type stuff in great that looks good because if you actually go back back and you take that on change out right so like if you comment that out watch what happens if I go and I try to type in my phone number I'm going to get an error and it's going to say hey on change is not a function okay and so here let me bring this back and now when I actually try to write it knows actually what to do with that cool so this is looking good now what I want to do is I want to actually add that back arrow and give it a little bit of styling Okay so we've already added that back arrow and now let's go to our phone confirmation.module.css and we've we've added some Styles in here but now we're going to actually add the styles for this button right here because remember this this image is kind of crazy right so I'm gonna actually do back button and we're gonna give it a position absolute okay so now it's like right in the center all right so now if you actually comment it out right it's actually in line with every other element but actually if I make position absolute it is going to be smack on top of everything that's what position absolute does and uh let's give it a top of 10 pixels like this okay and then we're going to give it a left of 10 pixels like that cool and then the last thing we're going to do is we're going to bring that image size under control okay so I'm going to select the image I'm going to give it a width of 20 pixels and there you go that's it okay that uh resizing just changes the game and now we got the back button here we got our next looking good okay we got the big American flag in the middle put your phone number in and I mean I don't know this the screen is starting to look pretty damn good to me with that said let's keep on going all right now I actually want to work on the confirmation screen okay so for example what's the confirmation screen you ask Kazi what's the confirmation screen all right don't worry let me freaking show you okay so I go here I hit next and this is the confirmation screen so this is a very simple screen that's what we're going to work on right now and um it's going to be quite simple okay so let's go inside of our source inside of our source I'm going to um go inside of our pages and in my pages I'm going to create a new file and it's going to be called code confirm.js just like that okay inside of here I'm going to do import react from react like this I want to also get my Styles okay from that slash style slash phone confirm dot module.css cool so this should be in under my pages Pages code confirm beautiful then you back out you go into style okay that's that's good all right and then I'm also going to need my link because that allows me to go to different links without having to refresh okay that's a better a way to better than using the a tag that's what I recommend in react so now let's uh export default function so you don't have to write an additional export line if you just do that here and this component will be called code confirm okay and then in here I'm going to create a div it's going to have a class name of style DOT phone confirm container so we're going to now reuse some of the styling and the code that we've already done we're going to have another div here it's going to have a class name of text Center and this right here text center it's a bootstrap it's it's a bootstrap thing that is basically shorthand for doing text align Center okay so just makes your life a little bit easier now inside of here I'm going to make an H1 okay and then this H1 I'm just pretty much going to say enter the code we just texted you we're gonna actually need to see this so let's go ahead and actually to create the routing for this so we can see this freaking page okay so let's go to our app.js and in here we'll create the routing for so I'm going to say import code confirm from and we'll do Pages slash code confirm so I'm going to get that component and then at the end here I'm going to say let's go like this and for the path it's going to be code confirm and of course show me this component code confirm oh did I misspell it should be confirm confirm and let's actually go to this file and let's do I mean it's confirm everywhere okay I might have just misspelled it here then okay so let's try going here and doing code underscore confirm hit enter uh nothing was returned oh yeah because we don't have a return statements so we'll just do for now I'm just going to do a return and I will wrap this whole thing up in an expression like this save boom okay enter the code we just texted you so so far it's looking good now this H1 let's style it in a specific way so what I'm going to say is uh I'm gonna style it okay actually let's add all the content first and then I'm gonna style it so let's add a P tag inside of this div and basically in this P tag I'm just going to say it didn't receive receive it okay and then we'll have a span tag in here and then in that span tag I'm just going to say tap to resend okay so just like that then receive it tap to resend beautiful now for this H1 I'm going to say give it a um not last name I'll do style and we'll do I'm gonna give it a jsx expression and I'm gonna just give it a object inside of it okay it's just a simple JavaScript object and in here I'm going to say with will be 100 this is inline styling okay Max width will be 200 pixels and then we will use um margin bottom will be 1 em so enter the text we just enter the code we just texted you didn't receive it tap to resend and it looks looks pretty freaking good all right and then for my P tag I'm going to give it a little bit of styling as well we'll go class name mt2 let's hit save so again remove it refresh bring it back mt2 now with this empty two you might not see the difference right away but once we actually add the input box where you actually put in your number okay so for example um here you're actually going to see the difference all right so we'll talk about that once we add it other than that I think as far as this specific page slash screen slash component is concerned the code confirm one I think it's looking good and uh let's now start working on the input okay so now we're going to work on the input box over here so let's put that right underneath the H1 simply do input the type is going to be text because yes we're going to be putting in text in there and then we're going to do styling all right so let's go style I'm going to go with in here I'm going to give it a hundred percent width okay so you just saw this got a little bit wider that's perfect um now all right let's um let's actually do it like an object okay okay with 100 I'm going to give it a border of none so let's get rid of uh the border around it let's go down all right and sometimes you know if it doesn't show up just hit refresh because I don't know why but sometimes the code just won't load up okay so just hit refresh the Border should now be gone and it should look much cleaner we're gonna do text align okay and I'm going to do Center like this cool um and then I'm gonna do outline I'm gonna say uh none what does this text align line do notice we're now about to write I'm writing from the left hand side right text align Center I write I write from the middle so that's good okay so this code confirm screen honestly looks uh pretty good let's just move forward now so we're going to add the next and previous uh buttons to this so we can actually go back or forward right because otherwise we're just going to get stuck here so we want this and this luckily we just created it and this is where you're going to start seeing um some of the power of react this is we're going to see the power of react okay so let's keep on rocking and rolling so inside of our code confirm I'm going to go all the way up right underneath here and I'm going to add a link tag like that I'm going to say exact 2 and we're going to say get username like that and we'll have a class name and the class name will be style dot back button okay and of course let's give it an image so we'll go image on here and I'm going to say slash Images slash arrow.png okay so now that button is there okay now one more thing we need to add and we'll add it underneath this div is create a link I'm going to say exact two we'll say allow underscore notifications notification okay I think that's because that's going to be another one of our screens and then here I'm going to say class name and let's put that okay let's put that below so class name and I'll say primary button Flex align items Center like that cool so now that button is there and it's looking good it's inheriting the styling from primary that's what we wanted okay and um I want to of course give it some text right so here I'm just gonna say next and then we'll give it an image images slash next Arrow icon dot SVG so now that uh little image is there okay let's hit refresh great great great great great okay that's the image that we wanted and then of course we'll do class name equals and we'll go ml1 on this and again this is a bootstrap cool so now this is looking uh this is looking good okay and it's doing what we want it to do so let's keep on going all right so I don't like that uh underline that's happening underneath the next so let's go to our app CSS and what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna do a hover okay and on this hover I'm gonna say text decoration and let's go with none okay and let's go let's refresh hover over it okay it's still giving us problems let's hit save here so let's actually go ahead and debug and see what's going on here all right let's go ahead and add the important right here hit save go over and boom look it's gone okay so um sometimes you just have to add that important to take precedence over maybe some of the other styling you have or if you're using bootstrap maybe their text decoration or their on Hover with the a tag is taking precedence but doing important you say hey forget all that this is what takes importance and go with this one all right so now let's add our notification page okay that's going to be another one of our screens so I'm gonna go inside of my pages here and I'm going to right click and we're going to go and add a new file and it's going to be allow notification.js and in this file I'm going to say import react from react like this cool we're also going to import style from all right we've done this a couple of times now phone confirm dot module.css like that and then I'm going to do import link from react router Dom okay all right and then export the function so let's make our component now is going to be called allow notification okay and just you're clear on what we're building here is this one this screen right there all right this is a really this is really important for building out a proper user flow you need to have all of these things in there so I'm going to say div okay and um this is going to have a class name of style DOT phone confirm container like so okay inside of here I'm going to have another div and I'm going to Center align it so let's go ahead and uh class name text Center okay inside of here I'm going to have an H1 and that H1 will say last important step like this let's go to ours um okay and let's actually go ahead and connect this to our app JS and add it to our routing so we can actually go to this page okay so I'm going to import allow notification from actually we don't need this because we should just be able to use this component okay so I'm gonna go here and I'm going to say allow notification and hit save and it's already imported at the top and the exact path to get here will be allow underscore notification so now let's change that URL to allow underscore notification all right and I'll hit enter and I'm on this page uhhuh nothing was returned so we just have to make sure we wrap this thing in a return statement like this save last important step is now showing up okay that's good now inside of here I want to add in another H1 and I'm going to say enable notifications to know when people are speaking okay or talking like that cool now let's start giving it a styling so I'll give this one an H1 and we'll say mb4 alright so you saw that it gave it a few like line breaks here okay okay that was helpful and then we will do for this H1 as well we'll do something similar and I'll say class name and we'll go mb3 okay so that moved it up a little bit okay so that's margin bottom right short for I believe margin bottom and that's how we we add margin Bottoms in bootstrap I suck at bootstrap but this is fun right like we're all learning something and we're implementing it in this project and using it so that's super cool now let's work on adding the notification popup okay so like this little thing here we'll work on that so how we need to do that is first of all go ahead and grab the image so it's going to be the in the image folder that's in the description of the video that you can get access to okay that's where all the files are going to be images all the assets you'll ever need grab this image um this SVG and put it inside of your public images folder like so okay so now we have it now with that said let's go ahead and work on more on or allow notification component okay so right underneath this H1 we're going to create a div and it'll have a class name of style dot notification container and don't worry we'll create that styling okay let's just add all the content first and then we will create the styling for it so just breathe for me breathe in breathe out and relax it'll all be just fine should I all right that was bad but whatever I'm gonna add it in anyway okay uh next up let's create another div okay and I'm gonna give it a class name of uh P3 so this is shorthand for padding in all directions in bootstrap okay way nicer than having to do that in CSS is kind of annoying all right now within here we're going to make an H3 and uh this is going to say Clubhouse would like would like to send actually let's um camel case everything would like to send you notifications just like that cool let's get out of that H3 and we're gonna have a P tag and it's going to say notifications may include alerts sounds and icon batches so we got our H3 that's good you should have your paragraph tag with that information now let's go ahead and um let's get out of this div and let's go underneath here and we're going to create a new div okay and this will have a class name of style dot action button okay and inside of here I'm going to be using a link and this link will do the following okay exact two and this link will take me to the home page and this will basically the text will say don't allow okay so we have the Sexes don't allow when I click it I just get redirected to the home page you saw the URL change at the top that's it simple we'll have another link and this will also take us to the home page so let's actually what I'm going to do is um let's just paste this and we're going to remove the word don't so we have don't allow and then we have the word allow okay and with styling we're gonna separate them out from each other so they're not so close and then let's create an image and the image source is going to be hand icon.svg look at that look at how good that looks okay it's coming together okay just have some hope faith and some patience it'll all come together and it'll look beautiful just like you you are beautiful and I want you to remember that as you watch this tutorial and if you're enjoying this so far smash that goddamn like button break the Subscribe button and help me and help us make this the best community for developers in the world and beat the YouTube algorithm while we're at it back to the tutorial okay so let me um yep so we got this image okay don't care that much about the alt stuff right now and let's go ahead and give it a class name and I'm going to do style dot hand icon okay we'll we'll create styling for it do not worry okay so now all this stuff is done now it's time for the fun stuff we're gonna go ahead and style this page okay all the content is there now let's work on our styling so I'm gonna go to our phone confirm module.css and inside of here let's start off with the notification container okay so I'll go notification container like so um and I'll give it a border radius of uh one em not one m okay okay so we got our border radius now you won't be able to see it until I actually add the Border okay so let's go ahead and um add a uh background color and we will add um I'll make the background color white okay so there you go okay if I remove the Border radius look at that it looks like a square and it looks kind of ugly then I do this and it already kind of looks delicious and you're like man that looks juicy I like it I don't know where it's headed but I am liking this and now we're going to give it a box Shadow and box shadow of zero pixels by zero pixels by five pixels and then we're gonna go like this look at that that drop shadow just makes it pop out and it just looks visually so damn good but a few more touches so work with me here let's go here I'm gonna go notification container let's grab H3 by the balls okay hopefully there are no kids listening to this but um you you know in that case it's just juggling balls and we will give it um font size of one em cool what happens if I let go of this oh okay so it makes it much smaller right boom you saw the H3 get under control because the H3 was ridiculous and uh we'll give it a font weight of uh 500. okay it said refresh cool and then um font style won't really matter I'll give it a color of zero zero zero zero zero like this okay so it's like kind of dark black um very subtle difference there but definitely you can see it if you look closely and then with we're gonna go hundred percent okay boom so let's go and I'm gonna margin Auto this thing okay and um then after this let's go margin bottom let's add a little margin bottom and I'm gonna go with 0.3 em okay makes a little bit of a difference gives us some more breathing room and now let's control the P tags okay so we're gonna go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go notification container we'll grab the P tags and then I'm going to say font size let's go 0.825 em cool let's go refresh and then um let's go font weight 500 okay so now this is starting to look a little bit better I'm gonna go line height of 1.3 so that reduced the line height by a little bit and then let's go margin Auto on it okay so that allowed it to kind of be Center aligned good next up grab the notification container and grab the action button class like this and in here I'm just going to say position relative and then what we're going to do is let's grab the action button class and inside of the action button class let's grab the a tags and we're gonna do a couple of things so first of all I'm going to say display and I'm going to say inline block okay all right so now what I want to do is with 50 okay wow that looks great so don't allow and allow or separated all right so now what I want to do is uh let's give it a padding of 0.5 em nice okay that looks great and I'm going to give it a border top of one pixel solid and we'll make it like so oh so clean okay we got a border top now let's go color let's use our variable and use this and what that did is it changed the color of the button okay now watch what happens when I comment this line out and I'm going to hit save keep looking at the colors they're like blue blue right but then when I do this and hit save they're like depressing turquoise color which I don't know why Clubhouse uses those colors it kind of depresses me but they like to use it so we're going to be using this um dope okay good now let's go again notification container action button inside of it and then we're gonna grab the a uh tags and we're gonna get the first child of the a tags okay and inside of here let's go border right dope and go one pixel solid and that little gray color okay what broke this time all right so this is what got added right now okay right there that's what God added and um that's looking good now let's work with the hand icon so I'm gonna go um notification container let's grab the hand icon inside of there and uh we'll go position absolute and we will go bottom negative 90 pixels okay let's refresh oh where is that image we don't even see that image that image is gone it's invisible but the card the card looks freaking beautiful right the card looks freaking great just because it is border right that added that the other border top added this I mean it's just clean and now let's go ahead and go right and I'm gonna go 20 pixels okay so now we got the hand showing up the hand of God and we'll give it a width of 80 pixels boom home and now it's telling people hey go ahead and allow it okay go ahead and allow it so that this page looks good it makes you want to click allow so then this Page's job is therefore done okay good job if you've made it so far and let's just keep going okay let's not stop and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a routing container and it's going to separate routes between logged in users versus logged out users so let's go ahead and go do that right now oh all right so let's go to our app JS and in here I'm also going to add switch all right like Drake says I just flipped the switch now I'm going to show you how to flip the freaking switch and under browser router I'm going to do a few things here okay so I'm gonna say route and inside of here I'm going to say exact and here's something cool I can do I can say path okay and uh there's a couple of reasons for this one it for this is going to be extra added layer of security like people will not even be able to go to these pads um or I'm sorry people will only be able to go to the paths that are inside of this array okay so for example slash so it's going to be the home path for like or the default page right your localhost or your main domain of your website and then I'll have slash invite um we'll have slash uh get backslash get username I will also have code confirm boom boom code confirm and then we'll have allow notification okay so what this means is if you try to even go to a path called like slash bananas all right let's go slash bananas you literally will not be able to go to that path at all okay so that's kind of the point of it and it's kind of cool like that and uh this route is going to end all the way at the bottom okay so it's going to be under right underneath where plan layout ends there we go now what we want to do is we want to add a switch statement that's going to allow us to like kind of switch between which one we want okay I'm going to say switch and I'm going to wrap this thing up in the switch okay so switch is going to end right above the plan layout right there let's see what the error is I got plan layout hmm oh my bad yeah this makes no sense so switch is just going to be inside of plan layout okay there we go cool so we got our switch we got our plan layout um a better way of calling it would be like the onboarding layout right so it's like what's the default layout we want on the onboarding screens and onboarding process when the user is signing up so that's gonna have one style of layout and then we're gonna have a different style of layout once the user is actually logged in okay so like for example this is the user flow right so if I go to the home page here this is a completed version of the app not the home page let's go to let's say the default one right you'll notice that all the text is kind of usually in the middle and there's this background color and there's no buttons or things on the top okay it has a very like similar uh Style Now go to invite consistent style okay same thing text and content is kind of in the middle there's no big things on the top and there you go right but now watch what happens once the user has signed up so let's hit next let's hit next let's hit allow now our layout is completely different so once I'm logged in permanently our layout is going to be different right so it doesn't really matter where I go we have like different styles of layout right and uh they're a little bit similar in nature depending on where you click and where you go but right like upcoming for you goes at the Top If I click explore Explorer goes at the top right you have two invites that goes at the Top If I hit notifications the activity where it goes on the top so there is going to be different layout plans so this is important for you to conceptually understand as we go through this and that's why this freaking thing is so cool here that we're doing okay so that's that you're good with that and now we're gonna keep on rocking and rolling all right so now we're gonna work on the next layout okay so remember layout one the onboarding process layout right that was the aka the plan layout okay and then layout two we're going to call it app layout all right that's gonna be the one that's once the user is logged in so again I'm gonna put in um here parentheses this is going to be for all logged in users and then this is going to be for all uh logged out users okay that's how the structure is going to be so let's keep going boom boom bada bam I will go let's go inside of pages inside of pages inside of layouts we're going to create a new layout so I'm going to set new file and I will simply say app layout dot Js okay and in app layout.js we're going to do a few things import react from react then we're gonna export default function so this is where we're going to create our component it's going to be called app layout and it's going to take in children and I'm assuming it's going to wrap the children inside okay so we're going to go div give it a class name of app layout so then we can you know do something with the styling later on if we wanted to and then it'll just display all the children components within that div and um let's go to our app.js now and in our app.js what I'm going to do is let's go down right underneath where we are actually ending our route right there and we're going to add another route okay and this route is going to be exact path all right and it's going to be an exact path to home okay and we're going to do display app layout here okay app layout like so hit enter so it Imports app layout from pages and layouts close the brackets okay and then here we're going to add our switch cool and um that should be good all right so now we're going to add a home page for logged in users okay so let's go ahead and do that so inside of our switch I'm going to have a route and here I'm going to say exact path path and we're going to say home and the component will be our home component okay just like that so I'm doing this here just to show you like we're just showing you that there are multiple ways of passing in a component I could have also just said home like this I can also remove this Arrow here okay but I'm just going to leave this here so you have multiple ways of how to pass a component okay so that looks good okay so we have our switch there and then our route okay and then this route can be a selfclosing tag because there's not much happening in between that so we can make a selfclosing tag just like this okay and now let's see what happens if I click home and hit enter all right it says home is not defined great so now we're going to make our home component um so let's go to pages and inside of pages I'll make a new file it will be called home.js okay and in here I'm going to do import react from react and I'm going to do export default function we're going to do home and we'll go and just return a empty div okay let's refresh and now it says home is not defined well that's because we need to import it so we'll import home from slash Pages slash home so now it's there and if I added a H2 here that said Hello World um home okay and you can see we got home there on the slash Home Route okay but also you can see that there's no styling so now we're going to go ahead and add that styling so let's go into our app.css file and here I'm going to add styling for our app layout like so and we'll have a background color of a clubhouse okay so you see the you see the background color up there and we'll do height of 100 pH cool so that's taking over the whole screen I'm going to do position relative and then with let's make it a hundred percent okay Max width I'm gonna go with 500 pixels okay and then we'll do margin Auto okay beautiful so now our styling is good to go and now we're ready to do some damage all right now we're gonna work on our header alright so what that means is we're gonna work on all of this and we'll add it and look great and you already know you look great okay so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going gonna go to my com um let's go inside of source okay and now we'll create components because these were pages that we were creating earlier inside of source I'm going to create a new folder I'm going to call it components like so and inside of my components I will create a new file new component and it'll be called header JS okay and I'm going to do import react from react like that I'm going to do import link from because I'm going to need need that from react router Router Dom like so and then let's also do import style from style dot header dot module.css they're going to be like hey guys see that file doesn't exist and you're right it doesn't exist and we're gonna run into a problem so inside of our style we're going to create a new file and it's going to be called header dot module.css okay let's just look at the style slash okay let's go style slash um and that should be good okay so I'm pretty sure that should be good okay cool so now let's um work on this component okay so there's going to be a lot of things that we're going to be doing so all function header like so and I'm going to just do return okay we're gonna have a div and the class name of this div is going to be style dot header all right and again we're going to create all these Styles so don't worry they're gonna not be there yet and then we'll have um link tag okay and this LinkedIn tag will be will have an exact two slash Explorer so when you click it it'll take you to the Explorer page and inside of here I'm going to have an image and that's going to be search dot PNG now before we continue further let's make sure at least this shows up so what do we need to do well we need to go to our home JS and we need to replace all this garbage that we have and replace it with our header component so I'm going to do header hit enter and it should import your header from there okay so now our header is being imported but we don't see anything so let's see and investigate further what could be going on let me remove this div and see what happens still I don't see anything maybe it's the styling of the image so let's go and take a look at that so actually you know of course we don't have this image I don't know like this is what happens when you um sit here in front of a computer for six hours straight and and working on this freaking project and coding you um you know start losing your brain cells so let's get back into it okay and we need to basically add um this you know this PNG file that um we don't have and then I'm pretending to have so let's go in our images and let's grab search because we're gonna need this okay we're also going to need a couple of other ones so we might as well just grab it now so we're gonna need search we're going to need notifications we're going to need invite we're gonna need calendar and we're going to need B1 so let's go and drag all of these into our images folder great so now we're going to have access to all of those okay and let's hit refresh and there we go Tada or nice image that perfectly fits on the screen and looks completely mobile responsive there you go you're done congratulations on your build you can go home now okay let's work on it now cool so um uh let's let's of course style it a little bit because uh if I don't style this I'm gonna get a headache all right if we continue building this so let's go ahead and grab our header and uh display Flex Flex like that we'll go align items Center so this will align items vertically aligns things okay let's go back style dot header import style from okay and this is our header okay great and then um let's uh let's take the images first okay let's do that header let's take the image and we will go with 25 pixels okay let's hit refresh so there you go that is looking great right that looks good we can see it and we like it okay that's the size that we want otherwise it gets too crazy and then um we're also going to work on the nav items in just a second but right now let's let's go ahead and keep adding things to this okay let's throw in some more images first so then we can really see the difference of The Styling because I don't like to just add styling for the sake of adding styling let's go to home and uh we'll just wrap this up in some jsx fragments like this cool okay that's not really going to make any difference but just you know it makes me feel warm and cozy so just do it for me cool uh let's go to our header now and uh we'll add a couple of more links okay so let's get out of uh this div or actually let's let's stay in this div and let's just go down underneath this link and I'm gonna go div and we will create a new div for our nav items okay so inside of our nav items let's have a link exact two and this will be for friends invite okay and inside of this link we will have an image and uh this image will will be our invite image so there you go we got that okay and if I click between these you notice how the URL will change when I click the mail icon click it and it is navigating me right there okay where I asked it to navigate me now we're gonna need a couple more icons to be exact we're going to need calendar and notification and our profile image so we're gonna need three more so I'm gonna copy this I'm gonna go here and I'm going to hit paste and I'm going to hit paste and then I'm going to hit paste again okay so I copied it and pasted it three more times so we're gonna have a total of four inside of our nav bar now we need to change a few things so where it says slash friends invite we're going to change this with upcoming we're going to change this one with activity and this one will be profile okay and then this one here where it says upcoming I'm gonna change that to calendar the Activity one we're going to change this with the notification image so you see the images are changing so if you keep noticing what's going to happen with the last image when I change it from invite to B1 so pretty much all the images and icons we need are there are the calendars and one two three four five yep one two three four five okay great so yeah they're all there so now this header is looking good but of course we need to finish our styling that we started justify content and we're going to do space between and you're going to see there's going to be a beautiful difference that happens and there you go and the space between is not happening between each element it's actually happening between our header and then our nav items okay and in between we have space and that's happening because of this and that's activated because of display Flex all right you see how all of this is connected it is freaking mindblowing okay and I hope it's blowing your mind right now let's go padding 0.5 am and we'll go 1 em on this beautiful position I'm gonna go absolute okay that looks great we'll go top zero uh left zero and bottom zero and uh actually right zero and then that's good cool and then the background color will be the um of course the clubhouse color cool so that looks really really good and now we're going to um take care of our nav items and give them some margin because they look way too close to me squeezed up together so let's actually grab nav items image tags okay and then we'll go margin and let's give some margin between them let's go like this and now we got um some margin between them they look like they have some breathing room and that makes us happy okay so they're looking good so far and or pretty much good to good to keep going and go forward and actually uh work on more things so let's go all right so so far so good now we're gonna start adding our uh daily info cards okay and what these cards are are these cards right here okay so let's start adding those cards in the mix and uh and start working on them so we of course first of all need some data okay because we can't just make cards about nothing so let's go ahead and add some data okay so in my source I'm going to create a new folder it's going to be called data and inside of data I will have a new file and I'm going to call it dailycard.json this is we're going to pull our information from cool so we're gonna have an array of objects hello Json and in here I'm gonna have time and my time is going to be um time is going to be 7 PM okay and we'll try to give you this file too but just to kind of speed up the process here I'm going to um I'm going to just paste this okay so that will speed up the process a little bit so Time title description Time title so again boom Clubhouse Town Hall what is the connection between and talk let's do more okay so that's just us adding data so it didn't really add these cards yet okay so we actually need to make that happen now the next thing we need to do is actually be able to um to have a component that actually shows this so let's go on ahead to um let's go inside of our components and in our components we're going to create a new file and it's going to be called daily info card.js it's going to be our component okay and I'm going to do import react from react import style from I'm going to do Style slash daily infocard.module.css so again that is not done yet we're gonna actually create that styling and of course let's also do import data from we do data slash daily uh card.json okay so this is going to give us access to all of the data that we have now let's export this export default function daily info card like this and I'm going to return and um and let's go H2 and we'll say I'm the daily card like this let's hit save and we need to make sure that this is actually showing up so let's go to home.js and in home we'll add this component so I'm going to Simply say daily info card actually let's go daily info card and hit enter and it will Auto Import this component from the top okay let's hit refresh okay what's the error can't resolve okay so why it can't resolve is we need to actually create a styling so let's go inside of our styling and we'll create a new file and it will be called daily info card dot module dot CSS so that's going to take care of that and you should be up and running now the only thing is well why are we actually not seeing anything from here so let's go ahead and figure that out okay so now you might be wondering hey the H2 here is not showing up because that's what I was wondering and all we have to do to actually fix that is actually let's go ahead and create a new file in our style and this file will be called because what we need to do is push that down it's actually getting hidden behind Okay so we're going to create a new file and this file will be called home.module that's CSS okay and I'm going to dot home container and let's leave it empty for just one second let's go back to home and we are going to wrap this daily card info in a class and this class will be class name equals style dot whoops let's do um style dot home container like that and uh this card will be wrapped in this div and now let's go back wait why does this say style is not defined um oh yeah we have to actually import style from style.home wait slash home dot module.css like that okay now we need to actually add some styling to our home container okay so we're gonna do padding top and we'll do 3.5 em like that we will do overflow Auto let's also do padding left one em all right so the reason why that's not showing up is because this daily here is lowercase and it actually needs to be Capital because it was saying that it was not used so I was like interesting so let's make that capitalized and now okay that padding is actually helping right if I remove this padding notice you actually won't see it so let's add that padding beautiful and now we can see it okay now let's add some padding right we'll go one em on this okay let's go padding uh bottom we'll go 3.5 em okay so there's padding at the bottom it that'll help push out other things that are too close to it we'll go height 100 percent um and Yep this is looking good so the home container now looks good let's go to daily info card okay and let's see if we can console log things right so let's go and console log and see what data gives us this is the data that we're actually pulling from here so I'm going to hit inspect and uh we're gonna go to console and I haven't array and that array has all my stuff in it right so I'm already getting access so it's like if I want to get access to 7 pm time or let's see if I want to get access to where the title is Mind Body game how do I do that so I'll get my first index and then I will go uh give me my title right so if I did that save I now I'm seeing Mind Body game okay if I wanted access to this dynamically inside of my H2 I could actually do that as well just add this some jsx magic hit save and Mind Body gamma showing up here right if I show replace this with one now you'll have that one if I replace this with two so you're getting the pattern here right I'm probably gonna write a for Loop okay and that for Loop is probably gonna show as many items as there are in my Json okay got it cool so now let's just now ain't nothing to it but to do it so let's go ahead and uh do that so in my components let's start working on it let's remove this return here okay let's make it an expression and then inside of here I'm going to have my div I'll have class name equals all right we'll go style dot daily card so this dialing we will create it's not there yet okay so refresh it should be good okay and inside of here is we're going we're where we're going to do our looping okay so let's go data.map so whenever you're looping the dot map is going to come to save the day we get access to that item let's create another div inside of this div we'll have span class name we'll leave this blank okay and then we're gonna go item dot time it says item is declared but its value is never red so we're okay oh maybe these are maybe let's put squigglies right because as okay there you go all right so it's still not showing up but we'll have to do a couple of things for it to actually show up so let's see what we need to do let's go to our all right so now one another thing we want to do is make sure that this is actually returning uh right away so we're gonna do an implicit return and how we do that is simply because this lacks a return statement right so if I had a return statement like this here um you'll notice that it just works and I'm pulling all the information that I need okay but what we're going to do is I'm going to delete this and this and we're going to remove the squiggly and the squiggly and instead we're just going to replace it with a open close paren like this okay and then another one and we're good okay so now it's just returning this all right implicit return here and boom all right guys so now let's go ahead and uh what I'm gonna do is uh right underneath this span let's make another dip and inside of here we'll make a span tag and we'll say class name leave it empty okay and um actually let's not do that um I think let's do it another way so div we'll go span I'm sorry I'm just changing my mind here uh like crazy guys but just hang in there with me I think we should be fine with I think but this way how I had it and um I think I want to do item dot title now because I want to get the title so 7 PM Mind Body game Clubhouse town hall and ism.earth so so that's good and underneath this let's go P tag and let's grab the description now there we go so now we got all of them but what we need to do is make the title look a little bit smaller and gray make the description probably um bigger and dark okay and then we'll add this um background color okay probably add a little border radius and uh that seems pretty good right and then maybe some more things but that seems like a good start so those are the things I'm keeping in mind as I'm gonna go and um create the front end for this so let's go into our daily card uh daily info card module that's CSS and we'll grab this class let's go let's of course add our background color first we'll do E7 E4 D5 just save okay background color is uh showing up actually is it showing up let's go FFF like this and hit refresh okay again I don't know why I wrote daily let's actually write daily card there we go okay now it's showing up so now let's change this 2 E7 e 4d5 okay just like this so now that color is there beautiful all right so we added the background so that's good okay let's add padding to it so it right because right now it's too close to the seven and you know the time and the title and the descriptions too close to them so we'll add some padding and that'll like boom right it makes it gives us some space and makes it bigger and then the last thing is let's add some border radius to it and that gives it those nice little rounded Corners okay what what's next let's um let's add our daily card and Target the div so we're gonna actually work on the div let's go uh display uh flex and again the reason why we're using this little greater than sign that you see here is because we don't want to select all of the children right if I did this it'll select all the divs within the divs within in the days within spans that have divs inside of them whatever right by doing this greater than sign I basically say hey buddy only get let's say like this div don't grab this div okay just the child of this card that's it okay the direct the direct child not my grandchild and great grandchild and great great great great grandchild okay so use that for your advantage but just remember with great power comes great responsibility and we'll go flex start on this cool and then um I'm gonna give margin bottom and we'll go 0.5 okie dokie okie dokie so now you see there's like weird stuff going on with it but it's all good okay that's what uh I think adding display Flex did that right so if I remove display Flex this is how or if I add display Flex right this is how it's looking so we're still gonna need to style it a little bit more and then make it work okay let's uh let me actually zoom out a little bit so if I zoom out it looks better and this is realistically this is probably have a look on a phone but I'm just zoomed in more guys because I am on a giant TV so to you when I zoom out things look really really small right so for you the viewer I'm zooming in a little bit okay so just forgive me for some of the things when they don't look right let's grab our daily card let's grab a div within it and let's grab a span within that okay and we'll go with 20 and then let's also go text aligned and I'm gonna say end set refresh so you see this this went to the right like this let's grab our daily card again let's grab the div within it and the div within that okay and uh I want to style it is I want to go margin left 0.5 em okay so now there's a gap between seven uh the the time and the title in the description okay we'll go display Flex cool we'll go flex Direction and let's go column okay and with 80 percent great so that looks good and um I'm gonna just add a couple of more things so I'm gonna grab my daily card class again and I want to Target to span all the span tags inside of it okay and basically I want to say hey font size of this give me 0.675 em actually yeah that should be good so there we go we got the smaller font size just like kind of how we want it right we're gonna go color are in here and I'm gonna go hey give me a text give me my text color okay so this is more of that um Clubhouse color and then font weight I'm gonna go 500 on this bad boy okay so just adds a little bit more weight than the default now I definitely want to play with my uh that sounds funny now I definitely want to play with my P tag okay and uh we're gonna give it a font size of 0.875 em and let's go ahead and uh refresh this my boy Frankie's in the house let's go shout out to boy Frankie there we go hey hey if you made it so far to the video just say Frankie in the comments and nobody will know what the you're talking about it'll be the most upvoted comment it'll confuse the out of people but you're the squad you're the notification Squad so if I can do it hey all right let's um go here and I'm gonna give it a font weight of 500 okay again you see that pop out just a little bit and become darker and man starting to look good I'm gonna give it a line height Hamid is excited too nice uh line height okay so now the line height actually made it come closer to each other so it actually decreased the default that would that that it had I'm going to give it a margin of zero so let's see what that did right so here's a slowmo replay boom take away that margin and it's much closer together okay um and I'm gonna go inline block cool and um inline block what else do we got okay white space gonna give it a no wrap on this thing so this is useful for in this case it's not going to be too much useful but this line here is useful for like if this screen became too small and one of these words had to be broken down it'll wrap it to the next line okay instead of like running across the screen and having you scrolling left and right but here it's not that necessary all right and then um let's go of course overflow I'm gonna go overflow hidden okay and we'll make that uh important all right and then basically what we're gonna do is I'm going to say text overflow okay and uh we'll do ellipses okay so if the text ever becomes too much I just kind of want it to uh give me an ellipsis so let's actually see if it does anything so I'll make the description much longer let's see if that does anything wow look at that so as soon as it starts overflowing look at that from the front end we can actually put the dot dot dots how freaking cool is that normally you have to do that from the back end right some a dummy like me that doesn't understand front end that much I would normally not do this but it's cool like I'm learning these new features with you okay we're both learning together so it's exciting um so that's actually a really cool thing to be able to do okay so that's your text overflow Ellipsis little ninja hack and then we'll go with um and we'll go 195 pixels okay so that made the width a little bit smaller and therefore the text starts to get the ellipses a lot earlier okay so our home.js is looking good our daily card Json is looking good our daily info card component is looking good our module files are looking good uh so this is good now we're gonna create a room info cards with dummy data okay so we're gonna have room cards now and they're going to have a bunch of information in them so let's go and start adding some uh Json files okay so let's go in our data I'll click file we'll go room card dot Json just like that okay and then room card we'll have boom boom okay and um basically we'll um I'm gonna copy some of this okay because it's gonna take too long to um to hand write this okay and we'll try to give you access to these files too so you can actually uh copy this and add this all right and then um starting from my members I'm going to copy that as well so let's go here and paste that cool and then I'm going to get a couple of more members and uh basically you know complete complete all of my data in here so I got all all of my stuff that completes my entire Json file okay you will just have this out of the box so I got a couple of members here okay so for example what am I trying to do right now so all this stuff here good time we got Calvin Harris right and then we got sriram Christian arthi we got Steven sanovski we got Paul Davidson that data is going to start to be pulled from here right now in our app it's not being pulled from anywhere yet okay so we are going to work on that so let's go to our components let's create a new file and we're going to call this file room info card.js all right and now we're gonna do the use we got our import react from and later we're gonna need these okay even though right now we might not need this but later we're gonna need to you use State and we're going to need react hooks so we're going to need a use effect so let's go from react and then I'm also going to do import style all right from and I'll go style roomcard.module.css like so and I'll also go import data from from data slash roomcard.json okay those are the three things I need access to and now I'm going to do export default function so basically the component that I need room info card it'll take in props and let's open it up and I'll just say return and um I'm just gonna have it return and empty jsx fragment for now actually let's uh let's add an H2 and say I am the room info card so now what I want to do is I'm going to connect this to my home so I can actually just see this file so let's go to our home JS and in my home I'm going to do a couple of things I'm going to add this component right underneath daily info card so I'm going to say room info card and hit enter that's going to Auto Import it at the top and then I'm going to say set items visible equals okay and you'll see what I do here and it's going to be um basically some of these items so actually we're just going to leave it as is I'm not gonna add any kind of extra fanciness to this just to kind of like reduce the scope of the project otherwise it would just take too freaking long okay so I'm gonna make it a little bit simpler so you can have it on your portfolio much faster okay now I'm importing it I'm showing it here now it's complaining hey you don't have the styling for it okay great let's add a new file it'll be called roomcard.module.css and that's it and hit refresh and now this says hey I am the room info card so we got this thing connect did and doing what we wanted to do and now if I wanted to like Loop through it and print this stuff out I could right and then I would basically have access to all of the things that I need right so like for example I could just do data.map I can grab um each item Loop through them and let's do my let's do implicit return here okay and we can basically say what we want here right so here let's just get our item so you're gonna complain all right so let me actually do json.stringify because it doesn't like when I do it the other way so there we go I'm just like splatting my entire object onto the screen if I needed access to like particular things from it I could get access to them right but what I imagine this is is probably we have an array of objects here right and I can Loop through them and get access to them and show the people and blah blah blah it's just a Json file okay but Json stringify is kind of a nice way to just Splat things onto the screen and see them all in one place Okay cool so let's now remove this stringify thing that we're doing here and instead what I'm going to do is um I'm going to let's open this up and let's go um let's open this up and what the that's not what I meant to do at all what is happening okay that's beautiful boom all right now inside of here I'm going to have a div inside of which I'm going to have another div inside of which I'm going to have another div okay is it mysterious enough how many more divs I'm going to have you don't know and then I'm just going to do style dot room card container and within this let's go and add an H6 I'm gonna say hey give me my item.title and then within this let's go H2 so I'll go H2 here actually let me practice that shortcut let's go H2 just like this command and D okay I'm going to do command D it selects I delete it deletes both save boom okay so now I'm getting access to my titles and here I'm gonna get access to my subtitle okay so title subtitle still doesn't look as beautiful as I wanted to but uh that's gonna happen very very soon okay the speed that we're going is going to happen very very soon so let's go to our module file so roomcard.module.css and now all we got to do is just add some some styling okay so let's go and go room card container and I'm going to give it a background color and we'll make it white save and you can see that white happening let's give it a padding of one em one Em which way cool now we're going to give it a border radius of 1 am cool so now we got a slightly rounded Corners let's go border none okay so now it looks cleaner and then we're going to go margin top 0.5 em so each of the cards has some spacing in between it beautiful now let's target the H6 and style that so I'm going to say font size 0.67575 em save so now that good time font became a lot smaller I'm going to give it a color of our text color like so and font weight will go 500 okay then let's grab the room container of H2 font size I'm going to go 0.875 em okay so now that text is a lot more contained it's not as crazy font weight that and now I'm gonna go line height one okay so that reduces the uh the line height that they had and then for color we're gonna go like the straight up black right so let's just go boom cool so it's like dark black perfect that's a room corn info is look looking good now we're making good progress let's keep going let's add let's do add details in the room info card okay so this is going to require a couple of things so first of all let's go ahead and let's do yarn add react icons and remember you will probably do npm install if you're not using yarn like me so yarn add react icons okay so now once that installation takes place it's going to be really good and I need access to a couple of images so I need access to this user image right here I also need access to this user image right here okay so these two images you're going to need so let's go ahead open our public have access to our images let's drag this drop it into our images and uh voila we have access to it okay beautiful then what we need is um we need to work on our room um room info card so let's go to our room info card not here room info card right there and let's work on it so react icons that we actually added has access to all of the icons that means it has access to font awesome and icons and the rest of the icons okay so that's why it's super um useful to use that Library it also has access to material I a material UI icons and evil icons and feather icons so all the icons okay so installing react icons is a really nice hack that you can use okay so use that alright so now we're basically going to add some more details to the info card to make it look like this because we have the title we have the subtitle but we don't have the people's names showing we don't have how many people are in this room we you know there's like bunch of stuff that we don't have right we don't have images of the people showing like this um and we're also going to need icons like this chat icon this filled chat icon and this like person fill that content we're gonna need a couple of things here so let's start off by working on those things okay so we got the images that we needed now we just actually need to like start coding some of this up so inside our room info card uh let's go right underneath this H2 right here and we're going to make another div and uh whoops and I'm going to give it a class name of style dot room members like so we are going to create styling for room members later for now let's just keep going so we got room members let's create another div inside and in this div I'm going to have my images okay and we're going to have user image.jpg and this one so that image is already showing up that's really really good and then this is going to be called user image 2. so we got both of the users but notice that it just keeps running across I can scroll horizontal I mean it's kind of hideous but it works so that's a really good sign and it's looping through so for however many cards we have we have that many uh images right so these two images showing up three times six images showing up currently cool all right so now what we need to do is uh let's go right underneath this div ending we'll create another div and uh inside of here let's Loop through we're going to do item Dot members.map and um remember we're already looping right here so we have access to item so then we're gonna map through each item each item's members and we're gonna do uh the following I'm gonna grab uh any item that's in there let's do this and uh we're gonna have it just returned an expression let's go inside of here and we'll do a P tag okay and then inside of there I'm going to do item DOT first name and followed by item so that person's first name and we'll do I mean it should just be called person right we could probably just call this person as well so we got first name and then we got last name like so and let's see if it's actually showing up anywhere so boom Surya Ram Krishan or the stevensonovsky Paul Davidson we have uh we have this working already and uh let's let's actually name it person unless we have a good reason not to okay now the code um easier to understand and then let's actually add a um let's add our icons okay so let's go all the way to the top and I'm going to do import and I'll say BS chat Dots bschat Dots fill and Bs fill person fill and we'll do from react icon slash BS okay and if I scroll down oh what happened to my freaking oh yeah okay let's add it here we didn't add it that's why and all I'm gonna do is I'm going to say BS chat dots like this and now we got the person next uh and next to the person we have the chat dots okay so that looks great that looks really really good right underneath this we're going to have AP tag this is going to have its class name and we're going to do uh display Flex align items and I'm going to do Center and then inside of it now inside of this P tag we'll write We'll add a span tag and this will have a class name of MR2 okay so margin right we're going to give it some margin right and uh let's just write 1.8 beautiful it's there now and right underneath that let's go BS fill person fill so we can have that icon right next to that okay and then I'll go span and we'll go class name let's do MX2 um and we'll just leave it blank for now okay or empty like basically giving a space right after the span let's have another span here and we'll go class name and again we'll go margin right too all right and uh just in case I didn't clarify what MX was MX is margin horizontal okay this is margin right cool so we'll go and let's just put the number like five here okay and then we'll go and basically do chat dots fill oh okie dokie that looks good so now this page is pretty much done now all we gotta do is uh work on The Styling so let's go into the room card module.css and let's finish up the styling that we started okay so let's go room members and we'll grab the image and first let's control the image because it's just out of control and it's like way too big there we go so now we got the images under control so that's good let's add the Border radius of 0.6 em okay so now already the images are looking really clean um it's so cool like I kind of just want to build an app for our own team now it this like inspires me and let's go like this room members and I'll go display flex and I'll go align items Flex start okay good cool let's go room members I'll grab the P tag and then we'll go font size 0.975 uh em okay let's refresh so now it's looking good we have the images to the left we got the text nice and Center just like this font weight I'll go 400 and uh line height let's play with the line height so line height will shrink it okay we reduce the light height and we'll go margin bottom okay so We Shrunk the margin bottom too so now these cards are kind of getting squished together and coming closer okay and giving it that text color okay good and uh let's grab our room members class let's grab the div inside of it and let's grab the first child in that div okay and what we're going to do with this is I'm going to say hey make the position of this relative and give me a margin right of two yeah boom look at that if I take away the margin right right it makes it makes a huge difference so let's hit uh refresh save and refresh boom so now we got the images on the left we got this on the right now these cards are looking really freaking good right now we want to do a couple of more things and it'll make all of this look even better okay so let's go room members let's grab the div let's grab the first child again and then within that let's grab the image and then let's grab the second child like that and uh we'll basically go so this is the second image so this is really cool we're basically saying grab this div inside of that div right so wherever the div is inside of that div get me the image so that's like okay I'm getting you all the image tags and then we're like inside of the image tag get us the second image so like we don't care about this one specifically we want the second one and we're gonna go position absolute and then um we're going to go left one em and we'll go top one em just like this so hit save and look at that this image is now on top of that other image watch what happened when I removed the first child from being relative it has now gone up and it's doing position absolute against the entire browser right by doing this trick here by making the parent position relative then what happens is that the child even those position absolute it's only going to play instead of playing on this entire canvas and then it goes hey left one em and top one em is right there it goes we go actually that's not your parent anymore your parent is actually now just this container over here that contains the images and so then within that when we give it a position absolute and go left when em and top one em it goes right there you see it's kind of like a cool hack that you can do so yeah this card is looking good I mean it's very clubhousey we got the top nav bar working I mean Why Stop Now right when you're about to take over the city and you're already your boats are in there and you're already fighting and you're winning the battle that's not the time to go back home that's the time to keep on going so if you're here keep on going all right right now is not the time to quit right now it's time to smash that like button if you want to become a developer if you want to put this project on your portfolio and change your life and to subscribe to this goddamn Channel and let your friends know about this okay because what are they doing they're probably doing nothing they're just hanging around maybe it's a Friday maybe it's Saturday Sunday they're not they're not doing anything send them this video change their life make an impact with that said let's get back into the tutorial okay so this photo I mean it's looking freaking beautiful um and let's just keep going okay so now uh what we want to do is let's add a button to start a room uh so like for example I'm talking about this button right here all right that green juicy button that's a starter room we're gonna add that because that's what our app needs right now so inside of my home JS okay let's go home Jess inside of here um we're gonna add this thing okay so all the way to the top let's go import and uh we're gonna we're going to do AI outline plus outline outline plus okay from react icon slash Ai and then we're gonna need another one and we're gonna go BS grid three by three yeah and let's go BS okay so what is this well here is the three by three grid icon and then here is the other icon that we're gonna need okay so yeah let's go we got this all right now um we're gonna go down into right underneath our room info card let's get out of this div let's create another div and uh within here I'm gonna go class name and we're gonna go style dot action underscore button and um let's give it let's give this a styling as well so I'll go style and we're going to give it a object so we're going to go position items actually let me think about this because we might not even need that we might we might be able to keep it simple all right so now what we're going to do is um let's go ahead and uh you know the main functionality we're going to start working on is the starter room and how it opens up these rooms and you can choose from different ones so we're gonna like kind of add that functionality so let's go we got this button this div right here now inside of here what I want to do is I want to create a button all right and then within this button what I want to do is um I want to have my outline plus outline plus okay not pick Center we don't need to import that okay great this icon I'm going to give it a margin right so let's just first add it so you can see it so right now this plus is all the way at the bottom left doesn't look very pretty but it um it's there okay let's give it a um class name and we'll do our bootstrap class so I'm going to go margin right two okay so now that made it that expanded it and made it a little bit bigger okay and then we're gonna say start or room like this so now we have a button that says starter room okay and then right underneath that we're actually going to have another button and this button is going to um say the following BS grid uh three by three Gap and let's end it like so and it says is not whoa whoa whoa what okay let's refresh react Dash icons is not exported attempted import error interesting okay let's try to do this BS grid three by three uh refresh okay so the error here guys is this I believe is a capital x so let's make it a capital x and save and that should be uh reference error three by three X is not defined okay cool now we got that grid icon showing up at the bottom okay beautiful so that's looking good and uh let's let's now start styling this okay because it looks way too ugly for us to just be able to ignore it and continue so I'm going to go on home container and then we're gonna go and get the action button all right so Pro tip this plus sign here basically means hey get me the sibling action button of Home container okay so they're at the same level so like if if I go in home.js or not home JS where should I go room info card okay if wherever we have home container is there a good example of this um let's look all right so basically here I'm saying hey uh get me the action button that's at the same level as this guy but say that this action button was nested inside here it would not get me that and if it was on the outside of this one layer back it would also not get me that so as long as they're at the same level it will get me that okay that's pretty freaking cool you can do that with that plus sign um little plus sign action here so I'm Gonna Get You The Sibling action button and inside of it any buttons I want to style them the following way so it's not child um it's sibling cool so now let's go and um let's give it a background color of uh transparent and then what we're going to do is border none that should make it look less ugly so you can see all the way at the bottom now it looks slightly less ugly and then we'll go margin left and we'll go Auto that should uh let's see does that do anything it doesn't do anything in this case not a problem let's go home container and uh we'll do the same thing again so action button like this and then let's do display flex and I'm gonna just do font size and we'll go 1.3 em like this now let's do home container and I'm gonna grab the sibling action button and um okay this display Flex actually I don't need but here we got our display Flex okay hold on I'm I'm doing something funny here okay so this home container here right what I want to select within this by the way is I want to actually select the button SVG all right now you can start to see that it's actually in the middle so that's cool so get me the button SVG and then in this one what I want to do is um I'm going to align item Center okay so I'm going to be vertically aligned I want to add padding okay so that was the thing that was missing and that's gonna actually make a big impact on how this looks so added padding and now you can see all the way at the bottom I got starter room with tons of padding but it's like just stuck to the bottom but that's not what I want I want it to be there like all the time okay so let's go down it's there and then it goes away so we're gonna fix that that's why we're gonna give it position absolute okay actually we can even do um position sticky all right so now it's just freaking stays it stays there the whole time um and now let's go position all right and now we're gonna go and do left zero and I'm gonna do um I'm gonna do uh right zero and then I'm going to do top zero and you can see it's vanished and then it comes back up okay let's refresh okay it's there it's there so that's good and we're going to give it a background image actually so let's go background image and I want to give it a linear gradient and it's going to be a transparent 20 percent we'll give it a certain uh the um the clubhouse color here and we'll give it 80 percent so yeah so it basically has a 20 transparent to eighty percent Clubhouse colors okay going from top to bottom like that and now let's go home container let's grab the action button let's grab the button inside of that and then let's grab the first child what was that first child great and um let's start working on this now so I'm gonna go and say border radius to em okay let's go background color and let's give it this color it might be a green color let's see yep so we got this this green happening okay so we will still need to change the text color so let's go and make the text um all white okay good let's add padding actually to it so I'm gonna go like this for the padding beautiful looking much better and uh font size let's go like this beautiful font weight I'm going to give it a 400 all right okay and then uh display Flex align items I want to do vertically centered so that plus sign just got a little bit more centered it was not initially we're going to go and position absolute this bad boy and then left 50 percent okay and then transform will do translate X by negative 50 percent okay so now whether I go up or down it's always there up or down boom always there okay beautiful so a starter room is there our other like little grid icon is there in the bottom right so this is looking really good and ignore that little thing that's my Chrome extension that it's just impossible to ever remove but we're making really good progress so far and then the last thing I want to do there's still a little bit more that we got to do here is um let's go to our home container uh sibling action button let's grab a button inside of that let's get its uh second child okay like this and then let's give it a line height of one all right and then let's go down and I'll do home container again let's get the sibling button let's get the um nth child and I'll basically get the um all right and same thing but this time let's play with the SVG and uh we'll go text color okay beautiful so now all of that is good it's looking like how we want it it looks beautiful and now we're basically ready to make progress and um continue further okay and we're gonna basically now add an animated bottom sheet so that when we click Start a room there's actually a bottom sheet that pops open look at how good it looks so let's go and do that so first things first let's open up our command line and um I'm gonna hit clear and let's install this thing so I'm going to do yarn add you have to do npm install if you're not using yarn okay so yarn add I'm going to do react swipe I'm gonna move my face so you can actually see it swipe able bottom sheet just like that and uh let's mirror my face it looks like I'm actually looking at the code so now it's installed we can put our command line away and uh now we can keep going at it all right so a couple of things right now okay that are happening that are like a little funny and our button doesn't really look that good okay so I'll show you what's happening okay notice on the right hand side we have two scroll bars right now so I can scroll within here and then I can scroll on the outside what the hell is going on that's really weird why is there like two different ways to scroll so we're gonna we're gonna do a couple of things one I want to do bottom zero all right and now this thing should show up cool so now I can scroll in here and it's there but then I can still scroll on the outside which is weird and it doesn't really create a good feel for the app that that's not what we want so let's go to app CSS and in this we don't want to be able to scroll app layout so let's go overflow hidden hit save and look at that it's done okay so it's beautiful the solution was really elegant and simple okay and our problem that we were facing is now fixed and we are good to go okay so let's now keep on going and making progress on this so next up all right so now let's go forward with adding the bottom sheet okay so we already did our installation just in case you missed it for whatever reason um just make sure you do yarn add let me hit up yarn add react swipeable bottom sheet okay because we're going to need that again that's this thing right here I'm going to hit command J and lower my command line there and let's actually add the code for bottom sheet and there's going to be a couple of things that we're going to need to do for this okay so this is going to take a second so let's close out of this go inside of our source inside of our components I'm going to create a new file and it's going to be called bottom sheet.js just like this okay and then we're going to do import react from react like that we'll do import swipeable bottom sheet from react swipeable bottom sheet we'll do import style from and it's going to complain that we don't have this yet so we're going to make this next bottom sheet module.css okay let's just make this file before it complains because it's really annoying when it does so let's go to style new file bottom sheet.module.css there let's come back to our file now and uh I'm gonna do export default function and this component will be called bottom sheet it'll take in props all right and then we'll do returned and we're going to do this okay swipeable bottom sheet and we'll say open okay and it'll take in the props dot sheet visible and then we'll do all right so um let's go on change and uh we'll go boom on change here's what I want you to do buddy I want you to go and do props dot um set sheet visible I'll do props dot sheet visible so basically when you click it just invert its visibility okay so for example when I click here so here it's like off right now the default state is off but when I click it it's on but then when I click it again it's off you see so like you need to be able to set it on and off on change okay and in this case the change is clicking in and moving it down okay so those are going to be the two things that are going to be inverting it and then I'm going to say browse set items visible and we're going to set that to true so far so good all right and then let's go full screen equals I'm going to go props.sheet title it's going to be room detail so if it's room detail then I want you to return true otherwise false and let's close that okay and then right underneath this I'm going to create a div that div is going to have a class name of style dot bottom uh let's go bottom sheet container just like this so that's good and then here we're going to give it a style and we're going to say background color back ground color will be props the sheet title profile okay if it is a profile then give me transparent parent otherwise give me empty okay and um that's it so now let's just close out of everything that we have opened export default function hit save and this will save so that's a lot we're gonna break it down don't worry but right now there is a lot that we got to do okay so let's like keep powering through this and then it's gonna make um it's gonna make sense once it's for pretty much done okay so let's go to our home and um in our home I'm going to go and import bottom sheet actually let's not do that because we'll just import it as we need uh import data from and we'll go data slash roomcard.json okay good and then let's go right underneath home and we're going to now use State finally okay because we need it in our home Js so let's go and import it from here use State beautiful go down here we're going to go const I'm going to say items visible set items visible and this is going to be true and then let's go and do um sheet visible and we'll go set sheet visible and we'll go false and we'll need to do a couple more okay so I'm going to go to this one and we're gonna go sheet create room this will be set sheet create room let's make another one that's loader visibility stability so like this is where we're going heavy on react here set loader visibility and then last one we're going to do card ID and I'm going to do Set Card ID okay and we're going to say you state one just like that all right now we're gonna go down and basically we're gonna say for the button on click I want you to do the following I want you to set sheet visible and set that to true and then we're going to add the bottom sheet and the bottom sheet we're actually going to add below the button and below this div ending and we're going to add a bottom sheet like this okay and if you Auto completed it it should import bottom sheet from the top just like that so we're going to go bottom sheet and I'm going to say sheet title is equal to start room we'll set um let's actually end the sheet it's going to be a self closing tag we'll do set sheet visible to we'll take an item and we'll go set sheet visible to item okay whatever the item we're passing in all right next up let's go sheet visible like this and we'll go sheet visible I'm going to go car detail and let's go let's go data dot find and let's do for every item that we get let's get the item ID okay and check if it's equal to the card ID then let's do set items visible okay and again we're gonna do we're gonna do item okay and I'm gonna go and say set items visible to the item and then let's do set sheet create uh create room just like this okay equals oh grab the item and then do the following set loader visibility to true and then we're gonna do set timeout set sheet create Rome okay give it item and then what I want to do lastly here is set loader visibility to false okay and then let's just give it a thousand second timeout okay or not second but millisecond cool so pretty much one second time out here so a lot going on here in bottom sheet but again just hang in with me um I promise it will make sense okay now let's hit save and refresh okay and um let's go to our app it says sheet visible is not defined inside of Home JS so sheet visible visible okay so let's correct that set items visible sheet set sheet trade room okay beautiful okay let's click so right now nothing is necessarily happening and then also let's go ahead to our styling um and add our styling to it all right so let's go to our let's basically add some CSS because without it we really won't see it so let's go to bottom sheet module CSS here okay and uh and by the way just at a high level just so I can explain what's happening here right when I hit start a room it opens up a bottom sheet right then I can select any one of these now when I click into one of them and I hit let's go it opens up yet another bottom sheet okay so the bottom sheet within the bottom sheet okay that's why it kind of gets like a little complex here okay and also notice if we're lucky you're going to see a loader in the middle unless it like loads too fast so let's let's go you see that you saw that right hopefully you saw that one click it I'm going to click and right there okay I'm sure you saw it so that loader is also are being added in the middle while it's loading so there's a lot going on in real time so let's go bottom sheet container let's go here um where are we adding this class name right there okay bottom sheet container and let's go background color and we'll go ffff and this is our code okay so so far nothing is happening all good let's click here and let's go border radius go 1.5 em let's go padding I'll go 1.5 am followed by 1 nem like this okay position let's go relative on this and let's go height uh a hundred oops a hundred percent okay let's hit so now we got this completely styled it's connected to our file and now let's troubleshoot what's happening oh and by the way I made this one typo hopefully you didn't make it with me so if you go to bottomsheet.js in components um I kept writing visible and so when you do that what happens is when you click right and you hit start room nothing happens but if this is visible right and then you click it and you hit start a room that will happen like a modal thing will try to open up okay even though right now it doesn't really look that good so now let's work on once we click Start a room we want to be able to um basically see something right so like for example when I start a room I see open social close things like that right so let's actually start adding certain things to it so um first things first let's make a new component so let's start there all right so in components what we're going to do is I'm going to right click um we have bottom sheets okay but basically inside of bottom sheets we're going to actually we're going to create a new folder okay and it's going to be called bottom sheets just like this dot J uh not DOT JS it's a freaking folder okay cool um and then in here I'm going to do start room.js just like that all right so we got bottom sheet um this component okay now let's work on it okay so I'm going to do import uh react and then we'll do use State just like this I'm going to go from react okay let's go import style from and let's go boom style bottom sheet.module.css and then I'm going to go import FC Globe because we're going to use those Globe um icons right in a little bit so from react icon slash FC those icons are going to be really cool once we add those that component is going to pop and it's going to look so freaking good okay so let's keep going and add that now let's go ahead and make our component and it's going to be called start room and it's going to take in some props all right and here we go and room set room okay and we'll go use State open just like that and then we're going to say return the following all right and let's close close that guy just kidding um I'm gonna close this jsx expression here and um fragment I mean all right and then in here I'm going to have a div with a class name of style dot switch underscore line let's go like this now within this div I'm going to have um actually no that div let's just end it there for now and then let's have another div all right and then we're gonna have a class name of uh let's let's do text right on this and we're going to add a button to this and I'm going to do style dot add topic button and we're going to create all these Styles so again don't worry so much about it right now plus add a topic okay just like that now we're going to need to connect this to our bottom sheet so let's just connect this to our bottom sheet for now okay so if I hit start a room right now nothing happens so let's go to our bottom sheet and let's import import start room from bottom sheets slash start room and then let's go down right underneath this um actually where it should be at this let's add it right underneath this I think actually so let's go right underneath here and let's do a couple of things all right so let's go inside of this div here okay not not inside here okay because that's where you add attributes so boom right there and uh what we're going to do okay is we're going to uh add our start room component which we imported from the top and it's going to be selfcontained so let's just end it for now let's go set sheet create room equals and passive props.set sheet create row just like this all right we're gonna do set sheet visible equals and we're gonna give it an item and we'll do this we'll go props dot set sheet visible item and props dot set items visible to True okay and that looks good and I think uh pretty much we should be ready to go okay we have a start room component it takes in these things here okay we're giving it like what the set sheet create room prop already is we're passing it that's okay and um yeah so let's take a look okay I'm gonna hit refresh let's hit start a room boom we get add a topic right there okay right now there's no styling on it so it doesn't really do all that much but it's visible and I can see it now let's add the other ones okay so we still have finished this one yet under starter room so we got this at a topic let's go right underneath it we'll go div go class name and uh we'll go style dot select room all right and inside of this div I'll have a button cool and I'll go class name and we'll go room equals open all right so we we're using this ternary operator here so it's either if it's open then use the active style otherwise just blank style and uh another thing I want to add to this is I want to say hey on click what I want you to do is um give me give me a little something something okay so set room open okay so when I click then make sure that the room is now open okay great now we're still not done with this button we're gonna do a couple of things inside of here let's add throw in a div inside this div I'm going to throw in my FC Globe okay my FC Globe component slash icon that I'm getting from um react icon so if you haven't installed it make sure you go and you install it great and let's go ahead right underneath that div and what I want to say is open so that's pretty good let's hit save let's hit start a room oh not not that one let's hit start room so now you see the globe and you see open showing up that's a really good sign so we have certain things coming together okay so now we're gonna do something pretty similar and add the next few buns so let's add another button inside of this button actually let's uh let's play around with the attributes of this button so I'm going to say class name and I'm going to say hey if a room is equal to social then do me a favor and make the style active otherwise leave it blank okay and then uh maybe we'll add an on click for this as well so we'll do on click and I'm gonna say hey give me a set room and let's go social on this thing and then um let's go inside of the button and inside of this button here let's give me a div give me FC Globe let's add a selfclosing tab just like this social let's hit start a room now we got two buttons here perfect and I need to do that one more time for close so I'm going to get a little bit smarter with it and uh I'm gonna grab this whole thing copy it actually maybe let's not copy the div let's just copy the button okay all the way to where the button ends and um let's just add it in and hit save okay and then the only thing I'm probably going to change neat to change here probably is closed set room to closed um and change this to closed hit refresh started room and now I got open so social closed open social close so still a lot left to go on The Styling but hey that's uh you know pretty good freaking start so that's good and in bottom sheet so I've added what I needed to add to the bottom machine I added to this not as good okay now we're gonna do change the style of start room bottom sheet and we're going to add tons and tons of styling and that's going to make things a lot better so inside our start room let's do a few things let's go to where our closed button is okay and where we're closing our div right underneath that let's open up a P tag and inside of here I'm going to say start a room like this and then I'm going to leave this empty space there all right we don't really even need that we can just actually leave it like this that's a better way to leave it they are right autocomplete is Right within this let's add a span tag okay and within the span tag I'm going to say hey if the room is closed can you double check that for me and if it is closed okay do me do me a favor okay if it's closed for people then write for people I choose all right otherwise check if the room is social and then basically say with people I follow so check for that so this is gonna be a question mark like this and then we're gonna do otherwise open to everyone all right so we got multi multiple turn nested if then statements ternary operators but all they're doing is when I click this it's a starter room open to everyone when I click social it's a starter room with people I follow when I click close it says starter room for people I choose so that's really what we're trying to do in our app and look it's working so that's pretty freaking cool right like if I click this it says start a room open to everyone click this start a room with people I follow click here sort of room for people I choose okay beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful angel all right let's go div and I'm gonna go class name text Center and then inside of this div I'm going to add a button that button is going to have a class name of style dot Let Go Button we're gonna style this in a second so hold on to your panties for me please thank you on click I'm gonna go like this and we're gonna say perhaps a sheet create room set it to True okay and uh here so it's going to be set sheet create room okay so set sheet create room set sheet visible set it to true and then the the text for the button that I want is a confetti okay it's just not happening huh so we're just gonna what do I gotta do here tada make that copy it all right so confetti and I'm gonna say let's go just like that okay this is the let's go button so we're gonna create a special uh styling for it okay so let's hit start a room oh not this app the one we're working on so you can see we have let's go all the way at the bottom we have open social close we have added topics so now it's just a matter of styling so let's go to our bottom sheet.module.css and boy oh boy time to get to work so let's go with uh let's go with styling our switch line I'm gonna go position absolute position absolute and I will go top six pixels so we'll we'll start seeing differences a little bit later on but let's just keep going for now left 50 percent I want to go transform translate X negative 50 percent okay like that go height for pixels with 35 pixels uh background whoops background color give me a grayish color okay so it's this line right here okay it's a little hard to see but it's right there so for example if I remove that you don't see it if I add the color you see it right if I remove position absolute then it's to the left hand side uh of my face if I add position absolute then it's there right if I take out left 50 it's to the left again so that's what's that's how this that's what the switch line is okay then let's go add topic button and we'll go background color transparent okay beautiful and um probably gonna go border none on it so it looks cleaner refresh starter room so there we go now add a topic does not have that ugly border around it which we're probably going to remove from all of the other ones as well and color 2 8 ae61 okay this is going to be that green color perfect now let's uh get our select room class let's go ahead and style it so let's go with border bottom one pixel and we'll go solid and we'll go gray on this one beautiful and then let's go padding on it 1.5 Em by zero I'm gonna go display Flex align items Center and then justify content space between okay there we go right so now we have space between and it's starting to look much much much much much much much better life of frontend developers get used to it get used to it as a react developer you are a frontend developer okay now let's go select room and we'll add a button again we'll do border none so I'm selecting all these buttons and removing all of their borders hopefully let's bring this down let's bring that up let's refresh order none let's go back on color and I'm gonna go transparent so now that background color is gone nice this is exciting I'm freaking excited making this with you guys let's give it a round some rounded Corners even though they're freaking invisible um let's give it a padding all right give it a padding okay and then let's give it the um Clubhouse color cool and then line height of 1.2 beautiful now it's looking really good we've squished it together just a little bit let's grab our select room class and inside of it let's do button active so border we're gonna give it one pixel solid and we're going to give it a light C green when something is active so now open is active now social is active and now closed and now closed is active so you see when it gets active it gets that like sign and then we're going to go background color and we'll go light blue and here right style DOT active that's where we're making that happen okay so if it's open then apply that style that's what we're doing beautiful so now I've got the background color so when I click that's oh that's awesome and then we're going to do now a couple of more things okay so now this is to select what's active now let's go with uh button div okay so let's attack the div and I'm going to give it a background color and let's go light C green again on it okay let's boom so it looks a little bit ugly but just bear with me let's give it a border radius of 1.5 let's go select our button SVG and change the font size to 4 am okay so now they're much much much bigger let's go bottom sheet container let's grab the paragraph tag I'll go font size on this thing will be one em okay we'll go color uh let's go text color and I'll go text align Center beautiful so now this text is in the center so that's a really good sign and we'll go font weight 500. okay so now that's looking really really good and then let's work on the let let's go button I'll go font size 1.3 em font weight will go 500 on the Let Go Button uh let's go border none that's gonna make it look clean let's refresh hit starter room so starting to look clean we're probably gonna need to give it a border radius let's give it a border radius of 2 em okay let me refresh oh border radius right now we got those nice rounded Corners we'll give it font color of white okay now we need to of course give it a background color of that green 2 8 ae61 save nice now probably let's give it some padding 0.3 e m by 2 em yes nice that works and then let's go a text align on this thing and I'm gonna go Center oh man that is looking freaking beautiful okay start a room wow I am excited by this app man this is so freaking cool zoom in zoom out start a room starter room wow and I'm excited okay so that looks great The Styling is coming together and my neck is about to fall off I've been shooting for about eight hours but you know let's go let's freaking go you guys I'm pumped for you let's keep going so we got an added loader okay so let's work on that and uh let's work on also our home a little bit so let's go on our home JS and we're going to add I mean honestly we don't actually really need the loader the loader takes a bunch of work and does so freaking little but okay fine we can add it we can add it I won't be lazy I won't be lazy let's just go all right so let's go loader visibility okay and um here's what we're gonna do all right so my bad I meant to put parentheses here okay cool so loader visibility it's going to have a div inside of it all right and inside of this div we're going to have a certain styling okay so I'm going to assist dialing um and let's go position fixed and then I'll go top zero okay and we'll go uh right and we'll go bottom zero and we'll go left zero and we'll go display uh flex and align items and I'll go for Align items I will go Center and we'll go justify content and that'll also be Center so that's good so far let's go here I'll add in an image and we'll go images slide slash loader dot GIF so if we don't have this loader let's go ahead and bring it into our world I'm going to go to my public file images we got our loader right here okay so let's open up our uh let's open up our public we got our images let's drag our loader and drop it in there okay beautiful and let's close out of it because we need that loader okay and then we're going to have another beautiful little thing so basically this is a ternary operator right either this is going to happen if loader visibility is true or whatever is in this parenthesis is going to happen okay so here we go so in this parentheses it's pretty simple and it's going to be nothing so either display the loader doing its fancy things otherwise just do nothing and don't show anything and great so pretty freaking simple okay um not complicated simple so you see the loader came up right right when I hit let's go you'll see the loader popped up right there and it was there it's there as well when I hit it let's go and it's there again okay so very simple and very very clean and I think it actually shows up for one second I think that's why we did the set timeout right that's why we did set timeout and that allowed allows it to show up for one second I think if I if we do it 10 seconds here and then I hit start room and then we hit let's go this will probably show up for 10 seconds okay so we're just kind of like hard coding our visibility so see what I said like trust me it'll make sense as we go on okay so it's hopefully already starting to make much more sense okay so we added the loader now let's go ahead and add new room bottom sheet so we'll go ahead and uh do that yeah new room is going to take a little bit but I think this one is going to be a pretty um pretty important one you know that we that we really need all right guys so now what we want to do is um we want to basically add a new room inside of the bottom sheet okay so what does that mean well when I click Start a room in my finished app and I hit let's go look it starts a new room okay and this is a bottom sheet okay so we have two bottom sheets one when I click Start room and one when I click let's go all right so those are two things that two types of sheets that we're gonna need all right so let's just get started on that and let's start working on it um I'm gonna work on my component so let's go inside of our components right click and we're going to go inside of our bottom sheet folder and in here I'm going to create a new file it's going to be called new room dot JS again we're going to import everything we need we're going to need to use uh use State at some point so let's get that now let's import The Styling okay and if there's any styling that we don't have yet we just go ahead and make it so we know it's going to complain at some point about not having room detail module.css so right click and let's just make it just in case we don't have it so room detail dot module dot CSS just like that all right so we got this um made so that's good now let's go back and get some fonts that uh get some fonts and things that we're going to need some icons I mean outline file okay and I'm gonna do from react icon slash AI okay beautiful and uh the other icon I'm going to need is BS mic mute fill and let's give it BS just like this now we're creating a new component called new room and here's we're going to be using our state variables like mic mute visible and set mic mute visible and it's going to start off with false what does this mean so if I go to my finished version of the app if I hit start room and if I hit let's go look all the way at the bottom right you're going to see the mic if I click that mic it becomes and this becomes mute as well right here and when I unclick it there's no mute that's there anymore how's that happening well this is actually where um we're using our state variables to make sure that we keep that information we can show it in real time okay so that's what's really going on there and let's go down and I'm going to go card props.card detail beautiful so we got our you state hook and we're using it here that's beautiful and it's helping us all right so now I want to make sure I return and we want to return something so right now I'm just going to say potatoes all right potatoes so I'm not going to return anything useful but what I want to do is connect this component where it's going to be shown and that way then when I'm making changes I can actually see them happen in real time okay so we're gonna go do that so let's go to our home file home.js and let's go down down down where should we add this okay so right when where am I doing my timeout cool so right underneath where I'm doing my timeout we're going to add this and we're going to add a bottom sheet just like that and we're gonna go this is going to be a selfclosing tag so let's just close it right away we're gonna go sheet title is new room and set sheet visible is going to be taken an item and let's go set sheet create room okay I'm just going to set it to Whatever item we pass it boom let's go sheet visible like this and uh card detail we're gonna do new room data and set items visible I'm going to do taking an item and we'll do set items visible to item okay now this new room data that we're giving it here it's clearly not imported so let's go ahead and import that so I'm going to do import new room data from um and actually we need to get our data as well okay because we're going to need to use that data at some point so first let's go ahead and make that file so we have our new room Json file okay which is this one right here and again ours is pretty simple we're going to keep it really really simple so let's go inside of source and inside of source let's go inside of data and in my data I'm going to create a new file and we're going to call it newroom.json all right and let's just paste all of this there okay so that is paste pasted all right so if I go to our app right now our app is saying hey new room data is not defined so we made our data now we're just simply need to import it okay so I'm going to say import new room data and we're going to say from let's go bottom sheets Slash new room okay so bottom sheets slash new room just like that all right and that's gonna really um that's gonna basically import that so that complaint should stop now it says hey can't resolve this so let's go check what is happening right now and why I can't resolve that so new room data okay currently I'm in my pages in home.js so I might have to back out of the directory and then go into bottom sheets let's check pages home.js yeah might have to back out and go to data right so back out slash data slash bottom sheets and new room set refresh let's make this small lowercase it actually let's uh Delete let's delete this because we cannot import that there but let's go actually let's go new room data not in bottom sheets because that's not where it's at I don't know why I'm going crazy so let's go data Slash new room okay and let's do dot Json okay let's hit refresh and now that's good okay beautiful exactly what we're looking for all right so so far when I hit start room and I hit let's go it just keeps opening uh new sheets but it just feels like they're kind of on top of each other right so we're going to go ahead and fix that and make it so it actually opens new sheets okay so let's go and uh let's go back into our um let's go back into a bottom sheet.js okay and make a couple of changes so let's go bottom sheet.js this is our component okay and to this component what I want to do is let's go under let's go here and let's import our room so important new room from and I'll go bottom sheets slash new room okay so now we got that import and let's go to all the way where we added a background color for profile and right underneath here all right guys so now conceptually this is important to understand before we continue so here I have this one that start room right so this sheet title whoa all right this sheet title is going to be um this is our start room okay that's what the sheet title is here and um when I click let's remove this when I click let's go right and it opens up a new room now the sheet title is different so now the sheet title is actually a new room okay so this is going to be important for us because based on what somebody did we're going to show them a different sheet okay and that's how we're able to do that so just keep that in mind as we go along and write the next part of the code okay so I'm just going to start off with this so let's I'm going to cut this we're going to need this in a second I'm just going to cut this for now okay and here's what we're gonna do I will make the squiggly here and we're going to basically say hey if this sheet title is new room okay question mark then I want you to do the following show me the new room okay so this has similar code and uh we're going to paste it and let's do new room as our component okay and I'll import it so if I hit enter hopefully that imported it oh no already imported so that's good a new room we're gonna do the same types of things but let's go down and we're going to say card detail is going to be props Dot card detail just like that we are going to do set sheet visible but we won't need this or do this okay so let's go ahead and fix what it's complaining about we got our new room opening up here and now the new room actually needs to close so we probably need to close that within this there we go so if you see new room then show me this component now on the other hand though if you see start room like this then I want you to do something different I want you to do this okay so now we're getting into nested ternary operator sometimes it gets like a little bit tricky to visualize this but just follow along with me here and once this is done you'll be able to see what we're doing here okay and now I'm going to paste my start room one that we had earlier okay and uh let's what do we need okay we need to make sure that our start room actually closes at some point and ends start room not there so let's end it okay let's remove these quotes right there don't need them anymore and let's end our start room component let's hit save okay beautiful and then we'll say otherwise just do nothing okay so how we read this ternary operator is like this hey are we um hey is this a new room that's being created okay if it's start room being created then show the start room so show all of this stuff okay if it's a new room being created for example when we hit let's go then show this the potato uh room that we created okay so that's this new room otherwise do nothing that's really it okay and we got this question mark here so if the first thing is true then it'll show all of that otherwise it'll go through this secondary secondary um ternary operator that we added there okay beautiful so now our sheets are working as we hoped they would so that's a really good sign and now let's go ahead and build out our uh our sheet okay so I'm gonna go into our new room which is in which is a bottom sheet component that we're making and let's go ahead and build that out all the way now so instead of potatoes we're gonna make it much better than that let's end our jsx fragment here okay and let's go and I'm gonna go div all right and we'll give it a class name of sell that room detail container and again we're going to add all these stylings if we don't have them already within this div I'm going to have another div and I'm going to do a class name and we'll do style dot head and of course let's go like this um and then let's go and do do class name in here and we're again going to use bootstrap so let's go display Flex align items center now again all of this is going to start coming together once we start adding content inside of this okay so ahref I'm going to add here it's going to just be empty and uh let's go on click and we're going to say on click do this props dot set sheet visible and we're going to set it to false okay and uh let's also add an image in here okay and this image is going to be of the arrow that we have so let's go slash Images slash Arrow Dot PNG just like this all right so we got this crazy image uh Happening Here and let's add a class name which is going to allow us to style it later a style Arrow icon okay so so far completely out of control but it's all good we're going to um style it okay it's this Arrow right here we're going to we're going to make it look great that's good let's go underneath here and I'm gonna go span tag hallway all right and then underneath this hallway let's go ahead and create yet another div we're going to do outline file okay so this outline file is going to be this file right over here that's what we're going to add now what is it complaining about it says it's not defined okay not a problem so let's write this again but this time yeah I outline and let's do file I will hit enter it seems like it didn't import it so we'll just import it manually I'll go all the way to the top and import actually we did import it AI outline file so yeah I outline oh so it should be good start a room let's go there we go we have our hallway and we have that file at the bottom so that is good that's exactly what we were looking for and underneath here I'm going to add an image it's going to have a source of images so we got the image here for the user okay and of course we're gonna need to style this image too later so let's just keep it here for now all right now let's get to the fun stuff let's style this thing okay and we're gonna make it look juicy gonna make this thing look go great okay so let's go over to our room detail module CSS that we made okay and let's start styling this thing so we're going to have room detail container go height 100 on this thing background color we'll give it a clubhouse background color beautiful and margin let's go negative 1.5 em and we'll go negative one here so now it's looking good but still a lot of work to be done okay let's control that um Arrow very quickly we're going to do that in just a little bit so let's grab the container let's grab the head and in here I'm going to say display Flex let's go align items Center justify content space between okay and then of course we'll add some padding to this okay padding 0.8 Em by 0.5 like this so we had so things happen but our image is gone but don't worry we're going to bring all of these things back and make them look good so go in our head and the arrow icon that's inside of there and for our Arrow icon I'm going to give it a width of 15 pixels okay let's hit refresh beautiful so now our Arrow icon is probably there oh yeah it's actually right here so we got our error icon we got our image we got our file we got all of this stuff let's go transform rotate and we'll go 90 degrees and margin top negative 0.5 VM beautiful let's go and play with the profile image now so we can make the guy look better so let's go here all right now already it's starting to look great okay it controlled all those crazy images because they were just exploding everything let's give him a border radius of 0.8 em and then margin left 1.2 am beautiful and then I'm going to go ahead span font size one em okay margin left 0.5 em so we we gave a little spacing between this and give a little spacing between that and uh let's grab and control the font size of our SVG so font size let's go 1.4 am great okay let's so notice how this SVG becomes bigger now save and that is bigger okay so that hallway or sorry that file is like much bigger okay great so our styling is looking good let's make sure everything is looking good in our home JS okay home JS is looking good yeah all right other than that we got we got things looking spectacular and we made great progress here now let's go ahead and add body inside of our new room sheet meaning like we're gonna add more things inside of here so it doesn't look that boring right as you can see this looks much more interesting and this body will contain people and it will contain images and things like that so let's go ahead and work on that body now so I'm going to go back into my uh new room and in this new room JS let's go here pretty much um almost all the way to the end but just one level above it I'm going to add a div and let's give it a class name of go style dot detail room detail card and inside of here I'm going to have another div a class name of again we're going to go dflex on this which is just display flex and align item Center justify content between and then we'll go flex wrap like this okay very cool and then the next thing I want to add to this div is I want to add some styling so let's go here and let's add some padding padding of 0.5 em and by 1 AM now you might be wondering Causey why are you doing this with bootstrap and then why are you doing this like little line of styling here well we using this right just bootstrap gets us almost all the way there with the styling that we need to do and then I just need to add one more line so I'm not going to create it in a whole new file and try to maintain it it's fine just add some inline styling for it you're good okay nobody's gonna go crazy um so that's good okay let's go inside of this div now um and then I'm going to basically Now display those cards of the people that are actually in the room all right so let's go card dot members .map we'll go item so let's Loop through all the card members and uh here's what we are going to do okay let's have a div in here and within this div um I want to do I want to do a couple of things okay let's give it a class name because we're going to uh style this so style dot member container okay and then I'm gonna go hey it's Mike mute visible question mark um if it is visible so let's just complete this okay so I'm gonna go like that okay now it's complaining about something and let's see what it's complaining about it's probably complaining about so this is ending we're ending this we're opening and this should be closed with this all right so let's go ahead and do this so right now I'm basically saying hey if the mic mute visible is true then do nothing otherwise do nothing so obviously we're going to add um add things in here right now okay so for mic mute visible if it is true we're going to do the following I'm going to say show me a div give it a class name style dot audio icon and here I want to say mic mute fill so we're importing that at the top that's the one thing that we need okay mic mute fill is if I hit start a room hit let's go you can see when I go mute I can see this okay some mic mute fill okay so let's Head Start a room I'm gonna hit let's go all right so right now we're not seeing anything happening with the mic or anything like that but again we're gonna need to do a bunch of styling before we can see um really any of those things uh taking place so let's go down here I'm going to add an image and I'm going to do Images slash user image dot jpeg okay let's hit let's go and we have a person in the room okay our goal is to make it look like this so let's do that let's go down and I'll go P tag whoops we'll go on uh span and I'm just going to add a little asterisk here and then let's go down and I'm going to do item DOT first name because remember we're in the middle of the loop right this is where the loop is happening and we're in the middle of it so for however many people there are in our Json that's how many images it's going to show so for example I don't know if we had uh more members so let's go here and save then you see the second image is showing up right so let's go ahead and undo this so right now we just got one person showing actually let's show two people right so let's go Rafi qazi okay and then here we'll have Nas domansky all right great I'm sorry guys I just uh ate some hot sauce so if you hear me doing a little bit of slurping just please forgive me I'm trying my best to keep going here hey all right so we got this we got um this is this is all good okay this is all good start a room hit let's go we got this big ass faces in here and now we're going hey man we can't just keep having those big ass faces in there we have to um we have to you know style this because it's it's you know to be frank it's out of control so let's go to our roomdetail.module.css all right and we're gonna style this thing so let's go here and uh start adding in all right we're gonna go room detail card and I'm going to give it a background color so so far we don't really see that much happening okay no worries let's go padding or one em one em 3M and one M okay so we got some padding in there and I of course I want to control the images so let's control the images a little bit too so room detail card let's go image and I'll go with 70 pixels okay so let's see if that controls the images a little bit hit let's go so now the images are much more in control right and we have a background color of white that you can see there we got raphae we got Nas good good good good let's give each image a border radius of 1.7 em and let's continue styling this so I'm going to go border radius for the whole thing and I want to do 1.5 em 1.5 am and then let's go zero zero so now these Corners have they're nice and rounded and height I'm gonna go 90 VH so now it's 90 viewport height okay so now it's much bigger than when we started and let's go overflow Auto restart hit start room hit let's go beautiful so far so good let's continue styling this so we're going to style the H6 on this thing so let's go room detail card H6 uh we don't have an H6 yet not that I can remember but let's go ahead and style it anyway because we're probably gonna need this later so I'm going to add that in so font size 0.675 em okay let's give it a color of uh text color we will go font weight of 500 like this and then of course let's go margin bottom 0.3 em all right so we're going to see a lot of those changes taking place once we add an H6 okay right now we don't have them let's style our uh we'll style our H3 later as well if we ever needed a H3 for this let's style Our member container I think that's important so let's go member container like so and um I'm gonna go text the line Center okay let's refresh start room let's go we will go uh width of it is 70 pixels and Position will give it relative relative like that refresh hit let's go Okay cool so far it's looking good and now let's go remember container audio icon and I'm going to say position absolute and we'll go right negative five pixels bottom 36 okay so we're gonna make we're gonna make the icon show up that's our goal make the audio icon show up on the screen we're gonna give it a z index of five and let's go maybe give it a background color of background color of and let's just make it white for now with 25 pixels and height I'm gonna go 25 pixels okay let's hit refresh let's go this thing let's sometimes zooming out can actually help as well now to have that icon show up the mic icon what I'm going to do is uh let's just go ahead and set this to true and that will make sure that that shows up the whole time okay and then the then we can essentially just go on styling and make sure everything is looking looking um how we want it to look so let's keep styling our audio icon here all right so I'm going to give it a border radius of 50 so now it has those rounded Corners around it going to use uh display flex and I'm going to align items Center cool and then justify content let's go Center so everything is looking good and then I want to do box Shadow and add a little box Shadow to it so let's uh let's do that oh nice look at that that just made it pop out right it has that little nice gray backdrop to it and that makes it pop out just like how we want it so that's looking beautiful so far now let's go ahead and color that audio icon so I'm going to go here let's go audio icon and let's grab this VG and I'm going to give it a color of 2 8 e a e 6 1. so let's save save again refresh okay so now it has that like nice green color that we wanted it to have beautiful very clubhousey looking okay let's go member container I'm gonna go display Flex we're gonna go align item Center and this will be useful for the text stuff that we have so I'm gonna go font size one em and again if you're ever like hey I want the stylings to work sometimes just refresh okay and that'll show you um whether the styling is working or not okay cool and uh then uh this is again we're gonna need this later but I would just want to keep keep the styling here font wait 500 and then color let's go with okay awesome and uh next up let's style our span tag so I'm going to go member container and we'll grab span let's give it a font size of 2.5 em boom boom shakalaka we will give it a display inline block with I'm going to make it 14 pixels so let's just you know make it a little bit smaller we'll give it a height of 14 pixels beautiful border radius will be 50 let's give it a background color and I'm gonna go to 2886 ae61 okay so that gives it a little green and let's get it uh white color margin right and I will go 0.1 em beautiful so that margin from that little button that we gave it right gives it a little margin beautiful and line height of 0.8 and that's good oh look at that it's looking clean so all I had to do was just add a little line height there and it gives it that stylistic green color okay so we are uh we are all good with this component now the new room JS we have it doing what we wanted to do and now let's go ahead and add footer in our new room sheet okay so we're going to need a couple of images that we're going to need access to so let's go ahead and grab those images reveal all right so we're going to need access to our hand piece symbol and we're going to need access to our stop hand so both of these uh let's go public images I'm going to grab this drop it in images so both of those okay why do we need access to this well because you see here at the bottom leave quietly and then this raised hand here that's why okay and now time to make this footer work so let's go into our new room JS and we're going to add another one okay so we're going to do AI outline Plus why because if I look at my finished version I need this plus sign here okay and now I'm going to do another import that's going to give me this icon so these two are going to be images and then these two are going to be Imports so let's go ahead and grab we got mic mute fill let's go ahead and grab just the mic fill as well okay let's go down here and I'm going to do const we'll set a new state variable items visible and I'm going to go set items visible and we'll set default state to be true just like this okay and we'll go down here all right okay so we finish this here we got a div let's go underneath the second div and add it in go div class name and let's go style dot footer and I'll create button okay we'll go on click props dot set sheet visible false like this and that button will end and then inside of that button I'm going to add an image and that's going to be the hand piece image handpiece.jpg or actually is it PNG I think it's PNG yes it's a PNG boom son okay all right so it's this one oh not that one so we got the hand icon and then we have the hand piece dot PNG right there beautiful and underneath this button we're going to add another div and this div will have a button and this button will be a AI outline plus button that we already imported and that's it refresh let's go so I see the plus button and it's underneath the peace sign okay you should see it too but it's like hard to see it's like all the way at the freaking bottom all right so it should be there on your on yours uh too if you're following along so far let's go button underneath here and guys look if you're following along so far by the way I just want to say you're doing a phenomenal job keep going don't quit look what is this just a couple of hours and you have a fully finalized project on your portfolio that you can show it to your recruiter and at a job interview okay so don't quit keep on going and we're gonna finish this together so I'm going to add another button and inside of this button I'm going to add an image and it's going to be Images slash stophand icon dot PNG like this okay and then my button ends and underneath that let's add another button and I'll go on click uh give me the following set mic mute visible and basically just change its current value okay between toggling it on and off okay and this button is going to be a dynamic little button okay so let's go inside of our button here and I'm going to say mic mute visible if that's true then give me mic mute fill otherwise you can also give me just mic fill look at that when I click this button it toggles as on and off like this now I can remove that hardcoded true statement that I have here let's make that false so now when I refresh my app and I hit start room and I hit let's go it won't be muted muted by default but if I go down here and I see my mic and I click that mic notice that it gives me that muted uh styling that we did and even at the bottom you see that it gives us that muted styling right so that's freaking cool that's awesome beautiful all right so our job here is is good but we have to of course style the bottom because the bottom still you know is not the prettiest looking thing on the planet so let's go room detail module.css let's go footer display Flex okay so already it's starting to get in some type of control it's not as hideous anymore I'm just zooming in so you can see it clearer let's go align item Center justify content I'll go space between we'll go position absolute and again I'm going to do left zero and we'll do right zero and we'll do bottom zero okay beautiful let's give it a background color and make sure that that color is white okay start a room let's go nice okay great great great great great now let's give uh let's work with the footer buttons so style the buttons we'll give it a background color of okay so let's go ahead and do it all right so that color like does that make any changes to it at all what the heck okay well we'll just leave it at the color that it was then we'll give it a border of none so those ugly borders should go away it still looks pretty hideous so we'll we'll fix that in a second let's go to em all right so now it has somewhat of a border radius so it looks a little bit better um let's grab the images Now button images and I'm going to give it a width of 30 pixels so now those images are smaller and they also look much more high quality right because they're probably not the highest resolution things on the planet let's grab the button inside here and we will say display Flex on this we'll go align items Center so this will give us some vertical alignment we'll give it padding so the buttons have a little bit more uh meat in them just like this color we're going to give it that little green color that we always give things that's going to be the text color so you're not going to see that right this second and font wait I'm going to give it 500. okay so if you did want to see it we could go to new room JS and we can find this button that has the hand piece thing in it and we can add text in here so I can say leave quietly and hit save and boom you actually see leave quietly at the bottom just like that just like you would imagine and that looks great okay so our styling is coming together how we want it and we're very happy with it okay let's go down and let's go to div I'm going to do display Flex align items Center okay great let's go footer grab the div and we're going to get the button inside of it let's give it a line height of one width of 36 pixels so now they're all looking somewhat even we still have certain so like we still have these things too close to each other so I imagine we might want to give a little bit of margin let's look at our final product so it looks like there's a little bit of margin in these right where whereas in hours there really isn't that much margin in between those the other things I noticed is my hand icon here or image here is centered uh horizontally here it's not so I'm probably going to need to do that at some point so let's uh add a border radius first let's go border radius and we'll go 50 percent cool we're going to go display Flex okay the buttons are now like we going crazy everywhere so let's go align item Center this will vertically align them and then we'll go justify content and this will horizontally Center them okay vertically Center horizontally Center and now they're looking much better again we're still going to need to give a little bit of margin so we're going to do that now so let's go into the footer go into the div going to the button grab the first oh dib let's go div we'll go button and first child all right and inside of the first child I want to go font size 1.5 VM on this give me that 1.5 em and we'll go margin right 0.5 yeah let's refresh start our room let's go okay so now we got that margin showing up and now we want to add the margin to the second child because I said hey specifically give me the margin on this child here now we're going to add a margin to the right of our second child so how do we do that how do we do that it's very simple it's pretty much this exact same thing except of course we are not going to change the font size and instead of first child I'm going to say nth child and we'll just go to great we got it and then lastly let's go ahead and make the font size a little bit bigger because the plus sign looks really big the hand sign slapping sign looks big but the mic is much smaller compared to that so we're going to grab the third child and um not margin right but instead we're going to grab the font size and boom now the mic looks much much much bigger okay so we're done with the styling here we're having things show if I hit mute it makes the mute thing come up right my leave quietly actually works that was cool when I did leave quietly it leaves freaking amazing right so the functionality wise this app is coming along beautifully and we're almost at the Finish Line we just have a couple of more things to do all right now let's go ahead and add um add a Explorer page so what do I mean by that when I click here notice this explore page okay there's a lot of things happening here okay you got the follow button you got this card here you got a bunch of cards that show up here so we're gonna go ahead and add that functionality in as well okay so first things first let's install a couple of things so let's go yarn add again on your computer that might be npm install if you do not have yarn so let's go yarn add and we're going to do ant design like this we're gonna need this for some of our styling and then after this I'm going to do yarn add and okay I'm gonna need that as well so in terms of installing things that should take care of what we need okay leave quietly not quiet little um and we're going to add up we're going to add a couple of things here okay so let's go to app.js and here let's import explore from Pages slash Explorer now it's going to complain and it's going to be like hey I cannot resolve this Explorer component what the heck is going on well no worries that's because we have to go ahead and make our Explorer okay and we gotta we gotta add in the things that we need there so um one thing I want to do is actually uh get the data ready for explore so we can play with the data so let's go hit new file and I will go explore.json this is going to be the the dummy data that we're going to use okay so let's right click and let's reveal in finder and uh I mean you can't reveal in finder there's nothing for you okay but I have this for you you're gonna have to go and get it from the link in description of the video okay so let's go ahead and uh open this file not like this but I can open it like this great so paste all right so we got this is going to be the Demi data that we need all good we got access to it and let's Now work on our explorer.js page slash screen slash component so many terms in react so inside of source go inside of pages um and I'm going to hit new file and we're going to go explore.js just like this all right let's go import react from react import style from style explore module.css now it's going to complain hey that styling doesn't exist great let's go to style and let's make it explore.module dot CSS just like that and let's also go import down outlined fire outlined I'm gonna need these from ant design icons just like that okay why do we need that import well let's go here and we're going to need things like this like that fire icon okay and let's go import data from data slash explore Json cool now let's work on our explore component so I'm going to say export default function Explorer and we're gonna have people a con uh conversion conversation let's go conversation and I'm going to set this to data okay so I'm just unpacking people and conversations if I go to my Json I got people all right and I got another object called conversation so I am just uh unpacking this there's some other term in react I forget but in um python you call it uh Tuple unpacking but here um I forget the term as like a es6 thing that you can do okay really cool and let's go return and we're going to go div and I'm going to give it a class name of style Dot Explorer container and again we're going to style that later let's go and have an H6 here and we go people to follow just like that and then we're going to have div here and let's go style dot people container all right and inside of here we're going to do our people Loop so we have our people and we're going to go people map and let's grab a person or let's just do item okay and this is an implicit return statement that I'm doing and let's go within this div and let's do a couple of things so I'm going to go display Flex on this align items Center let's go within this div here add an image and we'll go let me just slash user image.jpg or as I like to say japeg and let's go add another div we'll give it a class name of margin left 2. okay thanks to bootstrap for helping us out here we'll send add an H5 go item dot title okay now there's a lot that we're doing here so let's go ahead and add this component somewhere we can so so we can at least start seeing it before we go ahead and add a bunch of more things otherwise it's kind of confusing so let's go to app.js we're importing our Explorer but now let's go ahead and add it so I'm going to go and in our home we're also not going to add explore just like that and we're going to add another route statement inside of our switch and let's just do this component regularly how we do all our other components I'm going to go component explore like this and we're going to go call it Explorer just like that okay let's hit refresh cool something weird happened so when I click it I see people to follow at the top and then I see a bunch of images okay so it's working somewhat when I click that image it at least takes me here let's go back and finish up all the styling for it that we started so in our explore page let's add a couple of more things and then we're gonna add The Styling so underneath this H5 let's add a P tag and I'm going to go and say item dot description like this okay again you won't really be able to see a lot of this stuff here okay there so at least so I commented out the image just so you could see all of this and you can see that I'm dynamically pulling all of this from that Json that I had okay right there let's go button we'll go follow okay so now that button is showing up that's good good all right that looks great now let's get out of here and we're going to add another button and this will give it a class name of style dot show more excited to show more people and we're gonna go down outlined boom all right so that's where we're getting that down arrow from right there okay so now I think we can um add in a bunch of uh styling so let's go to our Explorer module CSS explore whoops explore module.css and let's start working on our styling it's going to be quite a bit of styling here okay so let's go explore container add some padding let's add height 100 percent okay uh overflow Auto and let's do padding top 5.2 em okay so the padding is now showing up I'm going to add my images back okay so now after I did overflow Auto you saw that at least it allows me to scroll automatically Up and Down based on how much content we have on the screen now I want to definitely control the images here because they're a little ridiculous so let's go head image with 15 pixels let's just control it interesting that does not control it yet okay let's go uh position absolute left zero top 50 percent transform Translate Y negative 50 percent okay I said refresh okay so it's not doing all right so before actually we add this styling in right let's comment this out for now we're going to save this for later but let's go and add this show more people um card as well okay so let's go and style uh that so let me let me go to so or explore container we're adding some padding to it that made that made some change now let's style our people to follow so anything with an H6 okay so let's go explore a container I'm gonna go H6 on this thing and we'll go font size like that okay we'll go padding actually let's go um font weight 500 color beautiful and then margin 1.5 em okay so it gives it that little gray color right there now let's work on the show more so show more I'm gonna do display Flex okay we're gonna show more show more people it's a little hard to see but it's still uh still there okay and let's control the images as well so I'm going to do um Let's go people container image let's go with 40 pixels border radius 1.1 am okay so that controls the images so the images don't look freaking crazy now let's come to show more where we were working and let's add more uh more things to this okay so this show more people okay so for example if I do border none you'll see that the Border um The Border kind of vanished okay so those are some examples of what we can do to this but let's remove that for now let's go align items I'm going to go Center position absolute bottom I'm going to go negative 14 pixels on this thing okay so it moved it all the way down left 50 percent left oops okay and then we can do translate X probably negative 50 if we wanted to so let's go transform translate x negative 50 so this is one hack of how you can like Center align things let's give it a background color and I'm gonna go with an F4 F4 F4 okay and we're going to make that an important one so it overrides any other styling that this card has okay cool other things I want to do is border none and let's give it important so now that border is gone give it a color font color of this and I'm going to go important cool so again it's a little hard to see for you but it's there at the bottom okay so for you it should be there just chilling at the bottom a little hard to see okay like right there on my screen and box Shadow I'll give it zero pixels my bad it probably exploded your ears sorry about that okay so that adds a nice little box Shadow on this thing and what can we do to make sure we see it right so let's go show more people I'll go H2 dummy text all right so because we've done so dummy text is showing above that because we've done position absolute I believe right so that's why that's showing at the bottom otherwise it would show right here okay but because of position absolute it's making sure it's all the way at the bottom okay so I can change the the negative 14 PX okay I can bring that later just so you can see how it's being styled right now and then we can go font weight 500 and let's go important all right okay and let's go show more span and we'll go font size okay margin let's give it a little bit of margin for from the top so 0.4 em should be good beautiful and then of course let's give it some margin from the left 0.5 VM all right so now this button is starting to look much much much better right we've got some margin here we got some margin there all right so let's go down and um we're gonna add um we would do stuff with the header but let's go ahead and do that maybe um we could do that a little bit later or we could do a little bit of that now trying to think I think the header stuff let's do it just a little bit later okay for now let's just work on the people container that we have okay so I'll get started here so let's go people container and I'm going to give it a background color for that so that's highlighting to you where the people container is and where it starts and all of that let's give it a margin of negative 0.5 em beautiful we'll give it some padding cool and then make sure the position is relative okay and show more people is right there great okay if I added that little uh bottom negative 14 pixels at the bottom of that that would put the show more people right here okay beautiful that's because this is relative and if I remove this now it just vanishes okay so that's the trick we use we make the parent container relative and the child container absolute and so then it just stays within that all right so let's grab the people container again let's grab a div inside of it I'm going to do display Flex we'll align items Center so vertically align it we'll justify content space between so things are evenly spaced out so we got our text here we got the image here we got the follow button and let's give it a margin bottom beautiful let's go down let's go and add an H5 to this thing styling for H5 for the text color let's just make it the regular color that we use for Clubhouse okay let's refresh okay great so look at the font keep watching it let me uncomment it and boom the font size became a little bit smaller all the h5s became a little bit smaller and then let's give it a margin bottom of 0.2 em okay that looks good let's go here and let's get into the P tag so the P tag we're going to do a little bit of styling here so let's start off with the color first so I'm going to put this for color font size let's go 0.9 em okay so we're making the font size a little bit smaller again refresh if you don't see any differences let's remove any margin we have so again all of those come together a lot closer display I'm gonna do block and let's go with 173 pixels okay and I'll also do display uh webkit box height I want to do fit content okay let's hit refresh good line height and that goes ahead and just shrinks it a little bit okay that's why we add that line height there all right so what I want to do here is it's going on for four lines I want to make it so it only comes to two Okay so I'm gonna do webkit line clamp on this thing and let's go with the clamp of two let me hit refresh save okay interesting all right so now let's keep on styling this thing so I'm going to also um throw so this clamp is going to make sure that it's going to be um on two lines okay so you'll see what I mean in just a little bit let's also throw on a I'm gonna Orient this vertically let's go overflow hidden on this okay and I'm going to do text overflow ellipses so that's going to put the little dots if it can't read anymore and then last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to color it like that all right let's make sure we hit refresh and that's looking pretty good okay beautiful oops misspelled that let's spell it Orient like that save cool all right so Watch What Happens right if I remove the or that look what it does if I remove the Overflow hidden it will have this like overflow hashtag a Naj Cass whatever right so if I remove that overflow or if I add hoverflow hidden then it will take care of that if I take out the ellipses okay so let's go so ellipses will actually help the text if we ever have overflowing text it's just going to end it with the ellipses all right and then we're going to do people container let's go and add a button and in this button I'm going to say background color and let's go transparent on this button okay border I'm going to give it a solid okay let's give it a button background color so now this follow button is starting to get styled if I remove the transparent look how it has that like gray color and then as soon as I go transparent it gets the color of whatever is behind it okay let's give it a border radius of 2 em so now we got nice rounded Corners there let's give the font our color button background color okay so now it'll also have that blue that just bolds it up a little bit dope and then let's go padding 0.1 em and 1.2 am okay so now that padding makes it look really freaking cool okay and that button is looking kind of how we want it and now we want to have conversation cards okay we want to style them as well but we're going to do that next all right so let's add the conversation section in Explorer and that's going to be quite simple so I'm going to go to my Explorer and right underneath let's find where our H6 is at and right underneath this div ending here we're going to add another div actually let's not add another div okay what I'm going to do is let's start off with H6 and this is going to be find conversations let's go conversations about just like this okay I'm going to delete this and let's go ahead and actually paste it within this div right here okay let's put that inside of that div otherwise I was complaining okay so now you see this thing that says find conversations about blah blah blah okay so what we're going to be working on is this thing right there find conversations about and right underneath this let's go and put ellipsis like this right underneath this I'm going to have last name and I'm going to do row so this is like margin horizontal of zero okay and then within this div I'm going to get access to my conversations and loop through them like this okay and again we're just going to be returning an expression so let's go div and this div will have a class name of we'll go column six and margin bottom three cool actually no this is probably not what we want let's grab from here okay and I'm going to cut this all right and let's actually move that below this button right here so I'm going to go below this button and let's go underneath this div and I'm going to paste this here okay that way to find conversations about is going to happen here because otherwise it was really messy how it was happening there now let's go create another div and I'm going to give it a class name of style.conversation card and here we're going to have another H6 and I'll do fire outlined just like this hopefully we've imported that have we not imported that okay it goes we have not imported that so we will go and import that um oh actually maybe it's a line with the small L nope we still have not so let's go and do that fire outlined like this all right so far outlined is not defined refresh okay so we got our fire icon showing up that's a good sign and I'm going to do item dot title nice okay that's good and then let's go underneath this we'll add a P tag and we'll just go item give me the description of the item boom did I misspell a descript description so somehow the description is being added but it's somehow invisible okay item dot description let's add it there okay so we're gonna fix that in a second let's keep going for now oh I think it's because I actually misspelled description and I spelled it description like this so that's really where the error is happening from so it's yeah so everywhere all right let's do command um let's do command D and let's go actually wait why did it not select every single one of those command D huh that's interesting I don't know why it's not selecting all of them change all the currencies let's go description so now that'll fix that typo that I had we can change this with description and boom there we go okay so that is all good now let's go ahead and add the styling for this um component okay so let's go into our explore module.css and we will add The Styling for our conversation cards now so conversation card and I'm going to go and give it a background color of white okay we're gonna of course give it a border radius and I'll give it those nice rounded Corners good let's give it some padding okay and then let's give it a box shadow that looks pretty all right beautiful so this is looking really really good so far okay and again if you're enjoying this and you love this do consider our course uh profit with JavaScript because in that course we're gonna go way deeper because here you're following along with me you're learning this you're having fun you're building something that's actually really powerful but there are a couple of things where you're like how what are the basics behind this right so sometimes when we're building these clones we might not be able to go into deep down nittygritty of everything because otherwise this maybe five six hour long tutorial would actually be a 20 hour 40 hour long tutorial right so we take all of those Basics we put them inside of the program so then you yourself can build apps like this from scratch without having to necessarily follow along on this coding tutorial okay so if that's something that actually interests you and excites you then definitely click the link below and jump inside a profit with JavaScript okay this is the best community in the world of developers you get three coaching calls per week so the coaching calls are absolutely so valuable you have 20 plus hours of content around react JS all right so it's brilliant and you're going to be building tons of real world projects inside of that course okay so if you're enjoying this so far I would highly recommend to consider joining that course and I would love to see you you inside okay that's it that's it let's get back into this all right so um let me go ahead and do a couple of things here so I'm going to do conversation cards and let me grab the H6 okay and I'm going to set the color to our regular color that we have okay for the fonts and I'm going to give it a font size of one em okay so that made it just a little little bit bigger in this case let's give it a margin of zero okay so there's no margin that's why everything just squished up and we're gonna go display Flex beautiful okay so let's take out that line let's say display Flex everything is working nicely and we will do align items Center beautiful and now let's go grab the span tag inside of the H6 and I'm going to give it a little margin right and we will go 0.2 em beautiful let's um now grab the P tag in conversation let's take away any margin in there as well okay so now you see it's made it significantly smaller we're going to make the color maybe a little bit Gray let's give it a line height of 1.2 dope and then font size of 0.8 am nice that looks beautiful look at that so now our explore page is looking looking as good as it can be right this is a really solid looking explore page it looks juicy it makes you want to click on it and see what else is happening okay so great job on this and of course let's add our header as well okay so we're gonna add our header and our sub header so let's go to our Explorer and let's start with adding our header okay so we're going to need a couple of things um let's do import input oops input like this from Ant um ant d and outside of this let's start working on our header okay and we're going to add our header pretty much at the top so let's go div here and I'm going to go class name and this div here will be style.header okay and then inside of here I'm also going to have a sub header okay so I'm going to table that for now but we will add it later so I'm going to comment that out just for now there and then let's put our input that we got from anti the input component we go style of that input will be the following will have a background color of that so now our input is showing up and that's the background color okay if I remove that I mean looks pretty much the same to me so that's good uh do we need to be oh we out yeah Okay cool so we got our background color here let's go ahead and add a border radius 0.8 em oh duh so style is misspelled it's styled like this lowercase okay so now there we go we got our style going okay and I can see it now so that border radius is now coming through as well if I remove it okay boom and now let's add a couple of more things here so let's go padding and we're gonna go 0.3 Em by 1 em so now it's gonna become a little bit bigger like this I'm going to add border of none okay beautiful so now it's looking much cleaner and then we're gonna go box Shadow and we'll go none as well so let's hit save okay now it's it's there and it's doing what we want it to do great all right so now let's do a couple of more things uh what I want to do here is let's give it a size of large large input okay and then I'm going to give it a placeholder of find people and clubs so now that placeholder is right there and then let's give it a image whoops image tag weird let's go image source is equal to Images slash search dot PNG like this okay we're gonna close it and then let's go ahead and give it a width of 15 pixels like that and let's hit refresh okay great so we got our image up here and so so we're good to go right we got what we need we got what we came for and our search is showing up at the top good now can we make it look better yeah probably we can give it some styling and that should help us make it look better okay so let's go back to our my explore module CSS explore module CSS right and uh let's go add some stuff about a header okay so let's go header and I'm gonna go position absolute great we'll go left zero will go right zero and let's hit refresh okay great and let's go uh top zero cool so now boom all the way at the top let's give it a background color the clubhouse color great did I write that right f2f0e4 yeah I did all right let's give it a z index of five on this just so like we make sure it always stays on top it doesn't really go behind anything and I'm going to give it a padding of 0.5 em okay so that pushed it out a little bit from those top the top part because otherwise it was too close to it and one more thing to be to keep in mind why this is not showing the anti design and it's kind of just showing a random design is because we need to duh go inside of our index.js and actually import it um right here okay so we're going to do anti dist and D dot CSS so once we import this give it some time to load and hit refresh and now it's going to import that design and it looks much better than it did earlier now we're gonna work on the sub header component which is this one right here so that Explorer with the back button on the top so how do we add that well first of all we need to actually go and create a new component so I'm going to go inside of my components right right click here new file and we're going to go sub header .js like this and inside of here let's start off with a couple of things import react from react that we need import style from style slash explore.module.css okay we already have that file so we're good to go and let's just create the component for now let's make sure we spell this right sub header and I'm going to just give it a H2 actually let's go return and let's go H2 sub header like this and then let's go to our explore.js and make sure that we can actually read it and it says sub header is not defined so let's go sub header let's go like this okay sub header hit enter it'll Auto Import it at the top just like this and now we got our sub header being imported great now those go to our subheader component and we're going to start start creating this so open close parens because this is what we're going to be returning and we're going to do a couple of things so let's go ahead and do H3 and what I can do here is put the page title okay so I can kind of hard code the page title to like for example I can just say explore like this and it's going to just say that at the top but we want we would rather have it be passed in from right here from the subheader component right so like that's what we would want to preferably do so let's go ahead and do that now so this H3 instead I'm going to replace it with props.page title like this all right and I wanted to show me that now clearly that's not there as of now but I can actually give it that so I can give it page title equals something so let's just go page title like this equals and I'll go subheader boom or explore booms right there okay and oh it's called deconstructor right so for example we could use deconstruction over here instead of using props so like for example I could do page title because we know we're going to be receiving that and I could get rid of props if I wanted to right but props just makes it easier for us to deal with it we can give it like any number of arguments okay it's a little crash course for you now let's actually start styling this a little bit okay so let's add a div okay let's remove the whole thing for now let's add a div and I'm going to give it a class name of style dot head okay and we're going to create that style file or styling for that in a little bit I'm also going to create a link to the home page now you might see that there is a problem here oh I mean first of all let's obviously open close this in parens otherwise that code will be forever unreachable now we we still need to import link because it says link is not defined so let's go ahead and do that import I'm going to do import link let's go like this I'm going to need with router as well and Link from react router dump great okay now within this link I can make it anything I want okay so for example let's refresh this and this heee can be a link to a home page I click it it takes me to the home page I click here I go back to the explore page but instead of a he what I'm going to make it instead is I'll make it make it an image and we'll go Images slash arrow.png okay not so pretty so what I'll do is um I will try to go style it and make the image a little bit smaller right so for example we can go to explore.js I can grab my head and any images inside of it and we can give it a width of 15 pixels okay and now it's just there at the top so that's just to like kind of control that image so it doesn't explode on our face alright so that link is good now while we're still in this div we're going to do a couple of more things let's give it an H3 okay and we're going to do props.page title what we did earlier and now it will show us that explore at the top so that looks good to me actually it looks like this page is good let's hit explore again this looks good to me I don't we don't need this it's not being used so you know it's not a good practice so leave that in there and let's throw that out now let's go to and work on adding a profile page so for example when I click this it takes me to this profile page let's add that okay so I'm going to go to um let's see where should we start so let's just go to our app.js for now and in my app.js I'm going to do a couple of things we're going to get an error but that's okay so let's go import profile from Pages slash profile and I want to add the path here so I am able to route to it we'll do profile and of course I want to be able to route to that component so in my component I'm going to add profile now my app is going to complain I don't know what that component is or what that page is so let's go ahead in our source and we'll go and in our pages right click and we will hit create a new file and it'll be called profile dot JS and in here we will do everything we need to do to be able to see our profile okay let's go finish the styling for this Explorer okay so let's go to our explore module CSS for a second and um I'm going to go to head all right and we're going to text align it to Center so that takes the whole thing to the center let's add padding let's add position relative and we'll do margin bottom the things underneath it there's some margin there okay cool and then let's make sure that we play with the image and control it better so going to give it a position absolute okay so the image was the thing that was actually pushing the whole thing down now I've just said hey position absolute so it'll just be like Splat on top of anything and then I'm going to kind of position it right there so we can give it a left of zero pixels we can give it a top of 50 percent and then we can transform and Translate Y and we can do negative 50 like this okay and again that's a trick for centering okay so you could do this trick for centering things horizontally you could also use this trick to Center things vertically let's go here and we're going to go um we do we have an H3 here actually I think that's an H3 right what is Explorer yeah that's an H3 so we can grab that let's give it a margin of zero and then we will give it a maybe a smaller font size like 1.2 okay good so now I can see everything I can see explore I can see people to follow my left arrows there I can click into this okay that's looking good I am definitely happy uh I'm definitely happy about that and do we even need this H6 oh yeah yeah yeah we do we do for the people to follow okay fantastic good progress so far all right so our app is complaining right like for example if we go to the home page it works if I go to the explore page it works but if I go to the profile page when I click on that face it goes huh what what's happening well let's work on that okay so um look we uh let's go to our app.js right we imported profile but when I go inside of profile it's kind of empty right and there's not anything going on so let's go ahead and actually start working on our profile component so I'm going to go import react from react like this I'll go import explore style from style slash explorer.module.css whoops CSS okay and now I'll be able to access any styling within it by doing explorestyle Dot we name space it like that import style from there we go oh my all right style slash profile dot module.css okay now it's going to be like hey I attempted an import but it doesn't work all right and it's also complaining about this so what we need to do is actually create export default function and we're going to call it explore like this or no what am I doing is not explore profile and have it returned H2 it's going to say a profile like this and now it's going to give me a new error it's going to say something something about CSS and that's because it doesn't see where we got the profile.module.css it's like yo it's actually not there so let's go and add it profile dot module.css like so so now I've added it okay now it's not going to complain about that let's hit save let's hit refresh and bada bang bada boom we got something happening here so let's work on this component first before we do any type of styling so let's let's get ready to rumble all right so we'll go return and then in here let's add a blank jss jsx fragment like that and within this I will write my code so we'll have a div and I'm going to give it a styling of it says style.profile container okay and inside of here we'll go and have a class name here of Explorer style dot header okay it's going to borrow the styling that we made for our explore page that's what we're going to be using this for and um I think that's that one is good let's go and add another div and this div is going to be I can give a class name and what I'm going to do I'll give a style name using a template literal okay so basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to call it explore header but then attach bootstrap stuff to it so let's go ahead and do that so the so this one is going to be normal explore style dot head but then here's the template literal parts that comes in clutch so we're going to say text right margin bottom of zero nice little way of doing it there explore style is misspelled Here style all right let's hit refresh and we should be good to go okay so still an empty page but don't worry The Emptiness is about to end now we're going to throw in a link tag in this so when we throw that in and it gives us an error what we do is we need to go and import it so let's go import link from react router Dom okay now this link is uh going to link to maybe it allows us to go back to the home page okay so let's go to and I'm gonna say home just like that and inside of here I'll have my image and we'll go Images slash arrow.png so we got that little image if I click it takes me back to the home page that's all we got for the profile so far but hey it's pretty good you know why because it's not none it's not nothing I just hit command J and hit the command line and we're gonna do class name for this of Explorer style dot Arrow icon okay now this link is good that's all I wanted to do here let's create another div and we're going to give it a class name of style.action button okay and you might be wondering hey what's the point of this what are we going to do here well what we're going to do here is create all of these buttons right there okay so inside of this we're going to have our at sign okay so when we do that and it doesn't know what you're talking about what we need to actually do is go up at the top and import it so I'm going to go here and I'm going to say import BS at from react icons slash BS okay and now I got my little tiny at symbol okay if I zoomed in like a maniac it would be a big it'd be a little bit bigger now I also need my other things right I need uh my upload sign and I need my settings logo settings icon rather so let's go ahead and add those right so I'm going to go BS upload boom like this and then we're going to need um AI outline setting okay again it's complaining that it doesn't have those so let's give it them BS upload and that should be good and then we're also going to do import AI outline setting from react icons Dash AI like this and now we got all three of those icons now again as my eyes sees them as a designer I'm looking at oh I'll probably need to increase the font size in them and increase margin okay so as soon as I highlight that well that might be the perfect time to actually go to our module and just attack it right away so let's go get our action button right because this is inside of our action button let's attack the SVG which is what icons are they're svgs and I'm going to give it a font size of 2 em along with a margin right of one and all of a sudden these icons look much bigger right and they have a margin so that's really good it's really really good let's go back to our code that we were adding maybe we still need to add a couple more things like our image the username Harmony following things like that okay so let's go ahead and do that now let's go kind of um almost all the way down so count with me here this div this div this div and we will go right here and inside of here I'm going to add an image and this image will be of that user image that we had perfect and we'll give it a class name and again we're giving it a class name so then we can Target that class and style it okay so we're going to do that very very shortly but underneath this let's go ahead and give it an H4 and in this case I will just say rafikaze and right underneath that we'll add a P tag okay and we'll say clever cozy like this okay let's hit refresh boom great so that looks pretty good now again we just need to come into our styling and style up some of the stuff so let's go to profile module.css and I want to work on this image I want to grab this image and I want to style it so profile container grab the image in there with I'm going to give it a 80 pixel width a little hard to see and I'll give it a border radius of 2.2 em now the reason why that's all hard to see is because um the actual container I we didn't work on right so let's actually work on the container let's give it a height of a hundred percent and hit save great we will add overflow Auto to it and then we will add padding let's add padding top so we can give some some space from the top like that take the padding out and see padding when I add that padding now it's visible and we can see it and we'll also add padding all around so may so it's uh it's a little bit farther from the center and things like that okay let's take this padding and add it above padding top so let's add the padding first and then we'll do padding top 5 VM okay so sometimes in CSS yes the order can matter okay so that's why we're doing it like this now what I want to do is I want to grab the last child okay and I want to give it a certain I'm going to take away the margin so for example if you look at my last child here there's a margin right there we don't want that we want this gear sign to be right all the way to the right and these buttons will automatically follow so for example I got my gear here and these buttons but the gear is close to the edge of the screen so let's go ahead and make sure that that gear is to the edge of the screen how do we do that let's give it action let's grab our action button inside of it let's grab our SVG and let's grab the last child so the last SVG that we got let's go grab that great we're going to grab that and I'm going to give it a margin right of zero now don't go around grabbing random children okay that's not what this is about okay but in this case we can grab the last child and we should be uh legally okay to do so all right again hit refresh the disease of the browser will come to get you hit refresh and now it should be good beautiful okay what else do we need to work on here I want to work on some of my h4s but do we have h4s right now do we have h4s we don't so I think I'm going to hold off on that and um actually is my name in an H4 let's see yes it is so let's actually work on our H4 then so I'm going to grab that profile container and the H4 inside of it we'll go font size 1.5 em okay so let's make it a little bit smaller for color will give it the regular text color that we've been giving our stuff and then margin we're gonna go like this on the margin let's refresh okay beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful and um we will play with the p tags as well do we have P tags in here yes we do so let's play with the P tag here and I'm gonna go profile container and we will go font size 1.1 em oh font eyes that's interesting font size okay and I'm gonna make the color a little gray I had tons of A's in here let's hit refresh that refresh works like magic and let's take away any margins we have okay great great so this looks pretty good now we're going to add maybe a couple of more details to the profile page like the amount of followers add a bio at Twitter at Instagram things like that okay so let's go back to our profile page that we have and let's just add those things to this all right so let's go right underneath this P tag and I will create another div and we'll go class name go style dot follow all right we're gonna style that so for example all of this follow stuff here we're gonna style it in a specific way so that's why I'm just putting a class there so I can Target it and play with it later inside of this P tag let's have a span tag and we'll go zero and uh zero followers okay starting fresh starting fresh okay so you can see the zero followers and that right now is kind of the same thing but we'll we'll make that adjustment later can we do this hack because sometimes we can do this hack let's see all right yeah there we go that's cool right um the BR the code is so smart it understands what we wanted it to do okay so we can actually write it like that and it looks good zero followers all right let's add another P tag right underneath it and I will have another span tag what happened there span tag will go 51 and then we'll go space and we'll say following some zero followers and we got 51 people following Clubhouse our clubhouse is popping okay we're famous now let's go right underneath um this div here where it's ending and we're going to add a button and this button will say add a bio just like that and let's go underneath this and we'll go div I'm going to say class name and let's go margin bottom four on this thing and let's go inside of that div and I will add AI outline Twitter let's hit enter thank God for the first time in its life it decided to do an import now we got this Twitter icon right there and we will say add Twitter did that work hey that works that works that works now let's actually make this a button so what I'll do is let's wrap this up in a button okay so let's go button let's go underneath this just like that so we have add a bio button and then we have ADD Twitter button and I just want to make sure my margin button bottom on this button is zero so let's go class name margin bottom zero like that okay hit refresh cool as usual nothing happens um right underneath this button we are going to maybe add another button and that's going to be an Instagram one so let's just copy this instead paste it and uh we will say Instagram and let's say add Instagram okay and let's go right underneath this div right there all right and we'll add a class name and let's do style dot nominated will again get access to it afterwards let's throw in an image and again this is going to be an image of the user just like so right underneath the image let's add another div blank div and we'll go joined whoops okay and then this P tag we'll go this person joined um you know 14th of July 2021 14th of July is my birthday all right let's go 2020 so it's real because 14th of July has not happened yet and let's remove this for now and right underneath this P tag let's have another repeat tag and it's going to say nominated nominated by those span tag Anton Alarcon mixing names here all right so we got uh we got the image we got this now we're gonna style it we're gonna style it soon enough okay so just hold on there for me relax we're gonna style it very very soon let's go underneath this div right there and I'm going to say member oops let's go and say member member of all right and let's add a button and we'll give it a class name of style dot add member button and we're gonna do our plus sign for this one now it's like hey the plus is not defined what are you doing no worries BS plus and we're back in business okay so here's the situation right now I got my at my handle I got my followers I got a button for add a bio Twitter Instagram I got an image of who nominated me and then I can add as member of okay so so far so good but remember keep in mind this needs to go from looking like this which is kind of like crap to looking like this which is freaking beautiful Pixel Perfect okay kind of like my girlfriend so we're gonna make it look nice now let's go on from here to my uh profile Dot module.css and let's start playing with this okay so I'm gonna start with the follow first because the follow is uh not looking exactly how we want it so let's go profile container and Target that follow let's go display Flex on this bad boy cool so already it's getting in line we like that now let's go align items okay that didn't do anything let's refresh okay comment it out okay so we won't maybe add a line items Baseline and then let's try margin bottom let's see if that works all right that works that's good now you can just go and artificially give it a space as well or we can do it this way I can actually grab the first child in this okay so here here's a cool way of doing this so let's go to this one where it's a zero followers so where does it say that it says it right here right so for example I have this div right here now this div has um 2p tax okay now what I can do is I can actually get this div's first child so the first child would be this P tag and I can actually style it a certain way so that's something cool that I can do so let's go ahead and do that all right so let's go profile container and I'll go and Target the follow because it's this one right there and we're gonna get the first child of the P tags okay so let's go to the P tags and let's go to direct children I'll grab the first child and I'll say margin right of 2.5 em let's hit refresh and look at that right it added a margin right right after the zero follower right here so that's quite cool that's a good way of doing this okay so we're good on this end let's go and um Target our span and like change the font okay so font wait I'll start with and we'll go 500. we'll go color we'll give it like a darker black color which is the clubhouse text color origin right I'm going to go 0.2 em on this so there's some margin between the letters there and the words there and let's give it a font size of um and again I'm playing with the span here so let's give it a font size of 1.3 em like that save save refresh great so the font size of 0 and 51 is much bigger right so for example if I go um 3am and I hit save notice the 0 and 51 become big but the followers and following remain small and that's what we want that's what we want so we're happy okay great man my my front end skills are improving like crazy with you guys okay my frontend skills used to be absolute garbage now they're becoming so much better I'm excited thank you guys for being here with me doing this making me do this and build this for you I'm enjoying this just as much as you are so smash that like button if you haven't already subscribe to this channel if you want to keep seeing bills like this and if you want to boost me to make more builds do that right now and let's get back into it all right so let's go um grab our container and let's grab the Buns okay now the buttons are looking absolutely hideous whenever they look like this the first things I think of man I want to get rid of that background color man I want to get rid of the Border outlines right so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to just stay border or not let's start there okay they're gone now they still have that lingering ugly color let's um so let's get rid of it let's go background color and we'll just go transparent let's hit save boom Blended straight into the background looks beautiful let's go down and um let's give the buttons a blue color all right the clubhouse color button background color like this okay now they look like they're clickable and then let's give some margin on the bottom all right let's go to em my bad margin bottom great now I don't like this image being that big all right so let's go and contain that image so let me go here and uh where's my image all right my image is under nominated so I can just go globally image or I can just grab this specific image so at a good you know uh good habits we're gonna grab the image like this and let's go with 15 pixels for now uh what happened there we go oh wow it's way too small that's what she said let's go 40 pixels all right that's good and we can also add a border radius to it if we want it to and uh that makes it better okay and then margin write it uh by this much okay so if there's anything we add to the right which we will it'll like make it look good now let's just play with nominated uh itself and let's turn the whole thing into Flex let's align uh to the center and then let's give you a margin button bottom of one em margin bottom so the member of got some breathing room from it okay and if I remove this margin right look the text becomes way too close that's not what we want want the image and the text just a little bit farther away from it so that's good now let's uh play with the p tags here a little bit so let's grab the P tag in nominated and I'll go 0.975 em and then I'm going to go line height 1.4 so let's refresh great so now it's like a little bit closer together right like this see and we'll grab the span as well now and just Bolden it up a tad bit so this ant on all our cones the name of the person looks a little bit special and now let's also make it black okay we'll go VAR text color boom Anton all our cone pops out has a little bit Bolder of a weight looks different from the rest of the things and uh now let's make this uh button look beautiful here the plus one looks weird we don't like it so we're going to go add member button that's how we're going to select it because it's right there add number button that's the class we were messing around with and we'll go background color and I'm going to give it light blue and I'm going to say important like overwrite anything else that's there don't worry about that let's give it a margin bottom of uh zero and again this is important stuff so great if there was anything below it it would put get pushed down let's give it a padding so we're gonna make it a bit we're going to make it bigger we'll also give it a border radius so it starts to look more like this okay probably one em you know because if you look at the border radius of this and this they look very similar right visually so sometimes just play around with it and like give it a 1em and see what happens and hit refresh and like look they look they're looking very similar all right and let's go line height we'll go we'll go uh with the line height of one so that like did that kind of like squish it together yes it did right because otherwise it's too elongated but the line height makes it Go smaller so if I went 0.5 em on this um 0.5 not em but just 0.5 let's just keep it one for now and then margin top I'm going to give it 0.3 em so they'll push it a little bit below versus member up so now it looks like a nice clickable button and this screen looks really good so if we go back we got this screen right here we have our explore screen looking good we have our profile looking good that's a really good sign we can start a room we can hit let's go like look at all this right this is freaking crazy I can mute and unmute I can leave the room quietly and then not Dimension I got my like user flow right so this is my home page I can hit get username I can go to my invite page right I can go to this page now next next allow like the whole flow I mean the whole thing is so freaking beautiful now you notice this little problem right that we had in the start so if I go like this and I hit get your username it takes me to this page that doesn't really exist so that's a problem so let's just go ahead and see how we would fix that so the first thing that comes to my mind is well what component is that I think that's the welcome component and I think the problem is that I have get username and it's taking me to this page when it probably should be taking me to the invite page so I'll just hit save I will go back refresh hit get your username and now boom I'm going to this page done hit next next allow boom problem solved so again debugging just get calm and then start like you know anytime you go run into errors just calm and then start to kind of go one thing at a time don't think of it all at once because then it seems intimidating and it seems scary go what's the one thing what are the things that I do know for a fact start there and then work your way through it okay beautiful so our uh explore our profile is looking great most of the things are looking good so we could have done a lot more with this and we can keep going and here's my challenge to you okay see if you could make these Pages do certain things so see if you could play around with them and add more functionality to them okay so I'll leave that challenge up to you here's what my finished version and product looks like right here's the upcoming for you this is what it looks like look at this nice and then I even have a bottom sheet that comes up at the bottom I can get out of here I can go to my activity and my activity notifications here looks so good right so I'm going to challenge you to see if you can do that okay but currently this is the functionality of the app that we have and we have a fullon user flow that I just showed right so if I go to my home page it brings me to here which looks so cool I can hit get your username I can type in my number next I can allow to get the notifications it brings me here I can start a room and it can alternate between those I can hit let's go the loader pops up I come to the room I can mute unmute I can leave quietly I can go to my profile page and I can go to the explore page and see what's popping and even like type things in and of course I almost forgot one last piece of the puzzle which is deploying this app on Firebase okay so that's gonna still be exciting so let's go ahead add to firebase.com and we will click um I'll just go to my kazia clever programmer email you can go to whichever one you want of course click go to console and uh we're going to create add a project I'm going to say Clubhouse clone hit enter I will say Do not enable analytics and we will simply make sure that we get through this screen okay so now Firebase project is getting ready all right I'm gonna open up my command line and in the meantime we're gonna have to do Firebase in net in just a second so make sure you have Firebase tools and Firebase downloaded so let's go ahead and do npm install Firebase okay so make sure you have that if you have it globally then great and make sure you also have uh Firebase itself Firebase tools so yarn add Firebase tools and you can do again you can do um npm install because you if just in case you might not have a yarn add okay so I just want to make sure that I have those things installed and then I'm good to go okay let's refresh and um we're done on the Firebase side we just needed to go ahead and initialize the project and we don't really need to do anything else now again the part of deploying is that you're going to be able to go to blah blah blah blah.com and you'll have your site up and running okay so that's the great thing about doing that so we're gonna now make sure that we have everything we need uh available and then we deploy it and there's just a couple of steps to being able to do this so let's go ahead and do this together carefully so I'm going to do fire base in it and let's see what it asks so it gives us multiple choices I'm just going to choose hosting because I just want to deploy this app online so I'm going to hit enter now let's do use an existing project okay hit enter and let's see I see Clubhouse clone right there I'm going to hit enter it says what do you want to use as your public directory now this is an important part okay what I want to use in the public directory is actually just a directory called build so make sure to write build important and now it's asking configure as a single page app I'm going to say yes so I wrote Y and hit enter this I'm going to leave default okay good I have my build folder but it's not completed okay so now what I want to want to do is I want to do npm run build and hit enter so now it's going to create this build folder with all of our assets and opt super optimized way so this build is ready to be deployed in the most optimized way a possible okay so everything that gets deployed is actually right inside of this folder so that's what it's working on right now and it's saying creating an optimized production build okay so that is super freaking exciting let's go and add some music in here to make sure that we're good to go on this and this freaking bangs all right so we got the uh the build is good now let's try doing deploy Firebase deploy crossing my fingers I hope it works let's see is it gonna work is it gonna work let's go hey all right now I'm gonna grab this URL let's open up a new tab hit enter yo our build is here how cool is that you guys how cool is that let's go back our build is looking great let's hit get your username it's right there let's type some random stuff in hit next allow who beautiful start around let's go loader boom I can mute and unmute I can leave quietly damn let's hit profile profile page takes me here nice all right

okay you can go ahead and check it out yourself and honestly join this course worst case scenario you have a money back guarantee okay so there's nothing for you to uh worry about so go ahead sign up for this course so you can actually build these clones yourself you can actually build these projects yourself and you're going to learn the fundamentals that you actually need and we're going to start from absolute scratch and what that means is we're gonna start from our command line okay so let's go ahead and clear out everything on my command line I'll make my screen just a little bit bigger here and um let's just go here and do a couple of things okay so I'm just gonna go into my GitHub folder you can go wherever you want okay and I'm gonna do npx create this is the important command for you to follow uh LinkedIn clone oh it's complaining what is it complaining about okay so let's go ahead in the start and let's try doing sudo npx let's see if it's a complaint about this no it's not okay so the complaint is that we need a new version all right new minor version available okay so they want us to install the new version so let's just take that command you might actually need to do this as well and now it's complaining so let's do sudo okay actually let's do this okay I'm just gonna do create react app okay for you npx probably works for me sometimes on this computer I have to do create react app for whatever reason and I'm just gonna do LinkedIn clone like so and let's hit enter and let's see what happens beautiful it's installing hopefully it's installing for you as well beautiful okay let's wait for it to finish all right great we have the entire app pretty much installed uh ready to get started could create react app adds in a lot of useful things that we need that's why this is important and once this is done we are actually ready to go ahead and get started now what I recommend we do is let's open up visual studio code okay and I'll bring that over here and inside of our Visual Studio code okay we're gonna do this okay I'm gonna open let's go I'm gonna go to my GitHub I'm gonna go to my banker projects here's my LinkedIn clone I'm just going to open that uh bad boy up and we're pretty much right at the start okay okay so let me open up my command line and let's go into our app.js this is what you should have okay now I'm gonna do yarn start and that will actually start my development server and let's go here and start it boom this is what we should be seeing right about now okay awesome one note for you by the way the if you're watching this um if when I do yarn start you can do npm start okay so for example if you don't have yarn just do npm start okay otherwise you'll have to install yarn and I'm pretty sure it's something like this and you can actually install yarn uh but you know if you don't want to get fancy just do npm start and you should be good I just um I just like to do yarn I'm just used to it now okay so your localhost 3000 is open uh you should be good to go now we're gonna do a couple of things we're going to delete unnecessary files okay so for example set up tests I don't really need it report this one logo SVG uh not gonna need that um not gonna need app.test JS so I'm holding command and I'm just clicking each one of these okay and now I'm just going to delete them so they're all gone okay next up what I'm going to do is actually pretty much every line inside of my index I'm going to just remove don't need it okay so let's just go like that and get rid of that okay cool so that's good good let's go to app CSS and uh inside of app CSS I also don't really want anything so I'm just going to hit command a to select everything and I'm going to hit delete okay and I'm going to hit save so now all of that should be gone as well and now in app.js now here's what's going to happen Okay so on the right hand side when I hit refresh you should see this error your error will be like something something something logo SVG complaining about it well it makes sense why it's complaining about it because you just removed the logo silly all right so now in our app.js we're gonna go and that import line at the top where we're look we're not importing the logo anymore so now we're just gonna go ahead and remove that line okay so I'm gonna delete that line right there and um also there's a bunch of stuff in this file that we don't need any anymore so for example everything inside of this div right here I can just get rid of and instead I'll just say let's build the Linked In clone like that okay and on the right hand side now it's complaining about report web vitals okay that's simple just go to index.js and remove this line there remove this line there where we're importing hit save wait for it to stop complaining and hey we're making some progress that's what you should be seeing right now okay so great job so far by the way okay beautiful so we got rid of all of the fancy styling or anything like that we wanna pretty much start this app as bare bone as humanly possible okay and kind of go from there so now what I'm gonna do is we're just going to kind of set like LinkedIn type of styling okay so first things first I'm actually going to take the LinkedIn image all right and again I'm going to drop these images for you guys in the link okay so you can grab the LinkedIn uh image from from this file here okay or you can just go online and find a LinkedIn image so I'm gonna go and um you know I'm gonna grab this LinkedIn image okay and what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it in my images public folder I'm going to create a new folder in here and I'm going to call this images so inside of your public create a new folder called images cool and inside of there I'm going to put my linkedin.png and again if you want to find the LinkedIn PNG very simple just go online type in LinkedIn PNG and you know again you can use the one I gave you or just find one from online okay all right so now what we're going to do is now that we have the image okay I'm gonna go inside of my um let's go inside of my index.html okay and that's also inside of public you have index.html and we're just going to make a couple of changes to that all right so where it says public underscore URL it says favicon uh blah blah blah we're gonna replace all of that and remove that and replace it with Images slash the image that we just added Linked In LinkedIn dot PNG okay and hit save now at the top of your app you should actually see the LinkedIn logo as your favicon okay do you see it beautiful okay nice and uh so that's good to go okay now we're gonna go down and uh let's go where do I want to add the rest of this okay so let's go ahead and see where it says Apple touch icon and here instead of this logo we're gonna replace this logo here with the same logo so let's do images slash LinkedIn dot PNG just like that okay great so we're making good progress so far and now let's go inside of our index uh index.css okay so that file is going to be inside of your Source directory so go inside of that okay index.css now we're going to add in a sum styling okay and this is going to be the common styling that we're going to be using for LinkedIn so I just decided to Splat all of that kind of in the start all right right we're going to start with making sure the Overflow Y is scroll okay so basically if we're scrolling up and down I want to see the scroll bar on the right hand side so that's what that's going to do and now I'm going to do overflow X and we're going to do hidden okay and what this is going to ensure also remember to put semicolons and also remember to keep hitting command s or Ctrl s and saving okay and overflow x hidden is what it's going to do is if we're scrolling horizontally we're not going to see any bars on the bottom okay that's what this is going to do cool and now let's just do a couple of things um to root to our body to our HTML we're going to add in a background color of the following F5 F5 F5 okay this is a white color the kind of color that kind of LinkedIn uses okay that's uh that's what this is going to do okay let's also add box sizing and I will just do border box here Order Box all right so that's good that's that makes it easier for us to like design our app okay and make sure that things fit kind of like how we want them to and it doesn't do anything weird Okay um next up we're gonna do a couple of things all right so now I'm gonna basically add some styling to things like H1 H2 blah blah I'm gonna just reset their styling so they behave in the way that I want them to okay so um let's grab our div let's grab H1 H2 h3h4h5 H6 so all basically H Tags I'm gonna also throw in header in there I'm gonna throw in HTML um this tag here I'll throw in an image tag let's throw in label these are all things that we're gonna need later okay my bullet points Li nav P tag let's throw in small tag as well span and unordered list okay that's it I promise okay I know it looks freaking crazy looks stupid but I promise that's it okay now we're gonna do a couple of things to it so margin we're gonna make it zero okay that's uh first things first so already you you saw your headline go above okay because I removed the margin so I'm resetting the settings on here uh padding I'm going to set to zero as well okay we're gonna go and set border to zero of all of theirs cool outline we'll just set it to none okay and then um font size I'll do 100 on these guys okay let's add throw in a vertical line on this bad boy and we'll do Baseline okay and background let's do transparent cool so you shouldn't see too many changes happening right now but what this is doing is setting us up for Success kind of like if your parents were investing into like a 401k or your college uh funds that we're setting you up for Success even though when you were born you had no idea what they were doing okay like that just buy me candy with that money okay what are you doing all right I hope you're making good progress so far okay now uh we're gonna do a couple of things guys so what I want to do now is first of all I want to focus myself okay good now what I'm going to do on top of that is uh let's start working on some of our components like our login component okay so login component is going to be our component after I sign out of the app so if I sign out it's going to be our logout login page okay so let's work on that so first things first I'm going to install a couple of things that I'm going to need okay so I'm going to need let me just open up another terminal thing here by hitting that button over there okay and um actually actually you know what I won't do that let me close that terminal just so you can see things clearly and um exit out of this and what I'm going to do is I'm going to do uh yarn add but you can also do npm install okay either one is fine I just like yarn better so whenever I do yarn add you do npm install yarn add npm install okay so I'm going to do yarn add uh react router Dom because I want to use react routers okay so that's the first thing that I need to install the second thing I'm gonna actually need to install is um style components because guess what we're going to be using style components in this beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful okay so we pretty much got what we're looking for all right we we got what we're looking for those are the two things we're looking to install and now we're going to go inside of our app.js okay um actually you know what let's build out our component first so let's go inside of our source let's add a new folder and it'll be called components like that inside of our components folder I'm going to create a new file and it'll be called login.js okay and in our login.js file we'll just start off with import style from styled components like so and then let's um add in the actual component okay so let's capitalize the name and uh we'll pass in any props that it needs and open that bad boy up okay and we'll just have it return a div that says login inside of it so pretty much not that much right now and of course let's export this so we have access to this component outside of this file into our other files capiche good so I'm going to hit save now let's go into our app.js file because what I want to happen is I want to take this component use it inside of my app.js file and then have that be displayed on my screen so now let's go to our app.js file well in order to use that file what do we need to do the first thing we need to do is starts with an i then it has an M import okay so let's go ahead and import uh login okay from um and we're going to do components slash login all right and another thing we need for this is we also want to start using our react router okay so let's go ahead and import all of the things we need for that so we're going to do browser router okay like so and we're gonna do as router okay comma switch um and let's do route okay so I'm I'm basically getting browser router switch and Route those are the three things I'm getting okay and where am I getting them from great question from react router Dom like that okay and uh that's it cool well now we actually gotta do our routing so I'm going to remove this H2 and I'm just going to start it off with router and I'm going to hit tab to auto complete that okay inside of that I got my switch okay and inside of my switch I'm going to have my route all right and this route is going to be an exact path all right and this exact path is just going to be the home page okay so let's hit refresh it's complaining about something what is it complaining about well let's see what is the error about said save okay did we do yarn start we did not do yarn start so of course that's complaining makes total sense boom now let's hit restart beautiful okay and now you're like hey I don't see anything on the screen there's nothing here well yes because inside of Route you still didn't add in the login component so let's add in the login component let's ah do that okay this is the component we imported we added it there and now you see login okay that's it so we're pretty much now set to go and start working more on like styling our login component and adding more things to it so let's just go ahead and start doing that now okay great job so far so now let's keep rocking and rolling okay we got basic login component functionality working okay now we're gonna add a container and we're gonna start adding some nav components and we're going to add some styling to this okay so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to do a few things so first of all um I'm going to find this SVG right here okay I'm gonna put that inside of my images folder so I want you to actually find an SVG again it's going to be in the comments below or in the description below for you so don't worry about that I'm gonna put it right here in my images okay awesome so hopefully now you got it in your folder let's keep on rocking and rolling and guys you know if you want to know how to stop and start your servers control C control C stops it okay then you can install whatever module you need to install and then you can do npm start so just make sure your server is running otherwise your app is not going to show up here okay just a little note Okay cool so now let's keep going through this I'm going to go inside of my login component and uh we're gonna now start adding some styling and stuff here okay so uh just bear with me so first things first okay I'm gonna just remove this entire line right now don't need that and we're going to start with a return statement okay and let's create a container component okay and inside of our container component let's create our nav component and again hit tab okay and then inside of our nav I'm going to add a link tag okay and then this link tag is pretty much going to do nothing as of now and it's just going to be the LinkedIn SVG logo okay that's it so effectively what is this going to be it's going to be this thing right over here okay just so you know where we're headed and what we're doing that's what we're building okay so it's going to be a link and inside of this link all right we're going to add our image tag okay so notice the hierarchy container nav inside of there we have a link and inside of there we have our image tag okay IMG hit tab to auto complete um from my images folder I'm going to get my login logo.svg that gets me my SVG that I'm looking for and now look it's complaining it's like I don't know what container is or navis make sure to keep hitting command desk or control s to keep saving okay so now what this is complaining about is all that means is we actually need our container and nav style styling okay so let's go ahead and just style them not a big deal at all so first things first I'm going to hit cons container okay and I'm going to create style div and I'm going to put tilde tilde okay tilde is the key that's right above tab okay and just hit save so I'm going to leave this style component empty for now okay and then I'm gonna create a style component for my nav bar so I'm going to do const nav and I'm going to do styled dot nav and I'm going to do tilde tilde and save and stop right there okay so what am I doing here I'm giving it empty styling okay if I do that well you should now have a LinkedIn clone okay awesome okay so now I'm gonna start adding some styling okay and what that's going to allow me to do is it's gonna allow me to control that image because that image right now is just straight up out of control right because you don't want your LinkedIn to look that freaking massive so inside of here I'm just going to hit enter enter okay and then uh padding I'm going to give it zero pixel padding okay so on the container side I'm done for now and inside of my Nav Now I want to style this okay and this is where it gets like interesting what I need to do all right so let's go ahead and give it a Max width of uh 11 28 pixels let it refresh okay cool and then uh let's go ahead and give it margin Auto okay and I'm gonna give it a padding of 12 pixels by Zero by 16 pixels okay so now we saw a little bit of like padding kind of kick in so it's not completely touching the the top part right of our um of our browser because that didn't look great and now we're gonna actually use flex so to enable Flex you got to do display Flex okay now you might be wondering hey where did it go bring it back don't worry we're gonna bring it back really soon okay just hang in there for me align items this is going to allow us to align it centrally okay this is vertical alignment and then let's go ahead and do position relative okay and um I'm gonna do another thing I'm gonna do justify content and I'm going to do space between and I'll explain why I'm gonna do space between in just a second all right and uh let's give it a flex wrap of no rap I don't want this to wrap and go to new lines because for my browser right if I have this nav bar right here I don't want it to wrap and then go essentially to new lines that's not something that I want okay so this is looking good so far and then I think I just want to do a few more things to make sure that we're good to go okay I'm just gonna say hey anything that's you know inside of the a tag do a few things with it give it a width of 135 pixels so now this image has a specific width we controlled it right this is what we essentially wanted to do now let's go ahead down and I'm going to give it a height of 34 pixels cool okay and now what I want to do is Media query okay so this is something cool that I want you guys to learn and what I'm saying here okay is on a phone this line here all that means is on a phone do the following okay so I'm gonna open squiggly brackets I'm just going to say give it a padding of Zero by five pixels like that okay so if we're on a responsive mobile device it's just gonna look slightly different all right this is going to make a big impact later on so with that said with the currently with the nav bar and where we're trying to place our LinkedIn clone we are good now let me explain why we did space between remember how the final version should look well guess what guess how this is separated because of space between okay and guess why it doesn't run on new lines Why join now is not here and why sign in is not here because of flex no rap okay all these little things make a huge freaking difference okay and you can play around with it you can delete lines and like go back and forth and see if that actually does anything okay and that's another way to like pick up and get better at these skills okay so let's keep going and by the way if you're wondering why your code especially inside of the style components doesn't look like mine and it's looking like it's just one giant long string and it freaks you out um what I recommend is go to extensions and you can get vs code um just type in style components okay and you can get like one of the style components extensions that might actually help you I think it's called vs code styled components that one so you can get that one and I think that'll like give you the highlighting you're looking for and make your things look normal okay I have tons of extensions but that's um one of the ones that's really helpful all right cool so now let's go ahead and add the join now button in our app okay and that's going to be that beautiful button right there and it has a couple of features I want to show you when I hover over it it has the little gray color that happens also notice that it has a nice little border radius so we're gonna go ahead and build that now so let's go ahead and do that so first things first I'm gonna go inside of my login.js I'm already here so that's good and then underneath this image right here uh the the login logo so go underneath that okay that link tag as well and I'm just going to open up a div and inside of it I'm going to create a new component called join inside of that I'll just say join now okay now again you should be at this point where it's complaining join is not defined blah blah blah blah blah okay cool well not a big problem now all we have to do is actually just go ahead and create our join component so I'm just going to do const join and let's just get started okay and um styled a and leave it empty for now save okay so now at least you have join now up here on the top right okay so now let's start with the styling so go inside of it hit enter twice and let's go so let's choose font size and I I think I'm gonna go with font size 16 pixels on that one all right so now underneath the font size I'm going to add a padding of 10 pixels by 12 pixels on this thing okay so you can see it got pushed just a little bit from The Edge that's exactly what we're looking for uh text decoration um none because for my link tags I don't want them to have an underline so that is to just make sure that that happens and for color I'm gonna go with something like this okay just a not completely black it's a little bit grayish okay so that's what I want to do here um as a matter of fact actually what I can do is 0.08 okay so I think yeah let's leave it at this actually I'll 0.08 after hover okay so let's go here let's give it a margin right of 12 pixels great get giving it some more distance from the right hand side because we're going to put something else there and then let's go ahead and say that on Hover we want certain things to happen because right now it still doesn't have any hover functionality right so let's go ahead and do that so on Hover we're actually going to change the background color and um I'm gonna do this to the background color okay so what does that mean when I hover over it has a lighter gray right so it's kind of a dark gray join now when I hover over it it has a lighter gray behind it okay cool now I'm also going to change the font color on Hover okay and I'm probably gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm probably going to make it just a little bit darker so let's go here boom so the font color turns a little bit darker as you can see and then let's add text decoration of uh none okay and all of that is looking good so when I hover over okay no underlines no weird stuff happening and you know one last thing is that it's still looking pretty Square to me what I want to happen is I want to give it the little little rounded Corners so let's add some border radius to this thing so I'm going to go border radius and for Border radius I'm just going to say hey give me four pixel border radius on this thing okay so when I hover over I got a nice little rounded corners and the join now button is looking absolutely great okay amazing we're doing great so far guys if you guys are enjoying this video by the way so far smash that like button break that thing and of course subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and uh let's just keep on going so and the one thing I still want to do is uh to index I want to actually add to our index as CSS I just want to add some fonts okay so going to um our body right what I want to do is actually just want to add a font family here okay so let's go ahead and add uh to our body okay and we're gonna add a certain uh fonts okay and the only fonts I really want to add here is font family I just want to add Ariel Ariel like this and then I just want to add Sans serif okay fall back and so yeah now the fonts are looking good kind of what we're looking for and with that said let's just jump in to start working on our sign in component okay that's that thing right there so let's go ahead and do that so sign and component we're going to need a couple of things so let's go to our login component inside of our login component I'm going to make our signin component right underneath the join uh the join button okay but it's going to be in the same div okay so this is important to understand same div the join now component and right underneath it we're going to have sign in component okay hit tabs to auto complete that and then I'm just going to do sign in okay now again it's complaining hey cyanide is not defined so same thing here you guys know the rules let's create a styling for our sign in component okay and this is going to be a a tag AKA link tag and then let's just hit save cool so what you should see now is you should have sign in on your screen if you full screen it you should have sign in right there okay and now we're gonna go inside of this and start actually adding this thing so I'm going to add a little box Shadow to this and um you know I used a box Shadow generator that's what you can do as well but here you're just gonna get the final version so we got a little box Shadow around this thing so you see now a blue outline outside of your sign in all right we're going to give it a color of um a little bluish color for the sign in as well okay and for Border radius let's give it 24 pixels cool so now it's looking nice and round that's good okay I'm gonna give it a transition duration of 167 milliseconds okay so you're gonna see that's gonna come into play later on like for example when I hover over this it has a little nice transition that's happening there that takes 167 milliseconds it seems like just give it a font size of 16 pixels okay and I'm going to give it a font weight of 600 okay so now it's a little bit Bolder line height give it 40 pixel line height okay so now boom all of this stuff got pushed down just a little bit and um on top of this I'm gonna do a couple of more things to this let's give it a little padding I think okay so padding I'm thinking 10 pixels by 24 pixels like that okay so now signin component is looking a little bit funny it looks good here but on mobile mobile device it's freaking cut in half so it looks stupid so we're gonna fix that don't worry okay so that's our padding Now text align it um in Center okay and then we're gonna go back around color for it and background color is going to be a just that Okay so so far so good and then on Hover we're gonna give it some functionality okay on Hover I'm going to say that the background color is going to be let's go like that okay actually let's make it this one to 49 bye okay said refresh cool okay so now when I hover over it you see that there's a blue color that's happening okay and when I remove the transition look it just happens instantly so we don't want that effect I want that transition there because it allows me to make it blue but with a nice little transition on Hover and then on top of that I want the font color to change when I hover on it and I want it to be this blue uh right here on Hover okay so that's good and then of course text decoration even though right now it's good but let's just add this for safety and just good um you know default behaviors and patterns okay cool so our sign in on your computer should be looking good okay it's just because I was zoomed in like too much at 175 so when I meant here it looks good okay because I'm on a giant TV so I'm trying to zoom in but now you should be good okay so with that said our login component is looking pretty good now we're gonna start adding in our sections and putting in main content in there right now okay so now let's actually work on our section so in section basically it's going to be this big section over here okay so now we need to make that work at the image so it's also mobile responsive right because for example it's here like this but when I full screen it da completely different right boom and now it's here but when I go mobile the image is in the middle the text at the top how is that happening so we'll show you the magic behind the scenes Let's uh go to our login.js so we're here now right underneath the nav bar we're going to add our section that's going to be our new component all right all right so now of course it's going to complain and do our favorite complaint which is section is not defined okay so now it just means that we haven't had it added the styling part of this okay so let's go ahead and do that I'm going to create a section styling like this and it's going to be section okay save um cool so that's good now of course you know the drill enter enter inside of here and let's start adding what we want okay so first things first let's go align content and start whoops start okay now make sure let's also do display Flex because we're going to need that okay uh Min height I'm going to keep that at a 700 pixels for this thing okay and uh let's give it padding Bottom now some of the stuff you guys are not gonna see okay like for example padding bottom you're not gonna see it but what it's actually doing is if you added more content underneath this so like for example say section is like this right if I added something else underneath section it would start adding it from here but that's not what we want we want to give it a little padding so that padding that's what we're giving it right now okay so that's why some of the stuff is going to be invisible you can be like what the hell are you writing Kazi and why isn't it it's not doing anything but trust me it's actually adding padding that is good convention to do that okay uh conversely this is going to add padding to the top so just like this right now you saw it gave some breathing space between the nav bar and this section starting over here okay so cool we added pattern to the top and the bottom and now we'll do this all right cool so just giving it some additional padding now I'm going to make the position relative okay and um Flex wrap I'm going to actually do Wrap okay and the reason why I'm doing that is it this is the wrapping is what's allowing this image to get wrapped around which means when I do this it wraps it okay so that's what we want that means if the screen goes too small those things wrap and actually form new rows this is why Flex is so freaking helpful uh with we're gonna give a width of a hundred percent on this bad boy Max width is going to be 128 pixels okay align items because I want things to be in the center let's give it an align items of Center margin Auto okay and then of course last and pretty important thing is on media how do I want it to behave so meaning like on my phone on my iPhone how do I want it to behave this is how I want it to behave okay and let's give it a mid height mid height of zero pixels like this okay let's open full screen okay so now the section is in the middle you guys are going to start to see a lot of this Behavior once I start adding content to it okay it's going to start becoming a lot and a lot more clearer so now let's go ahead and start adding content to this thing and start adding stuff in our hero okay so let's go ahead and get our hero image so this is going to be our hero image that we're going to use right over here okay so we're going to put that inside of our images folder oh and just one fix right here guys um this is PX right there okay so just make sure you have that 768 pixels cool okay now let's go to our um I mean we're already here in our login component okay hopefully you're here now underneath our section we're going to add hero under um actually is going to be within our section okay so the hero is going to be within here okay so let's do this let's remove where we say section because that's not what we want anymore let's do hero as a component and hit Tab and uh just hit save so what it should look like is you should have section and hero should be inside of your section component okay now inside of your hero we're going to add an H1 and that's going to say welcome to your professional Community kind of like how it is on LinkedIn right it's save now again it's complaining hey hero is not defined well again that makes sense my friend because you know the deal we need to actually go ahead and uh make the style component for it so we're gonna do const hero style div okay do that and hit save so now we should have welcome to your porefessional community so let's um fix that welcome to your professional community great and let's just go here and start adding our width at a hundred percent why does it always autocomplete to that it's so silly okay and uh we're gonna style the H1 inside of here like the following okay so we're gonna give it a padding bottom of zero okay we'll give it a width of 55 Jesus so welcome to your professional Community that's what it should be looking like okay and that just happened because of the width that I gave it cool all right now we'll give it a font size of 56 pixels like so Big Font that's kind of cool like it actually looks powerful as soon as I did that and let's give it a color of 2977c9 okay so this is gonna be a light blue font weight let's give it a 200 font weight okay so not super thick and bold not Thicker Than a Snicker okay this is very LinkedIn e LinkedIn e vibe that we have here let's give it a line height of about 70 pixels okay great so that gives it some Breathing Room in between each line like so and um after line height let's add in a media query so we tell it how to behave on a mobile device okay so let's go Max with okay and this is a mobile device 768 pixels text a line on a mobile device should be Center so it should be vertically aligned okay let's go font size to be 20 pixels all right great and then let's go with to be a hundred percent rate and then let's go line height to be about two great okay so this is what it looks like on a normal screen and then this is what it should look like on a mobile screen right in the center fits nicely looks great just like you thanks for watching so far let's keep going all right so this is good now I want to get outside of this H1 okay and now let's style the image inside of here because we we want to add the image and we want to tell it how to um how to behave okay so let's go uh above all the way here we're inside of our hero we added the H1 let's also go ahead inside of this H1 and inside we're gonna add our image okay so let's go outside of this you know correction hit image and how to complete that and um I want to pull the image that we added okay and it's basically login Dash hero.svg okay so now you should have the image showing up man it's already looking pretty freaking nice okay just make sure you didn't do any misspelling so like look welcome to your professional Community is looking good but this image is looking way too big so we need to control it that's what we're gonna do let's go to the bottom and let's go inside of our image and we're gonna just control this freaking thing okay right now so first of all let's give it a z index of minus one and while we're doing that is so if a text is overlapping it it's always on top okay image should have this image should not have the most priority the text should have a higher priority than this okay now with let's go 700 pixels on the width cool uh just exploded but don't worry we're gonna control that so now on full screen notice we have made it already smaller okay before it was like even bigger than this okay for position we're going to do absolute okay and then uh bottom let's go negative two pixels okay look at that it's like in a weird position look at that boom right there right there okay don't worry we're gonna take care of that right now let's go negative 150 pixels uh right there cool and um it's kind of like watching a painter paint you know where it's like not making sense and then all of a sudden it kind of comes together and your brain is blown uh apart on a phone how I want it to behave is top give me uh 230 pixels okay and then with so like from the top right from the top make it drop that's a wet you know what I'm talking about so like for example if I change this like 50 pixels right it goes higher up but two 30 pixels is gives me that nice little touch that I'm looking for on a mobile device but don't worry right now it's like kind of invisible on a full screen so we'll will um fix that as well okay but let's just make sure it's good on the mobile device so with we're going to go with initial and then position we're going to go with the going to go with initial as well and I'm going to do the same thing for height and I'm going to go with initial okay so now on mobile device it is looking beautiful okay absolutely gorgeous so so far so good all right folks so one of the problems I'm running into right now is my image on full screen is going invisible but on Mobile screen it's there if that's happening with you actually comment out the Z index minus one line and now your image should be showing up okay and you should be good to go so let's keep on going ahead here and adding more functionality to our app so I want to add in the Google form component okay so I want to add in like the Google login so let's go ahead and get that Google logo okay so take that add it to your images okay awesome so now after adding that Google SVG let's go ahead and start adding that to our login okay so here's how we're gonna do it uh let's go right underneath um actually we can keep this inside of the hero section right because that's where we want it so inside of our hero I'm going to add a form okay so let's go ahead and add that form um actually this form I'll probably add it right outside of the hero okay I apologize for the confusion and throwing you all over the place let's add form here okay and we're going to work on the styling of this form and then inside of here I'm going to have another component called Google just like that okay and I'm going to throw in an image inside of the Google component and it's going to be my uh Google SVG component okay or not component I'm sorry the SVG file look at the image and um right underneath this let's go ahead and just say sign in with Google like so okay now again it's complaining okay form is undefined Google is not defined you guys know the drill let's create stylings for them that's what it's complaining about so I'm going to create a form and this is going to be a styled div all right I'm gonna leave it like this and then I'm going to create Google and this is going to be a styled button and I'm going to leave it like that refresh boom we got the sign in with Google form all the way at the bottom you should be seeing that right there let me make myself just a little bit smaller okay so you can see it okay now let's go full screen like so beautiful looking good so far and can be here and be good all right full screen and uh looks great now inside of our form let's start adding styling in here so let's start off by giving it a margin top of 100 pixels start there so that gave it a bunch of margin and that's really good okay because we definitely want to add some margin in there so that way nothing weird happens okay and also it gives it plenty plenty of spacing that we want all right cool so that's good the other thing I'm going to add to my form is I'm going to give it a width of 400 pixels 408 pixels okay and then let's go ahead and give it a media query whoops media query I'm going to say Max width of 768 pixels which means hey I'm on a mobile device buddy on a mobile device I want you to give it a smaller margin top so it's not a huge margin top okay so you see it now it's a little bit closer to our image which makes sense which makes sense okay now inside of our let me actually all right it's in our style button let's go ahead and now add um let's basically add styling to this okay so let's just start with display Flex so we have Flex box enabled on here and then inside of here we're going to justify content and this is going to allow us to horizontally Center things so let's Center that I'm going to add a background color to this and let's just do FFF okay which is going to be this bright white that you just saw happen right there okay and um align items so I want to I want to Center align this thing okay so that's now looking a lot better let's go ahead and give it a height of 56 pixels so 100 width let's give it a border radius to give it nice little rounded Corners beautiful and now I'm going to give it a box Shadow that's going to be a little bit complicated here but again you can Auto generate these uh from box Shadow generators okay but just bear with me here because it is going to be worth it because it will make it look great okay I can set pixels RGB okay and uh let's give it a zero percent here okay I'm gonna just save this and then let's do another inset there okay and um I think I'm gonna just make it let's go RGB here and zero zero zero slash zero percent okay so that's a mysterious looking thing but it gave it the Box shadow that we were looking for okay without it we just don't have that box Shadow so it's not the end of the world honestly whether you have that or not but you can add that in okay if you don't want to write all that out I won't blame you if you um if you avoid that cool so let's do vertical align and let's go middle okay and then I'm gonna give it a zero index of zero let's also start adding in the transition duration for this because I want it to have a nice little effect as I hover over it okay and if font size of 20 pixels so now sign in with Google is looking much bigger so great and then uh I think color let's color it like so so that makes it just that little bit grayish color that is looking great and then now let's add in Hover functionality on this thing guys because once we have that hover then it's gonna do things when we hover on it does that make sense okay let's go ahead and do that guys and let's keep the freaking energy alive and up in here so I'm glad that you guys are with me and rocking and rolling okay if you've been if you've made it with us so far smash the like button like look at how good this freaking thing looks right on your portfolio it's gonna look so great and it's just gonna make you stand out from so many of the other people out there so let's keep going so on Hover let's basically add a background color changing all right so let's do this uh let's give it a 207 207 another 207 and we're going to give it a 0.25 okay so now when I hover it has that little gray color showing up in the background okay all right so we gave it a little background color now let's go ahead and also add a font color for this okay and I'm gonna give it um this color right here 0.05 so when I hover over it makes the text a little bit darker okay that's a nice little touch and now again we're going to add a little Annoying box Shadow thing with honestly I'm just gonna skip because I hate for you guys to have to type it all out just looks annoying it's just annoying so this is uh great so far I think this is good and I think that um this looks great so far so let's keep going okay so next up um we're going to add a couple of more things to this okay so that should complete your basic form and to sign in with Google and let's basically add now some header functionality okay so I'm gonna go inside of my header and this header is going to be on the home page so what does that mean if I go to slash home okay I want to be able to get routed there so this is the completely built app okay this is the build version the final deployed version and when I sign in with Google right when I do slash home it should take me to this page so now we're gonna actually start working on this page and working on this header here as well so let's go ahead and get started with that so first things first inside of my let's make our header component and then we're going to make our home component or let's do the other way let's make the home component first so inside of components I'm going to make a new not folder new file and this is going to be home.js and I'm going to do import style from styled components here all right and then I'm going to create a component called home okay and then I'm going to return div and let's just do home like this okay perfect that's all good and let's just go ahead and Export default home so now this is a component we have access to in other areas now let's go ahead and create our header component okay so let's go inside of components new file header.js just like so and inside of our header JS we're going to do this pretty much a similar thing import style from style components and let's create our header component like that give it the argument of props and we'll return a div that just has a text header inside of it that's it for now and now inside of our app.js we're just going to import these okay so here's what that's going to look like so under login we have under login we have this route ending we'll create another route okay create another route and this is going to match the path of home like this and then inside of here we'll have header okay let's go header let's make sure that in our header component we export default header because that's why it couldn't auto complete it it seems like let's go back and now I'll go header and boom it will auto complete it and uh it we just imported header up there and uh let's also import home okay so I'm gonna do home like that and so I imported header from components header I imported home from components home we got header and home under the route call Path slash home so that means now I should be able to go slash home and it should take me to it so both of those components are showing and that's exactly what we wanted perfect so now you should be able to go to slash home see all of this stuff and let's keep rocking and rolling here okay so next up let's add in our containers you know how I like to do these things guys so let's go to our header file okay and inside of our header we're going to do a couple of things so you guys are going to need to keep up with me okay so let's go ahead and um add a container inside of the container let's add our content okay it's out of there let's add just text that says header for now okay so this is what it should look like for now and now we're going to add these style components right underneath here okay so I'm going to do container style div and let's leave it empty for now and let's do the same thing for content and we're going to style div and we're going to leave it empty for now okay let's hit refresh boom so so far this is what you should be seeing okay if I change this with boogie boogie hit save you should now see boogie boogie here okay cool now we're gonna start styling this stuff in here so let's add a background color and let's go White dope so it looks a little funny right now because it's just just bright white and it's almost like somebody was cleaning a really dusty board right that's what it looks like now let's add a border bottom one pixel let's make it solid and okay uh weird did not need that many parentheses so bugger off mite cool okay and uh now let's go ahead and add left zero okay and underneath this let's add some padding so we'll go uh Zero by 24 pixels just like that position I'm gonna go ahead and go fixed top give it zero and I'm just going to give it a crazy Z index because I want to make sure that that always stays on top okay and that's like never going away anywhere again a lot of this stuff is going to be invisible until you click into it like this and now you'll see this header okay I'm in inspect mode so just bear with me promise is going to get better let's give it a background color or actually no I'm sorry let's not do that let's give it let's do display Flex so now we have the flex mode enabled now let's go align items Center on this thing okay it'll Center align items let's go margin zero Auto and let's go Min height 100 percent okay hit save and let's go Max width of 128 pixels okay awesome now with this guys you're not gonna see much again this is to set us up for our next step where we're gonna now start adding the logo and the header okay and then you can actually start to see what this code was doing so let's go ahead and now add the logo so I'm going to grab the home logo and I'm going to add it in our images okay boom right there now let's go back to our header file and in our header file I'm going to now start by adding this image so let's go to the top and inside of content let's remove the word header we don't need that anymore let's add a component called logo inside of that let's add a link tag okay and um we're gonna say that this image should take us to the home page meaning that if I'm logged in if I hit that image right there you know it should take me essentially to the home page okay which is this page right here okay so now we're just gonna add the actual logo and the image so inside of this link tag let's add an image tag like so and this image tag is going to be slash Images slash home Dash logo dot SVG okay that's what we just added right here homelogo.svg now style components is going to complain it's going to say hey I don't see this component or The Styling for it no worries let's go ahead and add it my friend so I'm going to add a logo like this styled and I'm going to make it a span tag let's make it empty for now and let's do margin write eight pixels and then let's go ahead and do font size about zero pixels just like so let's hit refresh and tada all of that work that we had done earlier is now showing us what's going on okay so let's try removing these things and let's see if it makes a difference right so I removed container and look you cannot see anything right but now let me bring everything inside of container and now you can see it and now you can see why we gave it a color of white because now it's visually there okay so great work all right so now let's go ahead and add search and input and search icon so for example this search bar right here let's go ahead and add it and let's go ahead and uh get started on it right now boom so first things first we're gonna go ahead into our header file okay and uh in our header file we're gonna do a bunch of stuff okay along with like some stuff with SVG okay so what I'll try to do is I'll try to kind of um give you this SVG so you can have access to it as well okay so let's keep going I'm going to give you access to the SVG file too in a second but let's go ahead under our logo and under our logo what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a search component okay and let's hit search and I'm going to hit tab all right inside of my search component I'm going to create a new div inside of that div I'm going to create an input okay and I'm going to add a placeholder all right just like so now I'm going to go and create a new component called search icon let me actually go ahead and do that like this okay search icon will be inside of my search component so that makes sense all right now inside of my search icon I'm going to add my SVG uh logo slash path okay so I'm going to give you access to this as well but here it is all right if you guys need it again all of this is going to be Link in the description below so that way you guys have access to it okay so it's an SVG and then all we gotta do is uh we just have to close out of this SVG okay just like so so boom now again search is not defined search icon is not defined so we're just going to go ahead and create those okay so let's go ahead and let's do search first and then we're gonna do search icon so let's go search and um you guys know the drill I'm gonna go ahead and make it empty for now and let's go ahead and create styling for our search icon as well I'll go and uh do this okay so empty empty cool so we got our search icon right here we got our search bar right there um it is looking beautiful magnificent and we like it all right now all we have to do is start styling our search component all right so let's go ahead and style this thing okay so inside of our search I'm going to give it a opacity of one let's give it a flex grow of one as well okay and um I think I'm going to give it a position relative okay and then let's do the following for this div all right let's go Max with we'll go 280 pixels okay input I'm gonna go border none for the input so now notice that there's no border anymore so it already looks much cleaner uh box Shadow will go none and then background color eef3f8 okay that gives it a little light gray I'm gonna go border radius of two pixels cool okay that's gonna be the font color and width will go 218 pixels so now it's a little bit wider padding okay so great I'm gonna give it a line height of 1.75 okay so it became a little uh you know wider from the top got a little bit more height a hence height font weight let's give it 400. great font size we'll give it 14 pixels make sure every full screen it nice looks good looks really good height let's give it 34 pixels border color I'm going to give it a this color right here cool and then vertical align text top okay great so this thing is looking good now the search bar okay now let's work on the search icon so we have the style div that we started then let's go ahead and style that search icon component as well so we're gonna make the width 40 pixels for it position absolute Z index let's give it a one top 10 pixels so now it's getting inside of that search bar which is exactly what we want so that's good and we're doing that by using of course position absolute making sure that the Z index is making sure that it's not like hiding behind other things you know I don't know if I give it a z index of negative 200 it might hide behind other things right so Z index one just make sure hey don't hide don't be shy okay and then the position absolute just allows us to like position it okay now let's go border radius of that cool and then margin of zero great I don't want any box Shadow I mean I don't think I'm gonna even add that line okay I mean I could have pointer events none for this let's go and see yeah that's kind of cool okay so there's no um that's a nice little touch right because if I save now if I hover over it my mouse still looks like a pointer right but watch what happens when I go pointer events none when I hover over it the whole thing is a text box it's a nice little finesse that we decide to put in here for you and of course let's go display Flex so we have flex functionalities and flex superpowers and let's uh horizontally align that great now it's a little bit closer to the search bar okay look at it oh man that search bar is looking nice all right and then align items we're gonna align it to be Center and then of course let's add a transition background color and then have that transition be 0.15 seconds cool okay okay dokie okay I I mean I don't even think honestly we need that line you can kind of take that out and it still looks fine to me okay I like to just simplify it if we don't need something just take it out okay cool so search icon is looking good search is looking good yeah to me this is looking great okay you're making great progress so far I'm really proud of you now what we're going to do is we're going to actually turn that search icon into a file okay so I think that's going to be a lot better uh for you so let's go ahead and do that so I'll show you how to actually turn this into a file so inside of search icon what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this SVG right I'm going to cut it you need to cut it okay and um inside of my public images I'll create a new file and we're going to call it search Dash icon dot SVG just like so now inside of here I'm going to paste that SVG code okay so now notice that my search icon is not there anymore makes sense now what I'm going to do instead in my header I'm just going to replace all that SVG garbage code that I had I'm just going to replace that with this image and I'm just gonna go search icon.svg like so and tada we got that icon right there okay this is also highlights to you how you can actually turn that into a file all right has a nice little touch right there great now let's start adding things to our nav bar okay and we're going to start making progress on that all right so now let's style our nav bar okay and let's make it look pretty Pretty Ricky Ricky all right here we go so I'm gonna jump inside of my headers and uh we're gonna add nav okay and we're gonna add nav right underneath this search so give me a nav component just like this please and let's just go ahead and say nav menus now we're going to go ahead in our styling and we're just going to say const nav styled nav like this okay and we're going to go inside of here get a little margin left get a little bit of ah okay that's looking good display block beautiful got nav menus showing up on the top right hand side that looks good uh of course let's add in a media query for phones 768 pixels mobile devices in general and let's say hey if you're on mobile give me a fixed position on this nav and give me a left of zero bottom of zero background white and of course give me a width of a hundred percent okay so there we go beautiful that's what it looks like on a mobile device now okay Pretty Ricky Ricky okay cool full screen this thing so some of the nav menu items seems like they're now coming to the bottom which is fine okay we ain't got a problem with that right do you got a problem with that because I don't have a problem with that okay so you should neither all right let's keep rocking and rolling all right so we got the nav done now let's go ahead and add home to the nav menu so first things first let's grab our image okay let's take that image and I'm going to add the nav home image right there all right so this is our image now let's go inside of our header JS file and inside of our header JS we're going to do a couple of things so first things first let's actually wrap the nav actually not wrap the nav bar but inside of the nav bar I'm gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm going to delete where it says nav menus so delete that and instead I'm going to make a new component that says nav list wrap just like this I'm going to tab that and I'm going to hit enter and then I'm going to make another component inside it that's called NAB list hit tab then hit enter and inside of that let's make an a tag um and inside of that a tag actually here's what we'll do okay we don't need an ah ref for this okay we don't need that but we do need this thing tag wrapped up in an a tag so let's go here and inside of here let's add an image and for that image we're gonna go images with the nav home.svg like that okay that's the one that we put in our SVG file so what it should look like is you got your nav bar you got your nav list inside of that and you got your NAB uh I'm sorry not NAB list excuse me nav you have your nav list inside of there okay so that's looking good now it's complaining hey it's not defined okay no worries let's go ahead and Define this so let's go ahead and do first of all const nav list wrap okay and equal styled UL it's going to be an unordered list and let's leave it like this then let's go here and we're going to have our nav list and this is going to be a style bullet points uh okay here we go oh my bad let's put the tilde tilde at the end of it good good good good good good good so now all we see is this bullet point right here that's okay because that's what we expected okay um now we're gonna make it mean something in a second by doing our styling so inside of our nav list wrap let's go ahead and do this so display Flex inside of here we're going to flex wrap do normal wrap and then let's do list style type none okay let's open this up and now because we did list style none we don't have that little dot there um that we were getting so that's fine now inside of nav list let's start doing let's enable display Flex and align items let's make them centered okay and now let's make a a style our link tags and let's give it a little bit of a styling okay so first of all we're going to sell line items in the center background let's make it transparent I'm using Vim so you'll see a lot of jks happening there that's my shortcut for getting out of the mode and let's go Direction column and I'll show you why that's important uh later okay so column cool let's go font size 12 pixels font weight 400 okay just hang in with me there it's gonna make sense I promised my child I promise my child this is gonna make sense all right just hang in there for me pal Justified accountant it's going to be Center and long hot we're going to give it a 1.5 because why not okay and uh let's give it a Min height of 52 pixel enemy with of 80 pixels like so and uh position of relative okay and of course you know my style I do not like text decorations and the underlines that I sometimes normally get okay so none is gonna be far about me put that there okay and now just a couple of last things we're going to do let me just make sure that our nav list is right so we've got our nav list nav home dot SVG a nav list wrap we got our nav list inside of that we got our a tags great okay let's keep on rocking and rolling whoops okay okay my bad so this nav home is gonna be inside of images okay unlike me being an idiot that I am I put it not inside of images so of course I didn't have access to this okay here we go it's right there okay cool um so sorry there's tons of mysterious code and you're probably like what the hell's going on we don't need the cursor pointer we can get rid of that okay cool okay so now a lot of this is gonna make sense all right so you solve it and I took away a line item Center watch it became so huge and massive right that's what she said but when I take it away and I hit save it's gone all right also this is what the media query part is doing all right let me remove all these lines of code so you and I can be on the same page because I coded just a little bit ahead of you but now we're back so no worries um let me just close this paren here okay and we're just going to code this thing up together okay so hit save um and if I hit this now we can see this icon right there okay beautiful mystery solved now inside of this a tag let's go span and let's give it a little color all right and uh we're gonna give it this color okay so boom there we go that's good and where is this going to show up you might be asking here's where that's going to show up okay so inside of our let's go to our navless component now inside of our navless component you see that we have added this a tag well what we want to add inside of that a tank is not just an image but actually a span tag as well that says home okay so like that the a link contains an image and a span tag called home so now this is what it should be looking like we got home right there okay and when we go to phone screen right we got home at the bottom which is pretty freaking cool how the media query Works magically and makes that happen Okay uh media query makes that happen at the bottom right like for example if I change that to top it's gonna make that happen at the top but we don't want that at the top we want it at the bottom okay there we go cool so now let's style that span tag right but the color home now has that little like grayish color that you can see let's go display flex and uh let's align items of course Center okay so that's just going to make sure that the text is vertically aligned how we want it now let's get out of this span tag and we're going to add in a media query and I'm just going to say hey my Max width should be that which is meaning a mobile device or a tablet or something of that nature and let's give it a Min width of 70 pixels okay and then let's get out of let's get out of all of that and on Hover what I wanted to do is the following and on active here's also what I wanted to do okay the attack specifically to the a tag on Hover here's what I want to happen and specifically it is a span tag on hover or active inside of the a tag I wanted to get just a slight color change k all right now you can get lost in how it's nested it can get kind of weird but um it's a nice little touch okay watch this when I hover over this home Watch What Happens boom it's very very subtle it's a very subtle shift okay that's all that's happening there so just a side note if you're watching this video right now there's a lot of weird things that you can kind of get tripped up on especially how things are nested inside of one another so like be on the lookout for that and just be careful when you're going through this right because for example here right it's the on Hover and on it being active inside of the a tag and inside of the span tag that's inside of the a tag have this color happen Okay so sometimes you can get lost very quickly and easily so just be on the lookout for that alright so now let's add um nav menus like uh like the home menu that we added but we're gonna add all of the rest of them meaning I want to now add uh all of these ones here my network jobs messaging yada yada yada okay and so let's start working on that well for a couple of things we're gonna need need all these have items so we already did nav home so we don't need that anymore but we're gonna need nav jobs messaging Network notifications and work so I'm going to hold shift click here select all of these and drop them inside of my images all right now that it's inside of my images I'm simply going to go to the top of my file header JS file let's go to our nav list and all I'm going to do is I'm just going to keep on adding more nav list so for example here I'm going to select this nav list component and I'm going to do the following okay so this is just be careful on this as you're following me I'm going to hit like I'm going to copy this entire component okay copy the entire component and then all I'm going to do is just replicate it a couple of more times paste paste paste paste okay and how many icons are there let's go check one two three four five okay maybe six but I think it's five if I'm not mistaken okay it worked under your messenger jobs yeah so I think I'm fine pasting it five times um now let's go and start giving them those names so we have nav Dash home now this one is going to be nav Dash uh jobs I imagine actually nav Dash Network okay let's see what the first one is um in the completed version we have Network jobs okay so the next one is going to be jobs and then after jobs it's going to be nav Dash messaging and after nav Dash messaging is going to be nav Dash notifications like so now you can see on the mobile version so nice looks so good on a mobile device let me actually move my face a little bit out of here so you can see that like wow am I pretending to look down right wow that looks amazing okay so there you go that is beautiful and when I go full screen I see them all up there okay and now I want to change what it says so for example where it says um home leave that as is but the span tag inside of the nav Network well we're gonna go ahead and change that and we're gonna say my network okay we're gonna go to the jobs one and we're going to change that and we're going to change that to just jobs okay the one below that we're just going to change that to messaging and the one below that uh we're going to change that to Notifications okay so now on mobile device it is looking great and uh let's go full screen it's looking pretty freaking great that's exactly what we're looking for so our nav bar is now starting to look really really good that makes me really happy so let's continue going forward and now add the activation functionality to this entire thing okay so how I'm gonna do that is instead of nav list let's go where we have nav list and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do something special okay and I'm just gonna do this to the home one none of the other ones for now okay I'm just gonna kind of hard coded inside of the home one and the functionality we're now adding is you see how this home one here is active right but these ones look like they're not active let's so we're going to add that styling to our app so let's go ahead and do that okay so nav flash uh nav list and to this nav list I'm going to add class name and I'm just going to call it active okay and simply all we're gonna do now is we're gonna go inside our nav list wrap okay so let's go inside to our nav list wrap right here okay and uh under our nav list wrap we're just going to add the stylings we're going to do DOT active so for active class do the following for the span tag and right after that we're gonna just do content blank whoops that's fun cool transform scale of X I don't know why it does that one oh key dokie and uh simply then border we're gonna give it a border bottom of two pixels solid and let's go white Dash FFF cool okay so we're working on this functionality uh bottom I'm gonna give it a zero ta uh left zero position absolute position a spell position okay give it a 200 millisecond ease in and out and I'll give it a border color of like this okay so now we have this going on here so now boom there we go I just had to hit refresh okay and there we go we got home it's going active when I hover over it that's exactly what we want and even on Mobile screen I can see home has that like nice little underline and um you know that's kind of what I expect to see on the on the home um you know the mobile app the mobile version of all of this all right so let's keep on going all right so now let's go ahead and add um add user nav menu and add work nav menu okay so we're gonna add a couple of more things so for example here we have a user menu and then here we have a work menu okay looking thing so let's go ahead and add those two as well so first things first we're gonna need the down icon that little tiny icon right there it's a little bit hard to see but it's that icon right there okay so we're gonna need that um the other thing actually you know what let's just throw that into the images first I'm gonna need that the other thing we're gonna need is the nav work menu so let's go nav Dash work boom I'm gonna need that um oh we already have that that's fine and then the other thing we're gonna need is a user SVG okay there we go there it is okay okay so now that you have all the images let's go inside of our header and start adding them okay so let's go ahead and create these components as well by the way so I'm gonna go all the way under nav list but if within navless rap so right under the nav list ending let's go ahead and add user component okay and then right underneath that we're going to add our work component okay so these are the two components we're going to have now within our user component let's go ahead and add a couple of things so I'm going to add a a tag but I don't need an ah ref for this either I just need to borrow the link tag style link and inside of this a tag I'm going to need an image and I'm going to use the user.svg okay like so um right underneath this a tag right underneath this image what I'm going to need is a span that's gonna just say me okay and right underneath that me I'm going to need another image and I'm gonna give it the drop down menu okay so far makes complete sense because you got the user image right underneath that you got the drop down image okay so that's looking good now we're good with this part let's go inside of the work part work work work work work work so now let's go and add a couple of things so let's go to a tag again we're probably not going to need any of the other things let's add an image inside of the work tag and we're gonna add in the work image okay nav dashwork.svg cool and also we want to add um a span tag inside of here and we'll give it we'll say work and within NetSpend tag okay we didn't NetSpend tag I'm going to add another image and uh we're gonna give it images down icon dot SVG like so okay cool now it's complaining hey user is not defined work is not defined hey no problem I like when work is not defined because that's how I live my life as a CEO let's go all right so we're gonna do create new styling for the component up and got my thoughts all right so there we go and now I'm basically going to add my style components okay that's all I'm going to do so I'm going to borrow my styling from our nav list okay that's how you can borrow styling from something else and uh for my work I'm going to borrow my styling from the user okay that's kind of nice let's just hit save for now um oh let's do Style with a small S I believe okay user is not defined okay fair enough fair enough we'll Define it there we go okay so on the mobile screen now you get this funny looking thing at the bottom right okay if you're not seeing it I'm just gonna move this here I'm gonna get this funny looking image the bottom right and if I go full screen you'll see me and you'll see work so that's cool but that looks ugly so we're gonna fix that okay so let's go here to user and do a couple of things and basically we're gonna say hey the SVG inside of this a tag look we got to do something with this thing all right it's it's uh just unacceptable so let's start off with width okay let's try to control the width of this link tag okay and then uh let's also try to control the Border uh radius okay fifty 50 50 can go 50 50 with okay let's see hopefully that does something if it doesn't do something um I got another idea in mind okay so another thing what we can do is uh let's go let's grab the image tag inside of here and give that a width of 50 24 pixels beautiful so now you see the image is actually quiet small all right so that's controlling the image that's good let's give it a height of 24 pixels all right cool cool cool and now let's give it a border radius of 50 that's going to add that nice little circular effect to it so you can already see it's starting to have the nice little circular effect that's great and let's go span tag and uh we're just going to align items in the center all right because that's just how we like to do things around here all right and now inside of my work All I'm gonna do because it's already borrowing tons of styling we're just going to give it a certain border okay give it a nice little nice little color so there it is and when I highlight it looks a certain way we got the drop down we got the me with the big fat Arrow this is pretty freaking cool looking great okay okay great work young Padawan so far we're looking good we're looking smooth we're looking clean so let's just keep on rocking and rolling through this thing okay now we're gonna add sign out functionality okay so let's go into um let's go inside of our user because that's where sign in functionality is going to be added so my user is right here okay let's go right down there right underneath the a tag ending and I'll add the sign out component okay now this component before we build it this is going to be this component right here when I hover over all right it gives me that sign out option that's what this component is going to be all right so that's what that component is going to look like okay so now let's go ahead and just build it out now inside of my sign out I want to add an a tag again I don't need the ah ref and um all I'm gonna have it do is say sign out and again I'm just adding the attack to borrow the styling that I have added to it okay so hit save let's go down and let's create our styled component for sign out const sign out okay and we're just gonna do styled div let's leave it empty for now and let's go inside of here let's uh let's go back let's hit refresh cool okay so we have something showing up that's a good sign now instead of inside of our sign out we're gonna let's uh go ahead and do position absolute let's go top by 45 pixels okay and I'm going to pass on the drop shadow because again it's one of those like weird looking ones so I'm just gonna keep it simple here so sign out creates a little box around so give it a white background and now let's give it a border radius of this okay so now outside now it has a little border radius around it right there that you can see that looks cool and under here I'll give it a width of 100 pixels okay and a height of 40 pixels okay so now the sign out is starting to get under control and not looking as crazy give it a font size of 16 pixels and transition duration this is going to give it that little effect when it comes up which it's not going to do right now but in a second we will add that so then it'll look much nicer text align and let's align it in the center display none that looks good okay so it won't display anything and then it'll come up on Hover okay so now let's go inside of our user which borrows from our style component uh navless component so inside of user we're going to create a new thing and we're basically going to say on Hover do the following for the user all right now we're going to select use this fancy selector to select our sign out component okay and style it align item Center okay and I'm going to justify content inside of the center all right now we're having reference error so what's going on here cannot access sign out before initialization interesting so what we need to do is um we need to move this code up I believe let's take the sign out code and um move it up up above user okay let's move it right there and uh we should be good nice we are good okay because yeah I couldn't reference sign out because it wasn't defined yet defined yet so we just make sure we defined it right before okay so let's go back now when I hover over me you can actually see this drop down of sign out showing up that's a really good sign that's what you should be seeing right now okay dope so looking good so far now let's keep on going with this thing okay so we're now going to add a container and I'm gonna basically add another component using style components okay so let's go with that and we're gonna add the hiring in a hurry part which looks like this ad right here right there all right that gives it also a linkedinesque feeling we're gonna go ahead and add that now cool so let's go inside of Home JS all right and we're gonna add that here so um we're gonna be doing a lot of stuff so inside of this return okay let's just open this return uh create a container component inside its container component create a section component and then let's create an H5 and again let's create an a tag but uh um without the ahrefs okay like so just to borrow the styling and then basically what I'm gonna do is um just type in hiring in a hurry question mark all right and uh just like that okay and then underneath this H5 I'm going to make a P tag and um basically I'm just gonna say find talented Pros in record time with upwork and keep business moving and put a period there save okay so I have a section inside of which I have an H5 and a paragraph tag cool now let's go ahead and just style this and a lot of these are very common stylings that we have already kind of done so I'm gonna like go through this much faster so our container is going to be I'm going to just keep it empty for now and start off with that I'll have my content is going to be styled div we'll keep it empty for now we'll have section and um I think I'm going to make that section okay style section and again we'll keep it empty for now so it doesn't complain and uh there you go okay so now we have that text but you saw it was a little hard to see right it's kind of up here hiding okay and we basically need to push it down that's what we're gonna do right now we're gonna push it down so inside of my container I will go ahead and do give some padding to the top 52 pixels so now boom it just pushed it down and now I can finally see it let's give it a Max width of 100 percent so okay cool and then um what I'm gonna do inside of content uh let's give it a Max width of 128. this okay let's go down and I'm gonna do margin left Auto and also we're going to give it in margin right um and we're gonna do Auto okay cool and uh inside of section um let's do mid height 50. all right so let's give it that 50 pixels let's give it a padding of 16 pixels a box sizing let's do content box on this cool okay so that just centered Center aligned it all right now it's perfectly smack in the middle of the center uh let's give it a text decoration and we will actually give it an underline okay kind of like an actual link will enable Flex on this and justify content to be in Center okay there we go okay so we'll do media queries here in just a second don't worry for H5 I'm going to give it a special um styling let's go ahead and do this okay give it a little blue for hiring in a hurry that's that right there okay and the a tag inside of here um let's give it a 700 beautiful okay let's get in outside of the H5 tag now and uh let's go in to the P tag and style that and I'm gonna say hey give me 14. font size 14. and let's also now do some coloring on this thank you okay great gives me makes it a little bit darker and uh Let's uh make the text Bolder right so 600 makes it pretty bold and then let's get outside of the P tag and finally let's give it a media query so I'm gonna go Max with 768 again mobile devices were you at mobile devices Flex direction we're going to give a column and then padding of course will be Zero by five pixels okay boom there we have it that is looking gorgeous okay beautiful hopefully you got to that with me and let's keep rocking and rolling all right just to blow some of your uh some of yours mines okay so to flex on what this media query does right so for example imagine if I wanted to make this red every time it was in mobile device but like if I went full screen uh it made it um it made it black okay so what I can do is I can actually select because this is a P tag right here so I can actually select this by doing that okay and then how would I make it red think about that how would I make it red all right so color red save okay so now notice that it's in red but when I go full screen mode desktop mode now it's black okay so it's basically saying this again is saying mobile devices do the following now I can also you know if I wanted to do something like font size make the font size 100 x on mobile the font size would be crazy in red and on full screen it would actually be completely normal that's kind of crazy it's almost like you have two different apps right that's pretty freaking cool so um I'm just going to select this P tag and remove it and we should be back to our normal uh healthy looking app all right now what we're going to do is basically we're gonna start to add some of these parts so for example in the finished version you see we have um we have these three things happening over here okay so this is like one this is two and this is three and this is our left side right this is our middle and then this is our right side okay so basically what I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to divide up the page in these three things and I'm gonna use actually grid layout instead of flexbox layout to do this okay so this is going to be really cool let's go ahead and make it happen pal okay so let me go to our our app cool let's go to home.js okay cool we're already here all right so let's go to um let's go right underneath section and right underneath section I'm going to add my component called layout and inside of here I'm going to make a div and call it left side here this is gonna I'm gonna put Main and another div and we'll just say right side okay and again it's complaining I don't know what layout is but this time you know what we need to do okay what do we need to do we need to go downtown and style that damn component const layout style div all right save and then let's go here okay so right now you got left side Main and right side not exactly where we want it but it's a good start and uh here's what we're going to do I'm going to start with display grid okay well that didn't do anything it's okay buddy hold on hang in there all right we're gonna call them the the areas we're gonna call them this left side Main and right side okay boom so it's divided up into three areas all right so now what I want to do is I want to Define how many columns I want right so we're gonna go ahead and do that now so let's go here uh and I'm going to give it columns and I'm just going to say min max give me this okay right there let's go okay and always like click and watch what it does right so right now it's doing something really really bizarre but watch what happens once we're done with the whole freaking thing okay I don't know why I'm an autocomplete always acts so freaking weird okay let's go here min max 300 pixels okay so let's go here um min max zero five okay there we go so now they're like overlapping a little bit but we got left side Main and right side kind of like how I want them but uh a couple of things I want to tell them I want to tell them hey I want to have a column gap of 25 pixels okay cool and um another thing I want is I want a row Gap of 25 pixels okay just make sure we keep refreshing because sometimes The Styling acts a little weird and uh grid template row let's go Auto on this thing cool okay and uh margin I'm gonna go 25 pixels cool so that gave it some margin from the top great and then let's go ahead and again add our media query so what does that mean that means that uh mobile device we want specific things to happen okay display Flex all right Flex direction we're going to make it go column instead of like row by row right so for example here it's going to go like multiple columns okay uh when I go into this now it's like that each row is a column okay just one column per row and um padding we're gonna go zero by five pixels like that cool so we gave it a little push and a shove from touching the screen so much on the left hand side okay and uh with that said we're looking pretty good and that allowed us to divide up the page into three and you know honestly I'm just gonna comment that line out because that line is giving me the creeps with that said this is looking good and let's keep on rocking and rolling okay so so far looking good um now let's actually go ahead and we've divided the page now we're actually going to start making the main and the left and the right components okay so let's go ahead and start doing that uh we're gonna try to keep it pretty freaking simple and pretty pretty um empty for now okay so let's go ahead go inside of components and create a new file and we're going to call this file left side.js um and in left side JS create another component okay called uh inside of components call it main.js and let's also create another component and we'll call it right side.js okay then inside of uh left side just go ahead and do import styled from styled components okay and uh for left side we're going to do the following all right so let's fix this one because we made a little uh typo so just rename and all I'm just make it a small s okay there we go so uh complete const left side I'm gonna have props like this okay and uh return inside of the return we're just gonna put a container in that container just say the word left side like that that's fine okay and we're going to create the style component for this so it doesn't freak out and inside of here we'll do grid area and we'll go left side just like that okay and again export default of sight cool so save save save save save save now we're going to do this let's go to main and um in main I'm gonna paste that code and everywhere it says left side I'm just going to replace it with main that's it okay whoops so let's replace this with Main okay and let's replace that with main cool and this like that so wherever it says main replace it um and now copy main go to right side paste this code and everywhere it says main you know the drill by this point uh just replace right side replace main with right side okay like that okay and then just go hit save um cool and last thing we want to do is we want to go to home.js okay and under layout we want to replace all of these divs and remove them because we don't need that anymore instead we're just gonna do left side all right and make sure you auto complete it because autocomplete will automatically import it for you as well uh why did it do left side like that oh because um um okay well anyways it's it's left side with the small s like that okay we're also going to do Main just like that close it and then we're also going to do right side make sure that when you write these three that you import these three as well um and now it's saying styled is not defined in any of them well what does that mean so let's go to left side and let's see what it's saying okay so lowercase the style from style components and that should be good to go I believe save go here make it styled with a small s save hit refresh and um yep that's looking great let's hit save like that cool so we're good so far and now let's actually add a art card component on the left hand side all right so let's add the art to the cards now so let's go ahead and do this okay so first things first I'm gonna go to uh let's go to left side because that's where we're gonna actually make this happen and I'm going to create um let's create a style component and I'm going to um which are called Art card okay and let's actually get it started with something in here so instead of saying left side in there I'm going to do art card just like that all right and um within this I'm just gonna say card okay kind of like that so you should have card here okay now inside of this we'll do text align and I'll do Center okay so boom there we go looking good so far foreign now let's go overflow hidden all right so it won't like bleed off the screen onto the sides okay there we go and um let's go background color Boom Like This give it a border radius of 5 pixels cool so now we're starting to look like a card right um and we have that background right there and now the the little radius is coming in that's clean and uh let's give it a little transition box Shadow 83 milliseconds okay cool and now let's give it a position relative border I'm gonna give it none okay and um I can give it a complicated looking box shadow but I think I'm just gonna pass on that for now so I'm actually gonna add the Box uh Shadow because I think it does make it kind of look nice and so let's go ahead and do that okay I'm gonna give it a um the only reason sometimes I want to skip it is because it looks like this mysterious code but again a lot of it is autogenerated um you know and even when you should I encourage you to use like online tools for things like box Shadow and stuff like that okay all right so now we got the art card let's go ahead and work on the user information so we're gonna need a couple of things to make that happen all right so now you're gonna need two photos slash SVG files we're gonna need photo this one right here with the camera icon and we're also going to need this card uh background card okay so let's go ahead and take both of these and I'm going to um put them in my yoink okay just there's a place uh right before a pit stop before I drop them into my images so boom just added them right there all right so now that we added those images uh let's go ahead and do something with them so I'm gonna um am I in the left side already okay great I'm in the left side component already perfect now uh inside of my art card just so you have an idea what we're doing we're gonna be building this thing out right here on the left hand side okay so let's go inside of our app that we're working on currently inside of our art card component remove where it says cart instead we're going to create a new component called user info all right I'm gonna hit tab on this and inside of here I'm going to create a new component called background let's say tab on that that should complete it and inside of this um actually let's uh kill the card background right there okay and so inside of user info I'm gonna have card background I'm also going to have a a tag with no href just so I can borrow the a styling and we're going to have photo which is going to be a component and then I'm gonna have link just like this is going to be another component and it's going to say welcome there okay and then I'm just gonna end it so slash and just like that all right so I got user info and then in their card background and the a tag okay now right underneath this a tag I'm going to have another eight tag again with the no href okay it's just like this it's at this a tag and I have add photo text component and that's just going to say add a photo just like that okay now there are tons of components that we need to go and make so let's get go ahead and get started it's like three or four maybe more so let's go user info and I'm just gonna do style div let's leave it empty then we need card background and I'm gonna do something similar which is gonna be styled div let's leave that empty let's go cons photo and let's go here let's leave that empty and then um let's go cons link for the link component and again this is a div we're going to leave it empty for now and add photo text okay let's leave that empty for now as well okay user info is not defined boom welcome there add a photo that's what you should be seeing right now cool so now we're going to start adding all the styling in here so for user info let's get started with that so A couple of things are going to be happening here we're going to give it a border bottom of one pixel solid okay there we go so that gave it a little nice little drop shadow here makes it look beautiful so it's a border bottom I didn't add the Border anywhere else 12 pixel 12 pixels by 16 pixels okay so now this is much more centered we have padding going left we're getting padding going this way and we got padding going that way okay so far so good let's go word wrap and we'll do break word cool and let's go ahead and go ahead and do this cool so Sometimes some of this we might not need honestly but it's okay I'm going to leave it here word break um break word cool okay so let's go ahead and let's keep on going okay inside of my card background we're going to now okay so first of all we're going to add a background image to this okay so let's go background and give it a URL and that's going to be Images slash card background.svg cool close it put a semicolon good hit refresh refresh cool so that image is not showing up but that image is going to start showing up in just a little bit so let's give it a background position of Center let's go give it a background size of 462 pixels let's go give it a height of 54 pixels so now you can start to see that image show up and let's give it a margin of negative 12 negative 12 0. so now that card is starting to look pretty perfect pretty freaking perfect okay pretty and perfect there we go so card background we're good on okay now let's just go ahead and add photo in there so photo is going to require us to do a bit of styling but it's going to look so freaking beautiful when it's done so I'm going to start off with not having any box Shadow uh for background image let's go ahead and choose the photo image so images I'm going to do slash photo.svg okay now we're going to make this thing show up in just a second so let's give it a certain width let's also give it a certain height so now the image is showing up cool now we're going to start making it look better cool height I'm going to give it box sizing border box background clip content box background color let's go white okay background position Center cool so that changed how the image was looking I'm gonna give it a background size of 60 percent beautiful and then we have um background repeat at no repeat actually cool so because we don't want it repeating over and over again we just want one camera and that's how we get it now let's go and do border and for Border we're gonna do two pixels solid white clean okay margin let's give it a margin of 30 negative 38 pixels Auto 12 pixel like that damn look at that one line of code and beautifully smacks that in the middle guys like isn't that beautiful when you have these little touches and they all keep adding on and then your front end just just beautiful all right and then uh let's give it a border radius of 50 percent now we got it round nice and round just how we like it okay now let's go inside of our link and make that do good things let's go 16 pixels for the font size line height will go 1.5 okay that added some line height to this okay foreign let's go here and go color and we'll change the color just a little bit so we're gonna go zero zero zero zero point nine cool and then after that we're just going to choose the font way to be kind of boldish okay let's go 600 so welcome there boom a little bold man looks so nice right on the left hand side is looking beautiful when I go in this mode it looks great and mobile you know most people get lazy on the mobile but not us we make sure that that mobile version is uh is looking clutch you know is it distracting when I'm in the center probably I'll just keep myself to the side for now okay all right so that that looks great okay and then add photo to text add photo text let's go give it a color and let's start off with this okay cool we got a little blue action going on let's give some margin from the top so give it a little separation from welcome there right it was way too close and feeling a little uncomfortable and we got it out of there give it a little font size of 12 pixels line height uh again line height gives things some nice breathing room so it just does not hurt and then we'll give it a font weight of 400 makes it just a little bit Tad tad bit darker if we go 700 that's a little too much but 400 is just just right and just enough so perfect that's looking great now let's add a widget component inside of our art card okay so let's go ahead and do that now all right now let's work on our widget okay so first things first we're going to go inside of our uh left side component great and then here I want to add my widget okay so right underneath the user info I'm going to add this widget right there just like that okay this is going to be a widget component open up the a tag okay and then we're gonna create a div inside of that div I'm going to have some span tags so spandex and this is gonna say the first span tag is going to say connections and then the next span tag is going to say grow your network just like that okay now I need to close that a tag that's why it's complaining great and uh I need to actually add an SVG inside of that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this SVG that I'm adding okay and um we're gonna call it the Widget icon all right so I'm going to go inside of my so let's take this Widget icon right over here okay and I'm simply going to add that to my images so drag and drop cool so now once you have that SVG SVG we're also going to add in our item icon okay that's another one we're gonna need so this item icon one little bookmark looking thing okay so let's also get that and add that to our images so drag drop cool so we got that SVG going now let's go back to our left side and here's what we're gonna do okay inside of this a tag inside of this um actually where are we planning to add this where am I planning to add this so let's see here we got where's my div action going on grow your network so right underneath grow your network um this actually needs to be wrapped up in a div I believe okay so let's go here yeah so this this needs to get wrapped up in a div okay boom just let's do it like that okay so widget a tag div span cool and um right outside of this div ending is where we're gonna make our magic happen okay so let's go outside of this div and I'm going to do image and the image source is going to be that SVG file that we talked that we just added okay and afterward the widget ends we're going to add in another component called item within that we're going to have a span tag within that we're going to have another image or a image and that's going to be slash images item hyphen icon.svg okay and just so you have some idea what is happening is we're going to be doing a lot of this stuff so we're going to be adding this we're going to be adding this okay so there's a bunch of stuff happening like that so hang in there Buttercup it'll be great and if you're watching this and you're enjoying this so far do your friend a favor and smash smash that like button and keep that energy high in here okay I love your beautiful face and let's keep going okay so widget we're gonna need um just create a style component okay and just for you guys I didn't do an ASMR version okay because you guys didn't like that very much so let's go ahead and uh let's add in a widget just like this and we're gonna do two things we're gonna add in widget and we're gonna add an item cool so widget component just in the start was going to be styled div I'm going to leave it empty and then also let's add in um for item okay let's go item is going to be a styled a and just start off with empty so let's put slash here by the way that was a little typo so boom slash not Dash cool so now both of the images should be here right there okay if I full screen this thing you should see them connections grow your network and we got both of our images right cool okay so let's go ahead all the way down and start styling this uh widget okay so that's gonna take a second actually to style because there's a couple of things happening here let's go about border bottom one pixel solid all right beautiful uh let's add some padding to the top of this thing cool and let's add some padding to the bottom of this thing beautiful let's go ahead and uh style the a tags inside of this thing and I'm gonna give it a text decoration of uh of none let's go display Flex because we're gonna need that justify content and I want to give it space between okay so you saw how this thing got pushed right that's kind of what we want this on the left side this on the right side and there's space in between that's why we write that align items Center and we're going to give it some padding cool okay so on Hover it gets darker and it kind of gets highlighted okay whoops my face is blocking pretty much everything great so when I hover boom boom looking pretty magnificent my friend uh background color on Hover we got some action going on okay now let's go under hover and let's do something okay so just go display Flex and we'll go flex Direction and we'll go column okay so connections and grow your network got written out on separate lines because this is a span tag this is a span tag and because of doing column they both got pushed onto their own columns let's go attacks a line and we'll go left so now connections and grow your network are you know evened out more and within this let's uh style our span tags even further so let's go give it font size of 12 pixels a little bit smaller let's give it a line height of 1.33333 so we got some spacing going on in between some room to breathe it's like when I'm sleeping with my girlfriend and I just want to like not spoon for a second you know I'm basically giving a little line height in between because sometimes it just gets way too hot um first child uh AKA Monet's first I'm kidding all right here we go let's give it a color or GBA it's a it's one of the members on our team and I don't know if we're supposed to say this on YouTube but she's having a baby so we're excited we're super excited for her we're pumped we're super happy let's go here let's go ahead and uh let's go 0.06 beautiful and then underneath the first child let's go with a nth child whoops whoops whoops whoops whoops and child just like that and let's give it what happened here just like that okay there we go so now these styled things have certain ways of how they're colored okay so that's good and uh let's close out of all of this and then the last thing we want to do is we want to give certain styling to SVG hopefully that actually does something cool um so there we go so now this component is looking really beautiful I mean like look at it right on the left hand side connections grow your network that little icon right there I mean just fine little touches and this entire app is coming along so freaking well I mean like just look at this thing right it's beautiful so that's great now we're gonna go ahead and style our item component right because that's another one that we were gonna do so let's go ahead and do that one okay where's item component item component has the item icon so I imagine it's this one but hopefully we're not wrong let's go let's give it a border color whoops and technically those correct code um okay that text align it to the left I mean do we even have text in there oh yeah let's go ahead and add text in there okay so let's go to let's go to our item we have span and we have an image and right underneath this we'll say my items okay just like that so what did left a line do let's see if I delete that line what happens absolutely nothing perfect great just how I like my styling to do things um padding let's give it 12 pixels font size 12 pixels is great and then let's go display block okay nice so now it's looking perfect um I want to give it a certain let's let's work on the span a little bit so first things first I'm going to start it off with enabling Flex on it and then let's go and vertically align everything with the line items play with the color just a little bit it just makes it kind of like a dark black okay and then let's get out of here right there and on Hover I wanna change the color just like that okay boom boom boom boom hey hey nice look at these cards now this thing is coming look at how much we got completed it's looking great you you are great thank you for being here so far and I really I mean in all seriousness I really appreciate your support thank you so much and let's keep going this one is for the boys and the girls okay great progress so far cupcake but uh now is not the time to quit now is the time to go harder so we can finish it and make your portfolio look amazing so you can get that dream job okay right now is not the time to quit so let's keep on rocking and rolling uh let's work on the community card okay so first things first we're gonna need this image this is that plus sign uh finished version of that looks like this this is going to be the community card okay so that's what we're gonna be working on so let's go ahead grab that sign and add it to my images folder okay all right so once you got that plus signed let's go to the left side and uh let's add that thing in okay so go to let's go to under our art card where it ends so where does it end right there let's go under there underwear and let's do community card component hit tab hit a tab okay so we're gonna now borrow the link tag styling just like that and inside of our link tag I'm gonna hit make a span and the span is going to have the word groups in there okay and uh now I'm going to make another a tag that's going to be empty just like this inside of here we're going to have another span and inside of there I'm gonna have the word events and right underneath that I will have my image and um my image is going to be the Plus icon SVG that I got okay so again Community card I got my a tag here my a tag here with some span with the span tag in there okay two a tags with Spam tags in there and um we're gonna need just essentially uh a few more things okay so let's have another a tag blank and inside of here let's have a span tag that says follows whoops let's say follow hashtags okay and then right underneath that I'm gonna have another a tag that says span and they'll say discover more just like this okay so we have one a tag two three and four each a tag has one span tag one two three four so four a tags four span tags got it everything inside of the community card cool good all right so now let's go ahead and make our styled component called Community card so let's go and let's have it borrow from styled card let's hit save and Community card is not defined cool there we go so now we got this ugly looking thing right here but hey at least it's right here and it's ours so that's good plus sign so now let's go inside of this thing and let's start working on it so let's add some padding cool that gives it some breathing room let's text align everything to be on the left that's better let's make it display flex and you know what and I'm gonna give it a Gonna Make It Go in columns cool aha looking way better clean let's go down and uh let's start styling the attack so let's select the eight eight tags now color black cool my girlfriend's favorite color uh let's go like this boom that padding gives it nice breathing room from the left and from the top Let's uh play with the font size and give it 12 pixels and then I'm going to do vertical a line on this thing and let's see if it actually does anything I don't even think we need this thing Okay cool so let's just leave that out for now because otherwise it just gets confusing cool let's go and go on Hover let's add some functionality to it so let's make the color go and do the that blue thing okay so when I hover over it each one of these highlights yeah boom boom boom great okay cool now under hover what I want to do is let's go to our span and let's go display Flex let's go align items and I'm going to vertically Center great so now events is looking good because before it was looking stupid with the plus sign let's go justify content and I'm gonna go space between cool so now that plus sign has a space between and it gives it nice little breathing room there okay let's get out of the span tag and uh we're gonna grab the last child okay and we're gonna give it a color okay we're gonna make that gray text decoration of course is none border top let's go one pixel solid with this color I think cool so this border top has done that thing right there that like line that partition that we got okay so and underneath this I'm going to add some padding great and let's add in a little hover and 0.08 cool oh too dark let's lighten that up 0.08 baby yeah blue blue blue hover nice man this is looking freaking slick search bar looks great my icon here looks great the front end is looking it's looking good looking pretty freaking good okay all right I'm in like 200 zoom on my screen but you know so yours might look slightly different but that's okay all right so really good progress here and uh uh I think let's keep on going all right so next up um let's go and add the follow card component on the right hand side well what is that what is that Causey it's going to be um some of this all right the follow component so let's start working on this thing now boom so let's go add follow card component so I'm gonna go to my right side component now and inside of my right card component I'm going to remove what we have here and instead I'm going to add a new component called follow card okay so inside of my container I'm gonna have a follow card component now inside of here I'm just going to write the text right side and of course it's gonna complain it doesn't know what it is no worries we're going to create a follow card component now or style component now okay so so far it should just be saying right side and not really doing anything okay no worries now let's go text the line let's go text a line and we'll go Center uh overflow Let's Go hidden okay great um let's go and add margin bottom eight pixels background color okay so now the right side is having a little like border radius around it okay it's at the bottom we'll fix that but that's what you should be having so I just zoomed out a little bit from my app right side should be there on your mobile type of view and on full screen view um right side should be kind of at the bottom right right now Okay cool so uh we added a little border radius that gave it the rounded Corners let's go ahead and do position relative and let's go border none and I'm gonna give it a box Shadow and let's go like this with our box shadow okay mysterious mysterious box Shadow and then padding we're gonna go 12 pixels cool so now right side should be kind of a lot more visible and much bigger okay all right I have to zoom out a little bit and get 225 percent and that's that allows me to see it okay now we're going to add a title inside of our card so let's get our feed icon and we're going to put that in images because that's what we're going to need now cool so with that icon on the way let's go back to right side and um inside here we're gonna add that since I'll go let's go where we had the word right side written and remove it and instead we'll replace it with a component called title and inside of this component I'm going to add a H2 and this H2 is going to say add to your feed let's hit save so it auto formats it I have prettier extension you can get the prettier extension from here if you want your auto completion to work and on also for auto completion to work you should go to your um workspace settings okay so just go to your settings how do I even get to my settings go to your settings and have format and do default formatter prettier and also format on Save so once you do that your formatting should start to work okay cool um so add title now inside of our title I have my h2 tag and underneath that I'm going to add my image and my image source is going to be this one right here and all the way at the bottom we're going to now add the styled styling for this component const title and I'm going to say inline Flex on this thing so right there okay great let's go down align items okay and I'm gonna justify content let's go space between that should space things out for us cool let's go ahead hit refresh great and let's go font size and I'm gonna go 16 pixels all right and with 100 beautiful and again color okay so that gives it a little gray add to your feed Okay add to your feed that's what that should look like pretty simple all right so we're good with that and now we're gonna add feed follow list okay that's what we're gonna do so that's gonna add multiple more things this is going to be the big one it's gonna add a lot of things cool so great now let's add the feed list okay so under the title I'm going to create my feed list cool so let's go ahead and do it like this and as a matter of fact do I even need that other uh add to your feed stuff don't really think I need that anymore actually let's add the feed list underneath our title okay so leave the title as is and underneath that let's add our feed list okay I'm just gonna do this it's kind of like easier to see all right so let's go feed list component and inside of here I'm gonna have um here's how I'm gonna do this okay let's go there keep the a tag empty inside of here I'm going to have an avatar component whoops an avatar component like that and underneath this I'm going to have a div that div is going to have a span tag and it's going to say Linked In like this okay uh underneath that let's put a button that says follow cool so feed list um list okay the LI inside of that we have an a tag that's that's going to have an avatar component then we have a div that has LinkedIn and then a button that says follow cool all right so underneath this let's Get Out Underneath this and let's create another list okay inside of there we'll have another a tag again let's remove the ahref um cool let's put our Avatar component again and let's go div on this thing span I'm gonna go video cool and then I'm gonna go button and this button is also going to say follow great all right now it's like hey I don't know feed list I don't know Avatar so no worries we're just gonna go ahead and uh create stylings for them and this is going to be a styled uh UL okay unordered list and then we're going to to also create a styling for Avatar let's do that so now you should see on the right hand side we have add to your feed LinkedIn and then video cool now this feed list let's go inside of it and let's go margin top 16 pixels and we'll go display flex and align items Center great it's looking good margin will give it a 12 pixel so that gave it again some Breathing Room between LinkedIn and the word video I'm gonna give it a position that's relative and font size let's go 14 pixels on this thing so it's going to be on the smaller side and then let's select the div just like that and let's go display Flex in there and I'm gonna go flex Direction column on it okay to just make sure that the follow button is underneath where it says LinkedIn and video okay and uh let's get out of this and here I'm gonna now style the button so background color let's go transparent color okay a little gray these are some ugly buttons right now but I swear they're gonna look good by the time we're done with them the bun looks Goofy okay and they're getting uglier by the second okay padding 16 pixels okay fat buttons now and uh we're gonna vertically align them let's give it a little border radius so it has slightly rounded Corners that's better box sizing I'm gonna do border box font weight cool I'm gonna justify the content to be Center give it a Max height of 32 pixels in Min height actually I'm going to give it a Max width instead of 480 pixels text align Center and outline none great so looking good so far I'm liking it okay and now we're gonna go and do this stuff with the Avatar okay so let's get out of this uh and we're done with the we're done with the feed list let's go inside of our Avatar one now and inside of our Avatar we're gonna add the background image let's give it a URL and um I'll show you guys this image as well but uh this is what it is just type it out with me.com slash c h 1b4v oh my goodness I'll try to make it easier for you and add it somewhere inside of uh GitHub but this is the image okay it's kind of ridiculous I'm sorry but that's that's what it is okay so you can type that out or maybe we'll put it in our in my GitHub repo so you can kind of have access to it cool so boom let's go back round size and we'll do contain background position center let's go no repeat and with the 48 pixels and then let's go height of 48 pixels okay great coming along okay coming along so that's good so far by the way if you're wondering what that image is it's that like big plus sign that we have in our final app so let me just show you it's that one right over there actually actually I think I got the image wrong myself so this is what it actually is now boom we got that hashtag symbol right over there okay that's what that is so now that's looking better all right now let's add recommendation component and add a banner card cool so let's go ahead and do that baby girl all right we got the right icon and uh that's actually do we have the right icon did we add the right icon it's this one right here beautiful looks kind of silly did I add it I can't remember let's drop it in right here again boom I mean looks like I never added it before okay now that I added that let's go back to um our right side so let's go right side and then inside here underneath the feed list component once we get out of that one let's go ahead and create a recommendation component and under my recommendation component I'm gonna go view all recommendations okay and underneath here I'm gonna add image and let's go Images slash right icon Dash SVG cool so and now it goes hey recommendation is not defined well not a problem my friend let's go all the way down wait what's Happening Here recommendation wait I meant to do this view all right it should be wrapped in recommendations the image there we go that's better okay and recommendation let's create a new style component for it recommendation and we're gonna go style a cool let's just leave that now I'm also going to need a banner card okay so let's go and add the banner card right underneath the follow card okay so let's go Banner card just like that and um inside of the banner card I'm gonna add an image and that image is also going to have a really annoying source all right I'm gonna paste that in right there all right so again I'm gonna try to give you access to um the image but for whatever reason if you're unable to get it I'm just gonna paste that image right here um so you can see it okay it's gonna be this image and this is the URL um yeah there you go okay but I'm gonna try to make it easy for you guys to get it so I'll work on that so Banner card um yep that's it for the banner card and then now we just have to create styling for it okay so let's go all the way down for Banner card and let's go Banner card and for styling let's just um inherit our styling from follow card cool let's go here and refresh great let's go in our recommendation and go color give it a little color for our recommendations our blue color so view all recommendation it now has that blue color that you can see and it's looking good okay now let's go underneath here let's go display Flex let's go align item Center and font size 14 pixels cool so just made that a little bit smaller and then for Banner card what we're going to do is we're just gonna say hit image make the width of it a hundred percent and then make the height of it a hundred percent and that's it okay that is it oh by the way um I was wondering why my right side was messed up I in my file um which file am I in right now I think right um yep so right side JS inside of this file this was like at the bottom right and I was like why is this the bottom right so um this is a small typo okay so it's right side lower case okay and that actually brings that to the top right okay so make sure you have that right all right that ad image is acting a little funny so we're just gonna keep going and then we're gonna have that image show up okay but for now uh the banner card I'm not gonna worry about it I'm just gonna uh keep rocking and rolling okay so just bear with me and let's go so now we're gonna add a common card component okay so let's go inside of Main um and in here we're going to basically create that component let's go here const common card okay and we're going to do this okay and uh text align it to be Center I'm gonna overflow hidden margin bottom all right this is going to be helpful for the share box in just a second but just um let's keep going with this hang in there with me and it'll make sense very very soon okay so we're gonna basically add in margin bottom eight pixels to this thing background color and we're gonna we're gonna actually inherit from this okay because it's going to be our common styling and then we're gonna inherit from this card um let's go border radius and go five pixels I'll go position relative border none and then we're gonna do the Box Shadow game of that RGB that and cool so now we got our box Shadow our box Shadow is good to go and uh let's go ahead and actually start using this okay so I'm gonna go into my container let's remove Main and instead of main we're going to create a new component called share box inside of sharebox I'm just going to write in the word share and then let's create a styling for share box so const share box and I'm gonna go and inherit I want to inherit my styling from common card okay and then let's go and do display Flex Flex Direction I'm gonna go column okay and uh now we got the share component showing up right over here okay that's perfect that's what we want the share to be showing up right in the middle color okay so that gives it a very light gray I'm gonna margin like this cool and then background white okay so share box is looking good we're inheriting the share box features uh from our other component called common card okay so now in our share box we're gonna be adding a bunch of things okay what is sharebox you might ask well that's a really really good question so let's actually see what sharebox is so share box I believe is going to be our um this one right here this is are going to be our share box okay we got photo video event and article in there okay that's what we're working on right now so um AKA our post box okay so let's add those things in I'm actually excited to build that component out that component is going to be a lot of fun and that component is going to have some really dope modals that go along with it okay so get excited so first things first I'm gonna need a couple of couple of icons all of those icons actually so I'm gonna need my article icon that one right there I'm gonna need my event icon so let's go and find it starts with an E Event icon I'm also going to need my photo icon look for a p photo icon and then I'm also going to need my video icon where is that right there cool so let's take these I'll open up my public images and doom drop it in right there pop it like it alright let's delete this one cool all right um so this is good now um let's refresh so we got all of our images not okay that's good let's go to main JS now and in our main file we're gonna now start adding all of this okay so under share box I'm just gonna add in a div and inside of the div let's add in images and um let's add in our user SVG okay so that big that's a big image right there that we added cool it's taking up the whole screen right now but that's okay we're gonna fix that soon and then right underneath that we're going to do button and say start a post cool so underneath that we're going to have another div inside of that div we'll have another button and then inside of that button we'll have another image and then this image is going to have our photo icon.svg okay so like look right underneath that user image we got this thing going on right here okay what doesn't look like this right now but we're working on it okay we got the image part down and we got the photo down now we're going to take that image and we're going to control it soon because that image is out of control right now we're gonna control it don't worry okay and uh and you'll see how that happens okay so I got my button right here with an image inside of it and uh right underneath this uh image actually let's add in a span Tag and Call say photo cool so now that's looking good underneath this button let's add in another button and and this button right here is going to have another image in here this image is going to be slash images event icon dot SVG just like that cool so that's event um actually we got photo icon.svg and this one let's make it video icon okay and then the span tag right underneath it is going to be video okay then let's have another button hopefully you're getting the rhythm of this okay and then inside of this button we're gonna have image and we're gonna have slash Images slash Images slash event icon dot SVG okay and then underneath this image we'll have span event just like that cool and lastly I'm going to have another button which is going to have an image inside of it that image is going to be I don't know where it starts writing it goes crazy slash Images slash article icon dot SVG okay and the span tag here simply going to say right article just like that now let's go and check it out all of them are right there that looks great making progress photo video article we got the whole shebang in here okay cool and then what we got to do is we gotta start adding styling to it so let's go to our share box and underneath our share box where we added background white we're going to add an additional styling okay so let's create a let's create a select the div not create and uh for div we're gonna style the buttons like so and these autocompletes are painful so this button is going to have the styling of outline none cool underneath here we're gonna have color okay font size let's give it a 14 pixels right all right so underneath this let's do mid height of 48 pixels cool background transparent okay so caught the caught the crazy thing all right so share box make sure the whole freaking thing is wrapped in share box okay now that's the error okay this is why it's important to catch these errors boom okay now um if I uncomment this out because I commented it right now because I was like there's literally no difference that's happening okay so let's just go line by line here and see uh oops let's just comment well comments that's the whole um thing at once so let's try it like that okay so I'm gonna uncomment this color okay that made it a little bit gray I think you can see that right that made a little bit Gray okay now that made the font size a little bit bigger right uh line height cold I give it a little height cool let's go mid height boom we got a midnight action going on and uh lastly but not leastly let's make the background transparent okay so clear clear that out great now we're going to add a couple of more things to this okay cool so now under background we're gonna make sure that border is none okay so now the border is gone and it's starting to look a lot better yeah so boom that's that's looking beautiful let's go display Flex nice that looks a lot more beautiful now clean and then let's go align items Center nice font weight should be 600 yeah that looks great that looks great all right we're doing good now underneath this button let's get into the first child and uh display Flex okay so we're starting to control that image a little bit align items Center okay let's go padding nice some more control on that uh image it's always a good sign now we're gonna get into really controlling that image already looking better baby uh border radius of course fifty percent will give it that nice circular feel and then margin right eight pixels aha look at that we're getting we're getting somewhere with that now we're getting somewhere with that now so let's get out of that image now and uh now let's dig into the button okay okay so you saw what margin did right it gave it more margin from the top in this case we're gonna have Flex grow one and then let's go border radius 35 pixels cool okay and uh let's go on and go padding left my bad left 16 pixels cool okay so far so good let's go border one pixel solid and then we're gonna essentially give it that color right there okay so now you can see start a post actually has a little border around it right and how did that happen so for example if I remove border radius now look it looks square but if I put that border radius there boom it's looking nice and circular like that okay now let's add background color and we'll add white cool and then text a line and I'm going to text align everything to be left great great great great great great okay and now let's get out of here and let's deal with the nth child uhhuh looks like that all right and we'll go display Flex he has so beautiful it's coming together Flex wrap wrap beautiful justify content base around so we'll give space around looks clean okay and then underneath here we'll go padding bottom okay so you saw how it gave it some breathing room from here right there give it breathing room right there okay and then the button the buttons here image uh the the image inside of the buttons okay let's go ahead and control that zero cool that controls it that's great great so so take a look at the images right here these images but when I add that line now those images have some margin from the text because they were initially way too close all right now let's get outside of that image and let's deal with span and here boom and now we got the beautiful blue action going on amazing amazing you guys okay that was um absolutely incredible work and um you know I just want to say that I'm proud of you for getting up to here and making such great progress so far you've been absolutely amazing but we're not done yet and we got a lot of way to go for example you know we I mean as amazing as this is looking already right and I bet you even completely forgot we actually have a freaking home page right which is completely mobile responsive by the way okay and if I hit slash home now we get redirected to home right so this is all the front end functionality and this is great but remember we still need to add more things to it like for example we still need to be able to add Firebase to it so we have login and logout functionality from the home page we still need to be able to add uh react router redirecting you on login to to this page and then we need to add more functionality around being able to write a post so we're going to need a modal we're going to be able to we're going to need to be able to add text in that modal and then add images in there and add videos in there and then we're gonna need to be able to store that inside of Firebase and then we're going to need to be able to read that from Firebase and show all of it here and then we're going to need to write react code that can show those components and everything in a beautiful way okay so we're doing great so far but we got a long way to go so hang tight you're doing fantastic smash the

that you actually need all right now let's actually start adding the article portion okay that means like we'll be able to see some of the Articles so here we go so first things first okay um let's go over to our main JS where we're at right now I'm gonna zoom out just a little bit because that was a little too close and claustrophobic for comfort and let's go right underneath the share box okay so where is it let's go to main and I'll go right underneath the share box where sharebox is ending and let's open up a div and inside of this div I'm going to add an article okay and inside of this article I'm just gonna say article like so okay and let's hit refresh now it says it's not defined because we need to make a styling for that component okay so let's go ahead const article and again I can do styled and I'm gonna copy from the common card okay so let's go like this beautiful now we have an article right here pretty clean okay pretty nice so let's hit save now let's actually add more things to this okay so first thing I'm going to do I'm just going to add padding zero to it cool margin of Zero by Zero by eight pixels okay and then I'm gonna do overflow I'm just gonna say visible on this thing okay so our article is here it looks great I like how it looks I like how you look and you're important and I love you okay never let anybody tell you otherwise I'm here to support you all right let's keep going so great job on the article all right now let's work on the uh Ellipsis okay so first what I want you to do is open it up Whoopsie Daisy you're crazy all right this is the Ellipsis SVG it looks like that three collapsible dots okay so what I want you to do is open up your public open up your images and then open up your that's inappropriate open up your heart that's what I was going to say and drop that image all right great now that you got that image what we're going to do is we're gonna go inside of our main and we're gonna do a couple of things okay let's go inside of our article component that we made and we're gonna remove what we put inside of there all right simply because we're gonna change that bad boy up and add a new component called shared actor okay and inside of this shared actor I'm going to make a link tag now I don't actually need the link I just need to borrow the styling so I'm just gonna leave it like this and I'm gonna give it an image and we're going to give it a user.sme where the F where does it start typing okay like so okay and uh so that's pretty good as long as our a tag and image is concerned now inside of this a tag I'm going to also add another div okay and this div is going to have span and I'm gonna have title after title I'll have info okay capitalize the title T and then we're gonna have date just like so underneath this a tag I'm going to add a button that button is going to have an image and we're going to give it an ellipsis uh and image SVG okay now it's complaining it's like yeah I don't know what the shared actor is no problem const shared actor okay just like that we're gonna give it a style div make it empty and save and refresh and it should be defined now okay so now we see title info date right next to each other very uncomfortably close with the three dots okay great so let's start adding some styling to it and make it look good okay make it look good in the hood like you should let's go and do that okay for the shared actor so now that's going to require a lot of styling hang in there let's give it padding right of 40 pixels oops cannot see it cool let's go down and I'm going to give it if Lex wrap and we'll do no wrap on this thing okay and just make sure the whole thing is wrapped and shared or shared actor just like that okay padding I want to give it 12 pixel by 16 pixels by zero cool okay whoops all right let's see okay this is where we have it it's looking good we got some padding going now let's uh do a couple of more things to it okay I'm gonna add margin to bottom let's go like this and add some margin and uh underneath that let's go align items Center cool and let's keep going all right so now let's go ahead and add under align items I'm going to make sure my display is flex okay cool starting to look pretty okay sometimes certain things don't happen but I promise they take some time and then they come together cool so we got display Flex now underneath here let's style our a tag akr link tag and I'm going to give it a margin right of 12 pixels okay so now that button moved just a little bit to the right that's beautiful now make sure you keep hitting save for the changes to take place so that gives it margin great now let's go flex grow we'll do one on this all right beautiful damage is taken up a lot of that nice and uh now I'm gonna do overflow hidden cool and then let's do display Flex okay whoops did not mean to do that all right so now you should have the image here the three dots to the right just like that and then if I full screen it it should still look very similar to this okay cool let's keep on going now underneath it this again doesn't really matter that much but I just like to do it just to be safe that no links have any text decoration just because it's annoying let's go inside here and now let's dial the image tag that's inside of the link tag and I'll give it a width of 48. pixels nice and I will give it a height of 48 pixels cool so now what you see is that right there okay so you should see title info date and the three dots great now let's get outside of this image and we will select our div and let's go display Flex cool Flex direction will go column so now title info date should be each On Their Own Line okay um let's go flex grow one on this awesome so now title info date should be in the middle okay and we'll do Flex bases of zero all right so we got the flex bases now let's go margin uh left on this thing and we'll go eight pixels for margin so that gave it just a tiny little margin you'll see it move a little bit and I'm gonna go overflow hidden again cool so we don't want to see any type of weird overflow happening and span let's control the span now so text align I'm going to say left so now title info date should be right up next to the image let's grab the first child okay and then we'll go font size 14 pixels cool makes it a little bit smaller we'll make it now bolder with font weight and again first child is that text right here okay and then let's give it a color and we'll go zero zero zero one okay so that makes it just a little bit uh darker okay then outside of this span tag what we're gonna do actually we're still inside of the span but we're outside of the first child right so inside of this span tag let's also style another element so I'm gonna go um basically this means this thing that you're styling all right so that and is referring to this shared actor style div so I'm saying this divs um nth child and I'm gonna go n plus one foreign and let's go font size 12 pixels cool and then we'll go color great so now the whole thing is just a little bit Gray okay so that's pretty good now we're gonna go outside of pretty much all of that and we're gonna style a button component on its own so we're gonna go outside of all of these squigglies and we'll now style the button component and we'll say position absolute so now the button should be hovering right over the photo we'll say right by 12 pixels cool top of zero nice background transparent like so border will go none outline will go none so now there's no boxes around it now there's no boxes around that Ellipsis right it's just Ellipsis by itself and uh that's it on the when it comes to this component for now this is pretty good and now let's keep on going all right now let's add description and a shared image okay that's what we're calling it so let's go and find her and this is the image that I want you to use okay this is we'll make a random post so that's the image and uh cool now let's go to our main after we got that image and now let's start actually working on this okay so what we need to do at this point is we need to find where our shared actor component is which is right here underneath our shared actor component we need to now add a new component and we're going to call that component description inside of description I'll just say the text description just like that that's it okay so that's good uh let's see what is happening here cool cool now underneath description we're gonna add one more thing we're going to add a new component and it's going to be called shared image just like this and inside of here we're going to have an a tag that's going to be empty and inside of this a tag we're gonna have an image like so shared image.jpg okay so again description boom again it's complaining that it doesn't know what those style components are no worries we'll add them in right now so let's go add a description that boom beautiful here we go that image is just out of control right now okay that image is overflowing everywhere so all good now we just need to figure out how to control that image okay and uh we'll do that now by styling so inside of my description let's add padding 0 by 16 pixels overflow let's make it hidden foreign let's go like that okay let's make it a little bit darker cool all right and then we're gonna go and text align it to the left now you can't see that much right now but now you'll see it okay there we go so save boom that's where my description is that's what you should be seeing right now but really the thing we need to style is that image so let's control that so first of all let's give it a little bit of margin from the top there so now it has a little separation between the word text and the image itself let's give it a width of a hundred percent cool so again it's still crazy but we'll control it in a second let's go here let's go display block cool let's go position relative all right and then background color okay all right and then let's control the image inside of this tag so let's go image object fit contain so still the image should be pretty much out of control with 100 percent and finally the image is starting to come into control so let's put a semicolon here semicolon here and beautiful so now it actually looks like a legitimate post right description title info date if I go full screen I have description here so now this is looking like an actual post that is great that's what we want all right so now it's looking like an actual image right it looks good so let's keep on going with this and now add social counts underneath here right so for example how many likes does this image have how many upvotes does it have and reactions and things like that kind of like in the finished version I can see that there are 75 reactions that I have zero comments how many likes comments shares send all of that cool so um let's go ahead and add all of those things in now so what I'm going to do is I will go and underneath underneath my shared image component so let's go right underneath that and I'm going to add my social counts component okay that's what we're going to call it let's go ahead and create our list and then inside of it we'll make a button and inside of that button I'm going to add my image okay and uh these images are again we're going to give you access to all these images but this is um gonna be an image that I kind of just pulled all right it's an online it's a URL all right what I'm going to do is I'm just going to download this image so it's less annoying for you guys let's see um is there an easy way to actually download this image though there's no easy way to download that image so actually let's just use the CDN okay that we have here and let's just stick with that okay so this is the URL for it and again we'll add all of these images inside of the GitHub repo so you can access all of them okay so that's going to give you your like button let's add another image right underneath this okay and uh this is going to be the following URL and uh we'll add that one whoops let's add that one right there this one okay great so now we got these two images okay and this image right here you can go look it up this image is going to be um the Clapping Emoji okay really hard to see I'll have to zoom in quite a bit so you can see it but yeah this is the Clapping one okay so make sure you have that one and underneath this image I want to add in another thing and we'll just add span tag and we'll say 75. as then to say that we have 75 reactions so far okay button cool and right underneath this list ending let's do another one Li and then inside of here we're going to do an a tag again remove the entire ahref and uh we're gonna say one comment okay let's just do two comments like this okay and hit save cool so we got social count inside of here we have a list we have you know one button here now one button has two images and that span cool okay great now let's go ahead and add in The Styling for our social counts component so I'm gonna do con social counts styled unordered list save the error should go away save again go ahead refresh come back cool all right so now I see this um I see 75 reactions thumbs up clapping 75 claps and I see two comments right underneath it okay looks good but let's make it look better okay let me full screen this that's what it looks like right now okay so now we have to do a bunch of styling work to make sure that this looks good so let's add a line height to it about 1.3 okay so that gave it a little breathing room for two comments let's go display Flex all right now they're pushed to the left hand side I'm gonna align items to be to start kind of right at the start so that's good I'm gonna make overflow Auto for this margin let's give it 0 by 16 pixels okay so now it's pushed a little bit from the left hand side padding and then give it a little bit of padding okay good so padding went ahead and right added more of this so now it's nicely centered and looks like we have again more breathing room there border let's give it a border bottom of one pixel solid and give it a give it this color here cool okay looking nice looking nice okay let's give it a list style and we'll go and give it none okay so those two dots that were showing up now are just completely gone and now let's actually select the list and style it so I'm gonna go margin right on this thing and let's go five pixels right we'll go font size 12 pixels cool so now the two comments are small button display Flex cool so it looks pretty freaking good now okay so that gives us our social that we were looking to add okay uh now what I want to do is I want to add social button actions inside of the article okay so now we're going to make it look even better we're going to add the comments button the like one and bunch of them cool so first things first let's go ahead and find them so I have comments comments is going to be that one right there at the top and we have our like icon so that one we have our send icon let's find that boom right there and then of course we have our share icon right there okay let's drag all of them straight into images cool so we got all of those inside of images so now we're good all right so now we got those images and we are gonna now start putting those inside okay so let's go ahead and let's go right under where our social accounts component ends so I'm going to go right underneath here and right there I'm going to add a button and inside of this button I'm going to add an image and this image is going to be my like icon dot SVG cool so now you should see a like button up here on your screen like so great after this let's go actually let's add the button word like next to it too because I think that'll look nice so let's go and let's add in the word like great so now we have a blue button and we have the text that says like cool okay let's go um underneath here and let's add in another button now okay and inside of this let's add an image and let's go images comments Dash icon SVG great so you got the like button and now we got the comment and we'll do a similar thing we'll do span tag and I'm just gonna say comments plural great and now we're going to repeat that okay so I'm going to just copy this button I'm going to paste and paste and where it says comments icon I'm going to share the remove uh replace our share icon and this one I'm going to replace it with send icon so now I have a share icon right here and a send icon right here I'm going to remove this word with the word share and I'm going to replace this word with the word send great that's what we have here I have a full screen this looks freaking great looks amazing okay but we still need to make it look better so let's go ahead and do that now so I'm gonna go and create a new component okay the one that we called social actions all right so let's go all the way to the top okay so right underneath so right underneath social accounts I'm going to make a new component called social action so I'm going to wrap all these buttons inside of social actions okay so let's go ahead and do that so I'll go social um let's do it like this social actions let's copy that and let's go right outside of this and paste it so all the stuff that we added let's put it inside of social actions like so okay now it's gonna complain hey I don't know but this thing is all good let's go and do and uh and describe the style component so we'll do con social actions is equal to and I want to do styled div a okay refresh here we go they're right there okay and now let's go ahead and do the following let's go align items and I'm gonna align them centrally cool display Flex because I like enabling Flex mode on here right I'm gonna give it a margin of zero Min height of 40 pixels there we go let's give it a little padding for by eight pixels like that and then I'm going to make a button appear on this or style button not make a button appear on this what the heck am I talking about and let's do inline Flex on this thing great let's align these items centrally cool padding let's go eight pixels looking great okay give it a little blue so now they actually look very clickable and then um I want to add a media query but only 2D buttons okay nothing else so I'm going to do the following let's add our media query and I'm going to say Min with so this is going to be the other way this is going to say only do this on desktop mode so you're not going to see anything change right now okay this is saying only on desktop only on something bigger than a mobile device that's what that means it's the inverse of Max width and I'm going to say give it a margin left of 8 pixels okay you're not going to see a difference but let's go full screen here all right and so you see the like icon and you see the distance between the like emoji and the and the like text all right now on the actual mobile device they're much closer together okay if I actually comment this line out and we full screen it notice that they're much closer together okay so that difference only takes place on a desktop great so so far so good you should be up to Here and Now our posts are starting to take shape and we are liking it all right you dirty boys and girls let's keep rocking and rolling so we're having fun so far having fun so far you're enjoying yourself but now we're gonna do redones and that's gonna slap you in the face fun time is over get ready to get spanked actually you might like Redux okay so hang in there and enjoy it with me come on let's go so let's get to the Redux part okay so first things first we gotta install Redux how do we do that command J open the command line okay and um what I'm gonna do is just for a second I'm gonna stop my server by doing control C okay um on Windows it might be something else but just control C should work all right and I will simply do yarn add you can do npm install okay it's the same thing yarn add and I'm gonna do react Redux like so and I'm going to hit enter and so now it's going to install react Redux and then I'm gonna also install just Redux by itself yarn add and we're going to do Redux like so so go ahead and install both of those beautiful packages my beautiful person okay great now that that's done we're gonna go ahead and wrap the entire app in a Redux store so let's go to index.js okay and um simply go at the top and right underneath here we're going to do the following I'm going to import provider prover provider from react Redux cool and then the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to import store from store okay um yeah so we have to still of course create a store which we're gonna do soon all right so don't freak out but we're gonna be creating a store soon okay but yeah this is what all I want you to add for now and then let's go underneath and what I'm gonna do is a few things instead of right underneath so this app here right we want to wrap this app inside of our provider now okay so let's go provider and store and we're going to give it our store that we have okay and uh wrap the app inside of that provider that's all cool that's all cool if you try to run your app right now and you're running into an error don't worry it's because we haven't made the store file yet okay so we're gonna go ahead and make that store file so let's go ahead and do that all right so uh let's go to our reducers and let's make the reducers first okay so I'm gonna go ahead and make a reducer let's do it like this so in my source I'm going to create a new folder and it's going to be called reducers okay and inside of reducers what I'm going to do is I'm going to make index.js okay great and um what all I'm going to do here is I'm going to say import combine reducers okay and we're going to import that from Redux and let's also do import user reducer from whoops user reducer like this and I'm going to say make root reducer equal to combined reducers that's a cool thing about some of the Redux stuff that we're doing okay and we're going to say user reducer like that okay so this is going to allow us to combine the reducer so it's going to be helpful now let's make another file inside of our reducers folder and this is going to be called user reducer like this okay so let's go inside of our user reducer and we're gonna do we're gonna initialize the initial state in here and uh we'll simply make the initial state to be where user is null he's empty or she okay and then we're gonna say user reducer is going to be whatever um in this case the initial state so the by default if you don't pass in anything it's just going to be the initial State and it's also going to take in an action and we're going to do a switch depending on the action type uh default however will be just the thing that Returns the state okay so if I get so here's how this reducer I think about it right user reducer anytime there's a reducer how I think about it really it should be called in my mind a state updater because all a reducer does is it updates a given state so for example if we gave it some type of state it would update it okay otherwise it would just return the existing state so here's just a dumb example if I gave it an array um with an action of um you know if I gave it something with the action of like it'll send a payload and it will hit like here and it will increment it by one okay that's where the switch case will come in okay is the switch case like all right then do the following action where we increment like by one is the switch action type comment uh well then in that case in increment the comment section by one if it's none of those well the default should be hey just return the actual State don't really do anything okay so that's kind of what's happening at a high level all right so now we have both of these made now let's go ahead and of course create our store okay and uh we are going to add our store um we're going to add our store let me actually just see this real quick all right so let's go inside of our um source and in our source we're gonna create a new folder okay and we're just going to call that folder store okay and inside of store I'm going to create a new file and this will be called index.js within this file we're going to do a couple of things we're going to create store and we're going to apply some middleware uh did I write it correctly and then remove it yes knowing me probably did something silly like that apply middleware and of course let's bring it from Redux okay import root reducer from reducers okay and now let's just Define our store and once we do this we're not going to have errors anymore in our app and our app should start uh running okay great so now store is defined we are also exporting store now that we're exporting store we will have access to it inside of our project and in our index.js if I go here we are importing that store and then we're passing it to our provider so technically looking at this we should not have any more errors if you do npm start in my case I'm going to do yarn start you should not have um errors on this thing okay so let me refresh okay so it's saying does not contain a default export and what does not contain a default export it is complaining about what is it complaining about attempted import error dot dot slash reducer does not contain a default export cool so let's go to some of our reducer files and let's see if we're exporting what we want to be exporting ah looks like we're not okay so in our user reducer we're gonna just simply do export default thank you and I'm going to say user reducer or wait am I in user user right now no I'm not I'm an index.js so here we have root reducer so I need to be yeah that would make sense so let's export the root reducer and let's go into our user reducer and let's go and Export default user reducer now we should be uh getting both of those did I misspell int yes I did initial should not be spelled in tissue should be spelled initial so initial is now defined cool now that was just set up okay of Redux and uh there's a pretty good start to it and we're making good progress let's keep going all right guys so just a little note this that you're gonna build is gonna be an example without using Redux toolkit so we wanted to show you what life looks like without toolkit Redux is much harder with that Redux toolkit if you built our Disney plus clone you would have noticed things were much simpler with Redux toolkit it's going to be a little bit harder but I think it's important for you to know this because you might go to a company that's not using the Redux toolkit yet so let's go all right so let's go and now start working on the log in functionality okay so I'm gonna go ahead to my login component do we have one yet actually we don't so let's go ahead and start working on that component now okay so inside of our components oh we do we do my bad cool so inside of our login component we're gonna do a couple of things okay let's go all the way at the end where we're exporting default login um we're not going to need that okay so let's remove that for now actually just leave that for now so we don't have an error but we'll delete that later okay and at the top what I'm gonna do is let's go import connect from react Redux like so okay and uh let's keep going down and what we're going to do here is now we're going to create a map state to props okay that's another one of the annoying things that we had to do before we got Redux toolkit okay but I'll show you how this works as well boom we'll leave that as empty and then we'll also do map dispatch to props okay and then let's go ahead and do this cool okay again just hang in with me I promise the more you do repetition of building things with Redux some more is going to start to make sense but it's kind of like one of those things that you kind of get the AHA moments all at once and also pattern recognition is key key key to understanding these things okay so don't get discouraged the first time you see this because it's gonna freak you out now let's go export default and I'm gonna do export default connect and we're going to do map state to props and I'm going to do map dispatch to props to props like that okay and then I'm also going to do login like this okay so freaking weird right but there we go okay that is gonna allow us to export login as well cool okay so we're good so far now what we need to do is we actually need to start installing a couple of things all right now let's go ahead and start installing a couple of other things we're going to need so we're going to need Redux thunk and we're gonna need a Firebase okay so let's go ahead and install these things now so I'm going to hit I'm going to click on my command line I'm going to hit Ctrl C to stop the server now hit enter just a couple of times and then I'm just going to do yarn add again you can do npm install but I'm just going to do yarn add and I'll do Firebase like so so now start installing Firebase and once that's done we're going to install something else okay we're gonna install Firebase tools because you're going to need those so I'm going to do yarn add Firebase tools that's the second thing you're going to need to install and then after that we're going to need one more thing to install all right now and then last one we're going to need is yarn add and I'm going to do Redux thunk Redux Dash thunk okay so we're gonna make sure that we have that so those are the three things we're gonna install make sure you don't miss on any of these because these are going to be important okay and then of course we're gonna need access to our Firebase config files so let's go ahead and get them now all right now so here's what I want you to do go to Firebase okay firebase.com so let's just go together firebase.com like so hit um here I'm just gonna go to the email that I prefer and then hit go to console okay and here you're gonna see all these clones uh free I mean you might not see any of them this is my Firebase so for you you might have to do add project okay and you might want to do LinkedIn clone I'm just gonna call It Dummy clone but you should call it LinkedIn clone like this okay so dummy Linked In clone like so hit continue um you don't need anything else and then they'll say creating your project and that's good okay that's kind of what you want and I'll show you what you need to do after that looks so beautiful right look at that UI beautiful just circling around all right so let's hit continue on that thing and then let's keep on rocking and rolling um okay so I already have a project created so I'm gonna get out of this one now and I'm gonna go to the other project that I have okay so I'm gonna switch to my LinkedIn clone you just stay in that exact one okay and here I'm gonna pull go to Project settings okay and we're gonna get the things that we need here so go all the way to Firebase SDK snippet click config and then get all of the details for your app that you need okay so I'm just gonna copy all of these details copy let's go back to our app okay and let's start working on our app so what I'm going to do now all right and just in case you were not able to find this code right let's kind of walk through it together so I'm gonna switch to my clone the the dummy one that I was building alongside with you okay and now it might say there are no apps in your project so what I want you to do is click that code button right here go ahead and do that now and now inside of here just call it the same thing we could call it LinkedIn Dash clone okay and then just hit Register App for now okay and now it's gonna give you all of the code that you need okay so then just simply grab grab don't grab the script tags but you can just grab everything that's inside of that like VAR okay and just copy it cool great so that's all you need to do on your end all right I'm going to switch back to my other project that I had made and I'm gonna grab everything from there all right now what I want you to do is go ahead inside of your source and right click on your Source folder and make a new file and I'm going to call it firebase.js okay and inside of here I want you to do import Firebase from Firebase like that and then just go ahead and paste your config okay and in your config you should have the API key you should have the auth domain project ID storage bucket messaging sender ID app ID and measurement ID okay and it should be called const Firebase config like that cool now I'm going to just do a couple of things after this so Firebase app and I'm going to initialize this app like this and pass in the Firebase config cool that'll help initialize your app now let's connect your Firebase to your database so let's do Firebase app.firestore okay and let's do const auth actually you know what I'll build mine from scratch with you guys okay so let's let's go to my dummy version here okay and I'll just build this out with you guys because I think that's going to be the best way for you guys to pick this up so let's hit save cool now you and I are gonna be on the same page okay I don't have any unfair Advantage Okay so firestore cons OS um okay this is what we're gonna need this for authentication later let's add that provider newfirebase dot auth dot Google auth provider okay and then let's do storage firebase.storage okay because we need to store our images somewhere all right so that's what we're going to be using storage for and now let's export some of these things so we have access to them outside of here okay and then export default database because we're going to need access to the database as well so this is what your overall Firebase file should be looking like this is going to be very important for all your Firebase uh stuff so make sure that you don't have some funny weird stuff going on here okay all right now let's go inside of our index.js which is inside of our store okay so we have bunch of index.jss now but go inside of your store click on that index.js okay and uh here's the here's what we're gonna do okay now we're gonna add a couple of things to our store okay so let's Hey where's my okay that line was just too far away for me to see let's do import thunk middleware okay from Redux thunk and um also what we're gonna do is now we're gonna start applying the middleware so I'm going to remove this I'm going to say apply middleware and I'm going to pass in sunk middleware like so and we're just going to close that paren and that's it okay that's the change that we're making here so we should be we should be good for now and now what we want to do is like continue adding in the login functionality okay so we're going to now add a couple of more things to our login okay beautiful you're freaking crushing it let's keep on going so we got this now let's make the login functionality work okay and what do I mean by that here's what I mean by that let's if we go to our finalized LinkedIn clone app if I sign out here look what happens if I hit sign in with Google boom right so this popup how is it happening how's that information being stored we're gonna do that and resolve that with Redux okay and Firebase so let's go ahead and work on that functionality now so first things first which one should I work on first let me think okay let's go to Let's actually do this okay so in our source let's make a new folder and we're going to call it actions okay for Redux you have your actions you have your reducers you need all these things okay and uh it's good to put them in different folders so inside of this actions we're going to create a index.js cool and uh in here we're going to import a couple of things I'm going to import auth and I'm going to import provider and um we're gonna get this from Firebase okay and then let's do export function because we're going to need to export this anyway so let's go sign in API that's what it's going to be called and what it's going to do is going to dispatch um auth okay and we're going to do sign in with popup so this is a nice function that comes with Firebase okay so this auth right here is coming from Firebase so sign in with popup like that okay so sign in with popup once Firebase responds with the promise we're going to do dot then okay so we're gonna chain it and we're gonna pass it a payload payload like so oops boom and then inside here I'm just gonna console log the payload okay so we're gonna be able to see that great now let's go here and I'm gonna do dot catch and let's catch any errors that we're getting and then I'm just simply going to alert us of the error message okay so this is what your index.js file should look like right about now okay and now let's go ahead and put it to use all right so now let's go to our login component where we're actually going to use this sign in thing okay so login dot JS and uh let's start with importing that little method that we made sign in API if from that okay so that'll import it and now what we're going to do is inside a form where we had Google form now all we're going to do to this component and we're going to say hey on click we want you to do something here's what we want you to do we want you to run that function so we're just going to do props.sign in okay that's it okay so let's go ahead and do this okay and we're gonna go down and this is where Redux gets funky but just hang in there with me okay and I'll show you how we do this so all the way at the end right here for the Redux portion we're gonna add this kind of right below our export default and let's go ahead and do map dispatch to props actually we're doing that already so let's just stay in here boom right there okay dispatch and this is the code so let's hit enter and get inside of here and we're going to say sign in okay and what that's going to do is that's going to dispatch our method sign in API okay so this sign in here right corresponds to where we're doing props.signin okay so now those things are connected and again think of Redux Like This Global store okay where when the user logs in it passes the user login information and stores it there on the front end it's kind of like having a database on the front end that you can access really really fast that's how I think about Redux and State Management tools all right awesome so now we got all of this that's looking good now let's actually start dispatching these actions um to the stores after integrating it with Google auth so we're going to start adding the Google Google auth into uh integration very very soon okay so first of all here's what I want to do let me go to my Firebase okay and uh what I'm going to do to my Firebase is let's go to authentication inside of my Firebase and under my authentication so let's go to our Firebase app and then inside of our app what we're going to do is uh let's go ahead to our authentication and then just go and click get started cool now inside of get started what we're going to do is hit where it says Google for provider and just hit enable and that's essentially it okay just give it your email whatever your email wait give me a weird email but whatever that should be good okay so now your Google should be enabled another weird uh thing uh by the way is if you are on some type of different Firebase website there you might have uh you might not see what I see here you might see something completely different so what you want to do in that case is actually you want to hit where it says build okay for some of you might say build click that and then click authentication underneath that that'll bring you to your authentication okay okay so now let's go ahead and start trying things and trying to break through things and let's see what happens okay so I'm gonna go to my actual app and on my app instead of home let's delete that and let's just go to the you know localhost 3000 now it's might say the site can't be reached well no problem I'm just gonna hit yarn start you can in your terminal hit npm start and you should be good to go okay so now uh we're gonna click uh oh my middleware is not defined oh okay interesting so let's go to my store my index.js inside of my store okay and in here I'm probably capitalizing it somewhere middleware and let's make it lowercase okay all right there we go all right I'm sorry Frankie Frankie's building it out with me to help test it by the way shout out to Frankie guys Frankie's been here Frankie popping Frankie's been here and Tess running and doing the entire build actually with us so he can make sure that this is actually running perfectly for you guys okay so drop some love for Frankie in the comments below cool let's keep going now let's hit sign in with Google and Frankie says it's working for him oh it's working that's cool right that's so freaking cool let's set content cleverprogrammer.com nice okay great so let's open up inspect and let's see if the payload is inside of our console and it looks like it is okay so hit inspect go to console and do you see where it says object now click the drop down on the object so you guys should see user right here Okay now click under user did you uh did you click the drop down now keep scrolling down and you'll actually see display name you'll see email and you'll see email verified yeah okay great and if you keep scrolling down you'll actually even see things like Photo URL do you see that now if you double click into the photo URL um actually can I select that copies so right click and copy string okay and now open a new tab and paste that string you should see your photo like this okay and that should tell you that your um your app is like actually pulling the payload from the sign in right so like where is that payload statement let's just go ahead and search let's go console there's like only one place we're actually doing console log um and it's inside of our uh oops not mean to do that we're doing this inside of our user reducer it seems like no no I'm sorry why am I I'm being freaking crazy we're it's what's right here not inside of our user user we're using it inside of our actions index.js and we're console logging so the payload is actually what Firebase gives us back it's this object that's the payload that gets dropped uh every time we log in so we'll be able to use that payload to pull the photo and pull the name and email and all of that good stuff okay so granted we're able to get everything that we need right granted we're able to get everything that we're looking for we still need a way to actually store that information right we still need a way to store that information so that's what we're gonna do and web the website and things still need to change uh based on the user logging in okay because it shouldn't keep saying sign in with Google the whole time that would not make sense all right so let's go ahead and start setting things up so first thing I'm going to do is inside of actions I'm going to make a new file and this file is going to be called action type.js okay and I'm going to do something very simple I'm just going to say export const set user equals set user okay that's all set user equals string set user that's it all right now let's go inside of let's see which file should I work on first let's go ahead inside of our user reducer now okay that's inside of our reducer so for example just click reducer then go to user reducer you should be there now we're gonna do a couple of things here inside of our switch case so depending on what type of action we get so if we get a case where we're setting a user what we're going to do is we're going to return whatever the state was previously and then add in our new user okay so the state is going to be updated just by one thing now it's complaining hey use uh set user is not defined well no worries let's go all the way at the top and let's import it so import set user okay from foreign type like that cool so now it won't be giving us an error anymore our app should actually be working so we're good with the user reducer for now now let's go inside of our index.js all right and now let's go to our index.js okay and in our index.js all I'm going to do and sorry wrong index.js my bad let's go inside of our actions index.js right here and now all I want to do inside of my payload instead of using console.log we're going to dispatch the user dispatch means send that information out shoot it okay whenever I think dispatch I think of like the Olympics um um what is it called referee shooting gun right so it's like whenever the starting pistol no not that that's like two of crazy starting pistol okay holy crap this just got crazy uh Sprint Jesus that's what I think of whenever I think of dispatching actions so like whenever we dispatch actions from the stores like like tell the entire store we're where um the user has logged in okay man got crazy so this is who you are when you're dispatching actions is this an actual gun I don't know if they have they don't have real guns right at the Olympics okay so let's go inside so in our index.js here now let's just make a couple of changes okay first of all we're gonna import from the top import set user like so and I'm going to do from action type okay that's good now let's also export cons set user this is going to help us set the user and it's going to take in a payload whoops it's going to take in a payload and that's going to be type set user and then the user is gonna be the payload okay whatever the payload is gonna be cool all right so that's good import is looking fresh and now we're just gonna dispatch the action here instead of console logging it's a dispatch set user and payload user just like so okay save okay so now with all three of those things done hopefully that information is actually being stored inside of Redux let's hit sign in with Google and I'm gonna go ahead and sign in cool so we'll be able to see later if this information is actually being stored or not all right so now let's redirect our user to home page on login so I'm going to go to login and inside of my container right at the beginning here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say the following I'm gonna say hey if we got a user going on okay then what I want you to do is I want you to redirect to okay and what we'll do is uh let me write redirect and hit enter so I'll import it from react router okay importing that from react router just like that cool and what I will say is redirect me to the home page cool now let's end that bad boy like that beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful very very clean line and it says hey if the user is there redirect me now all we need to do to make this magic work is let's go all the way to the bottom and um what I'm gonna do is right above map dispatch to props let's just add it here actually inside of map state to props we can do this okay we can do this right here so where it says return which is empty we're going to say user state to state dot userstate dot user so that's who the user is going to be and look at that it is already redirecting us how freaking cool is that you fools if I go to home page okay let's hit sign in with Google hopefully it works let's see hopefully it breaks and breaks my heart whoa whoa smash the like button if you enjoyed that one that was really clean okay I'm loving this man are you guys loving this I hope you're loving this okay this is awesome all right now Redux is kind of crazy so before we move on I just want to explain some of this stuff here okay so let's go back to our home page or not our homepage but our login page right this signin popup this just this one line of code makes that popup happen that is insane okay so that's just that one line of code that's making that popup happen then this line of code is telling the app hey this is the user information so I'm dispatching this action when I dispatch this action I sended this function called set user okay and I give it the payload of the user so remember what is payload.user do you guys remember that when I did um let's actually do this right now so I'm going to console log console log and I'm just going to do payload here okay and what I'm going to do here is comment this line out and let's hit refresh now I'm going to hit sign in with Google and let's hit inspect okay on the right hand side and I'm gonna go to whoops not sources console okay and I'm gonna click sign in right there now an object just appeared okay and it's giving me this information about the user okay now the user information is the one I want right so now watch this now I'm gonna do payload dot what user right so now watch what happens if I hit save and I hit uh refresh okay and let's go sign in with Google and I'm gonna hit Causey cleverprogrammer.com I'm just gonna get the information pertaining to the user that's it so I'm not meeting my display name and I'm getting my email and I'm getting all of that right so that's what payload.user actually is so that object we're sending over to this method over here that's a set user so set user takes a payload the payload was all of the user details now this is typeset user and user we set it to whatever the payload was okay that's kind of what's Happening um that's kind of what's Happening Here okay and let's go to set user boom okay this is it's all freaking connected okay now if I go inside of my reducers and I go inside of my user reducers when it sees the case that I'm trying to set the user it takes my existing state and it just adds the new user to it and if the state doesn't change it just Returns the default state of whatever it was before that user was there that's it okay and remember Redux is immutable so I'm not mutating this okay I'm creating a brand new state with whatever the previous state was along with the new one user that I've added okay so a little bit of just explaining behind the scenes of what's happening with Redux so now what we're going to do is we're going to take the user authentication info when the authentication is changed okay and store it okay so for example when I log in I want to like store that information and have access to it okay anytime I'm like refreshing or getting that information so let's go ahead and work on that now so inside of my actions and index.js what I will do underneath here is uh let's make another function okay and let's call it user auth like so get user auth okay this is what's going to get the authentication info and uh let's start it off with dispatch cool and I'm gonna do this is something that comes from Firebase so on off stay changed do me a favor and run this asynchronously okay you're going to take a user as an input and if user meaning if the user exists or is logged in or whatever dispatch set the user set the user to user okay so that looks good now let's go inside of our app uh JS file and we're going to add all of this here so um let's go ahead and do that okay so first of all I'm gonna need to I'm going to need to do a couple of things and for those things we're gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of walk you through all of this okay so first of all right at the start here okay function app um let me think let's have it and take props like that okay and then inside of here I'm actually gonna throw in my use effect uh hook so let's go use effect and uh let's hit enter whoops use effect okay there's tons of boilerplate that comes uh with a lot of this stuff but okay so use effect this is how we write it in here okay so I'm going to say props Dot get user auth cool and then here it's not going to really have any dependencies for now cool okay so now it's gonna start telling us hey we're erroring out so let's go ahead and import react hooks so import use effect like so all right so that's now going to import this use effect good use effect does not define interesting should be defined okay so now it's saying get user auth is not a function so we're going to go ahead and import that as well import get user auth okay from actions okay so now we got that as well it's good cool so now of course it's saying it's not a function but we're going to go ahead and take care of that okay so let's go ahead inside um you know just get inside of app.js hopefully you're there and now let's go all the way to the bottom and we're going to need to do those map to props type of things okay this is very common thing we have to do with the Redux if you're using it without toolkit it's annoying but has to be done okay so we're gonna do that now right after take out this fat ass wallet from my pocket so let's go ahead and do this the map state to props like so and we're going to do state and let's go like this and we're going to return squigglies like that okay then let's do const map dispatch to props okay we're gonna do this is gonna take in something to dispatch and uh get user auth and this is actually what's going to start defining your function okay and we're going to say dispatch get user auth function okay and then what we're going to do is I'm going to remove this export default line we're going to export default I'm going to say connect okay we're also going to need access to this connect we're going to import it later I'm going to do map state to props and I'm going to do map dispatch to props and then let's just do app okay now we're gonna need to import connect so let's go ahead and import connect um from Redux okay import connect my bad from from react Redux cool so that's imported now what's the error let's see identifier connect has already been declared oh my bad I'm declaring uh getting it too many times it's already right here cool we got connect now it's your expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression line 37 and 16. cool so let's see okay let's wrap that in parentheses so it's an expression okay don't need that there okay so now that should be good should be good should be good that allows us to get the user info hopefully they're not getting any errors and now we are on the same page beautiful okay so the other annoying thing that I realize guys is um remember my image was not showing up the jobs add one or whatever this one just kept not showing up I looked at my console and it was getting blocked by client for whatever reason so what I decided to go ahead do is like copy that image and open a copy link address open that right here right and then what what you can do if you're having the same problems hit save image as okay and go to that same folder you have everything right so for example for me GitHub Banger projects LinkedIn clone uh public images inside of that images folder I just decided to call it jobs ad.jpg okay um and then I hit save so then it showed up as an image right there okay and then I went to my right side component because that's where it was supposed to show up and it just was like never showing up okay so in the right side component in order for it to show what I did is I went to my banner card and um instead of having that static link I just changed it with the actual image okay so how you can do that is simply go and select this slash Images slash jobs at jpeg hit save and then uh this is what you should see okay so go ahead and do that that'll take care of that other problem that we were having earlier okay and so if somebody wants to be helpful please drop the time stamp to when this problem was first introduced okay and then um you know and just say this is the bug fix for that so if somebody's looking for it that'll be really really helpful thank you now let's go ahead and display the user photo once the user is logged in so I'm going to go inside of headerjs and let's go to where we have user which is user component okay so this user component right here okay so where that says me we're going to replace that with an image of me okay the image that I get from Google authentication all right so here's how that's gonna go I'm gonna go right underneath this a tag cool and uh right underneath this a tag what I'm gonna do is open up your squiggly okay and um let's be careful where we put everything okay so squiggly let's do it this way I'm in the wrong place okay remove that quickly and remove that a needs to be inside of user okay what did I do what did I do I'm sorry I'm confusing you okay leave work alone leave work alone so it should have that a tag in there you're good you don't need to touch work we're trying to touch user I don't know why I decided to go under work probably I've just been coding for so long I'm losing my eyesight a little bit so bear with me here okay I'm just a human being relax so right over here what I'm going to do is uh let's add a squiggly here okay like that okay so the squiggly opens up here but here's where we're gonna close it so remove the closing one and I'm gonna close it right above this span just like that okay that is um that is perfecto okay that's the right spot for me to close it cool so now let's go ahead and make this work so inside of this squiggly we're gonna do a couple of things okay I'm gonna say props dot user so if the user is logged in and exists I want the following to happen props.user.photo URL okay so if that URL exists then I want um the following to happen okay so I'm going to make an image tag here and in this image tag for source what I'm going to say is this okay and you can remove the quotes because this is going to evaluate to a string anywhere once it's done so I'm going to say props dot user.photo URL okay and let's end that cool and then I'm going to say colon so like this okay now this looks really intimidating and confusing but let me explain first hey is the user logged in yes they are they exist great then look for their photo URL does that exist question mark if it exists then show their photo then I have this ternary operator right there if it doesn't exist show a generic user photo capiche that's what's happening there another thing why my thing looks funny why my this me part with the drop down sign looks funny is because the drop down is not inside of the span so let's go ahead and uh close that and sandwich that in the span okay so again span should have the word me in it and the drop down image in it okay so make sure to go ahead and do that and once you do that what's gonna happen is now your photo and your me with the drop down looks freaking great okay that's what should happen alright so that's looking good now what we need to do is make sure our dispatch is happening because right now um our app does not know about the image so it needs access to the store and we need to dispatch that action okay so then it's going to have access to the photo so anyways long story short let's go all the way to the bottom and let's go ahead and do map state to props like so state whoops okay state and then inside of here we're going to return user state.user state DOT user and knowing boilerplate code okay that's map state to props now we also need map dispatch to props and let's go dispatch like this let's leave it empty for now we don't really have anything going on in here just yet and then this last line where it says export default header remove that line so we're going to delete that line and we're just going to do export default connect and you guys know the drill we're going to connect map state to props like so then we're going to do map dispatch to props and then we're gonna do header like this okie dokie Mr Pokey okay so that is pretty good for now let me actually just see if we need to change any additional things at the top should we import connect yes we did import connect so that's looking good so far okay great so it is working uh in order to be able to see it first of all it's at the bottom right you should be seeing your logged in photo because I'm logged in and you should be seeing your logged in photo at the bottom right if you're logged in and at the top right you should actually be seeing it if in desktop mode okay so you should be seeing your photo cool amazing okay now what we want to do is uh add the ability to sign out so when I hover over assign um me right if I hit sign out I cannot sign out so let's add that ability so um let's go and start off bye first of all inside of actions we're now going to create a new file actually no let's not create a new file let's just go inside of our index.js so in here remember we added the sign in functionality and the get user auth functionality so let's go underneath that and let's add the sign out functionality now so let's do export function sign out API okay and then let's do return dispatch just like this all right inside of this dispatch all we're going to do is uh we're gonna do auths.sign out and again this comes built in with Firebase okay that's why Firebase is so nice and then we're going to dot then okay leave that empty and we're going to do dispatch set user to null okay so we're going to run that function we're going to set the user to null okay that's going to remove any user that's existing and then I'm going to do that catch any errors um and if there are any errors just simply console log them in this case great so this is what your sign out API should be looking like right now okay so continuing on with our functionality now we're gonna do just a few things okay so let's go to our um when we sign out so let's think about this right when we sign out we need to be redirected back to the home page right just like when we sign in we need to be redirected back let me fix that when we sign out we need to be redirected to the login page just like when we sign in we're redirected to the home page okay so we're gonna work on that um that was Nas say hi to NAS everybody behind me beautiful so we're going to add that redirect in just a second but first let's start off with the functionality so I'm going to go to my header okay and let's first of all import the sign out functionality that we made okay so let's import sign out API okay and where are we gonna import that from well you know where we're going to import that from from our actions where we just finished making it okay in the index.js so now this will actually import it okay why is saying module is not found dot slash actions oh my bad dot dot slash actions there we go okay because I'm inside of headers which is inside of components so I need to back out first and then I have access to this actions folder okay gotta back out then boom hence the two dots right there cool okay so now inside of my sign out let's find that so sign out is right there and uh to just sign out all I'm going to say is they on click I want you to do something for me okay and sign out it's gonna be like hey what do you want me to do well on click um I want to actually sign out okay I want to call the sign out method now remember because we're using Redux you can't just normally make this work because that would make too much sense unfortunately so in Redux you do things always in a really obnoxious boilerplate method thank you Dan abramov and the founder of Redux so I'm gonna go to my dispatch to props and in here all I'm gonna do is we're gonna add in sign out and what signout is going to do is dispatch and we're going to use our method that we created earlier dispatch sign out API okay so that should already be pretty good okay so let's go ahead and see if that does anything or not so sign out whoa it actually worked did you guys see the photo change that's freaking amazing so let's actually go back to our home page and let's test this out let's hit sign in and it should redirect us to the home page when I sign in so boom let me choose my email okay it redirected me and look my photo is of the logged in user that photo is being pulled straight from Firebase now if I hover over and click sign out it signed me out and the photo is gone but what should happen when I sign out I need to be redirected back to the login page so let's just go ahead and add that last bit of functionality and how we're going to do that is let's start off by going to our home page and inside of our home page I need to make sure that I import my redirect okay from react router Dom because that's what allows me to manipulate the Dom and manipulate which Pages I'm at I also need to import connect because I'm going to need that for this from react Redux and again this is Redux without toolkit okay so this is why you still have to do mappings and connects okay now inside of my container right over here here's what I'm gonna do all right we're just going to add that right there and I'm going to say hey if the user is not logged in or there is no user then what I want you to do in that case is redirect me too the home page or I'm sorry I keep saying the home page but the login page in this case okay and of course we want to close this so let's go ahead and do that Okay cool so now when I sign out it actually brings me back to the home page okay and last things I want to do in order to make sure that that happens and my store knows about it here's what I need to do because that functionality is still not necessarily working we're going to do map state to props and I'm going to let the state know about hey user update the user State like so and I'm going to delete this line and we're going to do export default and this is what we've been doing with Redux every single time so connect and map state to props and we're just going to leave it to that because we don't need to dispatch any actions in this case and of course at home just like this okay so now refresh so now watch what happens okay I'm gonna sign in with Google now it should update my photo at the bottom right now let me full screen it real quick full screen hover over let's click sign out and boom that works that is nice right when I sign out it actually brings me back straight to the home page okay so hopefully you're enjoying this so far and now we're gonna start displaying the username right next to um right next to our user profile okay user image all right so here we go so now we're gonna actually add the user display username on the left hand side okay so um and we're gonna do that right there okay where it says welcome rafikaze that's kind of what we're gonna do in our own app okay so first of all just let's just log in so it redirects us to the home page beautiful that looks good okay but now it says welcome there well it should know who we are so it shouldn't say there it should actually say our name now so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go to my left side component that I have and then where we have this link this is where we need to change it okay and here's how we're going to do that so I'm going to say it props that User it's going to get me access to the user and remember display name this is what should get me access to the name um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to basically be like hey if the user exists Okay so props.user if the user exists this is a nice fancy ternary operator that says then show me the username otherwise show me blank okay or I can just say show me well uh there okay so that way it says there for now and then if the user will be there it'll say their name instead cool well why is it not getting the name you might ask well what we're gonna have to do is tell Redux about it so this is where we need to map state to props so let's do cons map state to props like this open this bad boy up and again we're going to return user state DOT user state dot user like this okay let's refresh okay and we're gonna go ahead and connect it now to our component all right so let's go here boom import connect like this from react Redux so now we have this imported that's great let's go all the way down there's a lot of lines of code in there remove this and we're going to do export default connect map state to props and we'll just do left side like this okay again we're not doing any dispatching here we're only doing reading and retrieving all right so now rafikaze is being read hey that's amazing right let me go home rafikaze if I log out it should basically be uh nobody okay cool slash home doesn't even let me go to home okay when I log in it lets me go to home so that's really good my authentication it seems like it's working really well and things are good now we're going to start working on the modal okay so let's go ahead to main.js file and instead of post Malone we're going to be working on post modal huh so congratulations all right post modal there we go you like that one nice all right and uh pretty much what I'm gonna do is right underneath where article is ending and there's a div ending right underneath the article let's go underneath that div and I'm going to add the post modal okay and you'll be like hey Kazi hey Kazi were you importing the pulse model from that's a really good question it doesn't exist yet so we need to go ahead and make it so inside of components I'm going to create a new file it's going to be called postmodal.js okay and now we're going to start working on this model and it's going to be nice so let's start off with styled from style components because we're going to need to style this thing and of course let's go ahead and go it's gonna get some props okay there's as arguments and um I'm gonna create a new component inside of here it's going to be a container and I'm just going to say pulse modal for now let's hit refresh it's still complaining well that's because I have to export default post modal and now it should stop complaining soon okay it goes hey I don't know what container is no worries I'm going to const container and let's actually go styled div and leave it as an empty cool so now all the errors are gone and we're back to an operational app which is exactly what we want now inside of our container we're going to style it so I'm going to say position position fixed okay where is our model I'll show you our model will be available for us shortly okay let's go top zero for the modal let's go left zero okay and um we're gonna start seeing it soon hopefully I'm as surprised as you when we see it just kidding all right bottom zero okay so that allows us to put it at the top we're gonna give it a really high Z index okay so you just kind of you can kind of do that that will make sure that it's always on top of things so now you're starting to see it post modal okay and now zero zero zero zero it means zero on the left axis xaxis yaxis and uh that's what you end up getting when you go zero zero so what this does here by the way right is this zero zero zero you're wondering what it does so hit come here and inspect the element now when I inspect it look the modal is actually over the entire screen okay and uh if I actually change this to 10 pixels or let's go 50 pixels so something visible from the top it's pushing it down but notice now it's not the entire screen so why we do that sometimes zero zero zero zero like that is to kind of in an easy way say hey take over the entire browser okay so this right now is taking over the entire browser and it has a massive Z index so it'll also take over more priority cool so now inside of color I'm going to give it color black and just to kind of show you this right if I actually gave it a background color of let's say black Watch What Happens boom my entire screen is now gone black okay and if I give it a z index of negative 20 now it's hiding behind but you can still see the little black bars on the side okay so that's the index just to make sure that always stays on top of everything else and instead of black of course it's a crazy color to give it right now um we're going to just give it um 0.8 just like this okay that's what's going to happen when the modal opens that's what's going to happen to the entire screen that's what we want okay so then we can see the modal easily so that's how we make that happen cool now last thing we want to do is I mean we're already exporting it and we're using it in main.js right so let's go to our main and we have pulse modal that's how we're getting this cool beautiful and make sure we're imported okay perfect good job so far let's keep rocking and rolling and now we're gonna start adding main content component inside of post modal so let's go to post model and inside of here I'm going to remove where it says post modal okay and I'm going to say content cool inside of content let's just write content for now and leave it pretty blank and we're going to add in a new styled component I'm going to say content with a style div of course empty to just start it off with and we'll give it a width of a hundred percent okay cool all right Max width will give it of 552 pixels so it will never be bigger than that we're going to give it a background color of white so now we can actually start to see this okay cool so we can see that the model is starting to become visible and now what we're going to do is let's give it a let's remove that uh let's actually keep that my bad and let's go and give it a Max height of 90 percent cool overflow will go initial okay and then let's go border radius of 5 pixels okay so now we're starting to have slightly rounded Corners right there we'll go position relative display Flex okay and now let's do Flex Direction column in this case cool well top 32 pixels that pushes it down and we're gonna go margin zero Auto okay so now we have this thing smack in the middle showing up exactly where we want it beautiful so that's all we wanted to do for this and now we're going to add header and post modal component okay so let's go and do that so inside of content I'm gonna remove content and I'm just gonna go header like this thank you cool and inside of here what I want to say is let's go in h add an H2 and we'll do create a post like that right underneath this I'll add a button and inside of this button I'm going to add an image and this image is going to be a close icon.svg okay and now the header is going to say hey I'm not defined well no problem okay and I'll show you how to add a close Icon by the way so the close icon actually is right here it looks like that little X at the top so let's go grab that close icon and drop it inside of our images now you should have access to it okay let's go back to the code that we were on inside of components postmodal.js so we added that image and now we're going to actually create styling for that component so cons header let's start right off with blank and then let's go ahead and start now styling it okay so we now see create a post so that looks pretty good display block I'm going to add padding to it boom now the padding starting to look good I'm going to add a border bottom so I'm going to add a something on the bottom and then lastly we're gonna do this clean let's give it a font size of 16 pixels I'm gonna give it a line height of 1.5 beautiful I'm going to go RGB a on this thing and let's do this cool so it's like a little grayed out now we'll do font weight 400. and then justify actually before we do that let's enable display Flex let's go justify content on this thing and we'll go space between so now that X should springboard over all the way to the right hand side I'm gonna go align item Center dope and then of course let's style the button and I'm gonna go height 40 pixels with 40 pixels great Min with Auto uh color let's do the same thing a little bit of that gray never hurt nobody cool and then SVG hey pointer events make sure that there are none pointer events are none okay cool X cool all right so now we got that big boxy looking um X in the model it's pretty good it's a good start okay let's create shared content and add user info part inside of it okay so let's go to you know we're inside of here now let's make sure content so where am I gonna do that I'm gonna let's do it right underneath this header right here shared content let's go user info let's make another component and inside of here I'm gonna go image slash Images slash user SVG okay this is just gonna be that dummy user in image and for span let's go name okay all right shared content is not defined user info is not defined you guys know the drill right you guys know what we do let's go ahead and start working on this right style div let's leave it empty for now user info style div like that oh refresh okay so now that image is showing up but it obviously looks crazy so we're gonna Now work on it let's enable display Flex to start off things are already starting to look in control display Flex is such magic Flex Direction column Flex grow one overflow y I'm gonna go Auto on this thing vertical align Baseline cool background I'm gonna do transparent okay and then of course padding eight pixels by 12 pixels beautiful great now let's inside of our user info let's go ahead and do a couple of things enable display Flex here I'm going to align my items to the center so I can see that n is in the middle but it's still behind the photo add padding 12 pixels by 24 pixels like so cool and now let's control our SVG and our images and we're going to give them the same type of styling boom boom cool background clip I'm gonna go content box okay border two pixels solid transparent border radius this is going to give it a nice little circle that we always love looking clean and then of course let's go inside of our span and now we're gonna go font wait 600 font size 16 pixels line height 1.5 cool so now the text is looking Bolder and then of course let's give it a little bit of margin because it's getting a little too close to that logo so let's push it a little bit okay beautiful so that looks great to me for shared content right this model is looking good I mean of course we still need to add functionality so when I hit X it actually goes away right and things like that so we're gonna now start adding those things in okay we also need to make sure the text editor is editable so that's going to need um you know quite a bit of work so let's work on that now all right so cool let's start working on the text editor and add in bunch of functionality so I am going to go um in I mean I'm I'm gonna just stay in my post model okay and then um let's add another component and I'm going to add it right underneath shared content so we're going to call it share creation like this and let's just type in some word in there like actions let's go all the way down and I'm going to add a component styling for this styled div hit save just so that error stops display Flex so you guys you should be able to see the actions in there now okay it should be it's right there boom cool now I'm going to do justify content space between cool and then of course padding 12 pixels 24 by 16. cool so now we just added some padding kind of everywhere from every direction so that looks that looks good now we're gonna add creation buttons okay so you might be wondering hey are you getting the creation buttons from here so we're going to have the share image okay that image right there at the top and we're also going to have that image the video image as well so share image share video I'm going to drag this into my images and drop cool so that's going to be there now let's go inside of my um right underneath share creation inside of shared creation I'm going to remove the word actions and instead I'm going to write attach assets okay and let's create a new component called attach assets okay and instead of attach assets let's create a new component called asset button like that and inside of asset button I'm going to add an image and that image is going to be Images slash share.mage.svg cool and then I'm going to have another asset button asset button and inside of that I'm going to have another image that's going to be Images slash sharevideo.svg like so cool now let's go ahead and add this so all the way at the bottom let's do const asset button is equal to styled button okay and I'm gonna do let's do display Flex on this thing um of course it's saying that error so let's actually start that styling too so we we don't have that error anymore styled div okay boom so we got the image here and then we got the video button right there okay that's what we were trying to add so now let's go here and do align items Center height will make it 40 pixels give it a Min width of Auto color I'm gonna go rgba zero zero zero zero point five okay and then under attach assets let's do a line items Center to display flex and let's go padding padding right and I'll go eight pixels on it boom okay beautiful so we got this we got the buttons and we got some styling for for this uh uh acid button at least okay so let's finish up the styling for attach Assets Now okay so I'm gonna go right here and we're gonna use the select this selector here to get our style component called asset button and we're going to style that to be with 40 pixels like this cool so now that should be good okay if I made that 100 pixels it'll be really obvious what happens so if I go 100 pixels like that you can obviously see that just buttons got really long but let's go 40 pixels and they're right there cool so that looks good and now let's add share uh comment component mouthful a little bit of a mouthful all right so let's go find this so share comment it's gonna be this one all right let's drag that into our images folder okay and then let's go to our post modal and inside of our post model let's make that work so where am I doing share comments so let's go underneath attach assets okay so let's go outside of attach assets all right let's go now share comment like that and then inside of share comment I will add um let me do it like this you could see the entire time let's just do asset button asset button like that and inside of this asset button I'm going to add an image and this image is going to be the following slash Images slash share comment dot SVG cool and then we'll just write anyone here okay so now you see this button up here but now let's wrap that new button that we made inside of share comment component okay so I'll go here go here and paste it okay so this is what it should look like share common component now it's going to complain about share comment component but you and I we don't worry about that because we know this we go ahead and create the style component like this keep it blank and then let's add some padding left okay let's go ahead and let's go and add margin right Auto cool let's go border left one pixel solid rgba this cool so now you're seeing this border right this thin little border that's being there let's go ahead make a dollar sign I'm gonna say asset button select asset button and inside of that button any svgs we have let's give it a margin right of five pixels cool so that looks good the share comment component it's kind of done now let's add the post button and how I'm going to do it is like this so let's go right underneath the share comment and let's add in the button right here okay so I'm gonna go post button and let's just say post now let's go ahead and add that to our styling so I'm going to do cons post button is equal to styled button cool so again start off with empty and now that button is there I can see it Min with 60 pixels cool border radius 20 pixels I like how it's looking padding left 16 pixels cool let's add some padding right by 16 pixels okay so now it's made it a little bit bigger background like this okay give it a little blue we'll color it white okay and then on Hover so I'll do this on Hover we're going to give it a background of that right there cool so when I hover boom just a little bit extra blue click it and I can press it okay beautiful all right so now that we added that post button let's remove the remove close button image okay and we're gonna do some stuff with being able to hide it and show it so when we hit X we want things to be able to happen Okay so let's go and work on that now okay and um I was gonna work on the text editor earlier but let's go and work on it now okay so let's go ahead and work on the text editor cool so no worries in post modal what I'm gonna do is all the way at the top okay let's go import use State like this okay let's use react States because we're gonna need to work with State now and uh let's just let's start so here I'm going to say editor text and then we're going to do set editor text so this is going to be a function that allows us to change the text all right that's kind of how you also set variables in react the react way of setting variables and we're going to start off with it being blank okay so the functionality we're working on now is this one so when I hit start a post this modal pops up the text in the start is blank and then as I start typing it it updates the text so we're going to do that in our app that's not built yet cool so let's go underneath user info okay so underneath user info I'm going to make my editor component and uh editor component is going to take in the text area actually let's before I make my editor component let's leave it blank let's start off with uh just doing text area like this um cool I'm going to remove just go ahead and remove all of this for now all right and what I will say is inside of text area let's add something for value so we're going to make value be the editor text so whatever the state of the text is okay so right now it's not really going to be doing much so when I type it doesn't do anything it just kind of freezes that's what should be happening with yours okay then after text I want to do on change I want something to happen okay and what do I want to happen on change I want to take let's go like this I'm gonna take whatever the value you're giving me and I want to set it to the editor text so I'm going to do e.target.value so whatever you're typing okay it's complaining e is not defined okay not to worry we're going to take care of that shortly okay so we have on change and we have the on change ending right there cool let's go ahead and add the placeholder as well in just a second all right just make sure you refresh as soon as you refresh you should be good to go and all that's happening is as soon as I do I type in F in the text area now it calls this on change okay it goes on change what should I do on change says hey grab the event okay what was the event I wrote this thing so now what we do is we change the editor text variable's value which was blank in the start with whatever the target value is in this case that's f so now this editor text here becomes F and then it shows F now I'm going to write f e it becomes f e it passes that here that passes that here and then that shows that there super confusing but that's what's happening okay and then if I hit post I have access to all of that information so now let's do placeholder whoops let's not do that placeholder okay and then my place was giving me what do you want to talk about cool so if you remove everything that's the that's what the placeholder will be and of course let's also do Auto Focus to be true okay so as far as my text areas can concerned that's looking good now what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create my styled component I'm going to do this one the other way so let's go ahead and create a style component called editor and do style div okay and I'm going to and I'm going to style it in just a second let's go and add let's go and take what we created this text area and we're going to wrap this entire text area inside of our a new component called editor so make sure you cut that and you wrap the text area inside of editor just like this okay now we need to style our editor component okay great let's add some padding and I'll go 12 pixels by 24 pixels like so let's now style the text area inside of this editor let's go with 100 percent gold is Big let's give it a Min height of 100 pixels great do anything yes I made it fat which is exactly what we want and then resize none okay so now so notice this little touch right if I have resize enabled at the bottom right you see this resize and I can resize it to whatever I want right boom it's kind of weird by doing resize none it now there's nothing there's no way to resize this that's what we want let's go here and let's go input with 100 beautiful okay so whatever we're writing here input cool height of 35 pixels cool font size of 16 pixels okay all right and then right underneath it we're gonna go margin bottom 20 pixels okay great our text box looks text box looks absolutely great we're using uh state to do a bunch of stuff and that's good now again let's focus back on being able to open the modal and close the modal this is something very common that you have to do in react and we're going to start working on that now so let's go ahead and get started so where should we get started well the first thing I want to do is um inside of main I'm gonna add the ability to hide and show the modal cool so let's go all the way at the top we're going to import State because we're going to need access to it so use state and I'm going to say from react okay now underneath Main I'm gonna do show modal set show modal like this my bad use State and um default is going to be a closed State okay so by default it's going to be just always closed all right now right underneath here let's add the code to make it um hide and show the model so let's get started on that so I'm gonna do handle click and here's what we're gonna do okay so we're going to start it off by preventing the default Behavior which is important for react so you don't have these weird refreshing things going on when you don't want them okay all right let's go let's stay here outside of our if statement and now I'm gonna just add a little switch statement and I'm just going to say show modal all right and in the case that I get an open what I want you to do is the following I want you to set it to close and then break okay in the other case where it's closed then what I want you to do is I want you to show modal to be open okay and break in the case oh actually otherwise let's just do default set show model to be just closed by default okay and then we'll break right there beautiful so that seems simple enough now let's actually go to the button and add that functionality where's my button user SVG yep so start a post that's where we're gonna add it so let's go on click equals and I'm going to say handle handle click okay great and uh where I have post modal let's scroll down scroll down where I have post modal I'm gonna give it show modal pass at the current state of the modal okay so it's going to take a prop that's show modal prop and we'll add in the functionality for that prop in just a second okay and then the handle click prop it's going to just do handle click actually we're probably just taking in props so we'll probably have to do props dot show modal and props dot handle click so let's go ahead and check that out let's go to pulse modal um dope and inside of my post model I want to do just a few things so right underneath that text that we're editing let's go ahead and do the following I'm gonna do I'm going to create a reset all right and this reset is going to take in an event and it's going to set the editor text to be blank and it's also going to handle click and handle the event okay so I'm going to wrap the whole thing in a jsx fragment all the way down to this container here okay so let's just start off with that and then what I'm gonna do is I'm also going to wrap the entire thing in these squiggly brackets like this cool now within here what I'm going to say is I'm going to say props dot show model equals open if that's true then what I want you to do is show me all of this stuff here okay and what I'm going to do to my button let's go to my where is my creative post create a post right so right underneath that I have a button okay and what to that button I'm gonna do on click on click taking an event okay and call my reset function and give it my give it my event okay that's what I want to happen when I click X so now um oh also let's go all the way down and where do I have my SVG inside of my header const header where's my header styling right there let's also do comma IMG to it okay let's add an image to it as well cool let's refresh let's full screen this thing let's hit start a post ooh hit X nice look at that that worked I can't believe that worked I really thought it was gonna break boom boom look at that model and look the whole screen goes dark because that we have that you know that post modal div that takes over the entire screen when I click it when I hit X it goes and it's done okay that modal is a very beautiful functionality so great work on adding that I'm proud of you okay and if you're proud of you then smash that like button okay just for yourself if not for me I'm proud of you let's keep going now we're going to add a smooth fade that's going to fade these things out so here's how we're gonna do that let's go to pulse modal and inside of our post model let's go all the way down to container and right underneath here I'm just going to say animation fade in and let's do something like 0.3 seconds that's 300 milliseconds okay I do something I don't know that didn't do anything then we're gonna have to make it do something start a post cool let's go to our index.css and we're going to make it do something all right so I'm now in my index.css file which is of course inside of source so let me close out of my images and close out of my public close actions okay so inside of source I have index.css let's go there let's go all the way down and let's make let's make that fade in mean something and do something so I'm going to say webkit keyframes let's go fade in and what fade in his job is going to be is this from opacity of zero what we want you to do is go to an opacity of one and now we're gonna also Define standard keyframes let's remove all of this Let's do an at sign right there okay save because it's still complaining failing to compile that should be good start oh look at that fading start a post click yo that looks beautiful that is freaking beautiful that's all I gotta say that's all I gotta say all right that modal work was just beautiful okay now let's keep going beautiful so now we got that working now we're gonna disable the post button when the editor text is um empty okay because right now even when the editor text is not empty I can hit post so we don't want that we don't want that okay cool so let's go ahead to post modal and let's start adding that functionality so let's go to our post button and um inside of our post button All I'm gonna say is this I'm Gonna Save disabled okay when the editor text state is empty when it just doesn't exist okay if it's so give me true so give me disable true if the text is empty otherwise give me false cool that's essentially it cool disable old old D just like that okay so now because of the styling and stuff like that you can't really see it but it's actually disabled right now because there's no borders around it but I type the borders appear okay but it's just like a little hard to see so we're gonna go ahead and add some styling to it so let's go to our post button so I'm going to command f post button component and let's add some styling to this so inside of background here's what we're going to do we're gonna do some cool ways of styling now props dot this I'm going to do it this way okay let's go get access to the props and if the props is disabled question mark then I want you to style it in this way zero zero zero zero point eight okay and if you're not disabled then I want you to style it in a different way so like what we had earlier so now this is going to be really freaking cool whoa what the hell happened it looks ugly as hell what the heck happened we lost all of our styling oh man the app is going all over the place all right let's take that out of parentheses here um I mean it doesn't really matter but prettier wants me to do it the other way oh and why am I going blind let's um close this freaking parentheses right there right because that would only make sense and then that closes that cool ah yeah look at that okay my post is dark I write and now it's blue this is why I love styled components you guys because I'm just I'm saying if it's disabled give it this color if it's enabled give it this color and it's just so freaking nice it's just so freaking nice okay um and now I also want to change the text color Okay so let's go ahead and change the text color because right now just white that's not what we want so let's go props and I'm gonna go props disabled okay if it's disabled then do the following of course open close this okay and then outside of this just give me white okay so when it's disabled it's hard to see it when it's enabled boom okay so that's what it I want that to happen with the colors it's good it's good okay cool and then on Hover I also want to give it a dynamic functionality okay so I'm going to say props and if it's disabled again let's go ahead and do zero zero zero zero point eight like that actually let's do 0.0 zero point yeah 0.08 okay or in the other case give me this okay am I closing my parentheses right yes I am on Hover beautiful okay that's all that's happening cool so when I hover over it gives me like a lighter gray uh in the disabled mode okay and then when I write then it gives me this one when I hover over on this thing right boom boom boom beautiful that's exactly what I want and that's really really good now we're going to start adding file input for uploading images and that allows us to upload a file from our computer and add it to this and that's really nice functionality if you're going to a recruiter you can show them that functionality okay they're going to be blown away so let's go ahead and start adding that now so file input where do we start well we start in post model let's go all the way to the top and right underneath this let's go ahead and add share image set share image all right and I'm gonna go use state leave it blank cool um and then what I want to do is I want to handle the change as it happens okay we're gonna get the first element from the files and if the image is blank or image is undefined okay in those two cases I want to basically say hey uh not an image the image file is a and then we're gonna be able to access instead type of image cool so that's gonna be great if this is going to help me figure out like what the actual error is and what's the type of the image and then otherwise I'm just going to return and I'm going to return right here return cool and now right underneath that let's go set share image okay so meaning if we don't get an error then do this thing and when I do this thing it's going to update that variable right there share image cool cool cool cool beans now let's go ahead and actually add the upload image component so I'll add the upload image component uh kind of right underneath the text area all right so text area what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove this and I'm just going to end it right there so just a little bit tad bit cleaner and right underneath the text area I'm going to add the upload image component and let's just go ahead and give it a empty styling for now before we start doing other things to it upload image is equal to styled div and just leave it empty for now and that way we don't get into errors as I'm writing it so you can see it build out upload image right there and let's go input type type is going to be file so already just by doing type file for input I can now choose file and it brings up all of this stuff which is super cool all right so that's good and I can even click choose file and click an image and it automatically knows Disney plus ASMR right it says it right there so that's a really good sign so like things are already kind of working I'm gonna say accept um and let's say accept what except uh image slash GIF so accept images and GIFs and also um accept jpegs and also I'll have it except pngs okay like this so that's good your name is equal to image the ID of this will be file cool of this input and then let's give it a style and I'll give it a jsx inline styling okay and I'm going to say display um none okay so if I remove that style you see choose file if I re if I add display none now that choose file is just not showing because I I said don't display it right if I change it with something else it's going to have different Behavior cool all right so that's good now on change we need to add something that actually handles on change okay so let's go on change we're going to handle on change okay so it's going to run our handle change function we're just going to do all of this which is going to set the image for us cool cool let's so now we're closing out of that input that's good all right so that input should end right there right underneath that will add a paragraph tag and in here let's add a label okay and html4 will just be file and now let's give it a style okay again we'll also do this one inline as well for styling just please bear with me this is going to be a little hard to follow but bear with me here and I'm just going to say cursor pointer but actually you know what I don't even think we need that to be honest I'm just gonna leave that so that will make it simpler for you and then let's just say inside of the label let's just say select a image Let's do an image to share like that okay so now there is our styling very very simple okay and when I click it okay already um it actually opens this up okay so but what we have to do is probably make it look like something that you want to click on so we're gonna do that in just a second all right let's end our label we're ending our label that's good and right underneath ending our label we're ending our P tag that's good now let's right underneath our P tag but it's still inside our upload image component let's add in these squigglies and we're gonna do share image so if the image actually exists then do the following okay I'm gonna say image source is equal to and I'm going to say url.create object URL and I'm going to pass this the share image path okay like that let's close our image tag beautiful okay boom boom hey our image is showing that was nice and a lot easier to do than expected beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful that's good let's go down upload image now let's add this component styling all the way at the bottom for upload image because right now the image is ridiculous right so we're just going to need to control that so let's go text align Center and then after this so now select an image to share is looking good okay and of course now what we want to do is we're going to say hey the image let's give it a width of a hundred percent one of those so now the image is looking great wow how nice huh we got click okay let's refresh right boom let's click select an image to share pick that hit enter man that looks beautiful that looks beautiful I love it okay very very simple and very effective very very effective um now we're also gonna add a react player so then that way we're able to actually show like any video URLs that we put okay that's gonna like kind of Auto expand them and make them look great so let's go ahead and do that cool so let's start working on it now first things we need is we actually I'm going to hit Ctrl C and stop my server and what we actually need is you can do npm install like this but I'm actually going to do yarn add which is the same thing uh and I'm gonna do yarn add react dash player okay and hit enter so install um what I want you to do is install this component right now not component but uh man my brain is getting fried but yeah install this so now you should have react player okay the react player Library and let's go inside of our post model and go all the way at the top and I'm going to do import react player from react player like this cool and right underneath here we're going to say const video link and then we're going to say set video link like this equal use State and leave that blank okay cool now inside of our handle change actually are we going to work on inside of our handle change let me see okay so right here where I'm doing this share image thing right above upload image um where should we add this actually let me think so let's keep this inside of our upload image but right underneath where we're doing the share image line okay so right here or we're gonna do a couple of things I'm going to add a empty react jss jsx fragment okay and inside of this let's add an input uh we're gonna keep it text and placeholder will be please input a video link like that and then the value will be whatever is the video link that we give it and of course on change we're gonna say take the event and set the video URL set the video link based on whatever the user gives you okay the value of the event great so input ends here and right underneath input what we're going to do is open close squiggly and I'm going to say if video link exists then what I want you to do okay and let's close this bracket and go react player all right and I just imported it so I imported import react player from react dash player so make sure you go ahead and do that let's say react player with is equal to 10 uh let's go 100 percent okay and then we're gonna go URL and is whichever video link that's actually set in our state at the moment okay save beautiful so that should be pretty good all right now we're gonna test it out and see if it if it does anything whoops let's do yarn start again so it starts up our app okay wake up app cool all right so we got please input a video link let's see if I have a YouTube video link boom right when I embed it it's right there that is awesome and this also happens to be my video if you want to go check out my chess Channel welcome that's awesome yeah beautiful let's go 20 on the width so that made it really really tiny just like this so make sure choose 100 on your react player width so react player plays really nicely with videos okay so we're good now we're gonna make it so you can switch between share image or share video all right here we go welcome back to the same thing that you were on so let's just continue going all right I just want to take a little break but it's all good we're back now and we're ready to go okay can I hear myself beautiful awesome so let's just go ahead and get started with this right so so far we're doing a great job we got the video players showing we got me looking beautiful here right there okay maybe for you it's your video that you're putting okay you can use your own YouTube video link and then it'll be you with that said let's go ahead and make it so we can switch between whichever one we want right because right now we're seeing both image and the YouTube url I don't want to see both of them I just want to see one of them okay cool so let's go ahead and add that functionality okay now the functionality is going to take a little bit so first things first we're going to start off by going inside of our post model so make sure you're there and right here we're going to add that component okay so not component we're going to add a state variable here okay because this is going to change at some point so asset area and then of course the um the way that we are using it is going to be set asset area cool just like this is a convention we use and default is going to be empty cool now let's go under where we have set chair image okay underneath that we're going to make a new function here that we're going to use switch asset area cool it'll take in the area as an argument and then it's going to do a couple of things so it's going to make the image just empty we'll also do set video link and we'll make that empty cool and then we're going to do set asset area to the area that we received okay and uh that's all good okay awesome now let's go to our reset in in our reset we're just going to add a few more things okay but we're gonna add that above our handle Click Change okay so I'm gonna do set share image let's go blank here set video link will go blank because again this is reset so this should reset essentially all of those States so that's what all we're doing there now let's go down under where we have the area focus in our text area Okay so right below this I'm gonna do a couple of things okay what I'm going to do is let's open up our squiggly bracket here okay and um let's go ahead let's go ahead and what I'm going to do is I'm going to close the squiggly bracket kind of in this weird area right underneath this jsx the jsx fragment that's ending right underneath this uh player that's where I'm going to add the ending of that okay and essentially we're going to have a ternary operator in between there so let's do this okay so if asset area is equal to image then I want the following to happen all right whoops image then I want this all of this to happen okay the upload image thing to show up okay um all right guys so I'm gonna take this where this upload image is ending I'm gonna take it okay I'm gonna take this thing here and let's move it up okay so boom boom boom let's go up top and uh let's end this component right here okay the upload image component and here's where I'm going to add my ternary so I'm going to do colon here this is a little hard to read and um and I apologize about that but bear with me here and then I'm gonna say if the asset area is Media then I want you to do the following okay in that case do all of this so again a little hard to read but I'm basically saying if it's image then do all of this okay the upload image component okay if the asset area is Media then do all of this okay great and then let's go ahead and just switch a couple of things so I'm going to find my asset button and all I'm gonna do for my asset button is very simple I will simply add an on click on this thing like this let's open this up go like that beautiful and I'm going to do switch asset area like so and uh pass in image okay give it pass in the image for that and then where's my other asset button right here this is the one for the video and I'm just gonna say on click and we're going to do switch asset area and I'm just going to say media like so okay and then that should be pretty freaking good great pretty freaking cool wow look at that it's working and it looks nice right when I click the image I see this when I click this one I see this video right there okay and how is that working well uh this is this is uh one asset button which is right here and this asset button number two this video one okay so we got one and two I'll write one and two just like so okay this image one is this one the one and this media one is this video one now what happens when I click this video one or sorry this picture one is this on click thing runs and it changes my estate variable this asset area one and it changes it to image okay so well let's go into that function and see what that's doing okay it changes it to an image okay so I go switch asset area and I pass it the image and then it just changes it to an image all right and that makes the code appear and work and do do essentially what I wanted to do okay if I go and do switch asset area to Media it goes ahead and changes it to a media okay and then boom you get your switching statements here boom and here I can put my video link to a YouTube video like so and it will actually even put the video here okay and let's test putting an image and let's see if our image works beautiful our image is working and that's exactly what we want so we're done with that functionality now we're going to connect with our store and uh get user info okay so let's go down first of all let's actually just import so I'm going to do import connect because we're going to need to connect to our Redux store in a second so let's do this okay all right so now we're going to map states to props the boring usual Redux stuff which you know the Redux toolkit you don't need to know how to do and do map state to props state and um actually this is going to be an expression like that okay let's leave it empty for now and I'm just going to do export default connect map state to props we'll do map dispatch uh dispatch to props okay and then we'll do Post modal like that actually my bad okay uh this is this one is going to be map dispatch map dispatch to props okay and uh that's going to be good for the dispatch to prompts and above this I'm going to add map state to props okay and we'll make this state now this one is going to be dispatch okay so this one that says state cool let's go like this all right I like putting parentheses here hopefully prettier likes it too great and what I'm going to do is say return user State user state DOT State like that okay so now that should be good to go that's that all right now we're going to display the user info so let's go to user info component which is up here and we're going to add our little ternary action and let's go ahead and do that now okay so I'm going to say props.user.photo URL so hey if the photo URL is there then I want you to do the following then I want you to show the image and the source for this is going to be the actual URL for the photo props.user.photo URL like so all right and I don't need to do anything else I think that should be good cool let's end this photo one okay and then we need an or statement so an or statement I'm going to basically give it this as my or statement and then we need to end this squiggly okay so what is my error here let's see I think I'm ending it too early so let's remove that there so basically I'm saying hey does the photo exist if it exists if the user then showed the photo of the actual user that we pulled from Firebase otherwise showed us Anonymous user photo so let's click the post modal okay now it's having an error cannot read property photo URL of undefined okay no problem um so what basically needs to happen is I need to right now actually I'm logged in logged in okay weird error we'll figure it out together not to worry okay let's hit save on this thing and then let's go ahead underneath here we got our span tag in our span what I'm going to say is props.user that display name okay just like that great and of course we gotta close our squiggly otherwise we're going to be in some troubles cool so let's try signing out let's try signing in with Google okay cannot read property photo URL of undefined interesting because pretty sure we're freaking logged in oh duh this is why I don't have access to the user I gotta access the freaking user okay that's what user is okay State at usersate.user okay so now up here where I'm asking for the user command F user okay where I want to get the user's photo now I have access to the user's photo so let's hit save let's hit refresh and now I'm going to have access to the user's photo okay so for example let's Click Boom there we go okay so now let's go full screen here Okay click Start a post and if you're logged in we'll have a photo here if you're not logged in you shouldn't even be able to get to this page but if you did get to this page you'll have this Anonymous photo as a fallback okay so great now we got that photo now let's add functionality with the image okay we want to be able to actually upload the image to Firebase storage so let's go ahead and do that now so first things first well what are the first things first so let's go to actions because we're going to add an action and we're going to add a new action again it's going to be called Post article API and it will take in a payload okay and I'm just going to return a dispatch event that's going to look like the following okay if what I want to do is payload is payload dot image is not blank so we have an image then I'm going to set my upload to be storage dot ref whoops storage dot ref okay Images slash payloadimage.name okay and then let's get out of here and we're going to use the dot put method and we'll do payload dot image cool so this is going to help us upload our image all right and uh let's go ahead and make sure that we do that all right now let's do upload okay and I'll do upload dot on cool on state changed okay then we're going to do snapshot all right let's go and not that one let's go like that snapshot I'm going to say const progress is the following I'm gonna have snapshot bytes transferred boom and we'll do snapshot dot total bytes bytes just like that all right and let's multiply that by a hundred and close it off cool all right now this is going to be helpful for making that loading bar soon and you guys will see how this is actually going to help you okay so now boom we have this one right here let's just wrap this thing inside of parens right here um it doesn't need it okay it's redundant cool let's get out of here and now let's basically go console log uh progress okay and I'll do this progress okay and we'll put a percent sign so they'll show us how's our progress doing so far I don't want my function to be ending here so this upload on needed to be ending a little bit later all right so we're gonna need quite a lot of little weird changes here so just follow along um gets messy Okay so open the parenthesis here and we're going to close this okay because this whole thing is an expression then I'm going to console log the progress and then what I want to do is I want to essentially close out everything right so for example this squiggly here let's close that out that parentheses right there I'm going to close that out I also want to close this squiggly right there okay and then I also want to close that quickly out right there and I also want to close that squiggly out right there and that should effectively take care of everything and once I hit save it should kind of format it like this okay but there's a couple of things that we got to do here all right now underneath this what I want to basically say is if the snapshot state is running on the other hand okay then what I want to do is I want to console log the progress okay progress like this and boom cool so in both cases kind of show me show me what's going on okay and then let's go underneath here okay right there and what I will say is if there's an error then console.log error code okay so again I know there's a lot going on in this upload so there there's a lot right so for example this upload function it took in the state change then it took in this function right here on the Fly and then it's also taking in uh what needs to happen when there's an error okay cool and then let's also do async okay we're gonna have download URL and what that's going to do is we're going to wait upload cool and we're going to do get download URL like so okay all right so storage is not defined we will Define storage by importing it okay so let's go ahead up at the top and in here right after provider I'm going to upload storage from Firebase that'll take care of that we also want to add our database let's do import DB from Firebase we're going to need that later okay cool let's come on down now and we got our download URL so that's good now we need to do a couple of things so right underneath this download URL we're gonna do our DB collection okay so DB collection articles to the Articles collection we're going to add the following the actor it's going to have the following things in here description will be payload of the user email title will beep display name like so date will be whatever is the time stamp of the payload and then image will be the photo URL of course okay great and then underneath Here video will be payload video shared image will be the download URL that we made comments will be zeroable kind of just hard code that for now and description will be the payload description okay so that should be good I know that that was like a pretty hefty piece of code but let's go to our post model and now actually add that functionality and we're pretty close so hang in there with me guys let's import Firebase from Firebase okay and then we're going to import our Post article API like so and let's do from dot dot actions okay so that gets us that now let's go where our switch asset area shows up cool and let's add in our new method okay our function here pulse article okay it's going to take an event and again I want to kind of prevent um any of the weird stuff happening in react where things need to refresh and so on so let's take care of that and I'm basically going to say if the target does not equal to the current Target then just return cool and then I'm gonna Define our payload and image will be the share image video will be the video link our user will be our actual user description description will be whatever the text is that the user adds and of course timestamp will be Firebase timestamp okay so that's why we imported Firebase and then here we're going to have props Dot Post article that's going to take the payload okay and then simply let's go ahead and reset e and then we'll call this function and we'll reset everything okay once it's added and now let's basically go ahead and add these buttons so I'm gonna go down to my post button and inside of my post button when I click that button I want a couple of things to happen okay so let's go here and we'll Define an on click just leave it blank for a second and in our on click what I want to happen is I'm going to give it an event and then I want the following things to occur run our Post article function and give it the event details okay that means the description the text any information that we have already about the user and now just let's go to our dispatch and add all of that in cool so let's go here and let's add in that so Post article and we will do it'll take in a payload okay and then we'll dispatch Post article API payload like that okay beautiful now let's see if it actually does anything for now so I will take in an image select an image click an image do that test let's hit post post so maybe it's doing something maybe it isn't but the only way to go and check is to go inside of our firestore database and let's see if anything is actually happening okay so let's go ahead and create a database I'll put it in test mode let's hit next and enable all right that's going to be important because that allows our database to actually be created in the first place otherwise we will not have a database and firestore is actually very very powerful so I like using this as our database okay all right now we don't have any collections or anything like that so let's try hitting post again does that do anything nope not doing anything right now which is totally fine and by the way firestore also has storage okay so I'm going to click on that I'm gonna go in there so on the left hand side I have storage and I can even upload a file right so let's just click here upload a file see what happens I'm just kind of like hard coding and uploading it there okay so boom it uploaded it and now we'll be able to retrieve file from here okay so that's the file data it's kind of nice GUI that they have actually for uploading uh things so pretty uh simple but that's just kind of like on me hard coding it okay but that's not the way we're going to do what we're going to do in our app oh and going back to index file by the way and our actions index.js um this is squiggly okay not parentheses that's why it's not changing uh that's why it's actually not using that variable okay this is like template literals so that's how they work but almost refresh cool okay let's try uploading the image now hopefully that works Let's test test test test test okay if it works it'll probably upload it to our storage folder inside of our Firebase okay so let's keep on trying this thing all right so let's actually debug this real quick together because I think that's going to be helpful so let's go inside of Post article and I'm going to type in console log uh post Malone all right let's uh add a rocket here okay it's not gonna add a rocket so let's just add a person here that's fine all right so I have my image I'm going to hit post and it says post Malone so I want to see where it's getting to so it's getting to this line let's now add a console log here and I'm just going to say and can I add add a cake here let's add that cake I don't know why it's uh being funny but I'm just gonna say hello here okay and let's see if it gets in here oh ah okay so it seems like it's getting to this if statement and then it's just returning so it's actually not doing any of this and it's not running this Post article payload function because that Post article payload actually does everything that we need to do it actually does this Post article right we give it the payload it dispatches it and then it gives it to this function this function knows how to upload so it's never even getting to that it's just dying right here and that's because e.target is not equal correct Target this should be car rent Target okay so delete here um and now it should not be getting to that hello so let's try again and look progress zero progress 28 progress 85 progress 100 wow so that actually looks good looks like something happened so I'm gonna go to my Firebase refresh is it in my storage or is it in my database oh it's in my storage I oh that's cool I have an images folder and here's my image Gatsby versus next.js okay beautiful it is all is it also in my database yes it is I haven't collections here so I'm going to delete this other uh record I had um actually let me just leave that I just had like some dummy freaking record okay so delete um I don't know if it deletes the whole thing or not it's not deleting it that's fine so just forget about that one but it just added this new record here in my collection articles okay how do I know that well if I go to my code inside of my index.js I have this line here that says hey um DB collection articles inside of Firebase add and then add this whole thing okay so we got actor an actor has all these things inside of it right and then I also got just video shared image and comments so video shared image description of comments cool which is corresponds to these four things and then actor and all of that corresponds to all of this okay so that looks good to me so far now finally it's working and this progress bar is working so that's really good progress on our end now let's add the same post functionality but with video as well okay and how we're gonna do that is it's going to be very simple so remember how we have this if statement right here that says payload image well what we're going to do is say let's find where that ends right there okay and I'm just going to do else if be careful with the indentation otherwise you're going to get caught okay and I'm going to say if payload is video then I'm going to do DB collection and essentially I'm going to do the same thing which is going to be articles dot add okay and we're going to do actor description payload.user.email title I'm just going to copy some of these okay title is going to be that uh date is going to be whoops didn't mean to delete it okay so paste and then I'm going to copy copy image and also paste it right here okay so those are going to be the same and also this whole thing pretty much is also going to be the same video payload video shared image so the there's going to be only one difference though okay so I'll show you that in just a second let's hit save now instead of shared image being the download URL it's just going to be empty because it's not an image cool capiche makes sense okay great so that's it that's all that happens if we choose to add a video instead of an image okay so let's try adding let's go here and refresh and let's go here try adding a video we'll add a YouTube video test hit post and uh hopefully something happens let's go to our app did it add a video yes it added a video right there okay it's inside of our database we'll be able to get access to it whenever we want so on and so forth okay cool now we're going to add in an article reducer and this is going to be helpful for when we actually want to start pulling the Articles and actually showing the Articles okay so let's go ahead and start working on that so I'm going to go inside of my reducer so source reducers going to my reducers folder and we're going to create a new file and it's going to be called article reducer.js AKA article updater okay much better name for a reducer and I'm just going to say export const in net State like this loading is false okay so the initial state is going to be loading is false so we won't we shouldn't see that loading Circle in the start okay my article reducer what that's going to be is hey my initial state let's make it the net state and then it's going to take in an action whoops my bad there we go and then we're going to take a switch based on the action type that's just how Redux works okay and again default is going to be just returning the existing state and I'm going to export default article reducer like so now let's go inside of our index.js which is inside of reducer so the re index.js inside a reducer so go to that and uh right underneath this user reducer I'm going to add in an article reducer like that and underneath my root reducer I'm going to add so user state is good I'm just going to add article state and we will do article reducer like so all right so that's good now we're going to start working on the loading bar okay so we can see the loading bar uh showing up as we um you know upload a video or an image we want to see like a little spinning circular loading bar so let's start with going into our action type.js inside of action so action type.js so this is going to be export con set loading underscore status equals set loading status like that okay beautiful and let's go inside of our article reducer okay and I'm gonna do one thing inside of my article reducers which is I'm going to add an import statement at the top and I'm going to say import set set loading status from actions action type okay so let's import that one and then we're going to do underneath our action type let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to say case set loading status okay and I'm going to say a return whatever the state previously was and then add this new loading State on top of that okay keep in mind because this is Redux nothing is being mutated now let's go to our index not that index let's go to our actions index.js there's just so many indexes okay so this import right here we're going to do set user and also set loading status and let's go underneath our um I mean we can kind of add this wherever we want but I'll just add it here okay let's let's just add it right there okay and I'm gonna just do export constant set loading is equal to it'll take in status as an input and we'll do type set loadings oops set loading status is going to be whatever the status we pass it okay and now let's go inside of our function Post article API and right underneath this return dispatch I'm gonna say dispatch set loading to be true great let's give a little Gap here just so it looks cleaner great now let's go to our image and our image if statement right go all the way down to where we have the payload.description okay and right underneath that I'm going to say dispatch set loading false okay so once all of that happens we're gonna say finish the loading meaning we'll keep spinning keep spinning keep spinning until the whole thing is uploaded and added to our articles as soon as it's added to our articles in our Firebase database then stop the spinning okay dispatch an action to our Redux store change the state of the set loading got it and then we're going to do the same thing for the when the video uh is done being uploaded so these are the two parts where we're going to switch the loading to essentially false and for it to stop spinning okay beautiful now next up we're going to like add our spinning logos and things like that okay so here's the spending logo it's going to be called spin loader this is what it is okay spinloader.svg the it already comes in with the graphic of the spinning so we won't need to do any like fancy CSS so that's a good thing all right take it and add it to your images and then we're going to x out of it okay and now we're gonna go to main.js so we can add that there okay so let's go to where our share box is because it's going to be inside of sharebox so inside of sharebox we have we don't need this text here by the way any more share let's hit refresh cool so that share word is gone great okay now I'm gonna add in a squiggly here okay and I'm gonna close this squiggly uh where should I close this squiggly I'll close it let me think about where to close it actually so let's just close this squiggly right underneath here okay and what I'm basically gonna say is hey if the user exists then show the user photo like that okay and then here's what I want you to do if the user photo URL exists then again this is a ternary operator we're going to do this show me the actual users photo end okay otherwise show me just an anonymous photo okay beautiful I'm gonna take that div and uh let's put it right underneath the share box okay just like that so now what it should look like is we have one div inside of here what happens is we either see the user's image or we see the anonymous image and then we have it button okay so if I hit start a post I see this cool start a post okay and then it uh when I click that startup post button this thing is treated like a button and when I click it the handle click uh function runs okay so that little thing we added there is helpful and awesome and now on this button what we're going to do is we're just going to add in what happens when it is uh disabled okay so we're going to do props out loading okay and if so loading is either true otherwise it's false okay so if it's loading set the disable to True otherwise set it to false so like we shouldn't be able to click that thing or do anything to it if it's a loading cool let's go to where our content component is so let's find content um actually we don't have content component yet so let's go ahead and add it and where I want to add it is let's go to our share box right there okay and right underneath my share box I'm going to add this cool so let's do this and I'm going to do props.loading so if my loading is going on then show my loading spinner Images slash spin loader.svg okay and I think we should be good even with that and let's end that image that should be good okay so our content um our content component is actually going to be just a tad bit longer so let's go ahead and remove this div that we're wrapping article in and instead we're going to wrap article inside of content okay so I'm going to remove the um let's go ahead and remove that div and let's grab the ending of that content and let's go all the way down to where article ends and let's remove this div as well and paste content okay so instead of rap ing our article in a div we're going to wrap article in our content component now again it's going to complain it's gonna be like hey you haven't defined content okay no problem we're Pros now so we're gonna go ahead and Define content I'm gonna do style div okay let's go up boom in there and I'm gonna do text align Center just like this okay and um let me go ahead cool okay let's do again this is for the loading part okay I'm gonna do image with 30 pixels all right and then let's go to the end here all right and um we're now gonna Define what happens to our map State props so map state to props and we'll do a returned loading state articlestate.loading and we'll also do what's going on with the user so we'll get access to the user state and then let's do map dispatch to props okay and we'll just leave that blank for now like this leave it blank cool and let's do export default and we'll do connect map dispatch to props as well and of course Main that's this file that we're in now it's like hey I don't know what connect is okay don't worry it's not Connect Four but it's importing connect from react Redux like so and that should know what we're trying to do so let's try to add an image and see what happens now we did not get a spinner okay that was not fun we definitely expected a spinner and then we got like Rick Rolled oh actually first of all let's go to this part here we I don't need these uh squigglies here first of all for the loading so let's remove that and uh let's try refreshing now and giving it a good old College try seeing if the spinner shows up nope okay and let's actually try putting a period here real quick and do period slash Images slash spinloader.svg let's see if that helps us out here nope okay I'm officially an idiot so I was like wait what the frick is going on the loading bar so loading bar is completely working I just forgot that it Works um not to show the image because the image pretty much just loads instantaneously but this bar is actually useful for when I hit post now the loading bar shows so perfect okay everything is working as expected and we're making great progress this was really awesome and fun so far so it wasn't because I put a little period in front of my um uh whatever that thing was uh the spinner the spinner logo okay so anyways good progress let's keep going now what we're going to do is when the page is loading we're gonna call the API using a use effect and we're going to use that to get actually the Articles from Firebase okay so we're going to use react hooks to get articles from Firebase so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go into my index which is index.js inside of my actions okay and uh let's go ahead and add a completely new function in here so I'm going to do export function and do get articles article pulse API okay and then we're going to say return dispatch like so and we're going to say let payload Okay so let's just leave payload as is and I'm going to say DB dot collection I'll do articles and now we're going to get data from the Articles okay so we're gonna do order by we're gonna do actor dot date cool and we're going to do descending like so and uh then I'm gonna do on Snapshot okay this allows me to read data from my Firebase I'm going to say payload is equal to snapshot Dot docs.map and all the documents that I pretty much get back I'm essentially going to just kind of put them in an array okay map them that's what map will output that's what payload will become and I'll console the log payload as well so you can kind of see it okay cool now I have to refer to this and use this inside of my main JS okay so let's go to main let's go import I'm gonna import use effect so I can use it and I'm going to bring use State because I will also need State need to also manage State cool let's do import the get articles function as well that we made inside of our actions okay we're going to do actions dot dot slash actions just like that great and uh let's go ahead and just add that uh right here let's say use effect cool and props.get articles okay so this will just pretty much run it once articles like this so essentially when I go to main page uh we're gonna try to run this once let's go down all the way and now we're gonna do our Redux stuff so let's go to dispatch data props I'm gonna go inside of here let's do get articles and um essentially going to say dispatch get articles API like so and run it run it run it run it okay okay let's see do I have an error here use effect and use State what is it complaining about um oh I have uh I have it twice so that can just be on one line that's fine refresh cannot read property collection of undefined okay great so let's hit inspect and see if we're console logging anything we got an array of four and uh this is perfect because as you can see this array of four is telling me what do I have okay so I have four items okay one is um this image right here the user image one is this image right here okay let me copy that string and paste it that image right there cool here's another one it has a link to that video and then here's another one okay so shared image let's see where that takes me oh permission denied okay all good but it's looking like I have access to all of this and I can actually read it okay now what we're going to do is we're going to dispatch an action to the store um and uh for for setting articles okay this will allow us to set articles and then later we'll be able to do a lot more things with them all right cool so let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go inside of my action type and let's have another action type export const get articles and uh surprise surprise is going to be called get articles cool now let's go inside of my main and inside of my main where I'm defining my mapping state to props let's add articles in here as well and I'm going to say state.article state dot articles like this cool and uh let's go inside of my article reducer okay if we don't have one do we need to create one no we have article reducer great okay let's go to our initial State and we're going to do a few things actually although at the top so we're going to import set loading status we're also going to import get articles okay underneath here I'm going to say articles and uh whoops like this let's make articles uh an empty array in the start all right initial and now in our switch cases we're going to say hey if there's a case of get articles then what we need to do is return the existing state along with whatever the Articles payload is just like so cool and now let's go to index inside of our actions all right and in our index we are going to import we have set user we have set loading status now let's go ahead and add get articles and import this and let's go here and I'm going to do export const get articles payload type get articles like that payload will be payload okay and let's go all the way down where I'm like sorting it by actor date and descending order all I'm going to do instead of this console log we're going to dispatch this I'm going to say get articles payload okay and I don't need this line anymore so let's hit save on this thing so we're done okay this is allowing us to set the articles okay cool test Mana just add a dummy image not too much be happening right now cool okay so everything is working now what I want to do is I want to hide the main content until there are articles so we don't want to show any of the content unless we have like articles in there okay so like for example if I don't have any articles then like kind of don't show any of this the content cool so let's we're inside of our main.js let's go all the way up let's go up right above the container okay and right above the container I'm going to open up a jsx fragment and uh right underneath where does the container end so let's see where our container ends under what where our container ends I'm going to close off my jsx fragment okay and here's another thing I'm going to do I'm going to open up a squiggly all the way at the top right here okay and uh we're gonna close it all the way at the bottom right before the jsx fragment ending and hit save okay now while we're doing this is so we can add our ternary operator so I'm going to say if articles length is zero meaning there's no articles then what I want you to do is basically say they're what the hell just happened and there we go there are no articles like that okay that's all I want you to say or give me all of the things okay give me the share box Give Me Everything cool so this is a pretty simple ternary operator but it's also pretty badass because it's like wait where did my ending squiggly go it's also pretty badass it basically says if there's zero then just show this there are no articles and if there are articles then do all of this okay kind of crazy cool okay beautiful now we're gonna add the loader uh component all right so a few things need to happen so let's go and make the loader component all right actually you know what let's actually skip the loader component because I think it's going to add a ton of additional code and not that much functionality so let's pass on that honestly and instead what I want to do is uh let's display the articles that we actually get back from Firebase okay I think that's going to be a lot more uh interesting to add cool so to get started on this we're just going to do a few things inside of our main JS let's go main.js cool I'm there um let's go down to where I'm loading my spinner down down down okay so here's where my spinner is happening okay now right underneath this I'm going to do a couple of things here okay so buckle up because a lot is going to be happening here so hang in there with me let's go props dot articles dot length all right if it's greater than zero then I want the following to happen I want to map those articles okay and I'm going to need the key for performance sake so I'm going to say hey article key is equal to key like so okay and there's a lot of stuff that we're going to be deleting soon as well and it's going to make a ton of sense shortly okay so let's go articles.map key okay let's put a bracket there okay and we're gonna need to end that article at some point but not to worry let's actually do this okay so I'm gonna remove all of this here so we're just opening this okay and I'm just going to use this article right here and let's give it a key cool because like initially I was just like showing one post but we're gonna need to show multiple posts okay so this whole thing is gonna end up getting wrapped up okay so we're gonna have to go all the way down and wrap up this whole thing so let's go all the way outside of article let's go ahead and close it okay so hopefully the error should stop just for a little bit okay now we're going to make our changes that we wanted to make okay so inside of our a um we're not just going to have this hardcoded image of the user we're going to have the image of the actual uh user okay so let's do article dot actor dot image okay so see now it's cool because it has my image right there that's what we wanted it's pulling that straight from Firebase that's a really really good sign so that's done the next thing is where it says title we're going to dynamically get this as well so I'm going to say article dot actor dot title like so okay so now notice that my name is coming through that's also really good let's do the same thing here article dot actor dot description okay and now my email is showing up and then I'm going to do article dot actor dot date and we're going to make it if I leave it here let's see what it does very interesting let's see if it bugs out it freaks out okay and that's because we're getting a weird date from Firebase so we're gonna do that to date like that and let's see if that fixes it refresh okay and if that doesn't fix it then we're gonna do that to locale date string okay hopefully that should fix it and it does okay all we had to do was change it and indeed it is April 24th here Saturday 1 17 a.m so I'm grinding out here 1 17 am for your beautiful face so if you're happy about that and you want to show your appreciation smash that like button subscribe to the channel all right that's what I got for you so that to me looks good outside of this let's see what do we need to change where it says description let's change you know the description is hard coded so let's change that with article dot description like so okay so test that's actually what I wrote test test test test test okay let's see what happens if I write hello and hit post okay so right now those things are not actually being added uh to the databases and coming back we're not able to read back from it so no worries okay because it's still also sometimes waiting for an image so a couple of things are happening and while it's loading did you notice I couldn't make a new post so that was cool because it disables uh the start a post button so that's really cool functionality underneath shared image we're gonna do we're gonna do a couple of things okay side of shared image should we leave this hardcoded image probably not probably not so we're going to get rid of it okay why well because it's hard coded we don't want it to be hardcoded we want to work on it and change things dynamically okay so here we go so I'm going to say if article shared image is not there and article dot video is there then what I want you to do is use the react player all right so we're going to do react player and I'm going to give it a width of 100 percent like that okay and URL is going to be article dot video like this and let's close it cool all right so let's also import the react player okay so let's go all the way to the top I'm going to do import react player from react player okay dope cool and uh now we'll add our or statement and we're going to say or do the following okay article dot shared image if that's there then do this image article dot shared image and then just close it off okay so open close um what's the problem here did I add a question mark question mark oh my bad this should not be here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because that's gonna end that whole thing okay wow that looks great look at that yeah buddy okay so I like it I like it a lot okay hover over this beautiful that's absolutely absolutely great all right now let's do articles comments okay so let's go down town right underneath so let's find our social so we have our social accounts ending uh here and let's go a little bit above that I have comments and my comments are hardcoded in here I don't want it to be hardcoded so we're going to make them Dynamic and I'm going to do article dot comments all right zero almost kind of like hardcoded but you know not really so that's good okay great so this is looking good now this is a lot of code a lot a lot just this line is almost 400 lines of code I'll just file I mean so great we have all of this showing up exactly like how we want it that makes me really happy and then of course let's do should we add more text now I don't think I'm going to add this more text functionality okay uh let's try now adding another post and let's see if it actually reads hey there uh we just got done building LinkedIn clone with fire I would react.js Firebase and Redux for image I don't know let me go and pick a cool image so I'm gonna go inside of thumbnails and uh sure let's just pick uh let's pick one of these let's just pick this why not why not let's hit post look at that we just got done building our LinkedIn clone with react.js Firebase and Redux so now our post functionality is completely working exactly the way we want it to that is absolutely gorgeous all right and before we deploy this thing because we're so freaking close and I'm so proud of you that you've done such a good job we just need to fix one thing this over here looks funny and these like buttons and these things look funny so this is going to be uh pretty simple so let's go inside of our main.js and first let's fix social accounts so social count component is that one right there this one right here okay so inside of our button let's try going border none so let's take away the border and uh let's also do background color white okay so just just matches the the rest of the background okay great so that looks good to me let's also go inside of social actions and we're going to do something similar inside of our button let's go um let's go border none okay great and let's go background color White okay beautiful so now there you go that is our LinkedIn clone it is looking absolutely gorgeous you can log in you can log out I mean every single functionality is there we're using Redux we have our drop down menus working I mean this is beautiful like think about it right like if I go mobile mode right look at how good the mobile version looks just absolutely freaking beautiful okay so this is an amazing clone you've done a great job so far and now for the last piece of the puzzle all we're gonna do is we're gonna deploy it together okay so sometimes um I forget my deploying commands but let's just go ahead and figure it out um you know in this video so first things first but one thing I know that I need to do is I'm gonna need to run npm run build and I'm also going to need to set up Firebase hosting okay so we're gonna go ahead through that process now um let's try let's try um npm run build okay and let's see it go through the build okay and then we're going to do Firebase deploy and let's see what happens and then we run into errors we'll try to solve them together okay not to worry just make sure you're inside of um the main folder like LinkedIn clone okay main directory now we should have a build folder and this is going to be all our optimized images and files that are going to be ready are are going to be essentially production ready okay so there we go that's good our build is good to go and now I'm gonna try doing Firebase deploy so I'm imagining I'm gonna get some kind of error or some kind of process okay cool no worries let's see do I have any Firebase commands that I've written uhhuh so I remember the command is actually Firebase and net that's what I was looking for okay so we're just going to initialize it let's go here and select hosting because we're going to need to host it um so that's good let's go use an existing project and let's go to where's LinkedIn clone is it actually logged into the right one because I'm not seeing my project okay I'm gonna end out of it let's do Firebase init one more time and let's go hosting okay and uh let's create a new project because that that project just might not have been there okay let's call it LinkedIn clone or would you like to call your project LinkedIn clone I did not mean to specify an ID there's already a project with LinkedIn clone okay all good so let's actually go to Firebase from here okay let's go to project overview project settings okay link to a Firebase hosting site let's see if we can do that boom okay and let's go through the init project uh init process one more time let's do hosting hit enter um I don't think it's gonna let me select an existing project why is it not seeing any of the linkedins though that's what I'm curious about because this sees all this other stuff but it not does not see any of the linkedins which is very interesting to me so one thing you can do is make sure so it's because I'm logged into the wrong Firebase I'm going to see if I can log out and I'm going to log into the right Firebase okay that's really where my problems were coming from cool so you can do this too if you're not logged into Firebase make sure you log into Firebase if you haven't installed Firebase make sure you install Firebase now would be a good time now I'm logged in to Firebase okay so good now let's do Firebase and net now I should see my dummy LinkedIn clone use an existing project the dummy LinkedIn clone that we worked on our directory is going to be build I'm going to hit enter configure as a single page app I'm going to say yes set up automatic bills file Bill already exists you want to overwrite just hit enter okay so now we've gone through the initialization process I've also done npm run build so I have my build folder let's try Firebase build is it gonna work is it gonna work yo let's go guys amazing congratulations the LinkedIn clone that you worked and we worked so hard for is deployed so now let's go ahead and check it out hopefully it actually works and it doesn't embarrass us Let's Go full screen this is the deployed version you should be able to go and play around with this let's hit sign in with Google and let's see if it allows us to log in log in boom I'm inside and look at that it has access to my entire database it's fully up and running okay it has a bunch of my files everything I need okay and maybe by the time you're watching this I'm probably gonna have disabled for you to write to the database because people add all kinds of funny stuff when they're allowed to let's try um taking an image like this trash devs need to become Pro devs all right and I'm gonna hit post all right let's see if that posts that came through clutch and uh let's do um let's post a YouTube video of mine and let's go qazi playing chess let's hit post oh that's posted let's hit play guys welcome back yo I can even watch that video I can even watch all my other chestastic videos so there you have it folks
