what is up everybody hoping a react js cologne uh react no disney plus club my bad with disney plus clone with react js that's what we're doing today look at this disney plus that we have right now as you can see look at this let me put this making this full screen this is a beautiful ad that we we're going to build we're going to use firebase we're going to use redux we're going to use react on our dom we're going to use let me see what else are we going to use we're going to use things like you know a react slick to be able to create this slick animation right here right uh so many different things we're going to use style components all is going to be used here okay and of course we're using vs code for to be able to build this look at all these animations if i go ahead and click on this i can sign out beautiful and then i can click login to login again with my this is by the way using firebase authentication so i can log in like this oh we're set we're set hello youtube hello everybody i hope you guys are doing great all right so let's go actually get this party started let's get straight into it um so a few things we need to do to go ahead and get this started like i said this is going to be a very detailed build we might split this up into two parts but this is how we're going to do it all right beautiful all right okay so now at this point what we need to do is the first things first is let's go ahead and build out our actual project by starting up a you know project using react so what you need to do of course for this you need a node.js so the first thing you need to do is you need to install node.js hopefully you have that by now so node.js right here very very important right that's gonna be what you need that's not gs all right so make sure you install the recommended version okay once you've got that of course you need to install pretty much just use code and once you're done with that you're pretty much all set okay all right sweet sweet sweet so let's go ahead and open up our finder or uh something where we go ahead and actually open up a folder i'm gonna go ahead new finder here new finder uh new finder window hopefully i can find it here where's my new finder window right there all right and then we'll go i have a github folder here right here and this is called nas and i'm going to do new services new terminal at folder so i'm going to open up a new terminal folder if you're in windows you might have to do it differently you might have to use your terminal kind of like on windows um so what i will do at this point is i will say type in npx create create i'm gonna go and make this a little bit bigger so you can you can all see it npx npx create create dash dash react react dash app dash template redux right so we're going to use redux for this specific application so npx create react app dash dash template redux is what you need to do so click enter on this one and there is a way with run to seo options please specify the project okay so the issue is i just specify the project name here so nps query react app and we're going to call it disney disney plus dash clone right here so npx queer react app disney plus clone dash template redux hit enter all right that's all going doing so what's happening here is very simple guys okay what's going on is basically it's building all the scripts it's building it's initializing a the first project for us uh in order to be able to do something like this and of course hello youtube hello everybody i see all of you guys well we have a 20 donation from on let's go beautiful thank you so much um that is amazing let me go and highlight hello you on here where are you where are you where are you where are you whoa let's go beautiful thank you thank you appreciate it because of clever programmer i made over 100k a year thank you on appreciate it yeah he joined us actually uh he joined clever programmer a while ago and actually joined our boot camp and he was able to make atlantis a basically a sunday key job and then make more money from other jobs as well so pretty pretty insane all right now at this point that's that's it so what we've done here is we've created our project it says happy hacking once it says happy hacking you're pretty much done okay i'm going to put up some music here so we cannot be listening to a little music while we're coding all right so happy hacking beautiful all right at this point what we need to do is you see how it created this folder called disney plus clone right here and all we need to do is very simple we need to go ahead and open this up and we use code all right so let me put this this code on here on the right hand side and of course hopefully you can do this by your with by yourself as well all right i'm gonna open up a new new window with vs code there we go beautiful that's a new window i just opened up i will do file open open and then go to my github go to nas here and then the one that we just did is what the disney plus clone that's the one we just opened up so let's go ahead and do that right now beautiful all right sweet all right and here's what we got now so right this is the project that we started with with or basically react gs you can see we have source and there's a few files that you need to pay attention to the the one file that you need to really really pay attention to is kind of like uh well this one right here is we have app.js that's kind of like your main file right here and what we can do is if we do go ahead and do let's do right click on the yarn.lock and then say open inside integrate terminal right here and then do npm npm start boom npm star so click npm start beautiful that will start up your project guys okay that will set up your project and now at this point you should see it right here oh let's go this is our first react js project reactor js project okay of course you can click can hit plus right here to add edit you can hit minus and the way it's working it's working with redux is because we're able to for example click plus and minus with redux right and redux is a way for us to save state and we'll talk about how that's done later on a little bit okay so subtract number three two one zero and so forth that's pretty awesome all right so this is our first project right here and what we need to do is very simple this point is let's do some cleanup okay that's part one all right in terms of cleanup let me go ahead and make this right here uh app.js don't really need anything here now just remove that sayonata baby let's go that's done all right save that that's what i'm talking about all right okay that's what i'm talking about so we don't need that all right so now it's clean right and i can type whatever whatever i want in here so i'll say hello boom right if i say hello okay so really just anything i kind of want all right if i for example look at these other things uh we have 300 views 300 people on youtube hold up what's up what's up what's up amazing to have all of you guys here as always as always okay beautiful hello hello hello great travel creation always helps me some of you somebody said all right so that's if i say hello here you can see we have hello on here next up let's go ahead and clean up some css here uh at that css just command a don't need none of this right save it don't need none of this it's all i'm not i'm not going to say useless but it's unnecessary for us okay so that's done uh test.js don't need any of this do remove delete this one right here too with the trash okay do not need that okay uh next thing logo you see this logo import logo from logo svg don't need this either boom right here okay do not need that okay and that's pretty much it next up let me see next time let me see i will go ahead and do the following is let me go ahead and do this so we have that next up let's go you see how we have this counter we don't need this counter as well so that's not too much important little svg remove this one unnecessary all right and now we have a pretty clean clean app now what i want to do is let's go ahead and create components all right i'm going to create a new folder here i'm going to create a components folder right so the reason why we like to do that is because just it makes things so much simpler right so it just creates a components folder and that's over all of your components will live now let's really think about how are we going to build this application right this application contains a lot of different aspects all right let's think about what it needs for us to actually build this um a few things as you can see here that part one is we kind of have the header right here that's part one and i always like to think about the structure of you know anything that i'm building so for example um if i do this so this right here is my header okay so i know that i need to build a header that's part one part two i need to go ahead and build a slider that's gonna be another component i need to go ahead and create okay that's part two part three is i'm going to basically then build up this right here this viewer it's called a viewer right that's going to be what we will do with that so that's another component after that what we'll go ahead and do is we'll build this movies list that's going to be a third component and so what now has happened is we've just divided our application into multiple components right and this is how every single app works or basically on you know that's how every single app kind of works you know when we're going to build it in react.js honestly any app you're going to build online so let's see it so these are the components we want to build let's actually go ahead and build them right here now we know there's multiple pages for here inside the add.js we'll create a component called header right here and this looks like a div but really it's kind of like it's a component so pretty much it is a div but it's a div that contains another component and what i will do is i will create a file inside the components folder and i'll say header.js that gs boom right there then what i'm going to do is i'm going to use the es7 code snippets which hopefully you have when you installed extensions which is this one right here you see esm react code snippets right there right see some redco snippets right here hopefully you installed that at this point and once you've done that if i click on header.js which is the one the file i created i will do rfce boom done danzo down to dunzo right and you can see this is our app.js so we have the header component inside here now that we've done that let's type in header in here so save that go to app.js and what's going to happen now at this point is um well we need to import the header so i'm going to say import header from from what well from components folder from the components folder so i will do like this components dash header done components header okay i will go and save this now at this point right and once i've done that if if i look at my app look at that it says header right there header right that is the header right so we've just created the header component using this okay all right beautiful now let's go to head.js and inside here we're going to use style component now what style components are basically css within javascript all right let's try this out um to use style components what i'm going to do is actually install them first let's go ahead and do plus on our integrated terminal right here now we'll do the following npm install styled dash components stardust components done beautiful awesome style dash components okay so this installed it just installed the components okay that's awesome there we go beautiful that's amazing and then what are we going to do now at this point is we need to import it now right so i'm going to import styled from styled styled dash com dash components beautiful awesome import style from the stylish components save that save that and look here's what we can do now check this out remember how we had this div right remember this dip well i can replace this deal with it it's actually a basically like uh like a style component so take this out container i'll rename this to container like so right to a little the container right here right and you see it says container is not defined no problem whatsoever we'll fix this in a second here so i'm going to say now at this point the following const container container is equal to styled dot div so really we're creating a div with javascript you see instead of saying div here we're saying container so we name it whatever we want but then we create a style.dip now check this out what can we do with that well a few things we can give it a height so let's give it a height for example let's give it a height height of let's say for example 70 pixels 70 pixels okay save that all right and then let's get the background color so i'm gonna say background background color and i'm gonna give it this color right here and you i want you guys to copy this as well by yourself okay so this is zero nine zero b one three that's hashtag right there all right save that beautiful and so forth and look at this right here boom look the header is created is pretty much created you see the header is now created right here which directly maps to just this container that's all all we literally had to do that's all we had to do right that's all we had to do okay beautiful all right next up once we've done that that's in the background color right all right so let's go ahead and save this background color so that's in the header okay beautiful next up is the phone let's gonna now create another component called home now what is the home well the home will be this portion which is this whole thing right well called home component right right why we're going to call home component what do you think we're go why do you think we're going to call the home component like let me know in the comments below right it's because we have multiple pages we have a home page we have a you know a login page and we have a detail page when i click on a detail i we have a detail page as well and so that's what we're going to call home it's like opponents new file let's create home home.gs boom right there beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so that's that's our home.gs let's do rfce again and again if you don't have rfc you just kind of copy this portion right here to your terminal and uh put into your vs code okay i'm just going to call this home boom right there awesome okay add that gs let's import home of course we need to import it the cool thing about react.js is you can import and export things right just kind of how you you import and export with you know with trucks and you know in real life it's the same thing we can export just how you see if you go to home.gs you see you export a function or a component right you export it right here and then inside app.js we import it so i'm going to say here home from components what which one do you think would do home right that's the one we're going to create beautiful all right next thing we're going to do is put the home inside here boom right there all right all right beautiful so let's go ahead and save this one all right i like it i like it i like it and if you go to home.gs we'll call it home so really if we go to our react boom we have home right here right now bars here home is here awesome all right so part one let's focus on just the header for now right our goal is to get to a header that looks pretty much just kind of like this pretty much just kind of like this right here okay it's pretty much just kind of like this all right so what are we going to do inside here well a few things right let's go and dive this up into a few different things well we have here this is the thing about this the divs is we have this is a div this is an image and then we have like a nav menu portion right here right and we call this a nav menu and then this is going to be like um a profile image right here so pretty much we're thinking about three diffs that we need to go ahead and create beautiful all right three dips let's think about this now inside here in terms of container i'm i'm actually going to change this name to not to be contained about i want to change this to be nav so nav and by the way to actually make it happen to this out you see how i just added at the same time here's a cool trick click command d in vs code or ctrl d and it will select all these things automatically for you and you just change on the fly see for example let me see see it changes everything on the fly how cool is that huh give a thumbs up if you think if you think that's cool even though something i think that if you think if you think that's awesome i think it's pretty cool yeah yeah yeah yeah all right there we go beautiful beautiful sweet all right so now instead of doing style that did i want to do style.nav so it's going to be navigation bar and that's just a little more user friendly with html5 that's pretty much the reason why once we've done that let's go ahead and do the following um well let's go ahead and create our actual logo so i'm going to create a logo here logo again it's going also going to be a style component source with a certain image no image just yet okay okay logo let's go ahead and do this const const logo right cons logo style the image logo right there equals oh styled dot image right there that's an image right again and again these quotes right here these quotes this call are called template that rule pretty much right called backticks and this is where we put our css inside here all right beautiful then inside here we're going to give it a width of width of 80 pixels so width 80 pixels all right now with now with guys okay with i'm not the best uh you know i'm not the best typer i will say that with 80 pixels okay all right so so we have the logo i can see there's nothing again does not show up on here but here's what we can do all right now let's go ahead and focus on the nav menu all right so we have the nav menu here nav menu let's create this other component now menu nav menu and we're going to create it into a div so it's the same thing here you see the cool thing about style components is that i'm creating css within the actual javascript file i'll have to go back and forth between two files nav menu equals styled.diff done done done all right that's awesome okay no error so far now how do we go ahead and get this image logo okay now um david or monoth hopefully we have a link down the description basically towards a folder that has an images folder and you should be able to download that folder and maybe a month a day but you can go ahead and send it to me can you send it to me on uh slack or something like that maybe david you can send it to me on slack the actual the actual um um yeah and also i've dropped it in the zoom chats thank you so much drop in the zoom chat for those of you guys who are on youtube it'll be down description uh below okay and of course for those of you who can now keep up right now don't worry you'll be able to watch this back for sure right this is a recording recorded uh you know coaching call kind of right uh we'll be able to rewatch there's no problem so if you cannot keep up with this no problem whatsoever if you can all the best to you right that's thumbs up but if you cannot don't worry right just watch it's about kind of understanding but you'll there's be there is a lot that you will actually learn here just by watching and then once you watch just basically rewatch it a few times later on and then um you know and then do it by yourself kind of maybe after we finish this coaching call okay we finish this live right so there's a folder right here i'm going to open this one up for you guys all right this should be down in the description and do this all right this is the folder down description or down in zoom chat just hitting that one okay there we go and this has all the images and all the videos and there's also like a javascript file as well we will be using that tomorrow actually not so much today what i want you guys to do is download this one so download this one so let's see he's zipping up right now good good good good good and like i said if you cannot keep up just rewatch this video and you know just do your best that's it it's about having fun and enjoying the build with us okay all right all right beautiful all right let's go and continue on so it go ahead with downloaded that's exactly what i want all right i'm going to open this up in my finder window let me let me find it let me find it downloads and see downloads downloads downloads too okay i'm going to unzip it so this is the one that's downloaded i'm going to unzip it this is what i have you see these images right here and so what i want you to do is simply you know where to put it here's where i want you to put it so take out these images you see this images folder you need to put it inside the public folder right here inside the public folder right that's where you need to put that okay let me go ahead and try that but not just images let me see no we don't need just images i actually need everything hold on because i did not download everything let me see i'll make sure to download everything drive i only download the images i should unlock the whole thing to download the whole thing that's what i should have done right there see i only select the images but that's okay download the whole thing here all right okay good good good good good good good all right awesome sweet and i'll bring this up again in finder all right downloads where is it downloads right here okay this is the one we want extract it i'm going to double click it here on mac if you're on windows just go ahead and click on as well just extract it okay beautiful all right so all these things i want you to select these things right here and just basically just move them move them into into the public folder so these videos and images these ones right into the public folder done okay now we have images inside here and the video is inside here alright that's it that is it that you need to do all right beautiful because all these images that we're going to use are they're all pretty much just here okay they should be inside the public folder right here as you can see public and images and videos right there all right hopefully you guys got that thumbs up if you guys got that yes yes yes yes yes yes yes again the folder is in the description below okay description below all right let's go ahead and create the image right so what what i need to do is this for the source it will actually be dash images dash logo dash logo.svg now where is it coming from you see images right here local svg directly from here from here right here okay that's where it's coming from all right all right let's go and save this one refresh boom right there we got the disney plus logo just like that how cool is that right all right beautiful let's go ahead and maybe add some pen into this you see how it's all the way on the top i don't like that instead what i'm going to do is i'm going to center it so to center it i'm actually going to focus on the main nav the nav is this whole div right here okay that's the whole nav and i'm going to tell a display flex right so display file is going to allow us to very easily to very easily very easily structure our code or structure our front end this playflex and so save that see that puts it right there and i'm going to say align item center item center center to center it vertically boom see now center vertically right here i'm going to give some padding i'm going to say padding 0 36 pixels right pending is zero times right now what is all this zero means top and bottom this means zero pixels for top and bottom thirty six plus so this means left and right padding okay that means left and right padding okay that's what that means all right let's go ahead and save that all right beautiful that looks so much better now guys check this out that looks so good all right i love that so logo is there let's now focus on the nav menu that one is a little bit going to be trickier okay and then you will have a few things okay the first thing will be is every single icon here that you see right every single icon what it is is is basically this right here is an a tag this is an a tag and inside here we have a logo and a span tag so let's just go ahead and take a look at this oh if i say here for example if i say oop let's go remove this for a second here boom i'm going to say a boom i'm going to give it a that logo you see which is this image right here right this image right here i'm going to say here image source is equal to beautiful and let's do it go to images images dash home icon home dash icon dot svg done okay all right and then let's go ahead and do a span here all right and we'll give it home done so a tag home so if i say this let's see what this turns out to oh it looks so horrible that's okay no problem whatsoever okay so you can see the icon is there which is great but of course you know the fact the homepage is here the homepage we don't really see that's mainly because of the color right we need to give it a color that's that's pretty much white all right so a few things that i want you guys to think about is the following let's go ahead and focus on this home icon partially the span needs to be color white so to make a color white we need to go to the following let's make the whole thing color white what i mean by that is let's go to index.css all right and this body let's give the full color to white see this one white right it makes this homepage now white see right there it just showed up just like that just like that beautiful all right now let's make this icon be the left side of this home icon right how do we structure from being like this to being like this right that's the question well it's very simple it's all using this play flex so i'm going to go back to my header i'm going to back to my header.js okay how the gs and i will say the following where am i where am i okay yes no menu so here what i'm gonna do display flex if i want display flex on this right now that's not really changing anything here right it's still home is like this uh instead what i will do is the following i will say a here you see and then here i will say display facts again the a we're targeting this a tag that's the link tag right so a will say display flex display flex awesome save that boom you see now this icon all of a sudden now it's very different it's left to right instead of top to bottom just simple as that all right so that's good i'm going to make this all right beautiful right there okay that's the play flex then what i'm going to do is i'm going to align this and say align items items center save it done you see now this home icon is centered right here together with the icon itself okay next up let's go and add some padding to it some say padding padding 0 12 pixels and what this does is this is going to add padding on the left and the right hand side okay beautiful next up let's do the image let's go ahead and change this image because it's way too large right this is this is our this image local so inside style components i'm going to say image now i may wonder now how the hack is like are we able to target all these css like this well that's the power of style components what we can do is we can we can target it basically our elements like a tree for example here we're targeting the a tag within the nav menu div here we're targeting the image tag within the a tag you see so we can do that in style components right for images let's make the image here height of 20 pixels and whenever we give a height uh the width changes automatically beautiful oh so much better so much better so much better all right so much better i like it so much more beautiful we got that portion let's now go to the uh the span tag okay so span okay and then here uh pretty much again nothing much let's change the font size here so we'll say font size not done size font always one size okay font size 13 pixels you guys are good still on on zoom yes you guys are still great yes yes yes yes beautiful yes give me a hum hands up hands up hey let's go beautiful that's what i'm talking about font size 13 pixels let's give it some letter spacing letter spacing and i'm after david if you have any issues just speak out loud and i'll be able to resolve anything okay 1.42 pixels all right and so forth let me see so now you see it changes a little bit there's a little bit of a difference now in terms of how it looks like which is pretty great all right now let's go ahead all we need to do now at this point is very simple is well i pretty much just need to copy this stuff so let's go to here let's remove this it puts all at the bottom we don't need this at all actually we don't even need this portion too either honestly so a tag command c i'm going to duplicate this command v right and instead of down those this for example this will be search search right and this will be instead of homework and this will be search icon search icon all right save that next up look at that you see how to create a it on the right hand side just as we speak right here look at that done beautiful all right next one all right uh just duplicate it here boom next one is gonna be not the home icon but it's gonna be the watch list icon watch list done so all right so we'll say watch list icon in here watch list icon all right same thing going before this the third one or the fourth one my bad there we go oh another one look at that look at that mighty look at that crikey oh no that's that's from a movie all right it's gonna be the original one this time original icon we're going to use and we're going to say originals here already knows all right okay okay same thing again instead of doing this i'm going to do movies here movies movies then we go to movie icon movie icon beautiful all right same thing you see now we have a movie on the right hand side if i scroll down to the right hand side ah it's okay don't worry about that just yet see beautiful look at that ah so good so good all right and then the last one is going to be which one is going to be series last one's going to be series right here so we'll say here we'll say series series and then we'll say series dash icon series dash icons go and save that beautiful look at that oh oh that's so good let's go that's amazing guys that's amazing that's so good there we go look at that so that's our goal to be our navigation menu now at this point no we're not done yet i gotta have some fun sometimes okay all right next up is going to be the user image profile right so let me go ahead all right uh the next one is going to be this one right here which is this little literally this little small icon right here that's all we are going to do uh let me do this here and this this is going to be called the user image so here we'll say user user imager right and so forth now with this image let's go ahead and go down here and we'll say const user image is equal to styled.diff oh no not that div actually that image it's gonna be an image type component you see so with style components you can have different type components images you can have spans you can have divs right nav basically any html component you can have you can have that with a style component all right now on the user image the image we're going to use for the time being is gonna be just this one right here it's gonna be you can use any image you want technically but i have this one right here and hopefully we can have a monitor david put in the chat there we go and that's going to be pretty that's actually my image it's actually me that's not all right let's see let's see how does it look like oh let's go there's me if you have your own picture use your own picture i highly recommend that you use a square picture that's gonna be very very helpful to you okay all right so that's gonna be sick okay so do that now of course we're not done yet uh we need to do is let's go ahead and make this a little bit better well let's go ahead and set the width so check this out guys if i want to edit this style for this i hit command and click on this you see anomalous styles check this out how cool is that huh command click on the actual user image i think in windows is control click i think so or windows click i'm not sure try one of those so inside the user image i'm gonna say width what 48 pixels okay height height also 48 pixels done save it all right now it's a bit smaller which is great and then i'm going to give the border radius for this radius of 50 now what that does is that gives the biscuit a circle that makes it into a circle because the border radius basically has the cur the beautiful most beautiful curvature on the on all the corners right you see right here fifty percent of the full image is gonna be basically curved up that's what i mean next thing i'm to make it to cursor pointer the reason why we do that is because so it looks like or it feels like you know a button beautiful all right now oh let's go all right last thing look at this you see how this icon is all always left inside well what i can do is i can actually expand the nav menu then that menu right here to push this icon all the way to the right hand side by using what what do you guys think we can do here let me know what do you guys think put in the chat what do you guys think we can do to push this nav menu right here all the way to the right hand side well that's very simple actually i can go to the nav menu and i can say the nav menu hey you know what let's give the flex of a one look at this another menu let's say flex one and what that does that's biscuit says look at this that says hey this menu is the most important thing right and you want to expand it as much as possible and so that's what that what that does okay i'm going to give it a small margin left 20 pixels margin left margin left 20 pixels ah margin dash left i'm gonna give it 20 pixels any pixels right here uh 25 actually give some spacing on the left inside there you go just to give spacing and then the last i want to do is for each a tag i'm going to give it a cursor pointer all right cursor pointer and what that does is gonna make it like a hand there we go now it's a hand you see that right there now it's a hand okay but okay we're not done yet i also want to make this into a line item center so this basically will here we'll center it vertically so online items might not change might not change a little bit just see that does not change much honestly right here beautiful right there all right so alignment center and that's looking pretty good won't you say so what do you guys think let me know let me know in the comments below let me know in the chat what are you guys saying so far that's looking really really good so far all right i like it next up all right next one let's go ahead and make that a beautiful animation that we have which is this one so this is going to be really really cool the way we'd make this happen is really cool really cool all right monique says beautiful i like it thank you monique all right let me go and check up on youtube here for a second here all right that's what i'm talking nicholas says awesome sweet flex ah you guys are amazing i like it nice bro javier says nice bro all right all right now a few things that we need to make to make it kind of like uh you know to make that portion happen so um check this one out this is going to be like a really cool trick that maybe you have now learned before but inside the um here inside this pan this pan here's what we can do we can use something called um after so what does it do right here i'm gonna say here i'm gonna say this this after now what this adds is this adds almost like a div this adds a div right here so i'm gonna say after i'm gonna give a content and i'll explain what again what it does in a second here content of empty string okay and i'm going to give it a height so imagine like a normal div height of two pixels i have two pixels and i'm going to say background is white background is white okay and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to position okay well for now it's going to see what does that do and let's see refresh ah nothing so much because we need to give the width so let's give it a actually give the contour like hello jello see there you go there it is right here it's called jello see and it's back on color white if i remove this background color white jello now what it does if i inspect the element on this one here's what it does is it adds a div after the ending of everything so check this out if i go to span you see there's home and then there's a after imagine this after almost like a div like a div you see and it has the content yellow and a height of two pixels and with that we can actually be very very very useful we can actually be very smart with that let's go and save this beautiful all right let's go and do that save that all right and of course we don't need jello at this point right no i mean unless you guys like jello who likes jello here anybody likes jello here i like jello i'm a big fan of jello i love jello that's my favorite favorite type of food okay love jello all right beautiful there we go that's what i'm talking about so let's go ahead and do the following now so how am i going to position this you see how this is positioned inside here especially at the bottom how do we make that work well let's think about it i'm going to use something called position absolute so here's what i'll do i'll do position absolute absolute absolute right here and i'll give a top of zero of zero and i'll explain well how that works out a little bit top left of zero right of zero and then bottom is actually going to be minus six pixels so y minus now you might be asking well a few reasons why i save this and you can see right there it's still not shown now because why we need to give it if you're going to position absolute something it needs to be positioned absolute to what to a relative object well let's make the same the the span position relative it's like you have to give it a parent to cling on to right so let's go ahead and save that position relative content high 20 pixels okay okay okay opacity of one background color white all right let's go and refresh this still not there let me see make sure it's all that it's all good let me see inspect that one on this one home oh because i did not put this correctly there you go boom right there you see now it's at the top okay it's at the top why because i i thought this top zero don't need this remove this one tab zero boom now to the bottom you see that right there look now it's at the bottom so we have this line here that was created how well we said that okay you have this div right here it's called a span okay we have this div and we said hey you know what let's all let's go ahead and create another div we're using after but let's make that div which is this one right here let's make this small div let's give it a height of two pixels a background color of white and let's absolute position it to the left where there's no space to the left there's no space to the right and from the bottom it's like for example hey from the left create no spacing from the right there's no spacing and then from the bottom there's only negative six pixels meaning it will push it down it will actually push down the div below this band component that's a really cool part you need to understand right it will push down below the span component okay let's go ahead and continue on all right awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweets with you guys still good yes yes yes yes yes beautiful beautiful beautiful all right all right derek i think you're still good alex you're still a good jared i think look you're still good as well beautiful leonard as well and same as christian all right sweet sweet tweet all right all right now the way we need to start out now of course when we go ahead and build stuff like this of course you see how the does not show up until until we actually do something about it right until we hover over it so how do we make that happen well um very simple very simple let's do initially we're going to give the passive zero passive zero passive zero and then we'll do transform skill x0 so what does this do scale x0 this is going to scale the i'm going to go ahead and comments opacity here for a second so it's going to scale the div to zero if i do 0.5 it's going to make it 0.5 you see that right there 0.5 as simple as that right right if i make it for example 1 then it's going to be the full thing right there see but if i do 0 it's going to make it 0. okay now in our case i'm going to make it 0 and also passes zero and then what here's what we'll do on the hover of span on the hover actually have the whole a tag which is inside here look at this i'll do the following this this this will say hover voila all right we'll do span after right right and the hover of this of this span after we'll say transform transfer scale x into one so we go from zero to one scale when basically from zero width to the full 100 width that's what that means and then i'm going to give opacity of one look at that all right let's try it let's try it oh oh does not work that's okay that's okay because we need to give it a transform from what to what to try this out i need to get this transform origin from left to center let's refresh again oh two two two that's not really happening here let's go ahead and see what's going on here so we have a tag that's on here on the hover of that span recon the span which is that one right after transform transform scale x one oh right here right there that's the one boom boom boom boom look at that see boom boom boom so it shows up on the hover you see opacity want to transfer scale wax one but let's make it even beautiful beautiful look at this all right i'm going to add a transition and here's the transition this is a special transition and this says transition everything all all attributes at 250 milliseconds and this is a special type of tradition right this right here basically says what type of a transition there's like a linear transition this is this right here number has a special temperatures and maybe for example a month maybe guess you can put it down the chat and zoom this specific text right here right cubic biz right here all right so it's a really cool transition that if i now apply this oh oh oh let's go let's go boom boom boom boom boom boom look at that guys how cool is that look at that how cool is that what do you guys think huh that's pretty awesome what'd you think so that's pretty awesome you can actually have this so guess that it's this one right here pubic bizarre right a little bit desire use that one you can do linear as well but uh you can do linear but we don't want that that's not not not not too much fun all right so save that and that's it our header now at this point is officially done that's it it's done done so that's it comprende all right all right so that's all good header is finished okay header is finished and let's go ahead and go to here i get and i'm going to actually save it so i'm going to say add header so i'm going to save this inside the git and i want you guys to get users doing stuff with this as well so add header that's going to save it into our git all right and that's it we don't have to worry about anything else at this point besides that that looks so good by the way that looks so good that's so looks so good well don't you guys think it looks awesome raising everything this looks amazing yeah and it's the way it's done is very intricate too it's all using css you see right this transform origin is saying hey go from the left corner to the center right here you see kind of uh from left corner to center that's the same the translation say transition all of this and the transform says scale it from zero to one that's it that's all i was saying that's as simple as that all right let me see now disappointing youtube we have 356 people on youtube let's go 423 people on youtube that is beautiful amazing amazing excited to see all of you wow wow that's actually pretty great all right so that's what we have this at this point okay i know everybody looks yeah it's amazing it's cool that's cool it's cool i like it okay so that's part one let's now look at the home page okay the home page now let me go ahead and focus put this on the right hand side and put them on the righthand side all right home page is done check mark all right next up header is done check mark next up is home page hemp homepage is going to be a little bit more difficult but that's completely okay let's go to home page all right um so at the homepage we'll have a few things all right of course uh let's start out with a container here like we always like to do so let's go and import style components here import styled from from what style components dash components all right sweet import staff the style components let's do the following so const container equal styled da what style.differ now oh actually no style domain so main is actually a great it's a very html5 friendly basically it tells google or any other browser that this is the main content right so it's the same thing as saying div except that uh you know underneath the hood uh google likes to read that so that's how you say main all right now for this one let's do the following for this one okay um a few things a few things all right a few things we need to think about here uh first things first let's do a min height so what we need to do min height and height here so what is the main height uh really it's the following um remember how this height is 70 pixels so this right here is 70 pixels okay that's 70 pixels all right then this means that this will be what the rest correct so that this right here means will be those will be the rest of the the height right so that's what that's what that means well to make that happen here's what we can do i can say calc so css can actually calculate stuff for you i can say a hundred vh that means a hundred vertical height 100 that's the full width from top to bottom of the view view height viewport that's the browser height minus 70 pixels right so that's the height i mean height is this full height beautiful we got that all right all right so we have that and then and then let's add a padding to it padding padding and i'm going to go to zero calc here and all this is saying is this is 3.5 view or vertical uh kind of view width 2.4 or 3.5 actually 3.5 view width plus 5 pixels that's just pretty much it's nothing too crazy just a very simple calculation so this means top bottom 0 pixels left and right is this one right here sorry all right now how do we actually see this well it's very simple let's go ahead and actually add a background color here background blue let's see our let's see background blue okay does not show up on there background color blue blue is it there or no let me see inspect element in this one let me see inspect that one here uh body root app oh here's why the reason why it's not working is because remember what we did here is we forgot to put the container so container is actually being used here instead of div container boom container nice i like oh that's cool let's remove this hideous color please i don't like that okay so so that's all good now the color that we do want to use however is going to be like a home color a background color it's going to be actually this color right here so what i want you guys to do to add a nice background color is go to initial.css here and this is css here and let's go to body and do here background color right here hashtag zero four zero seven one four it's a nice color that we're going to use for the disney plus clone okay that's yeah that's everything nothing too crazy just just a very simple one okay just about that all right beautiful all right next up so that's all good let's go ahead and go to home.js all right i like it i like it like that i like it like okay anyways anyways guys all right let me see so that's all good next up is gonna be watch next up is going to be we need to now add the background image now if we look at our disney plus clone make it a little bit bigger you see we have this background image that looks that's in here see this as i scroll you see it's there you see that as i scroll there's a background image in there you can have to look very close in here you see it's a background image so how do we make that work well um let's take a look at it what we're going to do is we're going to use this after before stuff that we talked about before okay before that's that's a fun that's a funny pun funny partners before all right done before and it basically will add a div before the container check this out i'm going to say background background here now see url boom done okay i'm going to give it dash images dash images a dash home dash background that what that png done okay now so that's the url i'm gonna say center that's the vertically center horizontally centered right and then i'm going to say what um center dash where am i right okay center then i want to cover cover and then i'm going to say no repeat and fixed so no repeat means do not repeat this no repeat do not repeat repeat uh this image right and it can be a fixed image now half fixed we'll talk about that in a second here all right now it's still not there of course it's not here right you don't see you don't you only see oh that's not good right you still see only this no problem whatsoever right so let's do this right so again it's url images whole background png center center cover no repeat fix no changes so far don't worry i'm gonna do content here check this out now content nothing just how we usually like to do it okay now again if i add content for example like yo save that yo see it adds a before right there see let's go ahead and do it like this right there i think i'm going to position absolute it that's the cool part position position absolute right all right right and i'm going to say now the following top 0 left 0 0 then i'm going to say right zero right and then bottom uh bottom zero right save that now still nothing happens why because the following because we need to make it absolute to what i need to make this position relative save that all right save it let's see let's see position relative background is this content is this and fixed the mississippi absolute two to two refresh this i don't really see that background image there there's no bueno let me see url am i doing this right bottom zero i'm gonna say z index minus one all right i don't see the background image just yet don't worry about that we'll make that happen a little bit here let's see i think has to put this background let me let me try this for a second here boom okay so there was a little bit of mix up here so i guess i did it wrong in terms of how we set the background so here's what we'll do background url right there images home background.png center center this horizontal vertical center this is basically the type of positioning here right this is background position cover right we need to add a dash here so dash cover cover and after that we say no repeat and then we say fixed okay so thick fixed means basically fixed on the page so if i scroll if i scroll it will always be fixed on there okay that's what that means guys if i scroll it will always be fixed under that's what that means look how good this looks already it's so good so good i like it that looks beautiful and again how does it work again right because if you think about this let's look at our rectangle here boom there's a rectangle right that's our home let's go ahead and force this here this right here is our home component you can see right then what we did is when we did before we added another div right there's no name for it right and we give it a content of nothing and we did position absolute top zero left zero right zero bottom zero meaning that means that it's going to be zero pixels from the left zero pixels from the top zero pixels from the bottom from the bottom right zip is from the right so when you do that you stretch the whole div to the end of this dip like so oops to this day right here that's what you do and so now we have this extra div this blue absolute it will not move anywhere and it will be behind all content all the time because we give it a z index of minus one that's why okay so i want you guys to really think about that z in this minus one is a big deal this is z 01 you will later on if you will see when i add content to it like if i do for example if i forgive me let's remove this for a second here see the home was gone right if i'd do zms1 home was out there you see that's why that's why that's so important okay and honestly that's it you're done on this container home now of course no you're not pretty much done but this is looking now very good raise your hand if you're still with me are you still with me raise your hand yeah you guys still with me how beautiful is this turn out to be just within about what one hour at this point within one hour we've gone so far now exactly it's beautiful all right and on youtube guys i know you guys are killing it as well it's a lot of fun all right so we got that portion we got this i like it i like it like that okay anyways all right um so now next portion is going to be the image slider which is going to be oh this is going to be so much fun you guys are you ready for the image slider oh that's gonna be a fun one it's gonna be a fun one because i know you guys will be confused that's why that's why exactly why so but it's okay we'll we'll do this together don't worry about that so image slider so what are we going to use for this image slide well the first thing to do is we need to create the actual component so let's go ahead and do inside the components folder right click new file and we'll say what we'll say image image slider dot js done all right let's do rsce to create a component all right and we'll say image slider here all right save that beautiful image slider and of course it's not here because we need to import it so let's go back to our home.js which is right here and let's import that right just how we always import we like to import so import what image image slider from what from going to be from what is it guys what is it component right what is it well directly from here because our image slide is inside this folder components folder and our homepage inside this folder so we'll say dot dash image slider save that let's go and create the component side here now so say image slider done all right boom image sliders right here all right so that's pretty good i'm pretty happy about that how that's turning out all right it's really really good actually i like that a lot all right so that's really cool so and now let's actually work inside the image slider let's go into here but now we're inside here okay all right inside here a few things we need to do what we're going to use to do to do my slider is something called react slick check this out sorry let me get some water i'm dying out here oh yeah you guys don't want me to die right i hope so i hope not all right so there we go so it's called react slick and it will give you some examples here but basically it's a react module that's been built for us to make beautiful sliders so right here reacts to the documentation right there boom see right there and this looks pretty much exactly the same as what we're trying to build and it actually tells us how we need to build this there's a settings there's a component right here there's settings we need to give it and then we just return the div you can see we will use the slider component that's this one right that's like opponent and then we'll use it where we'll use it inside here right there right so that's how we need to do so the first thing we need to do is we need to install image slider and well to make that happen let's go back to here react slick all right all right so okay so npm install reacts like dash dash let's go and copy that all right let's open up our terminal which we like to do by rightclicking and open an integrate terminal no problem right click on package.json or whatever you have to click right click on this opens up this okay so do npm install react.save done hit enter okay that will install the react slick module for you okay done that's all good we're not done yet though now we need to do npm install select carousel this will install us the css we need to use so next one is gonna be npm install let's look here so that's the next one and enter and look at this guys it literally has 746 000 weekly downloads this tells me that this is a good module to download no good homage to not good module to download basically it's very well supported that's what that tells me okay okay now what we do is we need to now import the css files here okay and need to import of course import the actual uh the actual as well slider so let's do that so here we'll say import import slider from react dash slick dash slick all right save that right and then we'll do the following we'll save here we'll say let settings uh don't let's not do that just yet actually i'll do that just yet get that for a second here and then we need to import the css files right here imports like carousel right here so these ones are really really important so import and hopefully a month dave you can guys can take care of it maybe you guys can put in the chat something to put on a chat hopefully uh imports like yourself looks like that css right there that's the one that we need to use okay all right save that beautiful and we're not done yet so now at this point that's gonna use style components as well so let's go ahead and import style components of course they were currently here okay there so let's go ahead and do import style components import styled import styled styled from from what styled dash components done stylish components alright so that's that's good and instead of doing uh div we're gonna say carousel so command d just like both carousel done and let's create that style component we'll say const carousel is equal to what not style.div actually but check this out remember how we had to use slider remember how inside here we had to use slider component you see which came directly from here remember that well watch this instead you install the div i'm going to say styled slider basically instead of doing slider inside directly inside here i'm i'm giving it a style component because then i can actually style it myself right that's the whole reason why right that's the cool part about this so slider okay so that's there uh everything's gone everything's deleted that's okay don't worry there's a reason for it probably i know 100 hopefully i think it's because the fact that we imported slider and we have not given any settings yet so don't worry about that so let's go ahead and create some settings we'll do let settings equals the following and there's a few things we can set there's like dots you know infinite true speed and so forth and first dots so that's the dots that will show up at the bottom so we'll say dots that's going to be true comma then we'll say infinite that's true basically you will infinitely should be able to infinite infinite that's going to be true as well all right then speed is gonna be 500 that's 500 milliseconds that's basically half a second okay slice to show one to show ah my bad it's gonna be one comma and then we're going to do uh [Laughter] slice to scroll how many slices scroll per scroll basically slides to scroll is going to be one as well okay and auto uh auto play is going to be true boom so this is our settings okay i'll play is equal to true let's get the things down to here now the way we do that is using something this called destructuring you see how would they do it here it's called destructuring that's what that that's what that does so say dot dot dot settings basically it's put it puts in basically all of these all of these settings directly into the carousel div as a as a basically as a what's it called so save that why is my thing not working that's interesting right click it inspect element where is my header where's everything it's not it's not there at all the help carousel they're just going nuts on me let's go inspect down below here body the root oh there's something happening here it's very interesting something fail which i'm like oh oh slider occur in the div component element type is invalid expected string for builtin components of a class function react dom undefined but you likely forgot to export your component from the file is defined in or you might have mixed up default or name view okay imports interesting style import slider die right through rightly let me see slider import slider from carousel slick see import slider make sure it's all good guys and on youtube do you guys have the same and you guys are the same issue other just me maybe it's just me it's okay we'll be able to solve anything we put our mind to correct cons carousel that's fine that's so good we imported it correctly which is correct right um maybe it's because we need to have an actual div inside here let's try let's see this let me let me show this let me try this for a second here okay let me try this for a second here one second i'm going to do rap is a style.diff don't worry about it don't worry don't worry i got you guys so constraint is equal to style.div okay let's see okay so all right so the reason why it wasn't working looks like is all right so oh i know i know it's don't worry about it it's gonna get fixed okay so the reason why that's working because when we put it into the slider right there's really literally nothing here right there's nothing to slide and so it gives us errors right because it probably expects us to have some kind of a slider right it's some kind of uh the actual image inside here because if you look at here right we need to give it a div right a div to slide through so day of h1 or h3 whatever might be right and so we're doing here is we're creating a d well to create a div what we're going to do is the following so let's go back to here right again it's going to be not going to work but we're going to create a wrap here a wrap div so that's gonna be it's just a normal div going to be a style component which we created inside here construct style.div okay and then inside here we're going to create an image that's the images we're going to uh now that's going to show up basically so do the following so we'll say image here say image and we'll say source is equal to the following okay there's going to be dash images images dash slider slider dash badging that jpeg there we go and close it out alright so good that's image one and then i'm going to get another image let's go ahead and do another image there we go now we have ourselves a slider right now it looks horrible i know it's like bad boom very bad right now would you agree with me that's bad right right raise your hand that's that's bad right that's pretty bad yeah i'll agree with that yeah you guys want to make it better shall we make it better yeah shall we make it better i think so i think so all right uh this pretty much just requires a a little bit of css that's that's pretty much all it does it all requires okay um so let's go ahead and actually look at our css here i'm gonna put this here uh boom right here hold that here all right so we're going to focus on the carousel here let's do a margin top here for a second so margin top so margin dash top is going to be 20 pixels boom all right that's going to basically push a little bit oh they'll just go away what the hell i don't know what just happened so save that so it pushes the slider over to the bottom which that's what i like to do that's what i kind of like right so i kind of want to put a little bit more to the towards the bottom okay all right okay all right awesome sweet that's that all right and then what i want to do is well a few things um let's focus on the wrap here for a second here okay this wrap let's look on this image okay image let's focus on this image and with this image let's give the width width of a hundred percent and a height of a hundred percent okay boom right there see done so with a hundred percent higher and now it's a lot lot better would you agree with me that one i would say so um next up for this one let's change this one to not be slider badging let's change it to be slider b b a badagh but that that's actually inside the images folder but dag the jpeg all right so that means we have now two different images you see right there but dag but that's funny but doug that's funny all right on the image side um a few things i want to give it a little bit of a curvature here so let's do the following so a little bit of a curvature uh when i do the following so i'm going to say image and i'm going to say border radius okay border radius border radius radius or four pixels it's going to curve a little bit of that of that kind of like this image a little bit maybe you see it see right there maybe you see that right there see that you see how curves it a little bit i see that cursor just a little bit right there just right there okay okay and then i'm going to give it a box shadow now i want you guys to copy this one okay this box shadow check this out okay right there so rgb basically that's basically where the color is coming from to the color to where it's going so it's very simple right rgb right here maybe uh david armando maybe you guys can put in this box shout out for everybody in the comments below zero plus 26 plus so 30 30 pixels minus 10 pixels maybe yes you can put it's basically just a box shadow style that's all it is now i know it looks horrible right now it looks horrible now don't worry don't you worry at all okay so back shut up look at that oh that looks so good it looks so good all right i mean actually does not look good i'm sorry um does not look good at all actually so the reason why it does not look good at all because inside this right here this slick component it's called slick component we call it um we don't you see how in reality we're supposed to see all these other images you see that all these other images on the right hand side and the lefthand side you see that but we don't see that the reason being is because there's no overflow hidden on this div overflow biscuit on any overflow it hides the rest so to prevent that what we're going to do is the following so i'm going to say inside the carousel i'm going to target the slick list select dash list and here i'm going to say overflow visible boom holy that made a big difference you see just like that look see overflow visible to oral flow hidden right so before initially it was hidden by default that was inside their css that would they that they give you you see now it's visible visible visible done now it's visible okay right there so that's going to be that right there awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet oh that looks so good okay that looks so good look at that oh that's so good guys how cool is that raise your hand with me if you're still with me yes yes yes everybody everybody everybody beautiful i like it it's looking so good we're making such good progress i love it all right so that's overflow visible and then what we're going to do is a few things i'm i need to change up to make it even better okay let's give a small border uh so let's go to border i'm going to say border 4 pixels here on this image i'm going to say border 4 pixels solid right transparent now what does that mean transparent is the color you see it adds a small like just transparent color now again right here it's kind of like right here and don't worry we'll fix it kind of how it looks like again it looks a little bit odd right here i know don't worry about it we'll fix that in a second here oh for example here so it's gonna be a transparent border right um next thing let's do the following here um on the carousel on the carousel so we have slick list then we're going to add a color white on all these active buttons right so let's do the following to do that i'm going to say li dot slick active so when there's an active button active button before right now how does this work out i will show you a little bit here for a second here and i'm going to say color white white okay ally slick that's actually inside let me see the carousel [Laughter] okay i'm also gonna do the following so i'm gonna say on every single button right here i'm gonna say ul ally button these are the basically the the next button right here and i'm gonna say like this before before i want to say here font size let's say font size i'm going to increase the fonts decrease fonts just a little bit so font says 10 pixels right there okay i'm gonna say give it a color this it gives i mean it can be cool it can be just a white color right there so these buttons right here see see boom all right so but i'm gonna give this a more gentle color i don't like that actually too much i like this color right here this guy's a little more gentler i kind of like that a little better a little better okay so that's kind of that color white uh same thing with right there oh you see how when it has like this white more of a more of a white look when on the active on the active button you see that right there see right there beautiful all right now you see how we have the next button but we don't have the previous button the reason by why is because of dz index so if i do button here and i give it a z index of one a one check this out oh let's go you see it right there that my friends is basically what we need right that's that's pretty much that let me go ahead and zoom in on this let me see how does this look like what do you guys think so far it's working pretty good i think so too i think so too i like it i like it i like it i like it i like it like that all right that's looking pretty good i like the way it's going oh my god not save this i don't want that that's pretty pretty good and then the next thing we need to do it to make it work a little bit better is is the following so so check this out um you see how here you see how this like this border is within this image see it's like a little bit better right that's kind of how i like it a lot better so what we'll do is this is called because of box sizing it's it's a little bit a little bit weird but i want you guys to understand this a little bit here it's all because of box setting border box so you see how these borders are on the outside here on the outside well to make them on the inside to make the basically included part of the whole image i'm going to go to app.css and i'm going to say everything that you have oops oops oops oops yeah box sizing board box save that boom see big difference look at that you see now what happens with this is basically it's telling for example uh border box when i say border box is saying hit the content should contain the border itself basically the width contains the border that's what that means right and so that's way when i say with 100 right the width actually is contained within the border that's what that means right that's how we can see the border which is much much better now and i like that a lot better honestly yeah oh let's go look at how good that looks guys that looks so so good oh my god it makes me happy all right let's go back to home.js let's go to image slider back to here we're not done yet we're almost done but not done yet almost there but we're not there we're so close but we're not there yet let's go all right uh next thing um i want to give it a small hover effect so what i mean by that on the hover of the image fully i want to change the sm a few small things i'm going to command b in here okay so i'm going to say hover i'm going to say hover hover and i'm gonna change the color the color of the board to be white so i'm gonna say border is gonna be four pixel solid solid but this time the border color is gonna be this one right here oh we see this rgba 249 so it's almost like a white color with a little bit of transparency and then save that let's see oh let's go look at that right there see okay next thing let's give a cursor point to the wrap cursor cursor pointer the wrap okay so when i hover it's like actually like a it's actually like a cursor right here you see it's good beautiful and then the last let's give it a transition so the transition duration should be transitioned let's give it extra transition so we'll say transition duration seconds oh look at that so much better you guys so so so much better that's so much better what do you guys think huh what do you guys think i like that so much better uh i need to fix this question right here soon as before i should be before and here okay there's the color white i'll refresh this oh let's go beautiful beautiful beautiful and guys we have made ourselves a a carousel that's it the carousel is right there now you might be wondering i want to ask you questions let me have a question do you raise your hand if you think you want to you're tr you're wondering like how the heck does this work like richard if you're wondering how the hell does this work okay good so look so because this is actually part of this is within the actual what's it called this is within um um i must say oh yeah we also need to fix this portion i want you to fix this don't worry we'll fix this i got it we'll play this in a second okay here so if i right click on this inspect element let me put this here a little bit to the bottom here okay i'm gonna put it here uh this is the button here you see button see this button so what's gonna happen we have this you see here look a line slick active so automatically basically javascript underneath the hood is adding a slick active class you see this to this li bone force is here then it goes to here and so we're doing here we're targeting a css call a class called called li slick active right there and then we're targeting the button now look at this see there's buttons you see this so button okay let me just let me let me do autoplay false for now so that stops here okay so it stops moving around right so you see here right there so button here so now this is a slack active here i'm gonna say button and look before you see so align slick active button before and then we've done it this actually is done through the slick carousel module right they do this themselves and look at that this before button has a color black what we did we said no make it color white that's what we do we overwrote overwrote the natural natural css that comes with react slick do you understand that raise your hand if you understand it with me yes do you see what i'm talking about do you see what i'm talking about yes we overwrote it but because by default by default the slick active if you go to slick active you go to that button then go to before see slick active button before by default it's just color black see here that's the default css that comes with the slick theme which is this one right here you see with this slick theme css but we said no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no we're going to change ourselves that's what happened here so that's what we did here color white that's it all right and that's what happened now funny enough let's go ahead and fix this portion because that's pretty bad huh you guys want to fix that yeah if you because i'll fix that yeah i think so too all right well that's honestly that's not that bad to fix so what we need to do is we need to go to actually index.css uh i actually need to go to home.css home so home.js let's go home.js and all you need to do on the home.js is just say overflow hidden that's it so overflow here overflow inside the home.js overflow x is going to be hidden save it and so save that refresh is still there ah that's it and then also do the same thing on the header actually let's go to header actually so ahead of the gs same thing on the nav let's do overflow exiting overflow dash x dash hidden and what really this does is very simple guys overflow based basically means when some content overflows what your view your view with like if a content overflows your view with we simply just hide it and you see right there we don't have that weird camaraderie going on anymore it's that's it it's done that's it awesome let's go back to image slider and let's go back to autoplay and we'll say the true now save it there we go awesome sweet all right we got that that's all good all right so raise your hand they're still with me everybody's still with me all right next up look guys we have made our own image character and it looks sick it looks so good it looks so good looks so good boom boom boom boom boom boom boom wait was it false or true like this yeah to go true awesome it looks so good all right the next thing we need to work on is going to be uh these portions right here so this portion so these portions can be really fun to make actually so we're going to call them cold they're go they're going to be called viewers is what they're going to be called so let's go to here let's call them viewers so let's create a new component here and so new component new file let's call this viewers v e v i e dot j s dot g s right there you're the g yes all right so that's going to be viewers.js and what we need to do with this one is very simple is let's go and do rfce and viewers right there so save that awesome sweet save that and the following needs to happen now at this point is to okay and we need to of course now input this i'm going to say viewers here viewers let's go to import it inside where import inside the home.js so imported helm let's do import import import viewers viewers from from where from dot slash viewers v right now ah this one yours right there okay let's also go ahead and we save this so go ahead to add image slider slider let's go and save that all right that looks so good looks so good alright sweet so that's amazing i like that import viewers and let's go and actually use this one so we'll say viewers let's use this component let's use a component i like it now drivers virus viewers let's go all right that looks sick okay boom all right so that's that one and of course now if we go ahead to our wrecked app boom we have viewers right here you see of course that's not what we want to do but that's what we got so far understand comprende all good good all right let's now work inside the viewers.js file which is gonna be pretty pretty simple it's not gonna be it's not gonna be anything too crazy anything in terms of css uh you'll just learn some stuff so let's go ahead and do import style you know the drill guys import styled styled from what from style components styled dash components components save that awesome okay and let's go ahead and create the container container and let's go and create the the container component so i'll say container here so const const container is equal to styled dot div the div done so done okay simple so all right now let's go ahead and do the following uh let's do this point let's give us a padding for us so the container let's do padding padding let's do some stuff let's do container padding 0 0 26 pixels and what is this actually on about what is this 26 pixels well if i go and take a look at this here let's go and say this right click viewers come on good okay so this one here right there so 26 pixels means literally heading bottom 26 pixels that's the shortcut for this one right pending bottom 26 pixels that's what that means okay all right now okay so that's all good that's so good now let's go ahead and take a look at it what are we going to put in here well this one is going to have a few things inside inside here actually no i need to be inside here ah container no actually it's not anybody my bad hold on that's not right hold on so this right here uh actually let's do margin top my bad margin dash top margin top and we'll say 30 pixels here hey that makes more sense right 30 pixels that push it pushes it more to the bottom um let's do the following now let's do display grid so this would be really interesting now we're going to go into grid now now what is this grid raise your hand if you know what grid is anybody know what grid is what is grid or just yeah so what is grid so grid is basically it's kind of like flex but it allows us to be very discreet it's like a it's it's a it's basically like a uh you know flex and steroids that's what i'll call it you know that's what i'll call it and we'll give it a grid and we'll say here we'll say grid template columns so we'll have three so we have falcon with template template columns columns and with query template columns well actually then before we do that let me go ahead and comment this portion now just so i can show it to you inside the container of course we do we need to have all these images right so we need to create the wrap so i'm going to say create wrap wrap for this one wrap all right so my every single thing is going to be a wrap so this is going to be your app that's going to be a wrap it's going to be individual divs right here that's what these are okay understand comprende good right wrap and every single wrap is we'll have an image so the image image and we'll say source is equal to and it's going to be this one this is the image right here so hopefully maybe you guys see you guys know where to get it or maybe a month dave can help you guys out and actually give you guys the image okay so images viewers disney wrap is undefined don't worry we'll define it right now so it's like const const rap is equal to styled dot div boom style.if that's what it's equal to okay okay so style.div boom right there that's amazing okay and oh my god it looks so bad don't worry about it so let's go ahead and create a few of them okay so let's go ahead and do actually create five of them oh my god it looks so bad two three four five okay all righty let's go look at this it looks horrible i know it's okay don't worry about it so now to fix that that's where grizz is gonna come in so let's go try this out so it's grid and i'm going to give the columns now so look at this grid type of columns i'm going to say repeat so what this says create five columns so five comma min max and what this does is it gives it a width basically what is it we should use well minimum is zero basically but the one fr simply means stretch it out as much as possible basically that's what one frame stands for okay boom all right okay now it's kind of like in line but it still looks horrible uh and so that's where we need to actually go to the wrap and actually fix that right because technically we have five grids if you look at it right look see one see five grits one two three four five you see it's there it's just that disney the images are actually overflowing that's what's got what's going on right here so to fix that if we go to wrap and we say here image right i'm gonna say a width of a hundred percent so basically the image should take up a hundred percent a hundred percent done okay oh boom right there awesome sweet right so i'm then i'm going to saying i'm gonna i'm gonna say height over all those 100 say height 100 boom right then i'm going to say object fit so object fit means hey fit up the object as much as possible so object fit cover so fitted the image as much as possible inside this div awesome and that's honestly pretty much it now for this wrap let's give it some stuff let's give this this so we'll say here uh border let's give it a border and the border will be look like a little bit like this kind of it's a very light border look three pixel solid rgba that's the rgb i want you guys to use right 249 249 and 0.1 so it's a very light border let's go and save that okay border is not showing up let's see not showing up which is completely okay border oh i didn't real right here border see border zero pixels oh solid solid right there awesome so that looks great so we have one two three four five things that we have okay now of course let's add some border radius to this one let's say border radius border dash radius radius and let's give it a 10 pixel radius nice oh it looks so much better now now it still looks pretty bad i don't like it did you guys agree that this would you guys agree that it needs some spacing in between like in between every single column would you would you guys agree with me on that one should we add some spacing yeah beautiful all right beautiful so to do that we're going to use a gap we're going to use something called gap so check this out okay let's use grid gap grid dash gap and i will say 25 pixels boom oh look at that so grid gap is a very useful tool okay it's a very useful way to add a gap between every single grid item boom see so simple so simple right and now let's go ahead maybe add some uh let's get add some padding inside this container so say padding let's say 30 pixels zero and we'll say 26 pixels boom so push it over the bottom so basically if you inspect them but on this one if i go ahead and go look at this specific padding you see this literally just means it's very simple padding top is 30 pixels putting right is zero putting left is zero and then pending bottom is 26. this is this means top this is bottom this right here stands for left and right that's what that means okay all right beautiful all right so that's that now let's go ahead and give it a box shadow okay i'm gonna get a box shot it looks a little bit kind of like this right there so again you can copy this as well hopefully maybe uh david and my mother can put it for you guys in the comments or maybe he'll put you guys in the comments in there just a box show just kind of copy it for yourself here all right so that's that so gives it you see that gives it that box which is really good by the way which looks so good which i like a lot actually it's a very light back shadow okay and then let's do a hover effect so on the hover i actually want to make it bigger so let's do on the hover now by the way do you know what this does what does this do do anybody raise your hand you know what this does raise your hand if you don't know what this does so this actually basically concatenates the hover to the parent which is the wrap it's kind of like doing it's kind of like doing for example wrap wrap hover that's what it's doing so basically this is concatenating hover to the wrap that's what it's doing just so you guys know okay all right on the hover let's go ahead and change up the particular let's do scale it so it's going to scale it in x and y direction so transform skill so scale just simply means make it bigger okay and then we'll change the border color to be a little more different as well yes boom okay so now if i say this boom you see it's a little bit different now but of course we can make it better let's add a cursor point this one cursor pointer pointer save that okay now now to cursor pointer which i like a lot awesome sweet god it looks so good guys it looks so awesome i love it all right that's cursor pointer and then what i want to do is i want to go ahead and change up the box shadow here as well just a little bit let's do box shadow change the box just a little bit here not not not too much so it becomes a big becomes a bigger box shadow but to make this actually cleaner we're going to give it a transition boom so this is truly biscuit transition everything with by the way this number remember this number i want you guys to remember this this is a big number here this number is actually used in a lot of transitions this is if you if you give it to if you give it a number higher than this it became becomes too slow if you get a number less than this it becomes sometimes too fast so actually this number is actually used by a lot of developers this number 250 milliseconds so just keep this one in mind okay and this is the transition we want to use right here cubic desire desire all right save that and look now look at this you guys ready for this you guys ready are we ready hold on oh oh my god that looks so good oh oh so good oh this looks so good oh that looks great that looks amazing i love this one i love that one the border changes transformation oh it looks so good how cool is that huh so that's pretty much that for you so look we finished the viewers but of course let's go ahead and change up these images so they're a little bit better a little bit better so we have viewers disney and then we have what viewers and pixar let's go ahead and do pixar here pixar okay let's do marvel marvel and then we'll do star wars star wars okay and then we'll do national right here international boom save that oh let's go that looks so good oh look at that guys but this is our ours that looks so good raise your hand with me if you're still with me and you're ready to continue on because that was pretty sick wouldn't you agree with me on that one would you agree that was pretty sick i will say hey let's go hey let's go beautiful beautiful so we've got our viewers ready we've got our slider the next steps we're going to focus on is just basically the movies so our goal is to get these moves right here these ones are here you see this one these ones that's going to be our goal now at this point and it's very simple let's go remove this rack slick okay that's the next we're going to focus on okay uh let's do that so let's go ahead and go to our vs code here let's do add again i want you guys to understand this one so add viewers right here let's go ahead and add this to git commit again hopefully you guys use your git commit properly all right all right so let's go ahead and uh create a new component let's do this one should be called uh movies movies.js all right so rfce you know the drill okay boom create the movies let's call it movies movies awesome sweet so that's going to be a movie here all right that's movies here all right save that and let's go now to uh let's import this into the home page okay so let's do back to the home page by the home page and let's import it so we'll say import import um movies from what from movies right that's the next one we're gonna create right right there and let's go ahead and use that one so say movies here okay beautiful beautiful beautiful movies all right sweet i like it all right so i like it like that that's amazing okay so just like music right here so movies that's all good let's go ahead and go now to the movies let's focus on that one so let's go ahead and save this and boom now we have a qc we have the moves right here so we create a component that's exactly what we need to do all right now this component is gonna be again not the heart of a component as well let's go ahead and do our normal thing we'd like to do which is import style so i'm going to use style components of course import style from where import styled from from style dash components stylish components components okay and then instead of doing return data we'll do containers so we'll say container let's go all right at the bottom we have cons container so let's do the following const container is equal to what styled dot dip okay okay so that's good all right nothing too crazy here uh let's get a little bit of padding here and this penny what do you guys think this this pen is gonna be bottom padding so don't worry about so much about that one right all right uh next one is let's do h4 so we'll do an h4 here h4 let's do so this is going to be a had a h4 heading uh let's do here recommend recommended for you oh no that's not what i want save that oh let's go that's beautiful it looks great that looks great i like that i like it like that i like it okay beautiful i like it it's a little bit big i feel like no i feel like it's a little bit bigger than what i like it or like it to be but it's okay we'll fix that later don't worry about that recommended recommended by for you that's okay so next up let's go ahead um and create our content so as you know right our content is actually going to be here that this is our content right that's our content and that's going to contain the movie so to do that what we'll do is create a content component so look at a content component right and the reason why we're doing this because it's going to make us to it's going to allow us to easily use a grid for example to wrap up our uh you know wrap up our list of stuff right so list of movies all right um okay let's go ahead and create create a content component say const content is equal to style.div boom style.div okay save that save that's good all right save that okay and it's all good right there beautiful so content styled dot this that is pretty pretty awesome okay so let's do the following so now we'll do uh let's create for that content now every single movie just like how it was here is going to be a div as well see how this right here so every single movie here is also going to be a div and we're going to call it a wrap so let's do that here we'll say wrap wrap wrap okay i will say here image source is equal to something well our image is going to be the following maybe hopefully maybe hopefully um maybe hopefully uh we can go ahead and comment this portion out for you guys or but this is going to be a temporary image that i'm going to use it's the is this image right here you see now maybe a month later you guys can put it into the chat right here uh or put it into the the youtube comments as well and nothing nothing too much of a crazy solution situation but wraps undefined let's create a wrap right here constant wrap is equal to style div boom all right save it all right this is the image we're going to use the simpsons image for now now you can get it pretty much any anywhere you want right just go ahead and for example uh you know i'll copy image address and i can put it to you guys in the chat i'm a cop yeah i could do that here for example i can put you guys in the chat maybe for example let me see let me put you guys in the chat so you guys can all have it let me see boom that's the image we're going to use there we go the same as we're going to use awesome sweet sweet sweet and then maybe a month you can place that into the actual chat on youtube that'll be amazing actually if you can do that that'll be very very helpful for so many people all right so if we have this let's do the same thing now but let's do multiple like multiple times let's do it like for example how many times we need well we need to be one two three four so four times actually so four times so we'll do the same thing we'll do four one two three four save that okay you can see right now it's horrible of course it makes sense right why it's horrible it's from left to right well to fix that again we're going to use grid to fix that right again let's do that so we're going to go on the content side i'm going to say display display grid grid okay i will say grid gap okay was to be 25 pixels okay 20 pixels and then here we'll say grid template columns so just how we've done definite calls before we'll say the same thing here so grid dash template dash columns okay and we'll say repeat 4 comma min max right there 0 comma 1 fr right so again same thing but just by repeating it four times boom look at that so so fast we've got our thing finished that's all great okay so that's amazing awesome all right so that's so good so now of course now we have the four cons which is um which is exactly what we want but just now we need to fix the actual images themselves that's not an issue whatsoever so that means we need to go to wrap here and now on the image side just how we did it beforehand let's give it a width of 100 percent 100 that means it will fill up the full grid see what there see just like that it's fixed height of 100 100 there okay that stretches the image a little bit so to fix that we do object fit object dash fit dash phase can be covered boom see it just object fitness kit will cover up the image within a div okay so we'll it will stretch out as much as possible without while keeping the aspect ratio of the actual image okay beautiful so we got that next thing let's go ahead and focus on the wrap let's give it a border radius because i kind of want that so border radius is also going to be 10 pixels all right that's that's great that's amazing so i like that that's 10 pixels and then you can see now i know that i know technically if we save this doesn't show 10 pixels don't worry about that we'll make it show there's a second if i do overflow hidden hidden then it will show it the border radius boom you see you see what happens again because the image just goes outside the border right and so when we do overflow hidden well then it's it can contain inside the actual div beautiful all right next thing let's go ahead and do it let's give it a uh a border the bottom one uses this one so border three pixels solid rgba with this one right here right so feel free to copy this one maybe or maybe a month or david maybe you guys can go ahead and copy this one into into somebody some somewhere all right next up box shadow that's this one boom so again feel free to copy this box shadow in here feel free to copy this to anywhere you want it to be okay hopefully you guys can see that all right so that's box shadow and honestly that's that's pretty pretty pretty much it that's nothing more crazy than that that's it looks pretty pretty damn good won't you guys say so i would say so i kind of like that actually it's pretty pretty good i like that a lot actually all right so now at this point let's do the following here okay i'll do the following here so we have the box shadow we have the border we have all that that's amazing that's awesome let me go ahead and wait wait wait wait wait wait what is this no that's good that's good that's good that's good okay next thing let's do let's do a hover effect so on the hover again we're going to use this hover effect right here on the hover of this right boom right let's scale it a little bit a little bit just how we did it before previously transform scale okay save that boom and then let's do let's change the border color of on this so on the hover of this all we do is we change the border color to be this so basically it's a similar border color but it's a little more visible see it's a white white color that's what's going to happen here so it's a white color that's a little more visible that's what's going to happen okay okay then we're going to change the box shadow to be a little bit more prevalent as well all right actually a bit more a little more prevalent let's do that let's go that's amazing i like that i like that and now see now right there that's exactly what we want but of course um we don't see you way too much because we need to do a transition so to do a transition we're going to see you use the same transition we used before transition all 250 milliseconds cubic desire desire it's funny desire so feel free to copy this for yourself right here transition all 250 milliseconds cubic desire 0.25 0.46 2.4 4.45 0.94 zero seconds right there okay save that save that oh look at that and let's do a cursor pointer cursor pointer to actually do that it's a cursor pointer look at that how cool is that huh that's pretty slick guys okay okay that's pretty pretty slick okay i love that that looks so good that looks so good guys all right looks so good look at that the box shot look at the transition it's so great i love that all right all right so who's still with me guys you guys still with me yes or no yes yes beautiful i love seeing all your beautiful faces that makes me so so happy all right so we got that portion let's go ahead and look at this if i go ahead and copy this portion this whole thing and i paste it multiple times basically i just create more simpsons so i create more movies that's that's all i'm doing so that is what our goal was it was to create actually just simply just create this all right and uh well the home page i will honestly say is um kaput finite i mean in terms of design of course the logic not so much there yet but your design it's kaput it's done right so what i want to focus on so that's awesome so we have that and of course these images are actually going to be replaced that are on by images that would come from a database so that's we're going to we're going to do that later on a little bit but i want to work on the detail page now so let's go and work on the detail page now okay so detail page so i will save this and let's work on the detail page now the detail page is basically going to be another component so let's go ahead and do here new file here and we'll do detail dot js okay gs so that's going to be the detail detail one that we use so let's go ahead and do this so the rfce rfce beautiful create the detail component inside here which is exactly what we need and this will be detail all right sweet all right now how do we go and switch up between detail page and the home page good question um well it's going to be very very simple uh we're going to use something called react router dom so what we need to do is need to go to app.js and you see how we have the header home so by default it's just simply just throwing the header and the home well we need to change that to be to change to use something called react water down so i'm going to go to if i go to react router dom here okay right right here you see that's what we need to use so this is what we need to do is react router down so we need to inspe install install react router dom again let's right click it open and integrate terminal right mp install react power down beautiful nice nice nice nice nice i like it i like it i like it that's awesome okay all right let me show this wow i'm really hungry it's a lot you know cool um i might stretch if you have to oh yeah that was good yeah whoa that's what i'm talking about go left yep beautiful okay all right so that's good so we installed react router dom now to actually use it to use it as you can see we need to go ahead and actually import it like so so browser router and so forth so let's go ahead and import that so import and you guys can do that on yourself here right there so you need to import right here browser router switch route and link now the way this works is very simple and i'll show it to you here in a second how this works but regretter is pretty much going to wrap your whole application around a route right a router and so if we go ahead and we got the router hold on right here i'm gonna do this router so the whole package is gonna be right around the router okay by default every single route will have a header page correct yes correct right so by default everything will have the header page right then what's going to happen is then we'll have multiple routes where either the home page or the detail page changes you can see for example if i click on the detailed page here right the header does not change but what does change is this portion right that changes right so that's what we will achieve with this if i go ahead and if i click on this i'm going to say here now i'm going to say switch switch so again that's coming from directly from here you see that switch switch switch and switch just means hey turn on this switch this to it this switch or this switch that's all it means and then we will go ahead and do route so route if we see there's a the path is detail detail if the path is detailed we will use the detail page so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to say import detail component from where components right components slash what detail boom voila right next up so then we do detail like so detail so that will be on the route where the path is slash detail we'll give it a detail page however if the route is a home page for example like this or the path is actually just just home right there right then it will have the home one the home component is trying to see how this works it's very simple right very simple we have a router that's this right anything that's inside the router will always be visible right so for example the header here will always be visible anything inside the switch case will always change so for example if i have a route here with the path details a path is basically the url path that's this path okay if it's detail we go to detail page if it's home page path is slash it's the home page raise your hand that makes sense does that make sense yes or no comprende yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes beautiful right that's going to be the home page and now let's go and take a look at that all right so if i save this now technically i'm in the homepage you see nothing really changed but if i go to slash detail boom we are on the detail component you see the header still stays which is right here which is exactly what we want to do right but the detail component which is this one says detail how sick is that what do you guys think you guys like that i think it's pretty cool all right so that's pretty cool so on the detail brush now let's go ahead and focus on the detail page inside here well the detail page is a little bit longer than some other pages so here's what we'll do let's go ahead and do import import styled from style components style dash components okay so import style from style dash components okay and a few things are gonna happen here in the detail page of course let's go and make this a container as we like to do all the time papa so we'll say container container just like so all right beautiful uh not defined that's not a problem whatsoever so we say now const the form will do the following so const container is equal to what oh is equal to style.div right there okay style the div okay and this dollar this is going to be pretty pretty simple uh same thing we're going to give it a min height just how you did it for home so min height i mean height height i mean height height is going to be calc a hundred vertical height vertical height 100 vh minus 70 pixels step 70 pixels basically that's the that's that top bar right there okay awesome and then we could also padding just how did we give a padding to the home page too so padding which is this one so zero calc three point five rev no vw basically means um width so basically that's the viewport width so 3.5 viewport width right there ah right there beautiful see nice all right so that's all good now of course if you think about this what does this have let's think about what does this specific thing have well it has a few things in terms of components well we have this this is the main component correct but this component is actually has a background you see it has a background image right so we can call the background image and then we have this kind of like logo and then we have i like to think of it as like a row so right see you see i always think of i see things as rows and columns this to me is a row that contains multiple columns column one button another button third button and fourth button right then we have another row that has this then another row that has the description basically of the thing do you understand that yes or no right yes so good yes yes yes yes yes bona good awesome sweet so that's what that has okay all right now and we can simply just honestly basically look at what we just have you see we can do it so the first we need to create is the background is the background component so let's create the background component so we'll say background background boom background component and we'll give the image source is equal to the following right and maybe if amount of the americans can help me out and actually give them this image source and this image stores again you can use any image source you want but in my in my case i have this one which maybe i can give it to you guys in chat here i'll go take this in chat boom that's the image i use okay that's the image i used that's just basically just this image right here all right okay that's the image and then so that's going to be the component if i go ahead and save that okay we have an error says background is not defined so say const const background is equal to styled dot div style that div the phone style div beautiful okay oh let's go look at that i mean it looks horrible but it's still it's kind of there right now just how we did our background image we're going to position it also fixed to the whole page so as we'll do the position fixed position fixed you see boom change right here we'll say top 0 top 0 right we'll say left zero just how i like to do it left zero bottom zero right and then what right zero right zero okay okay boom right there right zero okay now again it looks a little bit odd here i can see that right right zero don't worry about that we'll make it work don't worry and then here's what we'll do in that case right so and then position fixed about position effects to what well position the fix to the actual container so we'll say here position relative remember if you're doing position absolute position fixed you have to use position relative because it will fix it to the relative parent kind of like you have to have a parent kind of like you know you will have a parent right so position relative save that right nothing really changes here and in those terms but what does change is the following look at this i'm going to now target the image itself image right and then i'm going to say here the image here is width 100 with 100 good and height of what of 100 as well okay i know it got stretched out but don't worry because what we can do is we can say object fit object dash fit is going to be what cover i want you guys to look into that cover boom see oh moly mole now you can see it just covered the whole thing right which is don't worry about that you know um so to prevent that from covering the whole thing it's very it's as simple as well i just put a z index minus one on it so that's it look z index minus one and now the header shows as well and yeah that's it's as simple as that nothing too crazy you have to you have to honestly do let's add some more pat let's add a small opacity to some say opacity passes 0.8 so it's a little bit darker you see that a little bit darker and honestly that is our background image that is done comprende yes all good beautiful awesome sweet all right so i like that let's now go back to our what go back to our top and let's think about what else do we have well we also have this thing which is this which i like to call a title so so basically that's done now let's call let's you let's focus on this one right focusing down so that's going to be the title okay and we'll call it image title title boom and we'll also give an image image source and i also have that source for now again this data will come later on from a database so don't worry about that okay i'm going to copy this image so you guys can all have it and i'll paste in the chat as well maybe i might dip a monopoly if you can paste it in the comments on youtube as well that'd be awesome thank you okay i'm gonna paste it here boom okay all right so that's gonna be that all right let's go to our application here so this image is not defined of course we define it in using style.div nothing crazy here let's do following and we say what image title and define it first so we say const image title is equal to styled dot div done oh let's go that looks like i mean not that much but it's not bad again we can also use some really really cool things with that right so in the image title here we're going to give it a height height of 30vh vertical height okay all right and don't worry about it we'll fix it on the image and then we'll we'll give the image so here's here's the thing with images give it a parent container and then on the image say with hundred percent hide 100 and do object fit that is your recipe for any good image sizing give a parent container right a container to contain once you've done that on the image say with a hundred percent hide a hundred percent and then give it an object fit that is your your goto that should be your goal too okay so do image same thing with a hundred percent okay a height of a hundred percent look at this object fake this time the however contained right boom big difference huh much big difference much big difference right don't worry we'll make it better even right now so as we'll do i'll do uh width of this one is going to be 35 pw viewport width right there see that makes it even better and then we give it a minute let's go ahead and give it a min height just in case main height mean height of 170 pixels beautiful and then we'll do a mini width of 200 pixels manual width of 200 pixels all right so nothing created it just does change but all we know is that this is working this image is great right so that's uh we're getting very close to where we want to get to all right next up what we need to do is next up is we need to go ahead and focus on what that's going to be kind of like this content right here all this content right here i want to focus now on the controls you see this on the controls so let's go ahead and focus on the controls here so i want to say the following i'm going to say here controls let's go and do ah controls right here i'm going to create the controls con so controls oh controls controls container boom controls and all that will simply do is very simple let's go ahead and that will contain the play button and stuff like that right so let's go ahead and start the div so guns controls const controls is equal to styled.div okay inside here it's very simple we have four buttons here one two three four okay one two three four oh no on that side it's very simple now at this point we need to create four four buttons one's gonna be the play button so let me hear the play button okay god gosh darn it then we do the trailer button trailer button okay and then we have the add button let's go ahead and add that one too add bhutan beautiful and then we have the group watch button oh watch button group watch button there we go awesome sweet so that's kind of that so group watch button is what we're focusing on right now at this point okay let's go ahead and create all these buttons right right so let's go ahead and do the bottom let's go to the bottom we don't need any of this just yet okay let's go to the bottom and we'll just go ahead and focus on the buttons themselves so let's do the following so here we'll say const play button right is equal to styled dot div right that's that okay next one is going to be which one next is going to be the trailer button so it's a const trailer button right is equal to styled styled same thing here nasa is going to be const which one the add button right here and that's going to go to styled.div as well boom nice last one is going to be the group watch button oop oops oopsie daisy group watch button is equal to also style that div boom all right let's see what these now have inside okay so let's try this let's go and take a look at this nothing they have absolutely nothing but also we made it with small mistakes because this needs to actually be a button so we need to go call this button now this is by button you see button button button button okay so that's it we've got ourselves a button they have nothing inside them right now but we'll fix that here in a little bit okay so let's go take a look at the actual buttons when what we need to have inside them well the button will push part one the buttons will have uh kind of like things inside of it right so every single button well let's look at the play button first for example here so play button has what the play icon and the text play so we'll give it an image here so we'll do image image source is equal to equal to what is equal to dash images okay dash the play icon black button that we have actually inside of images which we downloaded by the way right here boom right there so that's the one we need to use okay that's gonna be our images inside the play button and then we need to go ahead and create a span and that's going to say play right there play let's put it in capital letters so it's easier for us yeah let's look at this oh let's go it looks so bad but it's there right let's do the same thing with the trailer button as well so we can focus on two at the same time okay so do the trailer button the same time same thing with this one it's going to copy this image put it in the trailer button right but this time the trillion button is going to be play icon white not black but white this one hopefully you guys are still with me all right and then we have what then we have the span right that's pain and so it's just a wrapper and that will be what the trailer button that's it okay all right so now we have two buttons you can see here one is truly one is played they have different styling for them so that's what we need to put what we need to focus on now at this point let's go let's go now to our play button and a few things that we need to focus on on the play button well a few things let's think about part one let's think about the border radius right so let's go ahead because it kind of looks horrible right now so let's do border radius radius right and let's give it four pixels border radius so it's a little bit cleaner and so forth so border is for pixels and so forth okay next up let's change the font size of this so we'll do font size just a bit of a more of a font size okay all right so it's a little bit bigger now at the same time now you can see how these play buttons oh my god let me go ahead and remove this portion right here we don't need that you see these butt play buttons you see how they're not kind of like aligned aligned uh horizontal vertically correct so we can do this use display flag so i can display flex display flex to vertically align them okay oh don't worry about that don't worry about that that's fine and i will say here align items a line line align with their items center boom boom you see now the play button is aligned now let's go ahead and make sure that all of these but are aligned horizontally as well to do that we do go to controls and i say here display flex display flex flex and what do we say see that puts them in a in a row by row fashion because by default the flag's direction is row not column you see and so we go that puts them into like the it's one row basically right into one row all right so that's good flex direction is basically in the one row now let's go ahead and do the following for the play button let's give the height let's get a height of 56 pixels all right so it's a little bit a little bit bigger okay and let's uh do the following let's go ahead and give a um let's think about this here for a second i will go ahead and actually say background color let's give that let's change the background color for this one so say background color i'll just do this boom so background color should be that now of course it's not that just yet let's go ahead and remove the border border border can you see you see how i had the border that's the hideous right now hey there we go so much better look at that so much better all right let's also add a little bit of species on the left hand side and our right hand side and to do that all we do is we simply just do uh padding right so we do padding so padding zero pixels on the top or bottom and the butt on the left and right will do 24 pixels simple as that right there see and now let's go ahead and add uh let's add some margin so let's do margin right you see to make sure that it pushes this trailer one so we'll do a margin right here margin dash right like this and we'll give it a 24 22 pixel margin boom done with that it's already getting much much better than what we'll want to do let's also in terms of color the black color that's all good i like that uh let me think about what else do well so we think what should we do let's add some letter spacing let's change that up a little bit here as well so letter spacing just to space it out a little bit more spacing and we'll do 1.8 pixels right just spaces out just a bit more just more so it's yeah i like that a lot better actually yeah i like a lot better and that's good okay that's awesome unless of course let's make it a cursor pointer too right so that means when i can click on it i can hover over it because right now it's not a cursor pointer right so let's do cursor pointer cursor let's do pointer boom all right oh something happened oh right here right there so now if i hold the c it's a cursor pointer now okay good so now we're not there yet okay not there yet i like that now let's go look at the let's glue now let's think about the hover uh solution so on the hover of this we're going to use this again so on the hover of this on this whole button we're going to change the background color just a little bit right so here background see this boom so now oh boom boom boom you see right there boom boom okay good so i like that that's amazing that's awesome now the same thing is going to happen with the trailer button right with the trailer button now check this portion out the trillion button right has the same style as this except it changes a few things like for example the background color well check out what we can do we can actually import it we can actually use like for example it's kind of like polymorphism you know in classes but in our case we can actually kind of like import the style so i'll do styled play button look at this style play button see now it's the same great great great great great way but all i got to do now in order to change color all i do is the following i say background is going to be the following so it's the back i'm going to be a little more darker here boom and we're almost done guys guys we're almost done for today by the way just wanna let you guys know that almost done okay i like that let's do a little give it a little bit more of a border so i like that too more of a border one pixel solid so kind of like a white border as well and let's go ahead and let's do the following let's do a color so let's go ahead and do more of a white color i guess like a more of a lighter white color boom look at that oh let's go now of course also i kind of want to hunt if i go to here ah that's fine that's great oh let's go guys how cool does that look now all right uh let's make sure it's text text transform actually let's do text transform uppercase so make sure it's text transformed make sure it's all uppercase text transform this form let's do uppercase to make sure it's all uppercase okay save that boom done holy mo look at this guys that's so good okay so i like that so play trailer that's all there i love that portion okay let me go let me go let's close this out we have a few more ones which is going to be the add button so far let's go ahead and focus on the add button which looks a little bit more different right has like just only has is just one icon right so in the add button all we're going to do is simply just an image so that's all we'll do so any ad and the in the add button and all that will be is simply just like a background a background image let me let me think about this for a second here okay cool awesome sweet so in the app add list button it will just be like a plus that we need to go ahead and add and that's pretty much it so if you look at it here look at this inspect you see here we have the span spin so that actually creates like a really interesting solution but i don't want to do it that way actually i actually want to do a little bit differently you see we're going to just simply do a plus icon or just just simply just a plus that we're going to use inside our thing so look at this i'll see i will say here as i will say span i will say here span oops span plus right i know nothing crazy so far right but don't worry it's gonna happen right so to make this this one happen what's gonna happen is we're gonna give it a height and a width as well so let's go to the add button okay let's go ahead and give it a width of 44 pixels let's give it a height of 44 pixels okay good so that's that's awesome sweet that makes me that makes me happy next up uh let's go ahead and just hold it in the other one let's go ahead and do uh display flex play flex right okay now let's focus on the span do a span here let's do span and let's change the font size of this one to be more so font size is gonna be maybe 16 pixels 18 pixels let's see maybe maybe more what do you guys think 24 pixels 26 pixels yeah it's about that ah i would say 30. there we go much better all right all right so display flex we're going to do now align item center to align everything inside there horizontally or vertically align item center okay then we'll do justify content center to do aligning horizontally right so justify content center justify content justify dash content is going to be center done so that that's very nicely centered uh so forth let's do border radius to give it a nice circular border borders radius 50 of course nice look at that it's time to look a button right i like that all right so that's really cool that's really cool water radius all right and let's go ahead and do a background let's do i'll do background let's give it a border actually border of white so border here is going to be white okay so it's a white border that's awesome let's give it a different background color too a background color should be this as well done look at that right let's also do a color white color white on the actual span oh let's go look at that and then we'll do a cursor pointer on the actual full button so we'll do cursor cursor pointer boom right there and honestly that's that's pretty pretty much it will do here again there we go and then we'll do a margin right of 16 pixels to push the other button away so margin margin dash right will be 16 pixels good so let's go ahead and save that all right save that all right it's going to refresh that beautiful oh it looks so good so good now you can see here that this button is not vertically aligned with all these other ones you see how it's kind of more the top versus more centered so how do we go ahead and do that to make sure it's fully centered well that's a very very simple solution honestly again display flex so to do that we go to our parent which is the controls the controls controls the controls controls everything right so we go to controls and where's the controls display flags and we do align items look at this center and watch it boom you see this just became centered just like that it's so simple all right so that's right there is going to be our plus plus button all right last button that we're going to focus on is going to be that's our button right there let me see right there last one is going to be the group watch button okay and i think it probably is the same similar button that we should use let me see coupon button but this one's gonna have an image so let's try that right right out so this one has an image right here so group watch button okay let's add an image here okay and we'll give the source is equal to okay is equal to what well we have a group icon that we can use right there so this is in your images folder if you downloaded it from the drive right there okay that's your image okay so that's good group watch button i like that that's awesome and again we'll do the same thing i think i think it's worth doing like the same thing which is also with 44 pixels and everything everything's pretty much you know similar so let's try that so we'll do i think we can probably let me see probably use styled actually this add button look at this guys add button oops no that's not the one okay so that's good all we need to do is just differentiate the color a little bit a little bit because you can see here it's a little more darker color here so we'll differentiate the color here just a little bit by giving it a darker a darker background color which is actually more of a more it's actually more of a background color black boom boom done done done that's it done look at that oh oh oh how good is that what do you guys think are you guys still with it yes or no we've got ourselves you see well very slowly we're turning out to have an amazing solution here an amazing product like you know little by little we have css going so far look at this guys all right look at all these css we just did all using style components that's pretty pretty epic i will say so all right and we're not too far off from actually being fully done right now we have a subtitle then i'm going to do description and that's pretty pretty much it so let's go ahead and do that let's go finish this up let's finish it up with a bang you guys oh all right let's take a water break all right beautiful that's amazing that's exactly what i'm talking about all right last thing that we go ahead and need to do is well it's the following okay so let's go ahead and take a look at it all right how is facebook how's youtube doing by the way let's see we got 400 people 274 people on youtube still let's go that's amazing good to see all of you guys so good to see all of you guys so many people you guys are commenting nonstop every single time that's awesome that's awesome someone said you have to hide the arrows what arrows do not need to hide anything i've got everything here i need fully all right all right let's go ahead and do one last thing here that we need to go ahead and do all right but wait guys on youtube can we please get to a thousand likes is that possible can we get 1000 likes on youtube that would be amazing those of you on zoom are you guys pumped yes or no with me raise your hand raise your hand if you're still with me yes yes yes beautiful that's what i'm talking about all right next thing uh we need to go ahead and focus on is going to be now this detail page which is this page right here i can actually just copy this for now temporarily i'm going to copy this and i'm going to call a subtitle here so let's go ahead and create a subtitle component so let's go ahead and do this so we'll do subtitle here actually not not a set of controls but actually it's outside of control so we'll do subtitle sub sub title okay all right subtitle and that's going to contain the actual text which is this is temporary text okay placeholder text that's all we know okay and then inside there we're going to create the description description and i'll give you guys you know the actual text if you need text but you can put anything you want in there right you don't even need just put anything you want let's just that's temporary until we actually get it from the database so for now just put anything you want in there okay so that's shin okay all right let's go ahead and copy this all right boom done nothing too fancy like i said right nothing too fancy at all all right of course we if we go back to our application says subtitles not defined that's the normal usual thing so what we need to do is to define it so we'll say the following so do style.div so const subtitle i'll go ahead and make sure you guys can see on the top here subtitle is equal to styled.div beautiful style.dip awesome sweet nice so this double dip that's amazing let's do something with the same thing with description const description is equal to styled dot do as well all right all right mateys oh what just happened what happened description what the heck i did not okay good like holy moly i would not just kill the whole application with this that'd be funny if i did though all right so for the subtitle it shouldn't be anything too crazy let's go ahead and um change the color just be a little more of a lighter color so i'm gonna do command click on this command click and this takes me to the actual style so that's one thing you can use color which is this color okay save that it's a it's just very light color okay font size 15 pixels so let's go ahead make this a little bit there we go a smaller font size let's do min height uh min 120 pixels as well okay let's also give a margin top margin top let's do margin top margin top 26 pixels to give it a uh what's it called there we go just to push a little more to the bottom here you see just to push it more to the bottom right here i like that okay so that pushes it more to the bottom and then same thing with the description let's go ahead and do that so now if we're in description let's look at the description here okay awesome that's pretty simple similar one as well right let's do we'll change the line height here for a little bit so we'll do line height line height we'll say one point four so it creates more of a spacing you see i kind of like that a little more let's do fonts let's give it more of a font size a bigger font size so font size 20 pixels so it's a bigger text boom beautiful let's do padding top is going to be so do margin top is actually going to be margin top 16 pixels boom nice i like that awesome sweet uh let's do the same thing with the color right there with the color ah yes and well i mean that's that's pretty much it look at that holy mole let's go that's pretty much it guys how cool is that what do you guys think we have ourselves a detail page now yes it does not connect directly to the thing that's going to have the connection is going to happen tomorrow by the way the whole redux all of that that's going to happen tomorrow although redux connecting right you know the react router down with redux actually pulling them data from a firebase that's going to happen tomorrow who's excited for that let me know in the comments below who decided for that one that's going to be pretty cool that's pretty cool it's not easy but we'll do it right and the last thing that i kind of maybe want to touch on is potentially the login page so let's go and touch on the login page i think they'll be a lot of fun as well okay login page should not be anything too crazy so we'll just touch on the login page a little bit as well so what do we have here well we have the detail page which is here boom okay we have ourselves at the detail page oh that's the homepage and we have the detail page okay and then let's go ahead and create a login page uh well i'll get login page as well with this all right let me see so to do this let's go and create a login component so let's go ahead first is first let's go ahead and do add detail page in the detail page in our commit as always okay and let's do this let's do components let's do a login page so right click new file we'll do login login.js boom let's do rfce boom that creates the login page and so forth right okay so that's gonna be the login page okay and then what we'll do is very simple we'll to make this happen let's go to our home to our app.js and if there's a route that says the login route we'll just take it there so say route path is equal to what i'll just say login slash login then what do we do what do we do well we import the login component so we say import login from where from dash component dash what login done zone okay so marginal file you tend to import components let me see components login i create one oh it should be there let me see outside the project folder oh because of this right here done done ah awesome sweet let's do that awesome that's good and so now if we go to this you should we should use the logging components let's try to try that login component oh done all right let's go ahead and go to now let's go to our logging component oh let's go login boom login is all we got and if we go to login in the in our actual build function sign out here's our log component you can see not you know nothing nothing crazy so far okay nothing crazy so far and this is where we will be very smart okay you can see how the header is still the same but it changes when the log component is different so we'll do that tomorrow that's part of redux we'll have we'll make that tomorrow but today is we'll focus on this portion right here right we'll focus on this portion we'll create this button which is beautiful we'll create this image right here and then this stuff right here as well so a few different things that we're going to create right now so let's go look into well what components do we have for this well a few things we have the actual container that's the width 100 right okay then what i'd like to let me go ahead and put a rectangle here so we have this okay and then we have i like to call the content section why because it gets centered horizontally and vertically you see if i go ahead and look at the brush see it gets centered horizontally centered and also vertically right that's that right and then of course inside that we have a few different things we have well what do we have we have a few logos so we have a kind of like let me see i'm going to go direct and go here logo here that's going to be that's going to be a component that we're going to use as well then let me see let me see then we have a button called get all there button okay and then finally we have a description get premiere access and then finally we have another logo code like this that's it that's it that's pretty much it so uh with that being said let's just look into what we do you so let's go to login page login page i mean i login but just hideous right now but but login page let's start up with the container okay so we'll oh let's go to import style so import styled guys we're almost done we're going to create the login page and then almost done for today and then we'll finish up tomorrow okay so import styled from style dash components okay all right from stylish components okay that's awesome and this one let's go ahead and create a container here okay let's do const container is equal to styled div beautiful style.diff that's amazing okay so now okay a few things are gonna happen here at this point let's do the same thing remember in the con in specific container we need to one is we need to kind of change up this image which is a pretty cool image that's pretty pretty sweet and we need to add that background image in a little bit here so let's go ahead and add a uh well let me do a few things here the same thing we did before remember how we did that before let's do that right now so inside here this let's do a b4 just would do before so we'll do position relative here position position relative okay and we'll do the whole before thing which is what did the last time to add those background images right so we did like this but like this before before right like so right and of course number one i need to give this the continuity to give us a height so the height for this one is gonna be just how did the last time is a hundred vh minus 70 pixels done done okay 100 vh minus 70 pixels that's going to be just how we had it for all these other ones so that you're going to do the same thing for this one okay okay good before so that's going to be this relative now before with this specific one is we're going to add a background image so let's go and do this so we'll say here we'll say position absolute absolute absolute i will say top 0 zero we'll say bottom zero bottom zero okay we'll say content is nothing it costs me nothing right just how we had it in the detail page right by the site it's just in this case we had the background was like you know we used an image inside that which is completely fine don't worry about that right content is nothing and then we will say go ahead and then bottom left zero uh all right zero as well zero good all right and now check this out now right all right that bishop and then we'll do of course this hold the whole z index now now now this point that's pretty much good so position relative on that that's all good i like the height here nothing crazy here let's do a background image now so say background dash image okay and we'll give it this url that's the login we have a background image we have a special login background image that we have which looks a little like this boom right now you don't really see it right now don't worry about that so what's gonna happen now at this point is default position absolute top zero bottom zero left zero right zero okay let me make sure it's all good good that's all great position before did they created before all right let me see or maybe it's after no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no things like this wait wait wait it's after one before there's no before here that's interesting maybe it's after here let me see maybe it's after you guys see what i'm talking about let's see hmm see how did i do before let me see am i missing something here before no technology is good like this before back on url say there was an image slider right here before all right right there submission fixed position absolute top right content zero position relative okay bottom that's interesting all right let's see so before let's go back to our login page yeah that's right let's go back to our login page here uh not that that one do command p to go back to login okay so content nothing top zero bottom zero that zero is your background image is that one so do like this okay let's see just don't understand why it's not edited before content let me see content that's very interesting i don't understand why okay let me move this image for now okay what if i do exactly the way i had before before you understand why otherwise it would just not work let's go to log in the gs log in the gs let's see you guys do you guys see any issues that i don't see or no or am i blind to this wait now i did so what was i doing before that was not right what what i do before it's same ampersand sign same colon same before what oh man this is not cool anyways absolute good okay well i mean i'm not sure what that buy that hat but that made that happen sometimes is it called not semicolon absolute is a colon not semicolon oh is that why because i had this one wrong okay interesting so probably because of the thing okay that's fine so let's go ahead and in our login that's that makes sense okay so we'll change the background image i do not need this right now good so background image dash image boom oh there we go so much better we'll do a background position top position top okay so we'll start from the top we'll do a background size cover so it covers the full thing so background round size cover okay nice i like that it says cover and then because no repeat so it does not repeat basically the whole thing at all no repeat no repeat beautiful and that's it we've got ourselves a background which just looks so good now again this right here will change later on okay the most important thing is now let's go ahead and change up this stuff so now we need so we have this portion which is great let's focus now on the the actual what's it called the actual content so let's create the content which i'm going to call the content yeah i'm going to call it the content box the content box yeah that's what i'm going to call it the content box okay so content box right here beautiful content box and inside this content box is where for example our logo will be so for example actually maybe let's go to cta box with this call to action box okay cta what do you guys think maybe call it cta for now cta and inside here we'll have what we'll have the following we'll have cta logo one so let's do this cta logo one as could be an image and then there'll also be a cta logo two later on so let's start with the cta logo one which has a source we'll say source is equal to so is equal to right here and there will be right here cta logo one which we have in our images folder boom done right there cta okay and i'm just full so if we go back to here of course we have an issue here so cta that means to create a style component so i'll do so let's go ahead and do this so we'll do const cta cta equals styled dot div okay that's part one and then the cta logo one is it gonna be an image so okay const cta logo one is equal to what style dot image boom boom hey right there okay don't worry this refreshes no i'll work okay good awesome so that's fine that's awesome no problem whatsoever so now with this specific thing let's go ahead and i kind of wanted a um let me think about this here what height should we give it i think we should give it a a specific height i think we should give it i should give it a specific uh height and width so let's do this for the cta let's do a max width max so it's good to continue this max width of 650 pixels for example okay awesome and i also want to give it a specific ah let's do a top specific padding on specific padding so let's do padding so top is going to be 80 pixels top bottom 80 pixels and left and right are going to be 40 pixels all right there you see i like that okay now so you see this kind of becomes that the whole dynamic here uh but actually yeah that's right yeah that's right yeah so now to make it all work properly what we need to do is uh we need to on this container we need to give it a position not position but display flex flex to make sure it's all centered and then oh wow let it just go display flex another just went and then we'll do a line item center where did the thing just go where'd you go don't leave all right so i'll bring you back okay that's interesting so if i don't if i don't do display flex it's fine display lex all right that's fine let's justify content maybe as well justify content center max with i don't like the fact that cta is just not showing up just kind of like that so that doesn't make sense at all um oh it's just it does not have a width that's why that's fine we'll give it a list we'll get it with right now uh let's give it a width of 58 let's give it a width with all let's just say 50 there we go let's do more like sixty percent or something there we go maybe 70. there we go i like that okay that's good i like that okay and of course it's centered right there but you know then once you put in the other stuff it will center normally so okay just look in the center that's basically it's fully centered now in this position that's amazing i like that portion the next i need to do is create a sign up button so that will be inside here so we'll do sign up sign up so create a signup button so sign up sign up right there and then inside here we'll say get all there remember just like we had here so get all there get all there let's increase this width a little bit more like 80 i would say so okay same thing let's do const sign up equals styled dot what style dot style dot it's gonna be actually it looks like it's nate tag actually it's a nade tag right there done right there see all right awesome sweets wait tweet so that is all great um i like that portion nice that's gonna be good next thing let's go ahead and actually make that make this into a proper button well to make that happen the ghetto there we need to give it a number one a specific width so let's do that so we'll say width width of 100 okay that's fine i will do background color color and we'll give it this background color which is this one boom right there save that okay by color again not not nothing crazy right now right but that's again nothing don't worry about that just yet okay we'll do font away here bold weight bold okay and then what we want to do is inside this cta is we need to we want display flex on this one so to the cell so if we display flex on this one and now that's the only way to make this a tag all the way fully uh full width so display flex to this out right right so i know this one to the left hand side to the right hand side but to fix that what we do is do a flex direction so flex direction direction column column right that's in order to fix the the top to bottom see now it's fully kind of like top and bottom and so forth okay so i like that flash direction column and then what i want to do is i want to give it a some kind of uh what's it called um the actual signup button i want to give it a a padding a top padding so let's do this so right here we'll do padding 17 pixels oop to give it a top and bottom pistol then zero pixels on the left and right oh no not that one hold on not here not on the button here my bad good good good good good good i like it i like it i like it like that oh yes i do like it like that beautiful so at that point that's all good uh let's go ahead and change the color here just a little bit more so we'll do color that's awesome let's change the color just a little more boom right there okay lucky let's get a border radius okay again to give this curvature a little bit you can see guys like all we're doing is css right now it's crazy huh border radius and i'll make it four pixels nice look at that next let's go ahead and do a text align center oh let's go look at that would you look at that that's pretty awesome let's give it a boy a what's it called a i mean i don't know let's give it a border don't don't worry about the border just yet so that's good let's do a font size let's change the font size here for a little bit so font there's size font size 18 pixels a little bit bigger okay i like that i like that let's do a cursor pointer so that let's do a cursor pointer on here cursor pointer okay so that boom it's a button now awesome so we let's go ahead and that's pretty good so i like that portion let's do now at this point let's go ahead and let me see let me think about this here let's do a uh yeah that's pretty good let's do a hover effect so if i go hover over on this now so i'm going to say hover hover what are we going to change well what we want to change is actually let me think about this you see you want to change the background color a little bit here that's that that's what i do so let's do it right now so on the hover of this let's change the background background to be this specific one good save that boom boom boom boom boom boom boom we can do a small transition even at this point too so we do get another for example transition all and then you can do things like for example uh 250 milliseconds there boom you see much better okay awesome sweet i like that that looks to be all good let's do a letter spacing let's place this out a little bit so ladder of 1.5 pixels nice it's a little bit bigger now you see that guys you see that beautiful that's all there okay all right so that's i like that let's go ahead maybe add a margin top let's do margin top margin desktop maybe like let's just say 8 pixels there we go just paste that just a little more and let's do a margin bottom 12 pixels so margin margin bottom for the next element done all right there we go awesome so that's all good next up next up is we have this kind of stuff right here nothing too crazy here so let's do the following so the description that's called description so that's the description here so we'll call description component ripping component right there description component and then i'm going to copy this you guys can go ahead and copy this for yourself as well again you can put anything you want in here i have right here description and i'll post it based on you guys for the chat let's go ahead right there i will paste the description for you guys here boom done all right that's the description i need to create a description component that's the next thing so we need to do const description right is equal to what styled styled what that div right that's what we need to create and then once we have that actually knows do style.p a p tag let's use because you use the pt so you see when you style components you can use p tag a tags pretty much anything at this point that's awesome all right i like that so that's good let's go ahead and do the following now we do color color's good let's go do font size 11 pixels 11 pixels will make a lot smaller there we go let's do um let's do line height let's do a letter spacing actually letter spacing we'll make it um 1.5 pixels just to spread it up just a little bit nice i like it we'll also do text align center text align center nice i like it i like it like that oh beautiful nice and and then let's see uh line height 1.5 let's see line height height 1.5 save that boom all right so much better i like that and then we have finally at that point we have our last one let's go ahead and make this a little bit bigger again i keep wanting to make this like 90 or something you know i know why and then we'll move this up to the bottom we'll move this up a little bit too later on don't worry good eyes and i like that that's not and then we have finding the last logo of the day it's gonna be cta logo two so let's do that right now so we'll do here so how did the tta logo one i'm going to copy this portion right here i'm going to put it into here so cda logo 2 and this is gonna be logo two which is this one two done guys we're almost done almost done it's insane almost so close so glad yes so far so close to you so far all right all right same thing with this one ct basically it's gonna be the same one as uh yeah ctl logo two go ahead and do this all right oh wait wait i define let's define as an image so ct logo 2 const uh cta oops cta logo to ecostyled.image there you go check this out now hold on oh it's not there that's okay let's go and take a look at it again cj local to oh because png not svg my bad oh let's go beautiful let's make it a little bit smaller i want to make it just a little bit smaller and to do that i'm just going to add some padding on the right the left and the right okay so let's do that around this one so i'm going to say here tata oh actually no this looks good honestly i kind of like it though i kind of like this i want to center this more uh this is centered vertically but i want to sound this better a little bit better so we did do a line item center but i'll rather do it kind of like items top here right i know stop just how we have it here and then that's part one and then i kind of want to do it where uh that's pretty good i like that i like that and i'm gonna do opacity here opacity here let's say 0.8 a bit more 0.7 just a little bit more of a darker theme you see i like that let's do a margin top actually on this whole shabang so let's do let me see i'm thinking about this actually kind of like that maybe let's do a margin top on this specific thing marched up on the whole container i'll do a margin top oops what just happened margin top i'm almost done guys see the sum margin desktop modern desktop let's do 200 pixels well not this one on the content itself cta here it's okay to go almost done no let's do 150 no let's do 100. and we're there guys that is pretty much it look at that oh oh that looks good maybe maybe make actually let's maybe make this image a little bit maybe make this a little bit smaller maybe let me see a width of let's see with 90 percent and there we go and then inside here we'll go ahead and do that just like content cta so we'll do justify content in the cta to make sure it's all good justify no actually align item center align item center you see how currently it's not aligned like this you see you see how let me go ahead and remove this for you guys um secondly it's not aligned or horizontally well we can maybe we can fix it by saying item center but yeah right there see but not see usually when you do when you do horizontal align you want to use justify content center but because we did a flex direction column right and then they switch align items changes to horizontal direction just so the content changes the vertical direction so it's actually the switch in terms of uh yeah i know it's just weird like that for some reason but yeah that's pretty much it guys look at this we have ourselves the the image we have ourselves everything we have ourselves i know it's a little weird because we have the login so let's take a look at what do we have look at this we have all you guys who are on hold on guys we finished we finished the login the homepage we finished the the detail page all that's done is tomorrow we connect them all together all that happens is tomorrow we create redux to connect the data we use firebase to get the data from firebase then we basically set the movies to actually basically so when i go for example here two movies here let's go ahead and do the homepage here right i want to be able to see actual actual movies in here not just movies that are you know images and then i should be able to log in log out no problem whatsoever like i should be able to log out from here log in using firebase authentication and you guys will learn all of that tomorrow how sick is that who's excited guys check this out we've done all this look at this let's go detail here slash detail page that detail page boom oh not that one hold on detail holy moly this is exciting oh so good let's give it a command boom oh let's give that extra i need to give this a max width actually yeah we'll we'll do that tomorrow don't worry guys the max width let's actually give the max of what is it what is the maximum of this thing should be maybe 700 pixels 900 pixels i think so let's go to the detail page let's fix this for a second here let's go here detail boom let's fix the description here this one max width max width what is it 500 pixels what do you guys think here yeah see now let's do a 760. i like that better oh my god that's so much better awesome look at that oh that looks so good let's give let's actually give this logo a little bit more of a margin top i like that this uh image title let's give that image title margin top so let's do oh two two two margin top it'll do 20 pixels oh now let's do a margin top maybe 40. let's do 100 no 60 pixels oh let's go there we go that looks so good if we now go to our homepage what do we have we have ourselves movies whoa look at that we can hover over them we can go to the next ones this is application that we built i can hover over these look at this oh that looks so good whoo let's go raise your hand if if you
