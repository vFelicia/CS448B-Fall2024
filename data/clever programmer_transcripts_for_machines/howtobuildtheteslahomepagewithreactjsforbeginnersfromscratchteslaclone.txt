hey guys what's going on this is dr martin here delivering the awesomeness like before and today i have a special one for you today we are going to be building the tesla homepage so we are actually going to be using react.js which is the most popular javascript library in the past few years i also want to mention that this tutorial is a hundred percent beginner friendly so if you've never coded in react js before this is the second best place for you to start after the profit with javascript course which you can check out in the description down below profit with javascript is your goto course to kickstart your web development career including several modules going from writing your first line of code to building projects that worth a whopping fifty three hundred dollars on upward cloning real world applications like netflix amazon and many more we also teach you how to land your jobs as a developer how to charge what you're worth as a freelance developer how to make an amazing portfolio and many many more check out the link in the description below to get to know more about it with that out of the way if you want me to go deeper in the tesla.com website and eventually even build the car configurative for you i want you to go ahead and smash that like button down below so that i know that you are actually excited about this comment down below if you like this video and with that said let's roll it so time to get our hands dirty and step number one is obviously creating the project folder that we will be using so i'm just gonna call it tesla home yep and not texas so we got services new terminal at that specific folder and i'm just going to go ahead and type in npx let me actually zoom in a bit so nbx create react app and i'm just going to hit a dot because i want this to be in that specific folder instead of creating a new one and that's pretty much it let it run for a second and i'm just gonna speed it up a bit all right amazing so once you see these two words happy hacking and all these yarn or in your case if you if you use npm then npm start build test eject and all that stuff you are good to go now so i'm just going to open up a new one and i'm just going to just going to say yarn and start so that way i'll fire up um the react server oops something is happening on my local 3000 and here we go okay so this is the template project that you get actually from the guys over at facebook so this is a tablet react project let's actually take a look into it so code space dot will actually open up a vs code in that specific folder for me so that's amazing all right so to change this application we actually need to go into app.js file and start by deleting everything inside of header deleting the logo import because we're not going to use that anymore uh we are now going to use logo svg setup test app has the js all these test files and the logo can go you also have app.css which we will just go ahead and empty out and we also have index.css and we're just going to add a margin of zero so that way everything is going to be perfectly aligned to these sides amazing all right so i'm just going to add the h1 over here so that we actually see what's going on so i'm just going to type in cover programmer there we go you can see that on the top over here it says color programmer so that's amazing and with that we are actually done with step number one which is amazing because we can go back into our terminal and type in git add dot and say git commit the sham and clean up so that way we just make a commit that we did these sort of changes and that way it is now committed so that's that it's time for us to start coding all right it is time to actually start coding and let's actually start in app.js so let's take a look at how the official tesla.com page looks like so let's take a look at this so we have a few different things happening over here so we got obviously we got the logo we got this thing in the center and we got these two items over here now we also have a title in the middle and we have some sort of uh uh tag i believe uh happening over here and we also have these two buttons and this little arrow which actually doesn't exist on any of the following pages and notice that the header is is on top and is always on top as i scroll through and we also have this scroll snapping thing something that i will actually leave till the end of this video so you have to actually watch the whole thing right not just forever to it so that's pretty much how it looks like all right let's uh make some sort of sketching out so we obviously have a header on top then we have these items which are snapping and that is pretty much how it should look like now obviously we have a few more of these items and kind of like this is how it looks like at the end before we actually go ahead and get started i have a few different um files that i want to import so say we have the images all these backgrounds we have to use those when we also have some sort of font which is uh which is actually needed to uh complete this project so you can actually download these items uh in the link from the link below there is a google drive link i linked both the fonts and the assets in there so these are actually those files that uh those images that you can actually see on the tesla homepage and that's pretty much it now we obviously have the tesla logo and we have a smaller logo i just created those so we don't have to worry about those anymore now let's create a components folder also inside of here so we got components awesome and then in there we got the header.js and we obviously have a header.css file as well because we will be styling those two now we have we're just going to type in r a f c e that will create a react arrow function component and we and it exports it for us now for class name i want to give it uh obviously header we got a header okay and before we actually forget it let's go ahead and import the css file right now so we got the header.css file from the same folder so that's amazing inside of here we got a few different things so first of course we have we got the logo on the left hand side we got some center pieces and we got the right hand side as well so we're gonna start with the left hand side which is going to be the header logo it's going to be header logo amazing and in there we will have an image tag and that will somehow we will grab this tesla logo small so let's actually go in and import that right away um we will say tesla logo from and notice that i will need to go up a level of folders and then in there i will have the tesla oh tesla logo small.svg file so that's what i'm gonna be pushing in here and we also have some sort of alt text which is not always necessary but good for seo purposes so we're just gonna say tesla logo in here that's pretty much it okay so we pretty much got a logo let's go ahead and check it out so if i refresh we're not gonna see anything because i haven't imported it so we're gonna go back to in here delete that line and then just add the header right over here boom now i used auto import so when i started typing in header it actually put this line in here if you don't know how to do it not a problem you can just go ahead and copy this line but um actually we as code lets you auto import components okay and we actually got it right there so if we go ahead and yeah look at that that's our tesla logo amazing let's go back and go back to header.js now we got the header center and that's going to be the piece that um that's gonna be that's gonna be the piece that contains all the model and the solar uh parts so i'm just gonna go ahead and put this snippet right in here so we got all these p tags inside of here which are uh containing model s3 xy and solar roof and solar panel uh and that actually created our center part over the header now it doesn't look it's pretty much don't look like a header now not a problem so far we're gonna make it look beautiful all right amazing and we also have a header header right portion which is going to contain the shop and the tesla account which is amazing and we're pretty much are done with the structure of the header now we just gotta make it look beautiful so before we actually go ahead and get started i wanna go into index.css and do a few different things now because notice that tesla's font is not this one now i already provided you with one but it is time we actually start using it so going in here we have a few different things we need to do so obviously we need to say we need to define the font face which is going to be which is going to have a font family of ice iso medium okay and we need to give it a source which is going to be a local one so let's just type that same thing right in there before i make any typing mistakes i'm just going to go ahead and do this and we will also have a url for it and this is actually at the fonts and that's it now we also want to do a format we also want to do a format and say true type in there and we also want to give it a font weight of normal now i forgot to give this here but now we're good and we pretty much just defined a full new um font now that's good let's go into here and where it says font family uh we want to go ahead and add this as the first option so we're just going to say this add a comma and we're good so this is going to be the top priority uh font that we are going to be using throughout the whole page and if you take a look at this it already changed a little so if i go back in here and i remove it uh with you saw that it actually changed a little okay now we got the uh phones figured out let's go back in here and give this header a nice style so inside of header.css we got a few different things that we will need to do so obviously we're going to target the uh header first and we got the display which is going to be not not in line but flex we're going to have a background color of transparent because it is it will always stay on the top and that's how uh that's how it is and we're gonna have a background of none so it is not going to disturb any of the view it's just not going to be there it's good okay and we're going to meet a position of fixed and we're going to have a width of a hundred view width so that will actually stretch out the whole thing throughout the whole page and we're gonna have a top of zero not percent just simply zero good we also will have a margin of 15 pixels and the margin top of fix 15 pixels just to make sure that nothing gets overwritten that's always there and we want to have a z index of 100 so it will always stay on the top no matter how we uh how we scroll it so we are kind of getting there we're still pretty far but we're kind of getting there so obviously we want to have a header logo um sort of targeting over here that's good and we're gonna have a height of 24 pixels a width of 100 pixels and the margin top of seven pixels so we got the header center over here which will have a flex of one so it will spread out as much as it can without killing the others and this will have a display of flex and the justify content of center now if we take a look at this we are getting closer and closer every single letter we type it is getting closer all right so next up we're going to go into header center and target all those p tags which will have a marg which will have a margin of 10 pixels and we're gonna also say text transform of upper case now we also gonna do a header right that will have our also a display of flex justify content but in this case we are going to uh justify the content to the flex end so that it actually is going to be all the way on the right hand side and we also will do a text transform of uppercase now that's good and we will do the header right and we will target all the p tags in there oops and give them a margin of 10 pixels so that's good we are actually there it is looking like it looks amazing so just a quick comparison that's what we got there and it's pretty nice i like it so that is how pretty much the header is uh built up structure wise and for now this is going to be the styling that we will leave it at and let's go ahead and do our git commit so kit and dot let's just take a look at the status because we can do that too so it's amazing here you can see that uh you modify the app.js file added all these files so you should see a lot of new files in here a lot of them in assets and we get the header css and js files and we got the font and we got the index.css as well so that is amazing and now you just want to go ahead and type in git commit dash m and then say uh header plus a set yeah that's good plus it's at plus that's at and if you hit uh return it will do this and now we are actually committed so that's good and on to the next one okay so the main thing in the tesla homepage is actually these uh center pieces i called them items just so it's easier easier to see what's happening let's take a look at what is built up how it is built up so we got obviously this title area ish thing and we have these two buttons but they are kind of like centered and the whole background is filling out the whole screen so that's uh there's a few different things that we will need to address there and there are a few different uh stuff that's happening so over here in accessories we just have one button everywhere else we have two and if we go all the way up we have this uh expand more icon from material ui icons uh so that's just something to keep an eye on too all right so let's understand how it let's actually take a look at this and start building this out so all right so let's start by creating a new component so we will just call it item.js which is amazing and we will just put it on the side and after an rafce we have a fullon function so that's good we give it a class name of item and inside of there we will actually do a few different things so notice that every single one of those have a different background obviously um but we will we kind of want to reuse the same components we will do something called inline styling so we will do inline styling instead of actually um setting this whole thing up to the point where it's like really hard to understand uh how it's happening so what we would do is we would just say style and boom boom two of these squiggly braces and that way we can just start typing css in here so we will just say uh i'm just gonna leave it empty for now because we got a few different things to discuss before we actually install this so that's good that part is amazing and i'm just gonna make a bit more space for myself over here good so we will actually pass in the background over here but let's not worry about that for now uh we will do this in just a second so let's understand what are the stuff that we will actually need to uh have in here so we will have the item container inside of there we will have an item text as well oh item text and that will contain a p tag or it could be like a h1 but i just prefer to go with peas so yes and we will have a class name we will have another div with the item uh text description so that's that there's that too and inside of there we will have another p tag which will contain the description so that's pretty much it uh for the top part because it's not that hard to create and we will have a lower third part of the of the of the specific item so that will contain both the buttons and the arrow where it is actually there so let's just add the item lower third that's good and we will have an item buttons so buttons will be actually a another component which we will build out in just a second but uh we kind of see that these are props that we would need to pop in here obviously um because there are different texts on these um on these buttons so we have order now learn more and shop now and all these kind of stuff and we got custom order so we really need to keep an eye on what what we are actually rendering out on screen so with that i actually have a few different snippets which you which is highly recommended for you to just go ahead and copy i will make it easy for you um by showing all this stuff this is actually going through the whole assets folder and then just imports everything in here so that's that's that and then in here let's delete all these commented parts we will have the app items container boom we want items container and that will actually contain all the items that we got here so let's do let's go ahead and i have another snippet just like that on the snippet you can actually see that i'm already passing in all these stuff we got description links so if you want to go ahead and add that uh feature on top of it you can totally go ahead and do it uh we are not going to worry about that too much because it's like uh very html basic so i'll just actually okay so we we got the uh we got the possibility to extend everything and if this video actually gets the 5 000 likes that i was talking about at the beginning of this video um we will actually fill all these stuff up and we will have a fully we will have a fully ready tesla.com page so for that i have all these expansion ready stuff here so if you haven't already smash that like button because that is the number one most important ways to become a developer in 2021 so make sure to smash it and make sure to smash it and uneven so it's so an odd number of times because if you smash it two four six eight you actually happen to unsmash it by the last time you smash it and that is just not good so you wanna go with the one three five seven nine route where you actually happen to smash it at the very end all right so that's something to keep in mind all right let's go let's continue so we got the item the js now obviously we only we need to uh actually grab all these stuff so we can go ahead and destructure it right away you can actually type it out so we got all these stuff happening basically you want to type out here everything that we uh passed in so we will do a few different things now um so just so we have the uh things that we need to have so we obviously uh change it to the proper uh prop so we will have the description here and we will have the title it's good and then this is where it gets tricky so let's go ahead and we're not going to focus on the button just yet we want to get the item ready but uh we wouldn't this is the time when we actually need to go ahead and create the button uh the button item so we will have it here and we're just going to type in rafce so that's good we will have a class name of button and we will leave it just like that uh we're not going to um we're not going to worry about that too much right so we will have so we are done there and we're just going to go ahead and import it so again i use auto import but you can go ahead and import it this way and to the item so to the button i have an importancy which i will pass in so the first one is obviously going to be the primary button then it will have a text which is going to be the left button text because the left button is going to be the primary one because uh because yeah and we also want to pass in the uh link which is going to be the left button link now again i left space for us to actually improve on this and add more features on top of this um so just yet we are not going to use the button links and all that stuff but if this video gets those 5k likes we will all right so now i'm going to teach you a neat little trick which i don't think we actually have uh done on this channel okay so two buttons two of these and signs and then this is where the second button is going to come if it is needed it's going to be a secondary button now this will have a text of the right button text and a link of the right button link so that's that now let's actually take a moment and understand what is happening here so we got the two buttons which we actually pass in over here so if it is true right uh then this statement is going to be true now this operator is actually checking if both sides are true now if the left side is not true then it's not even going to check the second the right hand side so we can actually leave it here so in case the two buttons is false it is not even going to take a look at what's happening here because then the whole uh operation is going to be false so we it will just ignore this line of code so if two buttons is false then it will ignore line 21. now on the other hand if the two buttons is true it will check the second part if it is true now it will check it in a way that it actually executes it and then we will have it rendered out so that's pretty much how it works super easy super elegant and super great way to uh work with so we will go down a row deeper outside of this div and then we will do the exact same thing thing so if this is the first one then we will going to go ahead and render out a something so it will be an item expand which we will uh and this is the time when we will be using material ui now let's take a look at what we're going to be looking at so we're going to need to have a material ui icon all right so we're going to be going to material icons good and then we will have this expand more so this not this so this one is what we're going to be using you can just go ahead and hit the copy and go back here and then in here we will just say yarn um yarn add and add material dash ui core so first we need to add the core and then we can add the icons as well so i'm just going to uh speed it up for you all right we're back and we're going to say we're going to do the same ins but we're going to change it to icons and that way we will be able to work with it all right let's speed it up good we are back and up here we can just go ahead and hit a paste and once we are done with that we can just say expand more icon and that's it and actually let's not forget to import item from uh we're gonna go to components and we're gonna say item so that's pretty much how it should be looking like and let's go ahead and hit it or hit a refresh and boom we got all these stuff happening here that's pretty good and now um remember i said uh we will have this uh inline styling in here so we're just gonna say background image and we're gonna give it a url and that and in there we will pass in the background image so that's good and it should actually load up all our images so that's actually pretty amazing i think it looks good for most backend developers this actually looks uh pretty acceptable and ready to be shipped but hold on to that uh we will start we will actually make it look pretty nice so let's just uh add a new file in here item css good all right so the item has a few different things inside in terms of styling so what we will do is we will give it a height of a hundred view heights so that will stretch out vertically and then we want to say width of a hundred view width which will stretch out horizontally and then we will give it a background position so we will give it a background position of center and then a background repeat of no repeat so that way it will not go ahead and repeat the background all the way and then we will have a background cover no we have a background side and we will have a background size of cover instead of contain and a display flex and we will justify everything to the center so that's pretty much how we will start this off with we have a testing library we don't need that so thank you for joining our session but we will import the item.css file that's pretty good and then let's take a look at if it takes action boom there we go we got all the text up top so that's amazing we have everything in the center and we also have the um header on top of everything and staying right there so that's cool so it kind of works all right uh let's go a bit down and we're gonna have the item container which will have a width which will have a width of 40 you with a display of flex we will give it a flux direction of column and an align items of center so that way we will snap everything in the middle so that's pretty good all right all right up next we got the item text which we will target and make look beautiful which has a margin top of 20 and we'll have a display flex just like everything else and it will have a flex direction of column and a font size of 34 pixels now we will also give it a nice color which is actually the tesla font color so that's good uh so this is 39 39 3c and 41 i'll just throw it on the screen so it's easier to copy and we will have an align items of center and the flex of one so that's pretty much for the text let's take a look at what's happening over here so it's pretty pretty looking pretty nice already we also got the item text description which will have a fun way of who which we have a font weight of 200 and the font size of 14 pixels next up we got the item lower third uh with a margin bottom of five pixels display flex flex the deduction of column and we will also use the display flex on the item buttons because we want them to be like next to each other so that's pretty nice and then item expand which will have a color of white and a width of 100 margin top margin top of three percent and the justify content of center now this is how uh this is the look that we just got so we're getting there we're getting there we're pretty much cool with the i'm pretty much cool with how the items are looking right like right now we have a few different things to uh left to do but let's actually do a git commit so we will say get a dot get commit dash m and we will say item that's pretty much it for the item i'll see you in the next one all right before we actually finish this project up one more thing we have uh we have to do is uh button so the button is actually a uh since in button it's actually not that crazy but at first it may look like so in here we got this uh button uh class name which is good but we're just gonna get rid of it because we will have template literals coming in here so remember we actually passed in the importancy of the specific button as well as the text and the link and based on what kind of button it is we will display different kind of things and it will look different so what we will do is we have the template literals here so we can type in button and we're going to say if the importancy equals uh secondary then we want to add a button that uh let's go underscore white otherwise we're not we don't want to add anything at all so that's good now inside of here we will have an a which uh which will have a an href and that will be the link and we will have the text that's pretty much it that's the structure of the button so that's good so this here again this is an es6 way so it's a super modern way to actually do uh an if statement i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead and learns it so that's uh that's just what happens here all right now actually let's go ahead and make this button look nice so we will uh type here uh button.css and before we actually go in and get and forget it let's uh add the button let's import it so that's good and in here actually the css this time is going to be way more than the javascript than the jsx it will have a background color of rgba and it will have a 23 uh 26 32 and a point eight opacity so that's good and we will have a height of 40 pixels and a width of 256. yes 256 pixels we also have a margin of 8 pixels display of flex because we want them to be next to each other and we would justify all the content to the center and align them to the center so both horizontally and vertically they are going to be on the center and we will border radius of a hundred pixels and we will have the opacity of the whole thing not just the uh not just the background because the background is 0.8 but uh even we need to reduce the text opacity to 0.85 now inside of there we will have we have obviously the link and we need to remove all the text decoration which is going to be none after this a color of white is going to be given to it we will have a font size of 12 pixels and a text align text align of center now remember if it is a secondary one we will add a button y so that's what we will define over here so if it is going to be if it ends up to be a white button then obviously we want it to look look white so we will say background color so we will say background color is going to be white in that case and we want the opacity or to be 0.65 so it's less hard so white is a much harsh much more harsh color than black uh see we want that to be uh reduced more and inside of there we will have we will give the text color uh to be black taking a look at what we have it is pretty much done only thing left to do for us is going to be the scroll snap so let's roll that we have everything ready to go we have all the styling one thing and this is a new stuff that we haven't done on this channel just yet up until now but it's time we actually introduce scroll snapping so what we would do is open and we will have a few different things coming in here so we will have app item with our app items container and that we have a scroll snap type of mandatory and it will be only mandatory for the yaxis now we will also have an overflow which is going to be auto and a height of a hundred view height now one more thing which we need to do because it's it just only enforces it but it doesn't know what it needs to enforce it on so what we will do is going to item.css and we will add one more thing here which is going to be scroll snap align and we want the start to be aligned to it and that will actually bring us the desired outcome of snapping the scrolling and now you cannot actually stop it in between it will snap it somewhere so that's that amazing job you build the tesla home page smash that like button once again if you want that want me to actually go ahead and build it further alright that was it for today's video let me know in in the comments down below if you liked it or what else do you want me to build for you and also smash that like button if we reach 5 000 likes on this video i will be dropping the next episode as soon as i can thanks for joining me in today's session i'll see i'll catch you guys in the next one peace
