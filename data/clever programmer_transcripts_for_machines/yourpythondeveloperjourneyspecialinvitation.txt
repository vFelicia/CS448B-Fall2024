hey you what is up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I have a very special invitation for you I have a webinar coming up ok it's called how to become a Django Python full stack web developer and a freelancer that's gonna be below in the description and I'm probably gonna talk about it at the end of the video but in this video I wanted to give you a lot of value and I want to give you your roadmap to becoming a web developer with Python now if you're a complete beginner right now you're like I don't even know where to start there are a couple of things that I want to clarify with you that a lot of people don't talk about a lot of the times it's like you'll look at you know people are like just do a lot of web development stuff or do a lot of coding and do a lot of data structures and algorithms and just one day cross your fingers and that's actually how you're gonna get a job right just apply to like a bunch of interviews on indeed.com on monster everywhere else and just keep doing data structures and you're probably gonna land a job one day but a lot of you are probably not in a position where you have a developer job right and you wanna you want to get that experience before you get to that entrylevel job that says you need three years of experience before you get that entrylevel job okay so it's kind of a catch22 here so what I want to show you is that there is a way that you can go from a beginner and then there's an awesome step before you start learning web development where you can actually be earning an income so you don't have to in this way you can maybe even quit what you're currently doing okay some people I've talked to you and you guys have told me that you're actually currently driving an uber and want to become a coder so like how are you gonna go from a beginner to becoming a web developer if you're spending a lot of your time doing all that other stuff because coding and web development all the stuff is actually hard and it's very timeconsuming and it's very demanding so unless you're earning an income from doing this stuff unless you can actually let go of other things that you're focusing on and make this your primary focus it's gonna be a very long journey and that's the journey that people talk about that takes years and that takes maybe a degree and that takes maybe like just a lot of stuff that you know like certifications that you actually in reality don't really need okay so I'm gonna reveal to you my process okay and I'm gonna make it as simple as possible so you can understand and follow me along so check it out okay here the process overall process I'm going to break it down one by one it's a fourstep process okay it's not easy but it is simple okay let me say that again it's not easy but it is simple so if you all disclaimer if you only want to do this to make money there are much better ways to make money and probably don't do this but if you want to actually learn how to code become a web developer get committed to becoming a web developer find time that you'd never thought that you actually had and then go on this journey which is actually a difficult journey right and become a web developer let me actually show you how it works okay so first you're gonna start off maybe this is where you are currently or even if you're past or whatever right first you're gonna start off learning the basics so this is step one this is learning coding learning Python learning variables learning loops learning conditional statements conditional flow right ifthen statements for loops while loops and just mastering basics of Python okay you should be able to solve things like fizzbuzz all right look it up if you don't know what it is you should be able to solve basic coding problems you should be able to solve basic coding problems that's what I'm repeating it because it's important okay you should be able to go in hacker rank and at least do easy problems okay and maybe a little bit of intermediate alright that's this part so getting your fundamentals down and now check this out you don't have to spend years learning coding before you start making an income here's an awesome way and I'll tell you why it's an awesome way so you need more time like what if you could actually start earning an income from coding right wouldn't that give you a lot more time to learn coding what if you can earn an income from the stuff that you're actually learning now instead of waiting till you start competing with the rest of the world on up work to become a freelancer where you fight to the ground and you try to charge like $8 an hour and you still don't get a job because there's another developer in a thirdworld country who will beat you there and charge like four dollars an hour all right so let me show you what that step is coaching all right this is a step that a lot of people miss like almost everybody misses this step this is coaching's finding somebody who's willing to pay you to learn what you currently have in your brain from learning basics of Python okay these people will pay you good amount of money to just learn coding from you you can find these people online on online platforms okay like take lessons wise and Craigslist or you could look for these people in real life and learn this stuff okay and so that's the step with coaching this will help you make at least okay depending on obviously how much you work how hard you work to find them and work with them you'll be making at least five hundred a thousand dollars extra per month doing this stuff and if you want to scale it higher you can scale it higher and be making even two or three thousand dollars a month it won't just happen instantly it's hard work but it's very doable and you can earn that income and you can make that money and what's the beautiful thing that starts happening when that you start making those two or three thousand dollars a month your brain goes holy I can actually make money from coding and I can maybe spend a little bit less time on the other stuff I'm doing right maybe you're doing like 40 hours a week maybe you have another parttime job and it's not giving you time to learn coding well guess what when you're coaching and making an income from coding you can replace the other stuff you're doing with coding so you're gonna be improving your skills massively you're gonna be earning an income while you're actually doing it you're gonna get experience on how to work with clients how to get clients how to have a recurring stream of income from clients you'll understand how referrals work you'll be improving so much right these are essential skills that you'll later need when you try to freelance as a web developer so that's step 2 does that make sense hopefully that makes sense if it doesn't make sense comment below it doesn't make sense you're crazy but if it makes sense I want you to just do like a thumbs up or stand up in your chair I don't know do something so I know that it makes sense like this video okay do that step 3 let's go with step 3 django web development okay that's the thirst so how does this work this step now that you're actually earning an income from coding you have room to breathe and you have time that magically appeared that didn't exist before so now you're gonna use that time to actually learn web development in Python the framework that I recommend using is Django why because it comes with an administrator interface built in and it kicks every other frameworks ass okay no chess and all those JavaScript frameworks are really awesome and really great but if you're working with a client and need to get them results really fast you can save ten hundred plus hours by just having an administrator interface kind of built from scratch and that's what this allows you to do okay meaning like functionalities to log in log out have basic database have your client give your client the ability to like delete stuff add stuff and all that okay and handle user permissions it kind of comes magically built in with Django from scratch so that's really really powerful and I remember Chris Hawkes actually mentioning this as well so I actually got that from there so thank you for that Chris Hawkes got it so far so good it's making sense this is where you're gonna actually take most of the time because this is the hardest part you're going to develop these skills you're gonna build projects you're gonna put those projects on your portfolio okay and after you have experienced building projects in this working in this and coaching other people okay you can even coach other people on Django okay and help them once you have this experience and you're earning an income from coding you're gonna go on to the final phase which I like to call the trusted advisor because I hate the word freelancer all right freelancers to me it just sounds like a commodity thing you're an expense okay but what you want your clients to see us no matter when you become a freelancer no matter what you become a freelance friend okay whether it's coding photography or anything else when you actually get to that level how you stand down from the rest of the crowd is everybody seeing you as a trusted advisor if you can demonstrate your value to your prospective client okay if you come off as an expense you're not gonna get hired the only way you can get hired is by being a lower expense meaning they'll hire somebody who'll price themselves lower than you okay so you have to compete on pricing but if you can demonstrate your value to your potential client and you can show them that you're actually an investment that can actually help them increase their ROI then they're much more likely to work with you and pay you more rather than anybody else does that make sense so that's why trusted adviser consultant that's what you're gonna aim to be not a freelancer I don't like that term but I just have to use it because it's just the easiest way to say somebody who works with clients does this make sense guys force that process simple not easy requires hard work but I mean coding is fun as hell right you take your ideas build something in real life share it with the rest of the world so you're making a deep impact in the world as you're doing all this stuff so not only it's not an only important for money but the reason why I have to mention money and practicality which no other developers do okay it's because you might have a family right now so not only do you have to take care of yourself but you actually might have to take care of the people that are nearby you your family members okay and I want you to live a comfortable lifestyle as well there's no pride in poverty okay there's no pride in that and that's why this channel me I always talk about practicality of practicality like learn stuff and then earn an income with it right and even grant cardone I was watching his 10x growth con and he says idea to monetization get there fast as possible because if you don't have money monetization ideas die okay your dreams die it's like the life blood and oxygen for what you're trying to do you're a good person you have great intentions but if you're not earning an income from it and you're you're you are barely able to survive I doubt they're gonna actually keep doing something right and that's why actually most of the people who start this journey quit because the only thing that they're taught is learn coding then learn web development and then just apply to lots of places cross your fingers and maybe hopefully one day you'll get a job that's a very tough route there's a lot of uncertainty I don't want to take that route I think you don't want to take that route okay now that I've shown you all this I do want to mention that my course the profitable programmer I only launched it like four to six months okay so the last time I launched it was in November and then I closed the doors for it and actually I've launched it now and the doors are open to enroll in that course but there are two days left that course literally takes you from a complete beginner all the way to this trusted advisor that's the goal of that course if you're a django web developer then great your steps are now shorter all you have to do is go from here to becoming a trusted advisor okay if you already know coding great I'll show you how to coach and earn an income from it then I'll show you django web development then I'll show you how to become that trusted advisor consultant people will pay what you're worth and not nickel and dime you cool and my awesome freaking webinar is coming okay so for those of you who want to learn more how to specifically become a Python Django full stack developer what's actually the opportunity what do these guys get paid all of that that I'm gonna cover on my webinar and that webinar I'm gonna run in two days from now March 26th 1000 a.m. which I believe is a Monday right Monday and PST okay California time 1000 a.m. do the math okay I guess you'd call this sort of like what time
