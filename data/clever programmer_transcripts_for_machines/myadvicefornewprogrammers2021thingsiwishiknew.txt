you can go ahead and click it's a free training where nods will teach how he was able to make 300 000 in three years as a software developer and how you can too now let's jump into it number one don't do it for the money now here is something that's super controversial because very often you hear people saying like hey you should become an engineer or a software developer because they get paid really well but let me tell you something people that come into this industry because they're trying to do it for the money they're trying to do it for the recognition the prestige end up burning out and don't successfully become software engineers because in reality it's not something that's super easy and simple it's hard it's complicated it's challenging so for you to push through those things you have to make sure you actually enjoy it and you're very passionate about it so if you are doing it for the money let me tell you you're watching the wrong video go ahead go somewhere else go follow your passion go follow your dreams figure out what you actually like what you actually want to go do and go ahead and exit this video but for those who are still here because you realize you're doing programming because it's something you're passionate about you find fulfillment from being a developer let's go ahead and get into number two before i tell you what it is let me tell you this mindset helped to make programming and developing software seem super simple and super easy and this quote took me a long way in my software career this quote is very simple it's not hard it's new now this is so powerful because when i started to get into programming everything seemed really difficult even though i was a logical thinker i was a good problem solver just writing my first piece of code assigning my first variable or even calling my first function didn't make sense but because instead of approaching it in a manner where man this is too hard for me i'm not going to be able to get it i approached it in the manner of this is new it's a skill that i have to build and once i build it it's going to become simpler it's going to become easier i was able to progress rapidly through those plateaus i was able to keep on pushing my career forward i was able to keep on learning more and more and more so by adopting this mindset i switched the frame instead of viewing programming like this impossible challenge that was just hard that i couldn't overcome i viewed programming as a skill that i just had to develop and i just had to spend more time with i had to get more intimate with it and as i got more intimate with it it just became simpler it just became easier to where it almost became like second nature to me now a lot of people look over this but the reality is that becoming a great programmer and becoming great at literally anything else is 80 mental and 20 actual skill so if you show up with the right mentality you're gonna be able to dominate the skill set so number three never stop learning you know one of my favorite mentors warren buffett says the more you learn the more you earn and this directly applies to software development as well you want to make sure that you're always pushing yourself pushing what you know trying to learn more if you already know specific stack or framework or language maybe learn another one that has similar applications or different applications but this will allow you to keep challenge yourself keep growing as a person keep growing as a developer and most importantly adopting this mindset will make sure that your career will be sustainable over a long period of time there's been lots of developers that ended up focusing on just one specific language like maybe fortran and where are they now unfortunately not many people are using it what they had to do was adapt over time and that's what everyone has to do as a software developer as you adapt you take on new skill sets and it's crazy because these skill sets start to compound over time and you just get better and better and better so guys as a new developer one of the biggest challenges that you're going to come across is learning how to manage data now this is gonna be important for becoming a developer because everything in the software world is driven through data that's all the software really is is you're showing data in different ways one of the best ways to learn more about data is by practicing immersing yourself in it and even finding the right mentors to teach you about it and that's why i want to talk today about datacamp datacamp is an online platform that has over 300 classes that will teach you everything you need to learn about data whether it's sql python and much more languages and tools that you're going to need now in data camp you're going to have the right tools to become an absolute expert because they're going to guide you through their courses and their teachings and here's the great thing it's also mobile friendly so it doesn't matter if you're trying to learn while you're walking your dog using the restroom whatever it is you could do it from the web or from your phone and it gets even better because very often we might be running around because of life this is something that you could do on your own schedule so it doesn't matter if you work in the mornings in the evenings if you don't work at all if you're in school whatever your situation may be you can find the time to learn through these courses learn all the things you need to learn about data so you could become an absolute professional so go ahead and check out this class in python where you could learn more about how to use it to create databases or even then this class in sql so you can learn more how to query databases and get the data that you want when you go through these classes you're going to develop so much experience in the back end because it's all about practicality so if you want to become professional and super good with data and the back end go ahead click the link below and check out data camp where it's only going to cost you 25 a month and the amazing thing is these are skills you can develop that will pay back in dividends because if you're able to become a professional you're able to land a job you're going to learn data so well that you'll be able to make so much money that 25 a month will be piece of cake and if you don't get to that point that's only a couple starbucks coffees you don't have to drink so that you could pay for your knowledge and invest into yourself now if you're still on the fence here's the best part you can go over there by clicking the link below and check out every single course's first chapter for free so one thing i see a lot from people pp yes pp practice with patience here's a crazy limiting belief for a lot of new developers they come in thinking that they're going to become these experts in just a matter of 30 days in a specific language or specific framework now for you to become a true master of your craft it's gonna take time it's gonna take practice it's gonna take repetition and it's also gonna take patience because this is a long journey of development in fact i clearly remember talking with a lot of senior software engineers back when i was working at blue origin and they themselves never felt like they had it all figured out because they were always pushing their own boundaries and learning just a little bit more and i saw that i was like man if they are 30 years ahead of me i have to be really patient to put in that time and put in that practice to even get to their skill set but i saw that even they're being patient because they're learning new technologies and they're increasing their skill sets so when i put that into perspective i kept practicing my craft i kept building my applications i kept coding as often as possible but i kept patience in mind i wasn't thinking about the next 30 days the next 60 days or the next 90 days i was thinking about the next three years the next five years and beyond when i started thinking long term this became a simpler game for me i wasn't rushing myself i wasn't feeling anxious anymore about getting it done i just fell in love with the process i fell in love with learning more about programming i fell in love with challenging myself and pushing past my comfort zone so don't forget to pp number five get a mentor now guys one of the most valuable precious resources that both i and you and everyone else have is one specific thing time if i could get all my time back that would be the most amazing thing ever this is the most precious resource on this planet because it's something that we're never going to be able to get back until someone creates a time machine but until then we're never going to be able to get our time back so we want to make sure we're using our time properly and that's the exact reason why i'm creating this video for you especially new developer because i want you to take what i'm saying here and this is three years of me being in the field three years of me learning and these are the things that i wish i knew three years ago and even further back so that i could be even further ahead than where i'm at right now so with all that i'm saying is if you get a mentor you're gonna save yourself time because when you have your mentor you're gonna learn what sucks and what's good you're gonna learn what's a waste of time and what's not waste of time you're gonna learn the things that you have to do to hit your specific goals and the mentor speeds up that process we've all heard that it takes ten thousand hours to become an expert and your mentor has probably put in those ten thousand hours plus more maybe enough to fifteen a hundred thousand hours of work on the craft imagine if you had access to that imagine if all you had to do was ask questions and they could give you the answers and they could guide you down the right path step by step and that's exactly what we offer with the clever programmer full stack mastery bootcamp we take you from a complete beginner knowing nothing about code to becoming a full stack javascript developer and beyond because we will help you with finding your first job as a full stack javascript developer when you have the right accountability when you have the right coaches on your side when you have the stepbystep system literally holding you by the hand taking you to becoming a full stack javascript developer with the right mentorship do you think you

out the free training that we have for you where nas teaches you how he made 300 000 as a full stack javascript developer in three years watch the training if you get any value from that you could go ahead and apply to our program full stack mastery and if it's a good fit we'll be reaching out to you to see how we can help you hit your goals of becoming a sixfigure software developer so all this to say time is super important and mentors are the life hack to being able to buy yourself that time back so in reality mentors are the time machine so guys that is the advice that i would give myself three years ago when i was applying to jobs and i was able to get offers from google microsoft and blue origin and started my career as a software developer and i hope that you found value from this
