hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm today I'm with avi and also known as Avinash and he is a travel blogger but it's what's also really cool is that he's a developer who works remotely so I was like this would be amazing to speak with him we're still at VidCon so let's do this welcome I mean I can super nice and have a man so talk to us about like your story how you got started into development and what company are you currently working with so I mean programming for nine years now and the most of it has been removed since we had a startup before which I was a part of yeah which was a part of something called startup Chile and startup Chile yeah it's a government startup Chile run government program yeah well you basically your startup gets $40,000 but the only glitch according to that if you have to move to Chile and work from there for six my only little yeah the only language that's the catch there like we're from I'm coming yes sir we were in angular Silicon Valley of India yeah I didn't know that Bangalore yeah the most of the startups in India in Spanish okay so this was in the back oh so we moved to Chile for six months I had a that for the first time I stepped out of the country it was fantastic I've never traveled before yeah and I just now Charlie yeah so since then I travel from Chile maple and online but then I make my life and be bought booze right over there yeah and we took two years off we stayed in Ganga saved up and started doing this lifestyle since then we are being travelling for three years now they've done most of Asia and we stayed in Mexico for six months before coming here now we have been the US for a band send us all of that view we'll add it in yeah when you're talking about some things you're sure yeah so okay so now you're vlogging and you're currently working for digitalocean yeah by the way I don't know if I can put that on but yeah I work for companies where us yeah that's cool so you're freelancing you know you're working as a fulltime remote developer for them not to monitor an independent contractor I would rather do some right now more of these passionate about travel vlogging yeah also I want to make video of me so I split my time between coding coding and so yeah so we make videos on and how much how much income are you earning on a monthly basis a yearly basis to be able to kind of have that life so it's a lot of viewers are like how much income one is possible to you as a remote then the second question they have all the time is what implemented in a b2b like three like that what is it person never yuan a month how much income are you generating yeah so if you are traveling in Asia all you need is about for two of us we need about one thousand dollars and with a skill set of three years of programming you can get you can get there too as a freelance and the freelancer if you have your mentor and your seniors for years you can get and if you're in India doubt how far but the 1500 it has also month will take you if you live in India a lot in the cities it's like it's here on the border yeah but if you go outside the cities you can take care along with but in Asia it does stick like Bali Island it takes you you can basically get beach house in Vietnam yeah for $300 damn Irish beach house in Vietnam there is a saying firmly so say one thousand five dollars will allow you to have this lifestyle yeah thanks ships Wow so I'm not I'm I mean I'm almost a nearly thirty now so I need to think about savings yeah so I need to think about saving sooo yeah so so some when I say I'm holding five dollars it's not just the expenses I'm starting on the borderline I'm saying have a good lifestyle and safe which is zero dollars you'll have a good lifestyle and be saving okay Asia if you're in South America Mexico yeah if you're like it's a past what kind of lifestyle they want because you don't need to be making like a hundred thousand dollars a year up you don't do you have enough lifestyle that you can enjoy it yeah you if you choose your country properly me too I don't know man yeah and before to it like expenses I'm talking about this for two right talk to me how you got your first on it as a friend like that is something that's gonna get though valuable to people so take me through the detail process of like how long were you coding for what did you do to get that first client sure I mean putting Ruby or Ruby on Rails for nine years now and a B McMullen startup since the time I left college so I have a lot of connections in the startup and once you get that gonna get kicked out of garden it's pretty easy okay I think Oh God was out of the relationships that you had built yes even even today every every Giga is because of the relationship of work and all those things don't really according to me I kinda get that yeah because of course you're competing on price with other people in the world who don't have this lifestyle they are in a single place so they can actually charge they will wheel it right than the price you would want for the Paulina so the best thing I would say for someone who want to get into this lifestyle is work for three to four years yep build up the skill which and the contacts and venture once you reach four years you have enough security for anyone anywhere in the world see three to four years like really hone down and then develop the skill yes okay now in that time are you saying they're not earning any of them know that you are an income but you are in a single trips oh I see what you're saying just don't say it tomorrow I'll quit and starts out I'm out of college tomorrow I want this on guys so you need to put in work either when you are in college put in the work and build up your get up is a beginner okay and whether they're going to college or not let's say they're not in college they want to start getting paid from coatings yep okay what should their process be like should they first spend four years like getting the skills down then try to apply or should they try to apply apply as early as three months or six months into the coding experience in interior coding experience he's once you have the skill to like fill a site or something which is like you can get in six month yeah or if you are going to those finishing schools and everything you can get there in six laughs yeah even our beer if yeah depending on once you get that immediately apply and get production experience all the projects and everything don't try to freelance maybe work something right get get the experience beautiful which which will help you to better your skill and habits why do you say don't feel at first why do you say get up job first one is the skill itself yeah thank you need you need production experiences to get get to a skill level where people are comfortable hiring you remote or freelance that's okay because people are not if you don't have you cannot learn why you are being what while you're freelancing yep you can learn while being removed but unique on the trust of the employer yeah so you will not get that trust of the employer if your name or deposits got it Terry say adios you should have enough body of work open sores have enough body of work to show sometimes that you can do the more I love that I love that you know lately I've been getting pretty creative with how I'm using Instagram and I'm getting my brother on it he's a freelance colorist and I'm naturally I helped him with it and he's going it's going crazy on it so he's actually in the last he's running on trade on history over the last five days he's actually landed two of clients straight on Instagram more like these companies and they want to take their fur color do you think if somebody's sort of getting an item like that with coating and trying to get clients is that something with they could look down because I don't know you said up work and those are not that great and let's say somebody doesn't already have like four or five years of relationships been here from college what would be a creative way for them to start building these relationships sure so one way is if you if I take the example of you right you have built this whole channel and and you what are you selling you're selling or each movie yup right you can teach this once you learn you immediately so once that's your product you can start selling that community you can use leverage Instagram and to sell what are your teachings that's the easiest thing you can do I never did that yeah I wish I knew but now it's a really scale of yes it's very scalable if you can't product is something which you have learned yeah do that immediately what the programming languages primarily you guys so I do Ruby all the time okay I like Jace also but chase the last serious aside it wasn't to turn 11 yeah when Jay with the CMAs completely different back then now I mean want to get back into it but maybe some current through review ever or open to create content on I found a great now whatever we would love to I'll feature it personally tour yes as them by developer weekend that's great I would love that okay anything else you want to add before we wrap it up um anyway like maybe you want to give a takeaway or tips from anything that you feel you want to show sure so if you get to a stage where you feel you have the skill and the network don't be afraid to try traveling and programming it's fun yeah it's really really really fun if you can if you can actually don't be afraid that oh I'm gonna lose a job my suggestion would be go to like some exotic location for two to three months and any person of the thank you it's not for everyone but I kill most of you later I went to Bali and there's like a spot called I think they call the coding dojo or something yeah yes it's unbelievable were you there yeah it is beautiful here in Bali for almost two months it's fantastic it's a life experience I think everyone has to do it and try everyone please try all right bro thank you so much that's it guys thank you so much for watching this was AVI we love your face
