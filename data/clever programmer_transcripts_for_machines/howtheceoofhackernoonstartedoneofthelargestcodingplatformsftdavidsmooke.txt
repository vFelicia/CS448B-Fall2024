buddy welcome welcome welcome my name is nas and this is clever programmer and i'm here with with david here from hackernoon he's the ceo of hacking he's the founder and ceo of hackernoon and today we'll be speaking about his story what how he has built this company to be one of the biggest coding platforms out there for people to read for people to get to know about coding for people to learn coding um and we'll talk about the struggles the hardships the hard times we'll talk about the happy events and we'll talk about how you can potentially grow more into that potent if that is what you want to do if you're a developer here and you want to learn more about how to start a business you're in the right place if you're somebody who just loves business want to know know what it takes for the business you're in the right place so welcome welcome welcome welcome david so amazing to have you here thank you very much for being on here hello clever programmers very excited to be here i appreciate uh taking the time reading hacker noon and you know i'm an open book so david how about you go ahead and introduce us just a little bit more about you know what do you currently do at hacker noon and and so forth cool yeah my name is david smook i'm 33 years old living in colorado i run a remote company called hackernoon we have about 12 fulltime employees and another 20 parttime employees we primarily employ editors and software developers we publish about uh 40 stories a day ranging across all types of technology so software development coding programming that's a big pillar of ours as well as startups business and then also the decentralized movement and the movement towards web 3.0 i spend a lot of my day uh building software so i'm more of a product management side of things editing stories uh kind of solving the worst problems whatever kind of funnels to me about the business is always like you know the the fun part of that job um you know doing some sales um you know trying to work more with great technology companies and uh making a we really want to just make a better place to publish so the relationship we have with contributors is they own their content they bring it to hacker noon we provide editing and distribution for those stories and we build up a library and our readership and we have about three million readers a month wow and we're building a lot of software wow that's beautifully beautiful and so i know you talked a little bit a little bit about hackernoon and what you guys you know are doing and tell me a little bit more about what was the goal with hackernet or like what is the premise of hackernoon you know info for those people who might not know hacking maybe who haven't heard about it uh tell us like what is your goal and what will the readers get out of it well the original goal was to make a business that made money while i slept okay spot in my career where i really didn't want to uh be paid by the hour and working salary is still in my mind by the hour you know you don't own the work you're doing you don't own any of the upside or very little of it so i kind of reached a point in my career where like that was more my goal than saying hey i need to solve this problem or that problem or anything like that it was more as a mindset of like i needed to figure out a way to make a business that provides value it makes revenue and pays rent and it makes more than it spends so a lot of like the early days of this stuff was not about making the best place for technologists to publish you know that that wasn't where it started as the goal but we found a nice niche around building a lot of sites um so i was building like blog licensing sites blogs and different verticals really you know getting into content management systems and um at my previous job i you know ran a wordpress blog with about 500 contributors so i had gone through kind of the back and forth of like how to manage a large network of contributors how to help with their work all the flow stuff so um that's kind of a lot where my background came and with hacker noon i mean it was that right mix of like a good name a good industry the people in technology they know they want to talk about their technology and find other people who care about this stuff right so there's a really good industry for much more of a communitybased operation and then putting things in place to improve the content and making your stories better like the headline itself is going to change the whole trajectory of the story how fast it loads is going to change it what the future images how many grammar errors you have how good is your word choice you know all these things impact the direction of the core of the story so it's kind of we found a nice niche of what i'm calling the second human rule of making sure another human views it and improves the content and that's something that i think the internet as a whole is lacking a bit there's so many places anyone can post anything and just shout into whatever other void opens up at the time right having that barrier to entry and saying hey a human's going to look at it it's going to take a couple days and then we're going to get a better result because we had two humans and editing is something that gets a little bit of diminishing returns the first 20 minutes of editing story you're going to provide more value than the next 20 minutes really usually so like the the first 20 minutes biscuit that the you know the students read or people read when you say 20 minutes you mean like what's that like what two paragraphs your paragraph so what do you mean by that how an editor can edit like a 500 word story in about 20 minutes you know they kind of come up with the basics and improve it but whenever they spend minutes 21 to 40 you know sometimes it's they're not as big of improvements yeah like yeah covering your bases is like the very first thing you need to do and also just answering the question like should this be on the internet forever that's important thing of like maybe someone's like no that shouldn't be on the internet forever or like hey reframe it as a different type of thing and a lot more people are going to care about it or find it you know so there's elements there that like an editor is just so helpful for publishing content on the internet that's true that's true so my interesting portion that you know from what you said there is but then by the way before we go into it fully guys if you do guys want to go and check out hackernoon you know we have the links down in the description there's a hacker on the web so you guys can go to and check out what they have they said they have some amazing articles you know around coding or development around the new you know the new uh web you know a decentralized web as well so you guys do you guys have a newsletter or like uh in there as well which they can subscribe to too oh yeah so if you sign up you can choose your tags as you go and so we can because our library is pretty big we have about 75 000 stories and 27 000 tags nice so it's helpful to uh sign up create an account and then you can pick your eight tags so you can customize your content um yeah and then the footer of every page is a newsletter that's kind of what the general that's beautiful that's beautiful so let me let me ask you this right because when you said it was really interesting when i asked you hey you know what inspired you first to start this and you're like well at first i just wanted to you know uh sit at home not do anything and just have to make money for me right so like that i needed to make money it has to pass the i get hit by a bus rule if it doesn't pass the i get hit by a bus rule and it survives it's not yes you're running your services you're selling your services you're selling your time and that's cool like that's a good way to do it you can make plenty of money but it really needed to solve the rule of like if i'm not a part of it it still works and that's the spot i wanted to get to so let me ask you that right because there's a lot of students i talk to so of course i still i talk to a lot of students on a daily basis you know students who want to learn coding students who want to get into booth camps and stuff like that and there's a lot of people who say you know i just want to you know be on the beach and and make a ton of money and that's it doesn't actually work that way is it actually possible to create something where you literally do nothing and then it's just making money by itself well i mean first and foremost i couldn't do the beach thing my brain's not wired that way like i'm not a beach person like trying to sell someone something on the beach or like you know once i get there i'm like finding a new thing to do so like just chilling on the beach like i probably couldn't handle that that's just kind of out um but that's funny uh what was the question wait so the ques so the question is is it actually possible right to um not not saying beach but actually to make money in your sleep right to where okay other people are doing things i mean with hacker noon that little yellow banner atop every page is about half our revenue and it's running all the time and so we sell it directly to large tech companies and large crypto companies they buy directly from us there's no targeting and we just put that ad up and when i go to sleep people can send you to visit the site have an impression click the ad that's right so that i mean i would say it's happening and it's possible um that's great it's not a fullon money machine it's not like the fed i can't just print money you know whenever i want um but it's a decent business that's good that's good that's good so now let me tell you let me ask this right you you had this goal in mind right that you wanted to be able to not be on the clock and so forth um at which point did it switch to a different model or at which point did you realize that you know this is a lot more than just a business of you know being able to make money while you sleep it came to more of a you know what this is actually a business of actually helping developers and making one of the biggest platforms oh where did you realize that um i don't know there's exactly one day um so it was kind of weaning down my clients so i took on clients to help grow their internet presence and define who they are and you know just help them grow up on the internet and so i had you know this kind of service business and the goal was that the the business from hacker noon would you know outgrow it so it's like it took uh the first customer was actually hired.com the website takeover for the site yeah bought our newsletter and they did all this stuff and um so then it was like okay now i can wean off a couple clients it was the goal was to get off all the other clients that required anything that wasn't hacker noon and that hit um it took about 15 17 months something like that for hackernoon to make enough revenue to be my fulltime job um and then i recruited my wife which was probably the smartest move she's much more intelligent than i am uh you know she didn't pay for any education she was sponsored from education from like full scholarships from like age 12 to 21. oh my god so much smarter than me so i guess that was a great pick in terms of you know [Laughter] and then i had people that were kind of in and out of the project uh an engineer jay zalowicz was running a lot of scripts and then um john marshall was doing a lot of writing with me so it's kind of having these parttime people like floating around because they believed in it and helping it grow and exist um and then when it was enough money for the two of us it was a really nice spot so we were we didn't have a software team we were just managing a large community and we were doing a lot of editing a lot of sales and then we wanted to really expand to have our own software team and that's kind of where um yeah that's where we i guess we were going all in and going a little bigger and we did uh something called equity crowd funding i actually remember that i remember that so we did that and that's how we built our first software team and the first uh two engineers three engineers we hired none of them went to college they were all selflearned uh online [ __ ] boot camps all that stuff and just building products so like you know i definitely like what you guys are doing and it's like i think more and more people are not valuing the education when they're hiring software developers which is like it really matt like we've pivoted a lot where we basically every software developer we hire we do a parttime project with them wow really working yeah and we pay them for the project we we talk about it we pick something we think would both be interesting and then we work from there about negotiating like a longterm contract and it's just like so quickly we learn like what people say in an interview doesn't matter what what do you mean by that like to me the interview like i yeah i just every time i try and base a decision on the interview i think i make a poor hiring decision like if i just look at their work and then do a project with them i can see how they work and at that point i'm like i know who i'm working with i kind of understand how they approach a problem how they divide it uh how they time it how they line it up so there's um i don't know where i got to this point but this is this is really this is actually really interesting i'm very happy at this point because you know a lot of our viewers are developers they're beginner developers they're looking to get into companies right and you know i think what you talk about is great because this gives a lot of great insight about what companies are actually looking for right yeah so when you go ahead let me ask you this when you go ahead and hire hiring developers now at this point right um what specifically do you look for and how does the process go yeah so the the last process we did we um put it we put the uh we stopped advertising jobs elsewhere we just put the careers page atop our site because that meant they were a hacker noon reader and they already understood what the site was so they want to work on it that's interesting that was one thing i realized that gets rid of the people that don't care about this so if you if you don't already care about hacker noon it's much harder to do anything with you because you're that's just a you're not already aligned so just that already aligned the people that would i would be talking to uh then we ran um a one and a half hour test that anyone could take and it basically said rebuild a page of hacker noon and we gave them a story yeah so like the story page and some guidance and it can be done in like hour hour and a half maybe two it depends you know how into it you get um but we tried to tell them like don't spend more than this like try we like instead of spending an hour interviewing we can learn more if you do one hour of the just build a page and run this little test and then the people that built the best page uh we interviewed and then uh from there we voted and then we hired so when you when you say build a page you mean like build an actual website that hack a new website no we just the story page so if you look at like a headline is a story page is the most popular page on our site so that's the frame the the formatting it's like you know headline author feature image right social shares emoji reactions uh tags recommended content footer so it's just and then people would it was cool in the explanation they're like hey yeah if i would keep going i would do this next i got to hear i took a shortcut there and then you get to talk to him about like how did you build this thing and i thought about this page a lot so like whenever we have that discussion it's a page i've thought a lot about and they just spent two hours thinking about how to make a page like that so it's um that's kind of the test that we run and i mean my goal is to for them to spend less time but also to us to learn enough to make a good decision that we're pretty aligned um that's that's the test we ran last time we'll probably run it again that's really cool that's really cool and so okay you guys go ahead you go through this process of having them submit a page which means really interesting you know because a lot of us for example here at kappa we focus on clones like building like you know website clouds right so like yes there's the proof right there that people like website clones you know basically you're cloning your website that's already there right what's up developer companies the amount of times people have told us how to build the uber clone they just the story submissions just keeps going from all these app development companies that's awesome so okay so once you went ahead and you have them let's just say this okay okay a lot of these people they build all these hacker new you know uh the website right not not the landing page but of course but that the article page okay um of course there's still a ton of people who are doing that what do you look for what do you pick from like right there's a hundred people and you only have one spot um in that moment it's like oh i'm looking for details in the page that we chose or how clean their alignment is you're kind of learning where they prioritize back end verse front and even choosing what they say to admit and what i didn't get to like some people just throw out the footer all together some people would put it in a different footer some people would acknowledge they didn't it was interesting to see if they acknowledge what they didn't get to i always appreciate that yeah it's like hey i probably i have the time limit one it proves that you listen to the time limit and communicate better so because do you know if the project keeps going you know you could do it better you know you spend three hours on it and send me something more beautiful and say i'm so great and i did it in 90 minutes and i'm like you know that's not as good really people to actually talk about where they were they cut short because the time limit forces that you can't do it perfectly in the time limit but you can come close you can get a good 80 thing out i think that's it that we give you wow so you're saying that even for example if i went ahead and i um interviewed for hacker noon as a developer and you guys gave me this what you would do this before the interview before before they ended right yeah and i would say the second after the coding test and then their personal website and is probably second for me so the personal website i think so one we're in publishing and i believe every technologist should tell their story around the internet and that's part of the value we have of bringing traffic back to your corner of the internet so if you don't already have put in the time to build your corner of the internet i don't think you're probably not a good fit here so if you don't have a personal site for a business like mine i want my software developers all to have a personal site already and they value and they understand the value prop that we have with our contributors that they want to drive traffic to something and they want to talk about the projects they're building so other than the test i would say number two is the personal site um and some people it also can be a build up you know linkedin profile it could be your built your github profile that you look at your corners the internet so it doesn't need to be a personal site but like a portfolio confirms that you do care about your corner of the internet and that that means we're already going to be a little more aligned i mean the last one at last engineer we hired marcos his personal site was so funny it was a picture of his actual office and then he did this 3d thing where you look around on the way for the menu yeah i'll all the i'll drop the link after this but it was like it was just unique and it was cool it made him stand out and you know and another one jefferson who he just hired he had a really cool like pixelated 8bit site where he built it and we do a lot of pixelated stuff in our design so right away when i visit the site you know you kind of feel this alignment of like this respect for that retro old video game and like those first times you found the internet that's so cool wow those are the things we value i love that i love that you know and every company of course is different right in terms of what they value and what they want their you know they see engineers in in engineers right but what do you think is the number one thing that is the one is the most important thing do you guys look for in a developer may that be when they're you know coding it up or may that be when they are go to the interview what is the number one thing you guys look for um since for me since i'm more on the product management side and the writing side you know i'm really looking for empathy and communication so there's obviously the hard skills part of it and i trust our test and if we tweak our tests for a different role i think about it and i talk to people and i trust it but whenever i'm in the stage you know as the ceo hiring this small team of software developers you know i'm really looking for empathy communication and people people that choose to do it themselves first at this stage when we're only 11 fulltime people it's like everyone needs to be a top individual contributor including myself no one can be just a manager or no one can be hey i need a designer and a backend developer in order to ship this feature it's like no you're a full stack developer you know like you don't need both sides support no matter what if one side isn't there you can kind of you know work around it plug in and get it out you have to revisit and clean it up and reconnect it later but like you're full stack enough that you got to the stage where you ship the feature and people start using it and you can learn to iterate so that's more of like you know the easiest way to show that is by having your own product out there somewhere right and having that thing functioning say hey i worked on this project with these two people and you can play with it and you can play with and that comes back to the personal site like how you're collecting your information how you're collecting your work um yeah so that's what we look for that's really cool and what i really love about this is you know the fact that you did say communication and you know even those soft skills it's something because it's something i very much talk about right so i for example i've had the pleasure of working i mean sometimes splatter stuff there's not so much pleasure like working with a lot of developers right work with you know startup companies i'm personally i'd love startup companies so i work as a lot of startup companies um and then we're also working corporate companies and for a big portion you know what i've realized is that it's honestly not just the biggest thing not the biggest thing is not just about your skills around technical but it's also your soft skills how good of a human being are you because what in the smaller the company the more the individual contributor decides what they do and what they work on and so really judging do you are you able to level measure impact are able to say how does this impact readers writers sponsors editors admins and think what what will happen how do i measure this impact and you're choosing what you prioritize and what you work on it's like i yeah i want a brain that i believe in i want a brain that cares about those users and cares and understands hey when i do this it's going to piss off ten thousand people by putting up this popup maybe i should pick up the popup instead and what happens is people these big tech companies they put up the popup and then they say look our subscription numbers went up by this much don't talk about the popup don't talk about how he did it character comes in and you choose the software development choices and it sucks you know sometimes you have to take on the weight of pissing off a lot of users when a thing breaks and these readers yeah there's a guilt that you have to be able to carry and you have to trust that you could like you know hey all right i know i messed up today i'm going to help these people tomorrow here's how i'm going to do it you know that stuff is um that that takes some weight and if you have a sociopath that's saying they don't care about what happens to those things it's like the business who knows it's actually really interesting enough i i worked this company once i'm not going to say well company but um i worked with this company where they brought in this lead developer right the elite developer is a great you know great person very technical uh basically was about to come in and fully redo the whole system okay and that was the goal is to make it a lot more secure a lot more scalable as a developer came in um really quickly the desire started to change a lot of different things really started to change all these different backing systems actually you know within two weeks the backend system has changed uh the frontend did not know about any of the backend system changes uh that thing was pushed live next to you know everything is broken and then next thing you know 95 percent of the people were fired so it's it's yeah yeah huh no i was not fired no i was not fired i was a full star developer i was the five percent that stayed on there were only it's actually me and one of my friends uh one of my friends he we're both foster developers and so we stayed on and we helped the guy out pretty much to kind of bring him up you know uh from what was going on with the whole basically his system just going down fully um but i think it's just really interesting right it's just like the importance of one how one person can really can really change so much in the company especially when you're so small and two the importance of that communication that you're talking about right so when you say communication how do you test it how do you see that in a person um mostly text i mean so i'm going back i'm reading what they say they would do and what they did so there's that element of communication of like accountability that you just want to look back and see what people prioritize and commit to um because i i mean i can't understate how valuable it is to be a good writer right now the developers that i work well with are willing to write and they take the time to write and some of them are verbose and some of them are very witty and sharp but clearly if you would read them and they're a developer or not you'd say that person knows how to write so that the written word for me becomes really important for communication with software development you know so that's um that's something i just value a lot and the precision of your language and what you look at and how even the tone like i'll have pet peeves i'll see red flags of you uh for example if you write something out and it's a question but you put a period that's subconscious stuff i look for those little subconscious things sometimes because it's like okay i get where you're coming from you think you can command people you see okay maybe it's a typo then you see it three five times and you see it happen when things escalate and you're like okay i get it that's that's what's going on there so there's um the precision in the written word and then going back you know looking at old typos is kind of funny and stuff like that but when i say communication i i mean it definitely matters that we can meet and talk out our options and say here's how we're going to d scope here's what we're going to prioritize if we do scope that can we get to here right so the discussions are very useful to have in you know the inperson meeting i mean actually i'm now at the point in the company where ling my wife is the only person i've uh the only one i've met in person wait what your wife is everybody else's remote right as we were expanding and so like wow and so what what countries like where where is everybody at um michigan florida um ukraine india ukraine yeah i'm from ukraine and i was oh and also i've been living michigan for the past seven years [Laughter] yeah yeah we got south africa uh amsterdam um yeah all over pretty much every time zone japan australia that's a tough time zone for meetings okay okay i have i have a question about it online i bet it's not that easy to get everybody on board in a team meeting no like like when everybody's telling me so many different time zones uh yeah we only have one all hands meeting a month so there's only one meeting that everyone uh is like mostly required you know obviously if you have something important or deadline or something or personal you know you can't make it but yeah it is tougher i mean you definitely want to do less meetings um less meetings are good i usually do two to three a day i try to keep it to two max so i can get six hours of focused work um on the keyboard uh but yeah it's it is a it is a little challenging for sure and i appreciate like the sacrifices that people make with late meetings and early meetings i don't want to like abuse it you know so i want to schedule like selectively but like also you know it is good that the teammates are willing to do that for each other that's true that is true that is true so i want to stay in the topic of a little bit of um of the interview side of a portion and kind of what you guys are looking for okay what you guys look for in general so soft skills communication skills okay are there any other soft skills besides communication that you guys think are really important and someone who's trying to go ahead humility is the most yeah it's it's just very hard to work with people who really believe their farts smell great it's it's difficult you know and you look across like when people get really smart it's easy to get really arrogant and so that's something where it's like looking for that humility and like being able to you know confidently talk about your work but not being able to just put yourself as this hero and ignore your faults and prop yourselves up in your stories so that's that's where it just gets hard you know we've learned like the more humble somebody is the more they can actually do a lot of times yeah whenever engaging like where is this interview from reality to what output i will get if you start to sense that they lack humility you're going to sense that okay at whatever i pay them they're going to expect that what they deliver is a lower amount then the humility person is going to say hey like i you know i'm going to come in and i'm going to bring more than i promised and i would you know more than i more than i implied i'm able to do i actually can do other things that i didn't even talk about you know because i'm humble i talk so that's where like um if you can if you can identify humility well you can usually build a team of really top contributors that like help each other out because the more arrogance seeks in seeps into the company the more your team will be disjointed and it will be frankensteiny and it will break yeah i agree with that i get 100 how do you hope in your situation how do you test humility or how do you test arrogance i guess i feel like it's really hard to test you know unless you actually work with that person i mean you can just talk how i would whenever they tell their stories of their past work really look for how they relate to themselves in the team and how much they how they use i you know how they whenever you ask them like who helped do what and just um i don't know it can also just be in little things of talking about other stuff and really you don't learn it until that first project and that's why we try and get them through the first project as quickly as possible our hiring process is one one to two interviews never three like we're not even going that far on the you know these uh software development roles because we want to you want to make sure the test is good and value your time for the test have the interview and then get in for a quick part parttime project where we pick something and build it together um i like that i like that so base of some from the community humility portion okay how i'm very curious you know i know you said that you see that the humility portion also from the project that they do you know whenever they somebody states the truth around hey you know i just couldn't finish that in that one hour you see that as actually as a positive thing not a negative thing yes absolutely i find that very interesting because you know a lot of people i've heard so of course i've heard i've heard some people hey you know just lie the interview and then i and then you will you'll somehow get into it you know from your perspective it's a very different it's you know just be as truthful as possible about who you are and you know if they like your truth and who you are then you know you're a much better fit for the company yep gotcha so now at that point how have you seen humility affect your so for example if there was a person maybe who wasn't so humble how do you see that affecting your company um i think it's because our core metrics are words published time reading and revenue so i think you can kind of see it sometimes where people will put their projects push their projects further or me imply their project is more important whenever it's like hey we're all trying to get to these three goals you know and the thing you're doing it does tan generally relate but it's like you're trying to push it forward because it's like the thing you love it's your baby and it's your thing you want to do and instead of helping others a little more of moving towards those goals you just kind of push your thing more so i think there's something where why we pick projects can start to become very selfish and you want to align the selfishness with the company goals and so whenever it becomes when those alignments come off and it's like i want to do this because i'm interested in it and it's not really going to impact those metrics too much sometimes you get down this rabbit hole of your interest is more important than the company's goals and moving those forwards so that's where you kind of see it like but it's head um but it's uh yeah i don't know that's cool no no i mean i think it's this is a great answer for a lot of people who are watching because of course right our audience is very much you know some of them are focused you know maybe they're more entrepreneurship a lot of them are focused on getting ready you know maybe for a job they want to become developers and so this gives them a lot of answer insight about you know who they need to be um and so software developers that can understand what are the goals of the company and be able to answer that smoothly you know that's where you can kind of have the one sentence mission and then you can kind of have the core metrics but it teaches you when you want to advocate for a feature for example you know someone if a developer is saying hey we need to invest in this big time i need to focus on this over that and it's because i think it's going to get us 10 000 new writers i think it's going to open up this distribution channel to 10 million new readers and you kind of look around and you start to think okay it's moving our numbers in and it does make sense to build that instead of this so it's that overlap of like when software developers see how their work impacts the core metrics of the company then they can make better choices and i always appreciate when i get convinced to do something else because that's interesting but you now have made a good case that that's a more valuable use of your time great you know and you understood the questions i would ask about how it would impact those numbers so that's it's a good moment and i always appreciate it when it happens i love that i love that because this is what i love to do as i love to challenge those those type of things okay so and this is what i what i actually teach to my students a lot of times in the booth camps and the courses you know i always say that no company really likes a yes person like word so always yes yes yes yes yes yes yes right i always say that um this is just my my thinking and you can tell me what you think about this okay it's just how you said that hey you know what if somebody can tell you or or maybe propose a different idea that they might think a bit better that says a lot more than if jesus just and then if they were to just go ahead you know what okay yeah i'll do it you know from my perspective you know when managers for example managers or somebody who comes with a feature they're like hey nas you know we gotta build this feature and so forth my first question is usually what is the goal with that feature why are we trying to build this and once once i understand that goal then then usually what usually happens is hey let's actually think about the will this future actually get us to that goal sometimes as you start breaking things down you realize that it actually might not have you found that in your position yeah absolutely a lot of times as a good product manager i'm basically a sounding board and i'm listening to okay where was the block okay where was the block and then it's like okay let's also just weigh these two things let's talk out two ways to get to the same goal that are completely different let's just talk out each option should we consider what why is this one good why is this one bad why is this one good why is that one bad so just that like little bit of back and forth is really um fun um i i will say that the people that say they're looking for yes people where that's coming from is they're looking for reliability because you do want reliable people you do want to trust when it's their shift for tech tech support you know they'll do it you know you want to trust that hey if the urgent bug happens they can drop everything if a minor bug happens and it's in the say it needs to be fixed in 10 days you just trust that you put it in the queue and a solution will be reached so there is a reliability whenever people say that yes people thing it's they there is a reliability that if you can trust the person to show up and do the job everything will go better and building trust is really important to making more money and building up your relationships and proving that you're worth more money so i don't want to like dismiss that but definitely the yes man stuff is bad and like if you don't trust if you can't tell yourself why you're building this thing the answer is because someone described how to build it there and told me to build it you should probably look for another job you may not today but you probably will soon because it's just too it's too brainless it's it's uh it lacks the purpose and the reason that's the purpose you know of just coding in general right the the whole what i love about just coding is the fact that it's such a creative aspect whatever you can put out can either make it or break it it can really help out a company very much or it can actually you know not help out and actually make it do it worse right but with just a line of code you can create something that a lot of people can use so i would argue this is old though because like writing has been like this for a while okay so you read something to start your day it's going to change your whole outlook your whole outlook whatever you read in the morning paper is going to change the way you see the world that day whatever app you open on your phone whatever headlines whatever social updates you dig into that stuff is all like framing how you see the world and so i mean the written word like code is kind of like this evolution of the written word or like maybe it's a branch off or like a metaverse universe of the written word i'm like speaking to computers is now its own language but to me i still group the bigger thing is together under the written word i love that the biggest technology and the most powerful thing i love that i love that so now tell me this okay okay when you guys interview i know you you had the project and so forth in terms of the actual coding aspect when you guys talk to a person what are the coding course i'm not saying what quality questions you ask but what you focus on when you do get to talk to them in person you know through skype or through an interview and so forth so usually another engineer will do that part so they can get more technical and they're really breaking down what portions of the tech stack do they know that we already have uh talking about the bigger problems and solutions we're working on to figure out what excites them because it's also a matter or we're broad enough that when you come in we don't exactly know what you're going to work on you know it's the conversation of where interest and experience overlaps with possible projects we've detailed or possible projects we come up with together so that that part um and really yeah how they work with people before and i mean i really the key questions i ask engineers is would you enjoy working with this person that's and if they i can you know how they hesitate like the engineer that interviews the candidate that's the first question i want to ask them um because if once if they trust that they're going to enjoy working with them that's a that's a sign that they're endorsing their talents they're endorsing the mess they they would have to be the more the team is excited to receive messages from each other the more everything like starts to go well like if they're not excited to receive messages from the teammate it's like that's the moment where it's like that's bad that that's that can create you know people spending energy on like needless anger or like just things that don't help the work itself and you're spending energy on it doesn't help the work so that's the first one i asked them and um yeah and we'll see a lot of the interview notes we'll have you'll see like hey there's gaps here in their knowledge they seem to be really experienced there and then we're also trying to gauge how quickly they learn so the ability to learn quickly is can't be under can't be overstated and how valuable it is like it doesn't if you don't know firebase it doesn't mean you can't learn the database like yeah databases it's like so you're also kind of judging like hey what's something you got excited about and learned really fast like where where's the project where you came into that project and you didn't have any experience with that type of code or typescript or whatever it is but you were able to learn it quickly and you know become the project leader and then ship the thing and like when did you choose a technology and why asking people why they chose the technologies they chose is also interesting because a lot of times it'll be like that's what the legacy was but yeah like hey i found it and i have been waiting for the use case i always love when people get to that like i was really excited about it and i played with it and i was just looking for where i could put it that's um it's like one of the things we look for it's like the center of like oh there's a there's a new framework let's use it i'm just i'm so excited to use that new framework there's like a new friend that comes out every single month or so which is not just so hard to keep up with but it's also really fun like i just recently recently realized uh tail and css uh i haven't gotten the chance but i'm like holy [ __ ] it's so cool you know yeah i think that's come up like three times in our slack of people like finding it the same way of like wanting to use it and not like having the finding wanting to use it before they have a use case of just whenever they stumble on it so so let me say this okay when you guys look for engineers okay is it you know are the people who already have experience out of experience or do you guys and take on any students who not students are people who maybe haven't had experience and what do you look for if somebody hasn't had too much experience in terms of you know working at companies but maybe they built projects and maybe they're coming from maybe their selflearner what do you look for in that and that i mean i love selflearners i mean our first three engineers i think didn't go to college and they had more work experience in the beginning and then we've had younger engineers that we hired that just finished boot camp and had like one or two jobs or finished boot camp had a couple clients and was basically building stuff for other people and had kind of their own projects on the side um oh full i call him full stack intern but we hired an 18 year old software developer and we just hired him to throw it on hacker noon he wrote on hacker noon about how to improve our page performance speed uh so we hired him to work with us no way so how did you guys notice him does he just notice him because he wrote an article did you just notice him because he actually applied so he wrote a story about uh google lighthouse speed and i was at the time digging into our google lighthouse speed i was like great i'm just gonna meet with him and uh see if he's not crazy and if he's not crazy i'll hire him you guys heard it here first if you're not if you're not crazy they'll just hire you he built the free internet plugin so if you if you google free internet plugin we build a google search plugin and what it does is it removes uh paywall results from the google search results and then you can customize it to add other sites or not that you don't want to appear so instead of seeing the paywall site and clicking through and getting to the paywall we just take out those results and like penalize the companies that use paywall and make google search actually free closer to free that's awesome that's great that's great so now okay you guys go through this whole process at any point i know you guys give them a coding question on any points you guys test them on besides the project on things like you know algorithms and data structures or do you guys not focus very much on that on those you know those typical coding interview questions they usually get like google which is like you know can you create a recursive function you know or can you create a link tree is there any focus on that um not for like the general entrylevel software development role for us but for you know we are doing some stuff with recommended stories that would get to that level of complexity but the people working on it are already on the team so we're not like we're not like pushing for a really machine learning heavy people right now we're more in the stage where we like full stack developers that have expertise so you're more full stack and you're better at something specific um is kind of like more of what we look for um but i i i think uh to me it's just as long as the companies keep the interview question coding tests very short and not do too much stuff on the upfront um it's a good sign i just think a lot of time gets wasted on the long interview quite long challenges or that like it's just it doesn't respect people's time enough um to me if you're a company if i can if i can't learn enough in three hours with you like i haven't designed my process well enough like an hour and a half test or two hour test and one hour interview or however that splits up that's like a more reasonable thing of like you want to hire this person or not yeah yeah yeah and i love the fact i love what you talked about previously which is you just ask the person if they're great to work with like would you want to work with that person right i think that says a lot because like it or not i think in environment something is the one the most important things besides any even any any technical knowledge yes technology is important but if the environment is just not right that ruins the whole thing pretty much yeah people that pick other people up are really really valuable and um it's hard to see until they get in the room but it's uh it's worth its weight in gold um it just makes logging in so much more fun um and it's like you the thing is you're going if you're working hard you're spending a lot of your waking time with these people and if you don't like them your day your not your mental health is not going to be good you're going to lash out in other ways and it's just uh you want to enjoy the people even though they're on the screen you know they're not the same as you know going in the office in person if you don't enjoy when their thumbnail comes up and you don't enjoy reading their text you're not going to enjoy your day you heard it here first be presentable on text and be presentable on zoom so that's really interesting you know um talking about how to get a job at some something like a an amazing place like hacker new and i think it gives them a lot of insight around what they can focus on and the one thing the first thing we talked about which is hey you know go into portfolio make sure you have a good portfolio some kind of a website that really presents yourself right put yourself out there i talk a lot about this to you know my students and you know i personally love that like you know if you share just what you know people will just get to know you a lot better and plus you make a lot more connections right even for example on hackernoon are they able to themselves just go there i'll go on there and they'll simply post topics and make it make articles on there so anyone can uh sign up and write a story and then it submits to an editor and we accept about half the stories um for quality control so that's you know some of the stuff's not good enough and if the editor can get it to our level within 30 minutes they'll help you and do it if not they'll reject it and they'll tell you a reason for why and saying hey you improve that you know it can come back so yeah that's i mean a lot of people in coding schools are writing on the platform a lot of early software developers a lot of hungry people that are saying hey i want to prove that i know this and i put it out there and it's on hacker noon and hackernoon verified it and fact checked it you know the third party saying i know how to do this you have a on your resume you have a a like this little logo that says fact checked by hackernoon [Laughter] great great so i wanted to talk a little bit about you know the story behind behind how this was created and you know even your back on yourself because i'm very curious about what it takes you know to build some of this i know this doesn't take you know a little effort no does it take one just one person to do this right let's maybe go from the beginning of okay where you were how you got started are you currently in college are you currently university what were you doing at that point before you even got into hackernoon yes i went to university for economics and creative writing so background on you know kind of business in the written word um then i was a newspaper reporter and then i worked for a startup called smart recruiters they uh shout out to them they just raised 110 million oh wow this week uh yeah but when i joined them they it was a fiveperson team and i left the company when it was about 125 people so i just kind of saw this growth phase of the company and that was like three and a half years of just learning apprenticing from the ceo learning how how to grow an internet company but so i kind of looked at that as like my graduate degree you know if you want to look at it like hey college i went to college for four years then i spent about another four years kind of just learning how to build an internet business that's that was kind of my perspective and why i wanted my own internet business um and then i left that company and i was just trying to work with the best entrepreneurs i knew kind of growing their business and having these different consulting contracts and at the same time i built the first app of this company was actually called map shot map shot pictures on the background of the map this is before apple had that feature google that feature of where the maps pictures were on the map and the idea was to build a social network where the more likes and engagement it got the bigger the pictures got and the more of the map it took up so it just like smashed together a bunch of pictures and it was like a way too much of a graphics challenge to like complete it was just like all these overlapping things and they would get gray so you needed like all these complex rules about like how to pick the line where one image ends and the other ones begins it just ended up where i spent probably uh from the from my own money i spent about 10k just like trying to build this app without software developers yeah and it was like revenue from the marketing business i was like besting my marketing service business into software and so that that ended up uh failing were you were you doing any coding when you were doing that or was it just like you know you were hiring developers separately and you had no idea about coding mainly doing uh wireframing and no i i was i would like try to look review the code and learn from it but like i'm not at that level you know i'm i'm more like visual and i'm like drawing these little pictures making wireframes trying to manage the the feature functions of it and what to cut and what to keep and more like that you're the idea guy you're the steve jobs basically i would not be a steve jobs i'm saying if it was ju i'm saying if it was just the idea persons that i'm saying right because i know steve jobs was not the best person as well just in general you know around some of some of the things i mean i was i was saying hey i'm going to spend half my time working for other people and i'm going to reinvest that revenue into software and i'm going to i'm gonna try that and i'm gonna build more sites and if i don't have the ability to build the thing i want to build i'm gonna take some of the revenue from marketing and put it into here and hire that labor so that was like more of my mindset about how to grow a business like to me a business is about bringing it has to have revenue in and it has to cost more than the the input you spend out otherwise it's not a profitable business yeah that's not the easiest thing to do okay okay so you went ahead and you you were building this application didn't go so well so what happened next well i just kept serving clients and then i was looking for other ways to build sites um so i built a lot of sites with uh medium.com and their software and content management system so that's a number of publications most of which have all died and then there's uh blog licensing apps i tried to build um and so but it got to the point where like hacker noon was by far the best like all the sites put together and all the apps i put together weren't as many readers as hackernoon so this area of like technologists coming to a place and inventing a word you know so the hackernoon wasn't a word it was a domain i bought for 13. what yeah the 13.99 on godaddy well that's probably worth a lot more huh yeah i mean it was a clean combination you know it's hacker afternoon so hacker where was the inspiration to call that one well let's just think about this okay why did you want to create on the something on the coding side right if you have not been affiliated so much in the coding site i know you're building websites and stuff like that but why you know create a publication you know people that read hacker noon for coding advice think hackernoon is just for coding you know the library is pretty big and we just kind of welcomed and we said hey you can publish anything about technology in an editor will review it and we'll distribute it and photos kind of just naturally emerged as kind of this underserved group that needs a little help with all their expertise needs to repackage it needs to have a better headline it was just a group of people that like fit the service i was offering really well so it wasn't to me it was just i wanted to create a technology site and say hey anything about technology you can publish here i want to create a site where you can learn anything and that's about technology and kind of have this vertical because i tried it with uh p.s i love you and poetry a marketing site and all these seo people and it was like the technology stuff is just more interesting and it's a better it's a better model and it's more people they're on their keyboard all day you know yeah the second women to read their stuff is always appreciated i love that and so basically they just your goal from what my perspective is your goal was not necessarily to just go ahead and attract you know developers your goal is to be able to attract anybody who want to be able to put on you know any article around technology in general it's just maybe because of the name the name number one and number two they're the lack of you know technology publication complicate publication companies there kind of brought them in just organically over time is that how i was uh that's pretty accurate um yeah pretty accurate and i i would just i mean i don't know if the other ones uh there's always a place to write but even over the last 10 years there's so many more places than there was 10 years ago so much easier to get a site live and as hard as ever to get people to visit your site you know so there's kind of that underserved thing of like okay what's the first thing when you do when you're trying to market a site well that other sites have to drive traffic to it that's right so there must be some tradeoff there of like how do you build up you know your webs on the internet where you're bouncing traffic around to each other yeah so i think that was an underserved uh group and and the underservedness led for predatory behavior and central entities so like becoming the social network it's all this power like facebook steals all the power from the publishers and they're just saying hey we're deciding where the traffic goes which publisher we rank above another in a news feed and now that's a tough thing too they took advantage of the trend just much better of uniting the internet really fast but then it's their own vested interest of what stories they want to serve you and why and you're not getting hey what stories does this site want to serve me i think that's right okay okay okay i see i see so okay my interesting now portion okay is okay great so you went with hacker no you bought the domain name for 13 which i think is really interesting and they are now serving you know uh you know a lot of people are posting articles i know this is what people want to hear or people want to know right now david okay there's one thing people want to know right now it is what technology did you use to build it right now no i mean before the first time the first hacker dude yeah medium medium.com we use their content manager oh really okay okay okay so it was me to come initially or they wanted people to just publish on medium.com when they started i thought medium.com was gonna set out to be right here publish everywhere and as they were bringing in all these back channel and big publishers i thought that's a great model for writers to publish many places and so i was uh much more bullish on their early software than uh whatever they're doing now gotcha and so what have what now did you use after that so uh firebase is our database so firebase and versal we're using both they're kind of our primary two databases right now um but a lot of different technologies we've plugged in there if you go to the about page there's like a big logo thing and you can see all of them and uh we're starting to open source more of them a lot of our own fonts um open we have a component thing coming up we have the free internet plugin the text editor we used slate js and we also just built a new one with um outline so two different open for open source text editors that we kind of built and customize and add some different things in um yeah well a lot of different things floating around we designed our own emojis we open source those so there's like pixelated emojis so you can do different reactions you can take them use them however you want we pixelated all the social networks to kind of clown on them a little bit of like hey you can't put your perfect logo on our site and we're not putting your tracking pixel no you can't do that so there's some like we're tracking google and google's firebase anyway so if they want to steal our information they obviously you know whatever i mean they already have all the information it's okay there's always these tradeoffs it's like oh can you afford a software that costs 20 000 a month or do you want to trade some of this information and go the google analytics tradeoff across the whole web is like a remarkable growth strategy but i don't know how it's going to evolve you know i'd rather pay them more and have a little more control over that but we'll see how the internet kind of plays out hopefully more of these smaller companies start to emerge and not get sold right away and they start to emerge and prosper and we have a little more uh diversity of large tech companies at the top i love that and i see here in the comments lynn smoke is that that your wife links yeah right some link some smoke so she went ahead and she said basically what you guys are using is something called outline and next to yes versal firebase prisma and font awesome [Laughter] i like to ask that question because we're out with ahrefs uh we've got some stuff coming out with them uhhuh we got some stuff coming out with grammarly uh mmhmm yeah you got web monetization floating around in there have you guys i mean so next i know next year is a react gs so you guys are using react.js kind of with next gs so first up gets into to go ahead are you guys you guys are using firebase actually fully do you guys use firebase um as well to uh put it on live as well uh it depends where it is in the product um but uh so more of the root domain is on versal and then app and different subdomains authentication firebase um storage and firebase a lot of user user data of around all the stories you know keeping the stories in a couple different places have a backup that's cool i know this is what a lot of you know developers like to hear it's like what technology they're using to learn about whatever technology is you know okay great so i don't know take it back to where we you know left off from which is okay you start this hack renewal thing and you start to see people coming in through there you know which point then you know what you realize that okay i want to take this a lot further and i want to focus in fully on that well with the equity crowdfunding we kind of opened up a software team and now we've doubled revenue three years in a row and we've passed last year's revenue pretty significantly already so we kind of opened up where we could hire a few more people and really in solving our own problems we want to build little different software applications so one of these is called slogging and you can see it at slogging.com and basically it's slack blogging and it's turning our own conversations into hacker noon post so this little app that we've been using internally and with some hacker noon writers so we published about 150 posts and it's about having a community discussion and then you click three buttons you turn it into a hacker noon draft editor reviews it and publishes it so that came out of our tech lead having 28 000 slack updates in a year and only 12 hacker noon posts and it was like okay that's not a good ratio all the great writing is sitting around yeah that no one reads so except us so that's kind of where the core of the idea came from and now it could go many different directions that's right i'm boarding kind of our first communities here um to try it out and start publishing it but it could become a standalone application where you can slog on your own site you know so right now it's all slogging on hacker noon um yeah and we kind of look to like solve our own solutions and then see if that software can be useful elsewhere so okay and so let me ask you this okay when you went ahead and get started and before you even hire your first engineer tell me you know who was working on it it was it just you or using your wife or is it just you yourself you know what was the kind of starting points there uh so outsourcing because software development was the first step and trying that and that didn't really work then i teamed up with jay zalowitz an engineer and uh helped scale a couple little applications about how to reach out and see what stories are trending and try and figure out ways to tell people this is a good place to publish and look at what's trending and use our insights about how you know once we start to rank for javascript terms now we have a little library here of like hey if you write about this you know it's gonna rank really well because we're building up our authority around this words so kind of that level of insight and editorial support was really helpful for getting these first group of contributors in and then feeling like someone else is on the other side of the screen and you know from there it was like me and parttime people for about a year and a half and then just me and ling for another year year and a half and then we did equity crowd funding extended the team uh then we did one strategic investment from coil to implement web monetization and kick off um a referral partnership with them about and coil is pretty cool because you pay coil five dollars and then anyone that's web monetized coil streams that five dollars to all the specific sites so all they do is add a meta tag to their site and we've had about 2 000 writers they add that meta tag to their stories and they get streamed a couple pennies from that five dollar subscription so it's like trying to look for you know innovative technologies like that is pretty fun uh so so so so back to the undercoil thing what was the purpose for that uh the purpose is to create another feature for writers and try and be a part of more ways to monetize the content you own on the web okay we want to provide more opportunities to writers so that was like something we were pursuing as a strategic partnership and they believe in us and they want us to grow bigger so we reached um an agreement and uh raised a million dollars from coil kept our company entirely common stock priced it so it increased the value of the company from the equity crowdfunding and it's nice to get priced again like all the hard work i'm doing can someone evaluate this thing and look how cool it is there's nobody that nobody see what's going on here i'm working so hard every single day and nobody can see it [Laughter] it's that was really cool because the um the founder of coyle used to be the cto of ripple and he closed our equity crowdfunding round we were doing an event at get headquarters in san francisco i had never met him before the event ends and he just tweets out something like just ended just was the last investor in the hackernoon crowdfunding round and the round was over because it hit the cap so it was like a cool like and i just found out his dad also invested in the round independently of him crowdfunding yeah like a 60 70 year old guy that's just really excited about technology and reads the site that's like that's so cool does he know maybe making articles on the site or no is it just like no he doesn't he hasn't done his first one yet maybe i'll message him that'll be interesting that'd be interesting okay great so you were you know you guys did some crowdfunding and and at which point did you guys realize you know we need to hire now developers like inhouse developers and did you have any difficulties around that uh yeah so we i mean whenever we wanted the equity crowd funding and pivot to our own software was all it's one thing it's saying hey if we don't control the software experience we don't control the site it's it's not our experience and people can steal it from us whenever they want you know or you're just locked into a shitty experience like if you tried to optimize our editorial flow within a wordpress it could be done but it would be a brutal amount of work yeah our experience and our workflow into your workflows right you've already wordpress has so many like the whole ecosystem it's built out it's there it's not exactly the most flexible to say my site works differently than yours yeah might interact differently than yours they need a different flow they need a different experience so that having that moment and having enough readers to believe in us to help us make that step and having enough sponsors to keep this thing going and it was that was definitely a tough move for us and we had to work really hard and hopefully come out the other side you know looking good and making a bunch more money and you know we have we have employees now for the first time buying houses which is super cool that's so cool we i think we had three uh so far this year of the 11 uh you know go move into their own house so like that's super cool is like judging my impact on the world yeah you know you can we're working here as we're making enough money and have a good enough business that people can work here and improve their lives so yeah that's all that's always one of you know the biggest impact right even here clever programmer right when we went ahead and started you know clever programmer and it's like now seeing that you know you know one person you know is getting apartment in like in like you know it's and they're improving their life in that way another person is doing this they're putting off in that way it's always just it's so it makes it very different for why you do things like it makes it you know you realize that this is why you do the things that you do you know that as a team if you as a team can become successful and you run this business and you guys are all growing together everybody is growing together everybody you know either make you know getting better in their skills everybody is growing in terms of you know their standards in life you know they're getting better and you know happiness uh that's like i don't know i don't know if it gets better just in general you know that's that's pretty much what you want i feel i feel like in life i mean i i think more small sustainable internet businesses would be just a great place to be in the models right now is still very much too heavy of invest in an idea and then grow the idea and then sell the idea to somebody else and sell the thing so like i think if more people would look at internet longevity and try and say hey i'm a sustainable business i make more money each year maybe it goes up more maybe it goes up less but it's enough that it keeps growing and you own it in 10 years 20 years from now it's still a business with all the shareholders that actually grew it as opposed to saying hey it got bought out and put into the shelf onto someone else's product suite and the the essence is you know kind of sometimes that dies you know yeah those type of stages uh but back to the the other question you're asking our first engineers that we hired um the very first uh leader chief product officer we had as my one of my best friends and i had worked with him for eight years i was in the group at his wedding and he he i was actually a client of his when his old startup they actually hired me to do some writing and messaging for them his name is dane lyons and he he's since uh started his own company after rebuilding hackernoon um where he's doing v1 labs where he's building all these micro apps and doing a micro app with nfts right now that looks pretty cool nice so that and then he hired his old you know best pair programming so that was his first tire of like that so like there is like the referrals are really valuable in the beginning and then to me it's referrals and inbounds or like we're at the stage where that's all we need for people and all the early developers as companies get bigger they want to like hire recruiting firms and target specific skills and if i'm targeting anyone it's like me or ling and we're like reaching out talking to them figuring out like hey we admire you it's not like we're not paying anyone else to do that we're not paying for any like recruitment marketing ads or we're not going to career camps yeah and well no one's really going out and it's not kind of their career camps are coming back you're kind of like hey do you united do you know anybody do you anybody do you know anybody yeah i mean i i agree with that that's a really important aspect you know in hiring this is um and also i talk a lot about this too here on clever programmer on youtube and just in the boot camp in general a lot of times is guys your network is very important your network around who you know what you you know what you know is probably one of the most important things you can be as a developer it's really hard for example even for me when i was applying for jobs you know my first job that i got oh i look back at it and i'm like you know most of the jobs that i had were pretty much through referrals you know it's it's like yes i applied to a lot of these companies i went to all these interviews and so forth but the actual jobs i had were all through referrals and that i think this has a lot and so this is a lot about as well i mean coming from dave david here is guys a lot through referrals but i've actually never got a job through referrals i mean part of the point of this whole thing was to never have to apply to a job again and i just work for my own company um but the first job i actually got with smart recruiters i had been replying to all these jobs had no network as a 21 year old and just had like oh check out my little site bro i didn't have like much going on then what but what changed actually because i was doing the traditional cover letter and resume but then i just started reaching out on social networks and writing like three to four sentences about what i like about their business and how i could grow it wow that's actually how i i cold messaged i think through linkedin for smart recruiters and i just told the ceo what i like about the model that he's putting out and what i think i could grow and then i got a message back in like a day wow okay if you actually tell them something to help their business they're more likely to want to meet with you i know i know it's crazy how that works out ah when you want to help people they just respond you know so it's actually really interesting links literally just recently commented she said one of our employees recruit people from via hinge and tinder i couldn't comment on that i thought that was really interesting so okay great so you you guys went ahead and now you're hiring people tell me a little bit now in terms of what are some hardest what are the hardest things that you have faced potentially when trying to build this because of course like it or not there's always challenging times there's always difficult times what are those tough times you know because of course we've had some tough times of course i'm sure you have too um i mean there's the unpredictability of traffic on the internet and specifically google you know our top source of traffic is google and so like sometimes that goes up and down they change an algorithm or they favor one site over another so there's an element of like what's in your control and what's not you know as a business owner you want to spend your time doing things that are in your control and positively you know improving all this improving the growth the ceiling of your business but also you know raising the floor and patching all the problems so there's that element of like what you can control and what you can't and then so that's um something that i think i've worked on getting better at and just being um picking projects and doing doing things in a way where i'm i'm impacting the business on the things that i control because the bigger it gets the less i control the more people are out there just following and doing what they think their job is and the more it's just the things bigger it's not the same as hey all the labor going into it is me waking up and me sleeping and so getting over that like hump and how to be better at each stage of the business is definitely it's something i'm working on every day you know not just trusting like you know how to do your job go for it yeah i mean i'm guessing of course it's not easy you know as a ceo you have to be you have to know there's a lot of things you have to you have to be aware of right even when this when the team is smaller it doesn't matter there's actually even a feel like harder sometimes because there's a lot more communication you probably will have with the people that you work with um and then you have to be on this side and then this side so i definitely i definitely get that get that portion what about you know things around you know uh what is the best times do you see what are the things that you guys love when you're running a business like this i mean it's it's always nice to read the random actual kind comment on the internet i'm doing nothing and something kind of just popping up so there's a little there's some endorphins there and some vanity of just like sweet i'm working on this hard it's not just sustainable for the people working on it but the people using it are also gaining value and they're saying hey i'm glad this site exists and if hacker new didn't exist i wouldn't learn that or hacker noon i published here and i got my job later there so like little wins that happen in your life like just cherish them you know as an entrepreneur it's like most of it is just running your head against the wall and moving the wall like slightly forward and so like when the flowers come you know like smell them take your time enjoy it so those are great i mean working from home you know i've been remote i had the first i had an office on flood street in san francisco and then when i had my daughter and got married i moved out to the country in colorado so just being able to work remotely with my wife and be in fresh air and be thankful to set up a good support system and uh sit in my own home office and you know type here like setting up a life that uh makes my work better uh so i think that stuff is really a lot to be thankful for and i mean a lot more people are getting it now with remote jobs but it's still a ton of back and forth and people get a job but they have to show up these places they have to work remotely sometimes in the office others and the pandemic accelerated all this but just having a good healthy remote work setup is something i'm extremely thankful for no i agree i agree remote from all work has been amazing i mean with when kobe started yeah it's been great it allowed me to a lot of us to focus as well you know uh but sometimes i mean for me personally like i love remote work and i love being a hobo sometimes like oh my god i cannot i cannot not wait to get out of the kit out you know yeah it's healthy to walk a lot and have your other goto places um and i mean i i don't we don't have an office right now but i wouldn't rule it out forever like having a small office and mixing it up and having a couple people meet there that'd be interesting yeah especially if you get to do youtube when you guys had to collaborate together like for me the collaboration portion is always the most important portion you know if you wanted to make videos and collaborate and that's like that's how when all the brains come together and that's when you know magic happens [Laughter] so let me ask you this okay you've been you've done some amazing things now with hacker noon um you do some amazing things right now where do you see the future of hacking on of hacker know now at this point so we want to continue down the path we're on becoming a better place to read write learn and publish and learn anything about technology and be this massive free resource i want to do a better job of reflecting the technology industry so that means you know right now we've done a good job of leveling up the people that are building and providing them with a voice on the internet and leveling up that voice and getting more discussion around the things that the people are actually building it or thinking about so we want to also hold the tech companies a little more account accountable and also empower them to like tell their story next to the whole web so we build tech company news pages where we're aggregating the discussion around every tech company and what they're talking about on the internet and what people are talking about them on hacker noon so a little bit of that like the character that greases all these wheels is the technology company themselves they're the ones making the revenue they're the ones finding it they're the industry that's growing head over foot as every industry needs more technology help and more technology abilities so there's we want to get a little better at that and kind of look more towards like how terminal works for bloomberg or how crunchbase worked for techcrunch so a little more there and then more opportunities for contributors and saying hey contributors you can plug in your coil meta tag you can get subscribers for your newsletter here you can drive traffic to book a call and get paid to book calls or book a customer and say hey get a demo of my software so more explanation of who these people are and what actions they want on the internet so to help them out and then for the readers just more customization of getting the content you want the larger this library gets the harder it is to get to the thing you actually want it's like there's more ways to get into the library but it gets complicated so that recommended stories that clean user experience that customization of hacker noon to making it your own and picking your own tags and getting recommended the stories you want and not the ones you don't so and just building more softwares that like we reuse elsewhere and looking at solving our own problems and creating these assets that we can open source or build a company or build a little team around and hey this this proves enough promising that we have like our own voting software and you know we vote this thing to vote on all the best contributors and have these awards around the internet and get sponsors to give things to the awards and it's like cool that's another we could use this voting software for many other things yeah like on startup of the year for every startup in the world which we're going to do so there's that's um kind of where we're going i just want to spend my time making it a better place to read write and learn and just build more software and that's kind of what i'm focused on and bringing in you know more stories about technology i love that i love that and so for you i'm just very curious right you loved you know building companies you love building software have you what what is your say on no you have you coded i'm just curious like have you put went down into that into that dark hole of coding or no i can open a terminal and like spit some stuff through and i can customize html i can inspect and look at css and play with it and move it let's go i'm at best of shitty coder i know just enough about it to talk to a software developer just enough just barely do you enjoy that i'm just curious um i enjoy more of the process of thinking about ripping stuff up and how software can grow and now that the ecosystem gets bigger the implementation of new feature is as important as the new feature and how does it fit with every other piece of software where are the integration points where are you cannibalizing traffic why is it leaving where could you put this instead those questions and like throwing something in and looking at the results and looking at the numbers and then seeing if i need to rip it out or how i could change it that that's more of where i get um the brain juice and the euphoria the creative word that it's like it's fun to break it and it's fun to fix it it's fun to break it it's fun to fix it that's that's much more where i get the enjoyment i love it i love it well david we've talked about a lot of things we've covered you know
