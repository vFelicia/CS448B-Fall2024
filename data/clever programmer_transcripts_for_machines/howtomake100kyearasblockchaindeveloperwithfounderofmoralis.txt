how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year as a blockchain developer guys today is gonna be an amazing treat for you because you're gonna learn how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year as a blockchain developer and uh i brought on ivan who's the founder of morales to talk to you guys about it so ivan welcome brother welcome uh glad to have you here thanks man thanks man good to be here and by the way thanks a lot for inviting me because i know that your community is big you do so many great projects here on the channel and you have a very knowledgeable very respected community so good to be here thanks a lot absolutely man um this is awesome now we're actually live on youtube we weren't before yo what's up aaron we got guys today we are actually live so i'll be bringing up your questions or anything that you guys have along the way make sure to go ahead and mention that um and we'll bring them up but i think ivan a lot of people are seeing the crypto boom happening right so p some people are aping in and trying to invest their life savings but i feel like there's a much more guaranteed way to start making some income by doing something really useful and i and i feel like that has to do with being able to build on this platform and being able to use this technology of blockchain and to build on top of it you know what does that really mean how does somebody build on it and is there really opportunity here yeah that's a very good question and it's the correct place to start from because when you look at whoever is most successful in crypto is not the traders whether you look at vitalik or charles hoskinson or whoever that has done anything significant in the space they're builders they either build some kind of protocol or some kind of application or some kind of company so that's very important to realize that the biggest opportunity is building it is to create something in the space that that really makes an impact and it does the same thing with the insurance when the insurance was new you could trade some stocks yes it they they went up then they went down but the big opportunities f is everyone who actually started something a company a project so i totally agree that you have to build that's the best and most sure way to succeed in crypto in web three and when it comes to building you have to start off by understanding the tech tag and you have to start off by taking it very seriously and methodically and i have a whole video on youtube if you just google morales uh web3 techstack you will see i explain it for 15 minutes but on a big picture you can start even if you are a web developer if you're a web developer right now you can be a web 3 developer because of course all web three applications need front ends and from there you can start using different tools like ethers like web3.js or like morales which we build in order to log in users authenticate get their transactions interact with smart contracts and so on and so forth uh but there are many many things we can go into we can speak about frontend space in web3 we can speak about smart contracts we can we can go into many different directions so it's up to you where you want to go guys absolutely yeah so i think i want to start off with like the opportunity right because for for the broader perspective most of the people aren't developers who are into the blockchain space yet or the web3 space i think for a lot of the viewers that might be watching right now i think you know they might even be like what the heck is this you know what's the opportunity here yeah and so i think i want to start off with is there an opportunity here does that exist you know how much are these developers making is that real and then i think once we kind of cover that i feel like let's then dig deeper into you know the technologies they can use and how we can use maybe even think tools like morales to make their lives a lot easier well of course there's opportunities you can look at the wage statistics the salary statistics and i think web 3 is among the top it's even above the ai space and and iot space and everything else that is very up and coming in tech web3 is above all of that when it comes to salary and becomes your opportunity so that's one way of looking at it and another way of looking at it is that this technology no matter which salary you get now this this technology is really the next iteration of the internet so the salary itself in my mind does not really matter because all technologies that that are going to be monumental it's worth working in them no matter what i mean you could imagine if you could work for free in in web 2 in the 90s i mean just when these protocols were developing where you could like be one of the first developers to use ajax just to send some uh yeah yeah from your site i mean it doesn't matter what you get paid for you get to work with blazing edge technology so there is there is a lot of opportunity but i i personally i don't think a lot on on the actual salaries and wages because there are many things you can earn money it's more for a long term if you do this in 10 15 years you're gonna be one of the top experts in the world and that's the best thing with web web 3 it is very early on and you can actually become best in the world right you can imagine becoming best in the world with something like web development it's impossible all right it's important you will not be best in the world there's too many people doing that but web3 it's so new nobody is doing that so that's the biggest opportunity that you can do something for a few years and you can really become top in the world at it right you can see this is build companies build projects whatever you want them i was just gonna say i've seen so many developers man when i was i was trying to hire a lot of blockchain developers to work on our team and like the the people with the most amount of experience was crazy it was like five months four months one year and even exactly exactly when i looked at the market i'm like yo those are the senior developers like those are the senior developers right now so i feel like that way the opportunity is huge i love your points about it being bleeding edge right it's something new that people can jump into and start learning and be ahead of the curve because it's the advantage that people had who jumped on the internet and started developing on it or the people that started jumping on new languages and technologies were like the developers that were doing pascal and cobalt and stuff like that started becoming you know legacy technology that very few companies started using in the future and so i think to your point it's really beneficial to stay with the curve and like keep moving forward exactly and let's also speak about what web3 is because many people they they throw out the words web3 but they don't really understand it so web3 is all about the different protocols that ensure that we can have decentralized applications where value is part of the internet where value transfers and really the value holding and value creation is part of the intro protocols what does it mean for example if you have ether you can send it to anyone you can program it it's programmable money so we can hold value we can transfer value back and forth and we can build on it as an open product call and that's the best thing for me about web3 because it ensures that you and i have ownership rights and property rights on the internet because without property rights on the internet we will all be living online very soon you know zuckerberg is investing in diverse a lot now his whole company is called meta a lot of big tech companies are investing in them in the matters also because the trend is that we will all be spending more and more time online maybe in vr ar who knows how the actual form form factor is going to be but the trend is clear we're heading towards basically 24 7 online experience that's if you look at the screen time how much time we're spending in a few generations it's going to be all online but look if that happens do you and i own something there can we own assets can i own some kind of real estate some kind of item or do i not own it or is it just an entry in the database that can be erased at any moment which happens all the time with the platforming as you as you know so it's a very important uh concept this this concept of web3 is key it's a protocol for value and ownership which is global which is neutral meaning that no company no government controls it and most important for us as developers we can build on it we can program money we can create our own assets we can build lending borrowings synthetic assets derivatives you can program it you can never pro program this before web 3. before web three you have to bake paypal maybe they give you access to their api and maybe they shut you off tomorrow and what can you do you can accept payment that's it can you program if you have an innovative idea can you program it dude i'll tell you once i'll tell you i'll tell i'll tell you one story right so like one of the times i was when i launched my business um i started making an income from uh you know i was accepting money through paypal and uh i don't know it was like 20 30 000 that paypal saw come in and you know keep in mind i went from like not having any transactions go through paypal through all of a sudden have 20 30 000 comes through paypal flags it as a high risk potentially fraud type of thing and dude they locked up 20 or 30 grand from me for a year or two years you know and at that time that was everything for me when i was starting out and i was like this is this is and i couldn't control and i couldn't do anything talk to me is that something somebody could do to me in like if i was you know doing this in the crypto world if i i don't know if i had ethereum those 20 30 000 worth could could i be shut down or could they mark my stuff as as high risk and and keep me from getting my own funds so you can on a protocol level you can do whatever you want you you have your money you can transfer them it's cryptographic you have the private key for a wallet you can sign the transaction the network will accept it now of course if you have a bank or paypal for example they may ban your address if paypal adds a feature where you can cash out your crypto into dollars then they of course they might put restrictions but the whole point is that we can do transactions between each other without having the intermediaries without having paypal or banks in in the middle and that's only one use case for developers the best thing that has happened here is that we have the biggest sandbox development sandbox where you and i can build whatever you want issuing assets like i mentioned or programming money flows if i send so basically we can create more contracts smart contract is a program that can hold money and it can decide what to do with money based on our code and you program this smart contracts in solidity which is a programming language that you show very well on the clever programmer which is kind of like javascript it's so easy to start with and the we can program hey you send money to this program if this happens it will send it there if that happens if it will send it there that's maybe the the most simple program you can build if this then that or you can have something more complex that we can have a a an onchain exchange like for example with uni swab where people can trade assets back and forth i have ethereum you have usdt tether or something else we can trade between each other without intermediaries that's maybe the most insane use case so it's kind of like so just to uh connect it for everybody it's like when you say unit swap it's kind of like being able to exchange on there it's almost like being able to exchange on robinhood without it being centralized in any way and nobody controlling it and you just get to make your own trades exactly and the best thing you can embed it in your app meaning let's say you have a game and you want people to earn some ingame currency or maybe they kill a monster they have some loot they have some gold now they can trade that gold for east i mean that's crazy without is there just a protocol you don't have to apply to some you know verification get some paypal accept no you just integrate uni swap use a protocol you list your coin there anyone can lose their coin and now you can have is ingame swapping and anyone can do it you can be 12 years old you know simple javascript you can do it it's insane and that's really what i love the best that what what web3 is doing to value and money is basically what iphone did to phones because iphone ensures that you can now program phones you can program phones with iphone before you had nokia they gave you three applications they gave you sms they gave you phone calls and then they gave you the snake game and that's it and that's basically that's basically what what we have before web 3. before we have like paypal you have stripe and that's it you don't have anything else now with web3 uni can build anything with one so it's really opening up this whole potential for a whole development ecosystem where the full talent and the full potential of humankind is unleashed you can be a developer you can be whichever developer you want you can program you can build you can innovate so yeah i love that that is really powerful i love that example you gave with an iphone and by the way guys if you're here watching this smash that like button let's get this video out to more and more people let's please start smashing it and um we have a question here for you can a database of a blockchain be shareable so i imagine this question basically means you know hey if i have mongodb i can share it with people i can have people jump in you know can can that be something that's shareable well the whole idea with blockchain is that it sure it's shared by default it's open by default so all the ethereum transactions are readable and accessible by everyone so that's what we mean that is global and it's neutral meaning that anyone can read it anyone can write to it anyone can access it and it's amazing for storing financial transactions it's amazing for storing balances and all of these different basic basic features of a blockchain but of course it's not meant to be used for everything let's say that i have a game with 60 frames per second i mean of course i cannot run it on the blockchain because the blockchain it's very slow database and it is basically a mixture so for example when you look at ethereum or polygon or binance chain or avalanche it's it's a mixture of a blockchain uh of a database where you can just store transactions but also of a virtual machine where you can also execute your own custom logic your own smart contracts based on what's happening on the blockchain and you can send and you can program money to behave differently depending on what's happening on the blockchain so it's it's both blockchain definition of blockchain by itself is that it is this decentralized open database but also with a virtual machine where you can uh script what uh what will happen with the different coins and tokens depending on what happens uh which transactions happen on the blockchain in this database basically yeah absolutely okay so the short answer is yes it is shareable and the longer answer has i love what you said which is it's shared by shareable by default that's the whole you know idea behind but it's not for all use cases i mean if i let's say i have a game world i make world of warcraft but web3 i mean i cannot run it fully on chain it will not work because yeah we can only do seven transactions per second or so in e with layer two is faster but all the ingame ingame currency transfers and all of the monetary transfers that can be on chain the value transactions should be on chain and then everything else should be optioned because of course you cannot run the whole you know 3d 3d engine and all of that and all the game backend on chain it will not work but everything that has to do with asset with value with ownership transfers that can be unchained and that should be on chain yes got it um i'll giant has a comment that he he made that i think you'd appreciate and he says morales really made integration of web 3 and react really a piece of cake so kudos that's good nice work man that's good to hear um thank you just science guys just to provide some context guys morales is a software that you know ivan you've created right or you've worked with your team to create well like exactly exactly so i haven't created it but i'm one of the founders and we basically wanted to create an experience kind of like firebase kind of like super bass but in web 3 because before morales you had to have a backend team to even get started so for example when someone logs in with their wallet in your application if you don't use morales you need to create a backend where you verify the signature then you have to figure out how to get all of their assets which means that you need to integrate some kind of api and build out and scale it let's say you want to you have a smart contract you need to figure out how to listen to whatever happens in that smart contract to the different events so with morales we thought why why isn't there a solution which is just uh you know you your web interface where you can say hey um here are all the smart contracts i'm interested in just sync them all in real time and put it in my database or here is one line of code for you to insert in your front's application so you can accept users so that they can authenticate and we create user profiles and sessions and all of that so we basically took the the biggest use case possible which is logging users syncing user at the transactions seeking smart contracts swinky smart contracts event and made it as easy as possible with morales and yeah since then we've been growing it and we have a whole plugin ecosystem and things like that but the goal from the beginning was to create an experience that is familiar to all web 2 developers that have used like firebase for super i love that they want to go into web 3 yeah i love that i love your guys's focus on developer first and like really caring about the developers because yeah like that is true that's what i was doing like whenever i would like start building an application with on on the blockchain i would like whip up a backend i would be like hey we need to lock these users and when i discover morales i'm like wait that can just all happen at the same time in the same place right um and you guys have a database which is super nice um here's a good question it took me a second to kind of understand it but now i understand it and i think it's pretty good mustafa asks are we super early to jump in web 3 or is it time to learn and build web three so my translation of this is is are we like too early because everybody keeps saying early so he's saying is it like too early where there are not even that many opportunities there so maybe i should wait or is this the right time to actually start learning and building on web3 well of course it's the right time because what's your alternative are you gonna be a normal web developer look you're competing with 30 million you're competing with everyone in the world basically who is also a developer what what are you guys are going to uh you can go into ai and spend seven years learning the deep math of that and which is by the way fantastic but it's also it's overly hyped i remember in 2017 i when i was still doing masters in university machine learning was so hyped i mean uh all of the world's smartest engineers are already in machine learning so look what are you gonna do otherwise web stream i love it because because of the opportunity and because of the unfair advantage because we're still in a in a stage where the mothers don't tell their kids to go into blockchain right because this is when it's too late when you have the average mom telling hey you need to become a webster developer it's too late and guess what now all all mothers are telling their kids go become a doctor or become a developer okay but not a web 3 developer so that's this is the perfect opportunity and i personally i love all industries where people have not been thinking too much uh what do i mean well look at web2 there are maybe you know thousands if you look took every if you spend any time thinking about ideas in web 2 or technologies in web 2 and you just add everyone who has been thinking about web 2 probably is thousands of years humankind have spent thousands and thousands and thousands of years thinking about web 2 if you just put everyone's thinking time after each other yeah and look if you're going to come into web 2 maybe you want to build some kind of thing with react or something some kind of ios app look it's too late whatever idea you had it's probably already discovered and it's tested and there is already a market dominance by someone and there is already a monopoly probably so uh is there is too late but web3 we haven't been thinking a lot there are so so much opportunity and so so much arbitrage basically that you can discover a problem and chances are it's not solved chances are you're one of the first people trying to solve it so i definitely think that it's not too early and the earlier the better because you have more time to establish yourself and it's all about your conviction do you do you think that web3 is needed if yes it cannot be too early if you still don't understand it uh slightly more study more re read read about what it can be and uh and be convinced that and when you're convinced then it's a nobrainer yeah absolutely um yeah i think for me it was it it took me a while to get convinced but i think what got me in initially were like the monkeys and um being able to make money very very quickly and then that's what got me in and then i got i lost a couple of trades i like got rug pulled and then i was like you know what i i really need to learn this and then i actually started enjoying it so i came for the memes but stayed for the test right right that's great and also you know many people they say oh and nfts are so dumb you know nfc's this dumb apes many people that that are more you know veteran crypto so to speak they they complain but i love nfcs because they get us so much adoption people really find them fantastic it's a community i see graffiti i think it was in new york city i saw a lot of graffiti with this board ape so it's i think it has they have given us a lot they've given us so many great people developers like yourself and it's been a good um a good push for many people to get into web3 because before that we had d phi which is decentralized finance lending synthetic assets derivatives but that's too complex for the average joe it's too complex enough people don't know what derivatives are but people know what collectibles are what game assets are so nfc's it's a perfect segue and i think nfcs will give web3 worldwide mass adoption we're still not there but it seems to be the avenue for sure yeah i think um nfts as well as gaming i think i i feel like the future of gaming in in this space is going to be really really massive um i have yet to think about how they're going to integrate start integrating it later into like mainstream games but one of the games that comes to my mind is fifa like fifa would be the perfect because fifa has its own stock market with like five million active users i used to buy cards and see if i have messi or you know cristiano ronaldo or whoever else and i would unpack the cards all the time and then like my brother is always watching the fifa stock like which players values going up and down there's millions of trades going on in any given second and so i'm like i feel like if if the blockchain were to figure out its way into something like fifa you would have like a average kid making forty fifty thousand dollars six thousand dollars a year just playing games at home well that's one another one that i really like are these physical brands like nike for example that now have an opportunity to digitalize themselves for a fifa this may not be the perfect opportunity because they they are already digital they are all they have all of this transaction volume they're always digital but when you look at business opportunities i think for physical brands it's fantastic because imagine if nike they have a shoe and they create an nfc which can be redeemed for this special shoe and now people can trade this nfc between each other and speculate and maybe people will trade it a thousand times before someone actually redeems the shoe and nike can take a cut of all of the transactions and that's very nice business model for someone like a physical brand that wants to now become a digital digital brand and digital fashion so i think nike can 10x their revenue probably by doing some special digital edition they did yeah they launched their project and it sold out you know it was huge uh one of the projects that they heard them and adidas um zephyrine asks i have no professional working experience however i have worked on couple of hackathon projects on web3 having trouble landing my first internship job suggestions well i have many suggestions you need to figure out which projects you want to work with and don't just send them the resume it's too many people send the resume all projects uh and by the way it also applies to morales to to our project or to anyone else they have a community because that's the most important thing in web street that you have a community maybe it's on discord on telegram somewhere else so if i were you i would start being active there let's say that it's some kind of of a product maybe a game or something you can start helping people out maybe there's some bugs you can start fixing them maybe there is some opportunity to contribute to their open source repository you can start doing that so instead of cv be active in the community of course you can also send the cv but there are just so many and cvs will be reviewed by the hr department and they're going to look at it differently compared to if you contribute to the open source repository and you're going to get noticed by a dev or you're going to do something in their community and you're going to get noticed maybe by one of the founders because founders look at the community a lot and you're going to have different people look at you so i i would recommend that be active in the community have a portfolio of course i mean that's a given you need to have a portfolio maybe github maybe something else of projects and if you want to practically build up your portfolio you can go to morales.projects and uh we do this weekly project it's kind of like you have here a clever programmer so you can of course subscribe of course to a clever programmer here you're doing also projects but do do that do that and then maybe adapt them maybe continue building you watch clever programmers then continue building something to put a twist to them or or if you are in various projects do the same so you have a good base and then you you can continue building or and and and making them your own and the step two would be to be active in the communities and i think you you will very quickly find a job this way because i know for myself we've taken a lot of people from our community that we hired and some of the our best hires have been from the community because they already love morality they are already engaged they're already basically working but in their free time so it just makes perfect sense that we start working for real and they become part of the team so community community community be active in the community guys that's the best the best thing and it does it doesn't work like that in web too let's say i want to work in google i mean there is no telegram to go to like okay i know you know i cannot be there in there some kind of discord chat but in web 3 it's all discord i mean and that's because it's so early you know we're still like in discord like figuring out things and maybe this was like uh irc chats in the past oh yeah i wasn't part of that but but we're still early on people ever they what whoever you want to meet in web 3 you you can you can meet them you can meet them in the chat group that's the best thing with web3 yeah absolutely um we're getting really nice questions man there are a ton of questions i um one of the questions that just actually came in i want to address this actually is how long will it take me to learn blockchain tech from scratch so assuming somebody's a complete beginner and they're just about to start learning you know how long does it take for an average person who's maybe maybe a little bit of a developer has some developer experience but they want to learn blockchain how long would you save till they they understand it and use things with it i think it can be in a couple of months and it all depends which niche you want to take because there is no such thing as you know learning blockchain completely it's like learning intro completely there are so many things i can do frontend backend devops i can go into spark cassandra i mean all of the different backend systems it's impossible to know everything so you need to pick your niche if you want to be in front and for example you can check out web3 ui kit on github which is also a project that we're contributing to a lot and that's where you can find a react library which is compatible with your current knowledge and you can very very simply plug and play it into web three so web3 akit if you are a web3 developer if you want to write smart contracts you need to learn hard hat you need to learn solidity and it's going to be a longer journey but i think you need to do that because it will show you how you write your own smart contracts you can program money it shows you how to program money the fact that you can and it's not difficult to start imagine you have you have a java class or python class but you change a few syntax syntax ways of writing different variables and and loops and stuff like that and now you have a solidity program which can accept money it can decide what to do with money so learn solidity and you're gonna use solids together with hard hat so hard hat is like this dev tool that allows you to deploy contracts and to manage your contracts um absolutely well also by the way before you before you do any of this you need to of course install metamask and figure out how that works and use use the different applications use openc use uni swap you have to be a web 3 user first before you can be a developer i mean that's that's an obvious thing but very easy to miss and an important thing to mention because many people that want to be in web 3 they may not even use web3 yet so maybe spend a few months just using it you need to so for example if i were to give you a list buy an nfc on openc figure it out make a trade with uni swap figure it out go into why earn uh and do some uh stake some assets there and earn some yield uh poke around with this maybe invest in some ico like just just for trying one of these token launches it's not even called ico nowadays it's called the launch pads so you can go to launchpad just you know try it out put in 50 bucks see what happens so you understand how to claim tokens how to stake tokens how to participate in all of these different operations that people do in web3 like for example launch pass when you when you tokens launch of course don't put any serious money into this because you don't know anything you're probably going to lose it because of the many ways you can also lose funds in this industry that's how i got it that's how i got it yeah you're gonna lose more by not trying you're gonna lose more in opportunity cost by being on the sidelines so best you lose you know you let's say you get drug pulled which is a way of uh as a way of saying that you've been scammed uh let's say you get dragged okay lose 100 bucks you maybe you lose a whole career if you don't try it so uh exactly that's a good one you lose more money by not trying it that's very true yeah that's golden man that is uh that's a golden one that's exactly what i thought i said i thought man i'll lose much more if i don't try and i went in with the money that i was willing to lose because how do i expect to win i'm brand new to it you know it's like going to tennis for your first time and just going i'm gonna crush everybody no you're not you're gonna lose you're gonna get destroyed like i came back from jiu jitsu today and i i'm like relatively new to it everybody just smashes me and i'm just like tapping out you know it doesn't matter who they are they're like choking me out so i expect to lose i'm like that with the whole world of crypto i jumped in expecting to lose but i love all the strategies that you were giving at the end which is like buy an nft you know even if it's like ten dollars like some it can be the smallest cheapest nfts you guys can buy actually make a trade and you'll end up learning so much i learned way more by actually doing things then like any blog article that i read because i understood oh there's like eth and then there's weath which is wrap teeth and you can convert it like this and yes i need to use uniswap and i was trying to do some really degen stuff and like my friend was showing me slippage and all this crazy stuff and exactly but you don't have to get too deep just just build a wallet so you you get a metamask wallet you get some heath into it uh so you fund it with some heath then you do some trades with nfts with uni swap and uh do maybe spend maybe a few days doing that then you can start developing so you can go to morales you can go to docs.morales. and then you will start learning how to build a dashboard for your wallet so basically the next step is just build a website in react where you can connect your wallet and where your website can then show you all of the things you've done so you can show this one so you can build then you can build yourself a website that shows okay you have this many if you have this many tokens this many nfts then you hear all your transactions because then you you can start you know you start feeling ah man this is actually programmable stuff you know i can connect yeah i really like that i want to actually build that for myself because i hate opening metamask i think their ui is like terrible um phantom has an amazing ui but like metamask ui like yeah so i would want to build something of my own that shows how i'm using the money the trend that dude that's actually a great idea so next in the roadmap is that you can create your own coin so after you've done this that you've just interacted with a bunch of stuff you can use morales to build the dashboard next you can launch your own coin using uh solidity and hard hat and you don't even need to know solidity because there are templates so you can go to open zeppelin which is a website with all a bunch of different smart contract templates and when you want to launch a coin you basically deploy a smart contract you deploy a a small program which is like a java class you can think about it but it's solidity solidity class but instantly it's not called class it's called smart it's called contract and you deploy it and you just say hey this this coin it has a million coins in circulation and you give them all to your wallet and then you can send it to the different other wallets so that way you've also now deployed something on chain you've deployed an asset on chain you've you've done something you know you've you've started programming money it's not only that you program where you read from your wallet which was the dashboard step now you've actually deployed your own asset you're programming on the blockchain now and yeah i mean then sky is the limit look at that point you will you will know enough to figure out the rest yourself because you know at some point you reach some escape velocity and you know how to research on your own then you kind of know you know oh i want to learn about lending or oh i want to learn about more nft more nfc related technologies so when you reach that escape velocity you will understand on your own where to go which tutorials to watch you will become independent i love that um this question looks pretty good so i'll pop that up here hamza asks do we need to have previous software engineer experience to excel in web3 or starting in web3 and sticking into it will also help us excel as some big web 3 companies like consensus want that experience well i think if you are completely new it's like with all programming it's better if you have programming experience than not have of course so you just know that you will probably have to learn the basics first probably it's better to learn javascript first before going into web three or so literacy is because in javascript you have big community a lot of books tutorials courses so i would say before going into web3 learn javascript and learn you know normal programming because it's all needed anyway in web3 you are learning web3 by learning javascript and then you can enter afterwards and you know if some big webs like someone like consensus will hire you uh i don't know if that's the it's like entering you know web 2 and asking will google hi i don't know man probably there are way more opportunities for you to do something on your own or or do something else than to aim for google instantly because it's not even for everyone but and even if it is it's uh basically no consensus they do mathematics so it's like it will matamus hire you i don't know maybe in a few years if you work hard yeah no i agree i agree um yeah these are these companies are kind think of it like the google of tomorrow and uh you know the facebooks of tomorrow these are like the big companies that are growing you have you have more chances of honestly joining one of these than like say google because they have like standardized their way of testing and they're so rigorous right now with web3 what i've noticed opportunity is insane um and a lot of people and companies just want talent that's willing to even show that they're willing to learn because everybody's new like most people honestly have months of freaking experience um and i know founders that are hiring them you know including myself and so i think as long as you have your heart and passion in there you can definitely jump in and it's a very practical um thing for you so you know going going on the whole thing of you're like okay learn solidity learn these learn these technologies and then you can start building stuff you know then what like so i i i learn stuff i can build stuff with this then what do i just start applying to jobs or do you do you stand by your way of i go into communities and just start adding a ton of value there as a developer well i mean it depends who you are as a person if you are more entrepreneurial you could see a problem in the industry and it can be many different problems so for example it can be that you come from a country and you see oh there's no like reporting tax tool for your country or it may be oh i see this use case with defy but there are no good wallets for it maybe let's create a wallet or you see some other thing like there is a coin but it's not easy to to take it cross chain maybe you can build a bridge and in all of these different uh different use cases there are of course ways to monetize it whether it is that you have some kind of fee or you have some kind of token that you can monetize through it's you really going to figure it out yourself as you go along but at the end of the day it depends who you are maybe you want to join a company like a consensus or something else maybe you want to join a traditional maybe you see that hey you have a big company that is web 2 and now they're going into web 3 and you can help them a lot because you you are now one of the top experts in the world because you've studied for two months [Laughter] when you start getting into this you will see more and more opportunities popping up it's kind of like you know you and i we're thinking about the medical field we're like so okay i learned medicine and then what i'm a doctor i am like you know local hospital that that's that's my limit but of course not there are probably like many different different ways that you can excel but before you start entering into this into space you you won't notice them so start start doing and then and invest your time because it will be worth it at the end of the there's nothing else you can spend your time on right now that will be as worth it as web 3. right exactly and a lot of it is about timing right right now doctors might not be exploding but like when the world war ii was going on i mean holy the opportunity to become a medical or doctor was probably exploding right it's like that matters um gregory horn has a really good one and ivan by the way whenever you have to leave just let me know it's all good but i just feel like we got a good energy going good questions coming through so i'm gonna keep going on my own gregory says asks is it preferable to develop a dap that runs on a web 2 traditional domain or a web 3 blockchain domain as part of a portfolio well you can do both you can show that you know how to do web 2 and web 3 because it's it doesn't you can have both but of course most dapps they are still in web 2 domains although you can of course use ens or you can use unstoppable domains or other protocols and now there is also a handshake i think is another one but none of them are really you know massive and you can definitely do both in most cases that you have a web 2 version and then you can upload it on ipfs and connect an ens domain for example yeah absolutely that's amazing um that's a that's a great way to answer that question people are really enjoying that we're both on here they're like yo ivan is ivan and kazi on the same stream let's go this is sick we'll definitely want to have you on here more um there are many critics about nfts that are ponzi scheme and web 3's a hype any thoughts on these i know kind of what your thoughts are um yeah and i know generally kind of what people's consensus are i don't know if you want to expound on this at all well yeah i mean i can i can speak for hours about this well first and foremost ponzi scheme people don't know what it means when they even say it i mean what is a ponzi scheme ponzi scheme is i take money from you i promise you a big return and then i i promise the same return to the other guy and then i take his money and give to you as your return and then i find the third guy and i give his money to the second guy and you know that that's a ponzi scheme all right nfts is just like any other market where people buy and sell things there's no promise of return there's no one that takes your money and says hey you give it to me i promise you that that would be a ponzi scheme nfcs are just assets that people trade with any assets whether it is real estate stocks nfts you can have a market where the prices are irrational they go up into in the skies and people become greasy and there's a lot of speculation which means that yes we may have a crash and people that bought at the top will lose money and people that sold at the top of the market will will earn money so it's just natural and look whenever there is a new technology it always creates these bubbles if you look back when trains were a new thing you go you can google this if you're watching this stream go google railway mania you will you will find that in 1800 or something like that 1800 in britain there was a new railway company starting each month why because railways people thought man trains you know railway it's crazy we can transport things across continents let's build companies less invest less great things using trains well of course it became a railway mania and how many railway companies you have now per country one maybe two so it consolidated the same thing with cars go and watch how many car manufacturers there were at the beginning of the of the previous century hundreds and hundreds now everyone was starting a car company let's build cars it's a new technology it was hyped you know people were doing cars left and right and and it was a hype it consolidated now maybe then you have mercedes you have audi you have a few others uh the same thing with internet early on everyone says let's do a dot com this dot com that people were following in there was a financial bubble and and then it's consolidated so probably something is going to be with nft most of this project is going to die a few of them are going to be successful and it's it's always like that when a new technology comes that is great it's going to create the hype is going to create a bubble people going to earn money people are going to lose money that are speculating but people who build and actually do something in this industry they are the guaranteed winners absolutely um yeah i think like building you can't go wrong with building because even if you like let's say lose financially in the short term you're gaining so much experience actually build something greater in the future so i feel like with building you can rarely go wrong at the very least you've developed your skill set and now you can go work for a company right so that's the big thing about building this is a really good question we have a senior developer in the house and he asks is moving to blockchain solidity a good idea for somebody with 13 years of experience with java node.js and archetype architect experience as well and how much salary on average can be expected considering person is already on good salary well i mean you can definitely expect very very competitive salaries i mean we're seeing everything from 200k to you know 300 and above in in some cases depending on your level of seniority because you have to understand smart contracts if you deal with hundreds of millions of dollars which if you are good you will you will be doing that i mean your code will be guarding hundreds of sometimes billions of dollars in this industry uh so of course when you're dealing where you do when you're dealing with that and uh i mean we also have many hacks you can just google recently we had the 600 million dollar hack you can google run in the network hack it was last week 600 million was stolen uh but uh this is the kind of things that you're you're doing in this space i mean you're programming money you're programming money so of course it it it can go it can it can vary a lot but if you're really successful and you know what you're doing then the sky's the limit and uh you should definitely start starting solidity juice if you are if you are but it depends on you on who you are of course if you're hungry you know you're hungry for success you're hungry for new adventures you're hungry for new uh new horizons then it's a nobrainer if you want to be a java developer with a good salary and feel comfortable then don't do it if you want to be in new horizons and explore new things and and take on a new industry then it's a nobrainer of course but yeah i don't want to say that everyone should do it because there are different situations look if you have family and kids you want to be very safe stick with your java and where you are right now if you are a bit more risky you know you want to try the solidity thing maybe work in a few protocols maybe it works out or it doesn't work out uh then absolutely it's a you should do it you should do it yep and as you were talking i don't know if you saw but i was just highlighting job opportunities and yep and you got your averages so these are averages on the left middle is the minimum and then these are some of the maxes you know um on the on the really really high end so you guys can go to web3.com yeah i i think i think that one is good for but i think the the what they got wrong in that list is the highest because uh once again i mean a lot of these devs they they guard hundreds of millions i think when it comes to the highest it's it's got to be higher than that i mean in many cases yeah i saw i saw some that were 600 000 to 750 000 as well um and uh you know you i think you know alex becker too in the field right i mean at least watch his videos and stuff and his developer who helped him launch neo tokyo i think cleared over a million millions of dollars you know working with them yeah so you have those rare right because a lot of companies what they're doing is they're giving a percentage as well of like the token or whatever exactly and and i think in many cases if you are a very good solution developer i mean very very good release developer uh but i would do that i would go into some kind of project that is doing some kind of nfc or some kind of asset and i would instead of having a big salary i would instead go for tokens yeah i love that yeah basically you're almost getting equity in those in the company that you're that you're with you know and i love the idea of tokens because i think when will morales release its tokens do you guys have something like that well we it could be on the roadmap nothing is decided yet but you know before we do it we want to be we want to be fully established you know we want to be already massive we don't want to do a token you know and then we're going to do things which unfortunately what most people do we want to do a token when when we have already changed the world to such an extent that our token is already the number one on uh on the number one page on coin market cap easily we don't want to be you know on some you know page ten coin market so for us we we're delivering first we're delivering first and uh and then what happens happens here wow i love that i will tell you one thing um this is something rare but i i look for a lot of qualitative feedback regarding people's products and services and things like that morales has really good qualitative feedback that i've been seeing around like you know i'm not even trying to push this down anybody's throats i'm not even like mentioning it's like from people in the community youtube videos even videos where we weren't doing morales like there will be a comment here and they're talking about hey can we use morales and i really like it so that's big man that's big to do that that's good here that's good to hear that's good to you yeah you guys should i mean you guys should be very proud of yourselves and i think you guys are building something phenomenal um really makes developers jobs easier so that's amazing um ivan do you have any more thoughts or anything more that you want to add oh by the way guys that was the april fool's joke i'm not deleting the channel um [Laughter] yeah i i shot i shot off twitter because you know i accidentally started to retweet some stuff which were like they kind of sounded true but then i realized man i've been retweeting the jokes like i've been there was a guy who said i'm starting my i started my first day at google today but you know goodbye web3 i was like whoa fantastic you know still good you know it's google [Laughter] and then i was like wait wait wait yeah then i i deleted everything shut the shot off twitter until tomorrow oh man um yeah i big bill i see what you said senior backend developer has paid more than junior blockchain developers are switchworthy um i don't know you decide man you decide i think that you could go into job opportunities that have back end involvement plus they want you to do blockchain and they might be willing to pay you a decent amount to be able to do that because like it's not it's not like all of a sudden web 2 is just vanished you know what i mean like um you still need web 2. um like if you don't have your web 2 wifi your web 3 won't work exactly that's true and you know i mean at that it all depends on the person yeah if let's say like you say if you're a backend developer and you can slowly nudge yourself towards web3 maybe let's say you're a backend developer and you're in a big company maybe you can just start pushing for web 3 projects because i assure you that all corporations they want to be in web 3 they want to be in in metawars they want to because for them it's important because they're investors the the shareholders this the stock price may may demand that that hey why are we not expanding why are we not exploring we're gonna be dinosaurs and if you then can start you know nudging yourself you're not taking too big of a risk maybe you you're in a big corporation you're starting to move more towards web three maybe you can establish a website department you can be the webster guru evangelist in your company i mean that alone can 5x your salary probably probably if you show that you're like the best expert they've got on this probably you can 5x your salary yeah there was a great question that came in earlier that i didn't ask earlier but i'll ask now um somebody asked um what kind of potato are you using for your camera ivan that's a good one so actually yeah i i i have a new lens a new lens that should do my background very blurry and uh and very nice but it's it's too much blur and i still haven't figured out you know which you know how how we should and look i'm so bad with cameras you know i i i think you just click on it but yeah at least you can hear me you can use it as audio yeah i think i think it's just your wifi is down i i think your camera or maybe wifi yeah i think it's just your wifi is making it look like that um yeah yeah cool this is doobie had a followup who you know the senior blockchain no not the senior blockchain engineer but just senior developer it seems like who wanted uh blockchain uh info and he's like i'm doing a ton of udemy courses are there accredited certifications which have value in the industry helpful in getting a job like a blockchain council or something no no um it could be if you are uh applying to two jobs in the web too like let's say you want to web blockchain ibm or something they may care about these things if you if you work in west groves and you build this it's uh yeah you you're not gonna need it uh this certifications they're mainly for uh corporations uh they're mainly that you can say that you you have it and corporations can say you know we've educated because imagine i'm a middle manager in a preparation i want to show that i've pushed my my team into web three so maybe i'll buy them some certificate just to just to say okay guys now we're certified uh and uh so that's mainly what i'm seeing that it's it's a lot for uh corporate use case that they want to upskill their workforce and get them into into blockchain but practically it's it's not really needed if you work in this industry and it probably as this industry matures they're going to be more and more needed but right now i i rarely see that it's some kind of decisive factor whether you have some certification or not instead is your portfolio are you active in communities do you know the protocols do you know how this industry works that's way more important yeah i i agree with you on that i think it's like on the blockchain you just build things that you can show them literally on the blockchain be like here's what i've built and as long as you can go in with what you've built i think that's going to speak way more volume than uh a piece of paper would at least in this industry and i love that answer like web 2 companies would probably care but other companies wouldn't care that much yeah nice i like that you caught that my camera my my camera is potatoing it's all good it's all good this is a good question i think because you know going off of okay we want to make a hundred thousand dollars a year as a blockchain developer what are the steps what are the processes so this question goes along with that theme really well ubang asks so what is the right way of learning web3 and smart contracts in that case hey look at that dude yeah there you go and and another option another angle well the right way to learn about three smart contracts is is by doing is by doing so maybe you can watch a few tutorials just just uh search web three tutorials soliz tutorial you can go to morales academy we have a bunch of courses and tutorials there as well and there we can also we give you a counselor basically someone that will help you and guide you if you want more personal approach like that go to morales academy but as soon as you got the basics you know you kind of know how to do a smart contract you kind of know the basics like the bare basics then you need to build things so here's where you can watch clever programmer the builds or morales projects if you go to mariah's ios projects because that will give you the practical context that you need because without the practical context you're just gonna get stuck in the tutorial hell you're gonna watch videos and you know read some articles uh read you're gonna read twitter threads you're never gonna actually have the practical context so all in all uh learn uh some simple solidity you can find a lot on youtube or morales academy then um you can learn some simple uh web3 and react you can use web3ui kit and also again as soon as you feel that you kind of you can kind of do something with it build full projects build full projects so that's what what i would do i love that and what is a full project well for example what you guys are doing on the channel like web3 twitter amazon i mean that's that's that's a good example or like we're doing on our channel at morales channel uh we'll do similar things and we also do game game engine integrations like for example if you want to do a unity game and you want to connect it with the blockchain we have a perfect course on that coming out on saturday to saturday for example so basically use cases finished use cases where you go from zero to done a use case can be that you build a dashboard for your wallet like i said maybe it's the simplest one then another use case can be that you launch a token and now you can have a dashboard for your wallet and your token where you can issue new coins you can transfer them you can you can do different things with your coin maybe stake them maybe burn them uh just very simple stuff that i'm thinking on the fly maybe next thing you have is that if you deposit one eth you get a token so you basically can build a as a token cell yes it's just just to this experiment you can have a smart contract a program on the blockchain which receives one if and for each if it receives it sends you 10 tokens very simple thing next thing you can integrate with chain chain link maybe chain link is is next big frontier because when you integrate with chain link now you can have look if there is there is a frost if it's a minus degrees outside uh we paid the money if it's plus or yeah in fahrenheit or something else but look if it's cold outside we don't pay you if it's warm outside we pay you you can have real real world data into the blockchain this is of course important for insurance let's say that you have crops they're gonna die if it's too cold it would be nice if it was an automated smart contract that paid you instantly when it's too cold for example so you can start in you can start buying real apis from web 2 into the conditions that decide what happens to your to the funds in your smart contracts so yeah i mean some very simple stuff and then you will figure out and look you guys ask so many questions you know or should i do this or just just do something you know you're gonna be analyzing you you gotta be asking and analyzing just do it you know stop asking me questions you just start building and start thinking stop thinking because it's the same with in normal programming people ask me hey ivan should i do python or java or javascript i heard python is good for machine learning java is good for this corporate stuff javascript is good for web i'm you know i don't know what to choose there's also haskell and rust and a month later they still haven't decided they're still analyzing you know is it good salary and job man just just do it's not just star [Laughter] i love that yeah uh guys yeah seriously jump in i i love that i think you'll find out a lot of these answers by just jumping in um so that's good dude i had i had a random thought while you were talking i was like what if you like could you build something like where um i was just thinking of doing this literally with my friends where they could bet on youtube creators like how many views their next video is going to get and if that video gets that many views in the next three days to automatically get the money ah that's nice that's nice exactly exactly that's the perfect one for for uh uh for chain link that you can connect youtube api to your smart contract and let me tell you another thing you can have a lossless bet what do you mean by that let's say that you and i we bet on some outcome so you put in a thousand bucks i put in a thousand bucks and then we can put it into something like compound protocol we send it into a smart contract it starts earning interest so this money we put in you know in a week it may be not a 2 000 bucks that we put in collectively maybe it's now 200. or i don't know the exact interest rates now but you can basically create a lossless lottery or a lossless bet where we only compete for the interest that we both generated so let's say you put in money i put in money we generate interest whoever wins gets the interest that we collectively generated the rest gets refunded to uh to to both i mean that's that would be impossible without web3 you cannot do something like this where you can earn interest like per second you know you earn interest per second in a bank you earn it you it's not like it's not real time so that is a sick idea that is so let me tell you another one another thing that is not possible uh without web3 that really bends your mind it's a flash loans where you can take millions of dollars you can right now if you know simple programming you can get 10 million dollars in your wallet with one condition you have to repay it in the same transaction so you get 10 million bucks if you don't repay it the whole transaction is just aborted it's reversed so you lose the funds but what does it mean it means that you can now funnel this money through smart contracts as long as you return it back in the same transaction it's all legit this means that let's say that i see an arbitrage opportunity i see that this coin is trading for one dollar on this exchange but it's trading for 0.9 dollars on that exchange so i can take 10 million bucks i can buy it for 0.9 i sell for one dollar i return the loan it's it's all in the same transaction it's all in the same transaction and i keep the profit so this flash loan concept you should really look into if you if you're interested in the new financial primitives we call financial primitives basically this is this basic financial operations that you can do in web 3 using smart contracts that you cannot do anywhere else uh and flashlights is a good example whatever arbitrage you see you can act on it with endless capital basically through this concept of flashlights damn that is so cool so flash loans makes sure that that transaction you're about to do it verifiably gives all the money back and if it doesn't it doesn't even fire off exactly just gets you so i mean okay so you can't um in simple words like i can't it up right like there's no way i can like just lose 10 million dollars like guarantee that if i borrow it it's gonna get back the the only thing you will lose is the transaction fee so all if he's a transaction transactions on ethereum need to pay fees but that's like any other transaction so the only thing you risk is the transaction fee because that you're going to pay either or even if transaction gets reverted and basically this loan fails so how do you how do you go through different exchanges and you know what i'm talking about give me one second i think she wants to go outside my bulldog yeah yeah sure sure yeah guys so for all you watching we're gonna get back soon there you go dog evacuated yeah so uh the way it works kind of like a promises in javascript you can do different things you can do you know do this request then take the response do that request and you can chain promises after each other and just funnel them you know one two one to the next and next and next and next the same is with the solid so you can say hey take the funds from here put it in this program okay take the output put it in that program take the output put it in that and you know if at the end of the day you have a profit because let's say you used an arbitrage you you bought some coin in here for 0.9 then you saw another place another program you could sell for one dollar you have a profit you return the loan perfect and by the way this is uh it's also a bigger topic because uh let's say that you you are smart and you see such an opportunity in the real world where you say hey wait there there are some assets trading cheap here and expensive there maybe on some stock exchanges or something else you cannot act on this opportunity without capital you cannot act on arbitrage without capital but now in web 3 everyone has endless capital to act on this arbitrage opportunities which in turn create efficient markets but that's a more economical topic but it's very interesting that's an amazing one have you messed around with it personally yeah yeah you can go to other let me see if they still have it in the docs docs our flashlight so you did a loan and you made like some profit i mean even if you lost money or something like that but you made yeah some money on it no no i i haven't done any money on it and by the way it's not it's not easy to do money on it because it would be easy everyone would do it so it's not easy to do it you really have to spend a lot of money finding this and because anyone can do it it also means that everyone does it all the time i mean that's why because the opportunity is open for all it's uh it means that it's very difficult to find a way in but you should research a recent example where somebody used it in a very smart way basically if you held if you held a board ape you know that you got eight ape coins and so some guy he did not have money for to buy an ape because an ape cost like 200k he got a flash loan he got he bought the nfts in one transaction so he gets flashlights like millions of dollars he buys the nfts he gets the airdrop token which is like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars he sells the nfts he returns the loan and he keeps the airdrop you can google it uh ape let me see if i can find it that's gene flash flashlight so exactly so just google it let's bring it up house just google apecoin flashlight so that's an example where look if you have brains you have now a tool with endless capital with endless capital to to act on those opportunities is it gonna be easy no this is not free money you have to be smart but you know that if you find a way where you need a lot of cash to buy something maybe to claim some airdrop like this guy he he didn't have money to buy eight it's a hundred of thousands of dollars to buy that eight ft but yeah you take penis of those flashlights you buy the ape you get the airdrop you sell the ape you return the loan you keep the airdrop jeez it included five this falls generated on the okay wow he bought a bunch of apes huh he bought a bunch of apes claimed the airdrop sold the apes returned they then sold these tokens on the decentral exchange for 398 after this sold so with flash loans does all of this need to happen in a matter of like one second or can this happen over like so this needs to happen in one transaction yes but like that one transaction like but what i'm not understanding is how could you possibly do this so it's like is that one transaction happening over a period of seconds in real life or is that happening over like no no no you could take a week to make that transaction happen no no it needs to be in one transaction meaning that it's it basically needs to all happen uh in in the sequence basically when so how does the blockchain work you have blocks of transactions so on ethereum each 10 or 15 seconds a bunch of transactions get executed on the blockchain and so your transaction needs to be structured in a way where the version when the ethereum virtual machine executes it this all needs to uh this ultimate all needs to check out in uh when it does it at the same time so it's not like over weeks it needs to do it at the same time got it and uh each each uh each transaction has a certain gas limit so basically it means that each transaction you can say how much you're willing to pay for it and that will depend on how how many computational steps it has to do so there is a limit how much you can do you cannot you know you cannot have an infinite loop in a transaction that because you will run out of gas but yeah you could you could tell it hey you know go into this smart contract send money there take money from there and send it there and if it doesn't check out at the end let's say that you cannot return the flashlight the whole transaction is just invalidated it gets thrown out can i if it does check out yeah i was just gonna say can i do flash can you do flashlights on the devnet uh let's see because that's like so scary right like if the only place you could execute this is on the main net so by the way uh google how do flash loans let me send you a video because we've actually done it i think on a test net on avalanche which is like ethereum so if you go to uh youtube and you search d5 flash loans 2022 i think you'll find our video because we did it with one of our instructors danielle so google d5 flash loans 2022 uhhuh there you go there we go flash loan course that one that one click on that one flashlight so this is on our channel is that danielle he's fantastic he's done this basically he where you execute and it's one hour long course on flashlights where you you have this app where you can try it and then he explains to you he uses ave and he does it on the avalanche test net where i think they have this capabilities yeah oh this is your house dude does he have a the code for me oh wow look at how nice he is what a nice guy got it you know i always when i was new i always thought this dot sol meant it was like dot soul but then i learned it's solidity i thought i was like wait i'm like everybody's developing solana huh interesting exactly oh okay wow but yeah here you can you can see her how it is damn so with so with smart contracts you and i we can publish programs on the blockchain and that program can be that hey you know take the flash loan do this do that it's like javascript now with promises you but with javascript promises is mainly requests you know you say go to this api then take the data go to that one and you chain them in a smart contract you can do the same thing but with funds you can say you know put in that one take take out you know mom and then you can do a transaction that calls that calls that smart contract and then it's going to execute it yeah no somebody says so the blockchain technology is all about trading no it's not all about trading it's just one aspect of it that he was showing we were talking specifically about flash loans so flash loans there's a lot of like trading arbitrage that you could pull off with flash loans so that is where we were talking about trades but a blockchain technology you could use it for a lot of things like for example you know where people are sending money to ukraine to fight off the russian war and that's the easy way for ukraine to collect money because i don't know how else i would send it but like with crypto it's super easy for me to send it and they can get it right away and so they've raised hundreds of millions of dollars because people are able to like i donated and usually i never donate anywhere just because it's like inconvenient but like here i was just going and it was so easy and simple and my wallet like i went to the website and my wallet just got connected and like i pressed one button i'm like yo this was super nice and and when you tried that i mean you that's where you see the light when you see your wallet being connected to all the different websites and you can start you're logged in instantly everywhere you can start interacting with all apps with your identity which is your wallet that's so amazing and this it's really when you see that you see that's how finance should have been on the internet that's minus on the internet that's that's how it will be i think i think the only things that that scare me that i don't understand how they would work is like some of it is so when i think of blockchain you know some of it makes me laugh because i'm like it's not crud anymore it's just cra cr because you can create and read but you can't update or delete so some of the things that confuse me are like okay if on instagram i make a post and then i'm like hey that was stupid let me go and delete that yeah yeah yeah you know and well that's why you don't use blockchain for that i mean blockchain is it's not uh it's not for everything that is something that you probably should not put on the blockchain but blockchain is for value that's i mean that's why in a way it's it's it's kind of connected to the financial space a lot because it's value it's value online you have value you have assets you have nfcs you have tokens you can trade them you can stake them and then you can connect them to other nonfinancial experiences like games for example like for example instagram you can have that if you uh if you get a lot of likes you you have some kind of membership coin generated or nfc generated or if you let's say that you are a music creator and a lot of people listen on your song on spotify you get a revenue share in real time so all of this value and ownership so blockchain is for value and ownership transactions and value and ownership programming which of course includes a bunch of trading because you can trade that but also includes you know how you store it you can for example say you know this this money we have here if you sign if you sign a transaction you cannot send you alone cannot spend it we need to be together to spend it maybe if we have a company together or maybe if we're five people we can say three of us need to accept the transfer uh three or five for example you accept transfer so that's why i think many people confuse it that you know everything should be on chain and you know and then they see but world of warcraft cannot run on chains so it's like if you guys so say you get two say you get two or three developer buddies and you guys are like hey we want to invest in courses and like learn about blockchain you could make this like dow type of thing with three of you where only all three of you have to agree to decide on buying a course that's like 10 bucks 20 bucks or whatever you know what i mean that's like fun that's like your 100 budget for learning blockchain or 200 budget for learning blockchain and you guys can all decide is that at a like persontoperson level you could use it that way or if you're founders of companies you guys could use it as like two founders deciding on a decision and um it's beautiful because it's trust less and so it it doesn't require trust like it's just guaranteed it needs to happen like that um i think some people were asking flash loan specific questions so tambo is like what is the maximum time for holding that flash loan it's not about time so there's no don't think about time because you you have a transaction i guess i guess like one thing i guess one thing that's like blowing blowing my mind my i'm having trouble wrapping my mind around is like how do you purchase like eight apes and then like go to unit swap and then sell them and then keep the airdrops like when that's happening in one transaction i'm thinking it's once one well it's very easy it's very i mean just think about a normal program so the computer executes a program the computer knows the state of the different data structures so for example the computer knows that okay these people have apes they and these people want to sell apes these people have apecoin and they give a coin if you have ape okay so then this guy comes and it's just you know a program that says okay uh send take money from the flash loan then buy buy ape with it it's it's just like imagine all of this was just data structures in your yeah and yeah and you can just change them and you know once you finish it you end up with a final state which is okay uh you have you have you got the edge from this guy because he gave you it because you have you had the ape which you got from the flashlight and the flashlight you got from these guys that give you a flashlight if you return it at the end of this execution which you now by the way can do because you have a profit and you can now return to these guys so this whole thing checks out it's accepted it's stamped put on the blockchain and the final state is that okay that their eight coins are now in your wallet the guy with a flashlight got his flashlight back because you return his funds and um the a the ape whoever sold you their ape they're happy because now they got the funds from the you know from your sales so it all checks out everyone's happy perfect so don't think about time because i i i don't know if that even makes sense to think about time because only here we have a block maybe with a thousand transactions i don't know how many it is in the block maybe a thousand and they all just get executed at the same time and uh so think about it with more as um as uh executions and uh they all happen at the same time then you wait 10 seconds the new block comes all of them are executed at the same time so there's no like don't think of it as time or something yet got it okay okay that makes sense i understand okay beautiful um wow so i think yeah people are enjoying this oh goron is here is this the same goron that i know i don't know maybe it's a different goron but we love you too goron so that's what's important um beautiful so i think we covered a lot man i mean people are still asking a ton of questions and somebody even asked like it seems like morales has all the tools like what what so what is the full stack on blockchain because they're like pretty much every tool they want to look up morales has so you know i guess what in that case if you have tools like morales what is the full stack on the blockchain well morales is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you but for example you still need to uh you still need to do the solidity code yourself and program the smart contracts on your own so that's that's still needed so smart contracts are needed even with morales and i think if you google so you need to google d5 sorry web 3 tech stack let's see if if you go to youtube
