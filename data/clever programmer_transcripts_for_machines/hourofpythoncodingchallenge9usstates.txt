hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer common in this video we're going to tackle the US states challenge so now we have completed all of the challenges in the string challenges section so lower case all the way through abbreviate or challenge or you should have completed it if you didn't that's okay just follow along from here okay and then later you can go back and do the other ones and then after this we have just three more two more challenges left after this one okay so we're almost at the finish line now in this challenge it's going to have to do with United States States okay hence US states challenge and basically how it works is just like a dictionary it's like a lookup okay so you give me a state like NC and I give you back North Carolina if you give me a CA I give you back California what happens if I give you il you give me back ill annoy if you're not in United States and you won't notice at the top of your head but you know US has 50 states and each state has like an acronym two letters long and that turns into like bigger like NY is going to be New York so you could you basically what you would have to do is create a giant dictionary right with key value pairs that's what you would have to do so for example you would create something called States like a dictionary like this and you would say and Y New York okay and then how you would use that is you would say States and you would index it by NY and what this would return is New York okay kind of like that now if we had this dictionary be bigger and have more elements in it it would look like you know it would have another key called ca and then the value of this key would be California okay just like that so now if I take this I put it in my command line right so I open up let's send my command line I go into Python I paste that dictionary it's not getting pasted okay there it is I pasted that dictionary I do States now if I do States and Y what you'll notice is it gives me back New York exactly what we wanted and I'll do States and then I'll do CA this time it gives us back California cool okay so now that we have both of our states we would just have to repeat this process for all of the 50 states but as you know that that could take up a lot of typing or a lot of copy pasting even if you go to something like Wikipedia so what did it for us which is very nice of them I'm going to comment this out is they create another file it's called us dot py okay and this file has basically a long dictionary called States and it has the key value pairs for all the states so for example a K is Alaska al is Alabama AR is Arkansas and then if you keep going down the same way right and then we see NY is New York and if I search for il which is right here il Illinois boom done okay so what we're going to do is we're going to leverage the dictionary that they gave us so here we say from US imports states so what that basically means is now we have access to the variable states and when we do states we get back this this variable States that's it okay but the reason why we put it in another file is so it's easier for us to see our code in this file there as it'll get too messy like for example I can copy it and just paste it in here but you can see like it just takes up a lot of space so it's not really necessary and plus we're learning how to import files which is an amazing thing to learn and it's it makes your magician encoding because you can use other people's libraries and other people's existing code to make it work with your own and you don't you can basically build on the shoulders of giants okay so let's go down here and figure out what the answer is so at this point try pausing the video and see if you can come up with a solution whatever solution you come up with put it in the comments below and if you're on YouTube click the link below so you can go onto my website code it up in there and then post your solution in the comment section below and then I'll take a look at it and right now I'm just going to go through and show you the answer I'm going to work through it live so I'll figure it out with you so if you didn't try it try it right now okay let's go through the answer now okay so how would I do it um I think it would be very simple I will say okay so if you give me a breviary I just have to pass it as an index so like for example States abbreviation right so if you give me NC and you pass NC to that giant dictionary it'll go and it will find NC let's see NCS right here North Carolina and then it'll just print out this value that's how dictionaries work if you index it by the key you get back the value all right so that's what I'm going to do I'm just going to do states here oops and I think that should work I think that's that should be the solution now let's try running and let's see what happens I get back North Carolina in California here it says that if I do NC I should get back North Carolina and we do NC and we do indeed get back North Carolina so as far as we are concerned we have solved this challenge okay beautiful job that's it for this video guys if there are any questions put them in the comments below I'll jump in there and somebody or somebody else will to help you out but hopefully you're following these challenges so far my new course called create apps with Python comes out this June 26th okay so with these new skills that you got from doing these challenges you're now ready to be able to create apps realworld apps that you can put into the hands of other people so then they can use it as well and you can land your first client with Python because my goal is to start getting you paychecks with Python ok so that's it for this video guys as always I love your guys faces off see the link for the new course sign up for the waiting list of that course you're the first one to join that's it and I'll see you in the next video
