I don't know about you but like okay let me ask you a question would you rather make $5,000 working 160 hours or would you rather make four thousand dollars working 20 hours this time right so the overall money isn't the goal but increasing our hourly rate in a really intelligent way that's the goal right that's the whole point of why people start businesses because it allows them to leverage their time that is a win right right that's a huge win because now you can scale it because now you can get another client and let's another client that's another 2400 another client that might be another thousand or 1500 but you're giving up the shortterm but you're getting a huge win in the long term because in the long term over the course of a year of you actually doing this and actually making sure your clients are getting good results managing them getting testimonials and completing the whole project what it could look like is you're profiting $4,000 a month okay profit $4,000 a month or $2,000 a month whatever it may be but what I want to think about what's important is that it's taking up almost none of your time right normally you would spend 40 80 you would spend about 160 hours making this much income and you go from 160 hours to let's say five hours of work per week attempting you go for 160 hours to 20 hours you understand so let's do the math on this 4000 divided by 160 hours that's $25 an hour now let's go four thousand dollars divided by 20 hours do you see that your hourly rate is actually really really high right your hourly rate is two hundred dollars an hour so so right so so basically this is what it means to leverage your expertise and your time for something I mean so always be thinking in terms of your hourly rate of what you're doing when I send out an email to a lot of people on our email list and then I make a youtube video or whatever there's a lot of leverage there that I have because there's a lot of people at the end so the the one hour of my time in that case is actually worth a lot more you see so this is the leverage that you want to be able to get and honestly this is what I did I would hit up equivalent of me high I hit up another developer I hit up a few developers and I would just say you need to have a job posting otherwise you can't hit them up but if you have a job posting you just hit them up and you say hey um this is the project I'm working on let's just set up a 5minute call and so in each person I would get on a 5minute call with after about three or four interviews and hire two developers and those two developers were working on lots of my freelancing projects go allin on business and business it's like business I love more than anything I love people more than anything so coding I as as much as I love software development as much as I actually love coding because I do really enjoy it I get lost in it but I'm doing it I actually enjoyed this interaction you and I are having right now Tony and I enjoyed the interactions like I'm having when every person in this group way more then I enjoy actually sitting on my computer in coding so at the end of the day think about how crazy that is my business is doing well not because of coding is actually doing well because of humans and people right all of the businesses that anybody goes on to build have to deal with people in humans at the end of the day and we forget that at some level so as long as you're like connected with people and humans you can start business and almost anything and be pretty successful the whole point of me sharing hey start documenting your coding journey like I don't care if you start documenting your learning how to cooking journey you know or like starting to play golf journey or whatever journey you want to document traveling to places it's hard to beat up somebody in Hong Kong journey like whatever it is but the most important thing is building a habit of sharing these things putting it out there like putting value in the world and then over time you see the difference that happens and you get people behind you and then you can actually turn the data into anything I think that real estate is really old right and stock market is really old and people understand those concepts really well that's why everybody's trying to put their money in 401 K to try to put their money into like some kind of buying a house right I know a lot of these things because these things are understood for like thousands of years but I think people are not understanding is that there's incredible like those are physical assets right those are physical assets but I think the world is heading towards lots of digital assets okay yeah how sometimes you're asked to fill it nice so we're heading towards where there's insane amount of power in digital assets each digital asset could serve you for the rest of your life like for example take something like Abdullah made a video today on something about turtles right on coding and it's on YouTube and you maybe made it a few days ago whatever the point is that that will serve as asset and it'll provide value to people because the point of a house is that it provides value to a person or value to people his coding video over time will provide value to people and imagine how much value would provide ten days from now fifty days from now thousand days from now four years from now ten years from now 30 years from now I have a I have a feeling that I'll provide a lot of that stuff will provide way more value than almost any real estate that you could purchase would provide built up and provide more value to the world than any amount of real estate because people will if you have real estate you'll have like two people physically living in there that's great you're helping two people this he could help thousand ten thousand fifty thousand or a million people over the course of one to twenty years so logically just makes sense as is providing more value to the market he's gonna get some of that value back right the thing that started clicking in my mind when I started doing YouTube was like one day of my time and then it would say ten days of people's watch time and I'm like holy crap it almost felt like I was time travel like one day of my time could move the world forward by ten days time and then eventually it was like one day of my time could move the world forward by 50 days of time so then it's just um if I'm providing people ten years of value with one year of my effort it only makes sense that my income will go to what my income will be in ten years in one year you see what I'm saying so that's kind of my thoughts unlike that lots of the digital assets and that's why I even say I have lots of different I have different opinions on this but I think for me I would be I personally would go a lot into digital assets creating things and documenting what I'm learning wherever I am in my life because I know those will serve and provide value forever and they're super lean it it doesn't need any investment like I don't have to put down or if you made a video Tony you don't have to put down two hundred thousand dollars to buy a videos right you can actually just put out a video today for free not putting any money down so it's kind of some of my thoughts on that when you up if you're up twice as much as the other person is up once as much in a year you will you will learn the things in six months of your time that will take other person one year add that over a long period of time one years now you're saving a year right so I think it starts to add up and it has helped me a lot when it comes to so rather type and then actually also using fin I don't know if you guys know them but if you want to be a ninja encoding go down the rabbit hole event that has certain point ly go down that rabbit hole at your own risk
