hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer Tom in this video I want to bust a myth nobody's a selfmade man and I'm going to tell you exactly why that's the case so without any further ado let's jump right into it yeah so basically this video I'm going to be covering okay why nobody is really selfmade yeah so what the heck do I mean by that well everybody that pretty much gets anywhere gets there with the help of people and anybody that tells you otherwise is kind of feeding you some there and you need to kind of call them out on it you know nobody kind of just puts on war paint and it just gets going everybody needs help now for example with me starting chess when I started in the career of chess I had a team that's why I'm big on even in one of my videos I talked about unfair advantages you know be ethical like Grant Cardone says but be unfair meaning wake up early exercise you know you get these unfair advantages so whether in whatever career you're in you can get that extra boost and another one of these unfair advantages is understanding that really nobody is a selfmade man so even when I say I'm selftaught computer programmer that's a load of BS because when I was starting out I learned from places like Udacity and EDX and Coursera and whatever other platforms are out there right online tutorials Stack Overflow YouTube all this stuff so I'm now really selfmade it was with the help of all these other people when I started my career in chess right I became top 1% in the world in chess and I still am and this was not because I was just such a genius I barely knew how to play chess you know even when I was 14 and then around the age of 14 or 15 in my high school I just joined the chess team and then there were amazing players there that helped me along the way that pretty much became my mentors but one of the key things out there I had to do was understand that you don't just become it by yourself you have to be okay with asking for help so I had to allow these people to be my mentors right you have to allow people to mentor you because then your success is effectively their success because you're giving them the right to help you be successful and when you let other people be a part of your life they're kind of connected they're with you so when you become successful like yes you are successful but on the flip side if you are just being a completely evil person who's driven very selfishly to improve him or herself and not believe in other people and not let other people coach you then effectively what you're almost doing is you're almost against them right there's almost this rivalry like no you're not better I'm better than you even if there are years beyond your skill level then they don't they don't want you no they don't care if you succeed or not and that's going to slow your progress down that's going to limit that unfair advantage that you get in life so be open to letting people kind of mentor you and put you in the right direction you know like I'll give you I'll give you an example I read this book Rich Dad Poor Dad it's a phenomenal book if you haven't read it go freak and read this book it will change your life but it really opened up lots of things for me you know what's important is finding out what you don't know and a lot of the times when you're just specializing in something you'll almost always miss the things that you don't know so by going through this book and really open my mind and a few things clicked for me and I remember one of the times you know I was doing a job I was doing software consulting and I was making really good money but you know when my parents or my mom had to go to a hospital and the bill for one night is $30,000 how does somebody who is doing a job able to pay for something like that right and this was something that was happening pretty frequently and this was something that was happening where for my mom we couldn't even get her surgery because we didn't have enough money so that's not something that somebody who's doing a job can actually afford and do right I have to live my life and I have to make enough money so then later I could have a house and a safe future how do I take care of other people you know if there's barely enough for me so because I had read this book Rich Dad Poor Dad he said you know be open to asking for help you know because he asks his rich dad and poor dad in that book for help so literally one time one of these people I knew he is really rich and I literally asked him I'm like how do I get out of this cycle it was like 200 a.m. at night and I just woke up and I was like what the hell am i doing like I'm going to go on to live this mediocre life where I'm barely going to make enough for myself let alone four other people there are people in the world that are starving that I can't help there are people who you know would like to get an education but can't I wish I could help them there are people in my family that need help like physical help because they need to actually be hospitalised and I can't help them and I can barely make enough to help myself so I don't want to live a selfish life I think it's very selfish to just be like I just want to make enough for myself you know I think that's a very selfish way of living because you should have enough not just for yourself but support other people around you so again back to the story it was around 200 a.m. and I texted this person and I said you know I'm kind of sick of that and I don't want to be in that cycle what is it that I can do to break out of this cycle to make enough for my family to make enough for me to make enough for other people in my life or people even outside of my life that I could help and it's like 200 a.m. I remember texting this to him and just making myself so vulnerable and open out there and then you know and I was like oh you know why did I leave him this crazy message because he was a friend and it was just weird to leave yourself so vulnerable and open to somebody didn't feel natural you know because I'm not that type of person I always want to save my pride and ego and I'd rather not ask for help I'd rather just do it on my own so the weird experience doing that and I remember half an hour goes by and one hour goes by and I'm just getting the feeling in my in my gut like ah this is this doesn't feel good to put myself out there like that and then you know hourandahalf passes and I actually get a message back from him and it was literally one word and he says business and that was one of the lifedefining one about life defining moments I've had in my life and it was that kind of like you rake a moment that mental switch and I was like wow okay so business will be one of those things that kind of helps you break out of it then I had to reverse engineer how I go about doing that and you know for that there was different kind of help so like for example for computer programming right I found programming Mentors and basically what I was doing without swapping my chess skill I don't think of money as just a static thing right you hoard it up and you save it up and then like you later 60 years from now you live a good life but you miss out on all your years I don't think I'm money like that I think of it as like a dynamic thing so meaning I didn't even think of money as money all I thought of it was like I'm gonna trade my chess skill for programming skill so if I made $70 one hour or hundred dollars and one hour $150 in one hour working and helping a client in chess oh then use that money for one or two or three hours of a programmers time to then get the programming skill and then once I realize business was something that was very important I then had to get a mentor in business as well so you know having a programming mentor having a business mentor those were the things that allowed my programming career to become successful and then my business that clever programmer to become successful so what I want you to take away from this video is you don't have to start paying people if you don't have the money right now but what I want you to start doing is then go out in communities where they're likeminded people right there's meetup comm but if you're in another country and maybe meetup commas anything like go out to where these people meet up maybe they meet up in some city nearby you you know there's a event going on or a convention or if there's nothing going on you know try to travel to a different city or if you can afford it a different country but try to meet with these likeminded people and if none of those options are feasible for you try to find these people online right these communities exist you can find a friend online that you can chat with and then if you guys connect then you can actually start doing Skype sessions or FaceTime sessions and those don't really cost you that much go girl hang out and then you guys can connect with each other so find somebody who is ahead of you but understand that you have to make yourself open to receiving help ego will hurt you your pride will be the death of you let those things go when you see people who are successful it's easy to get there you just have to model what they did ask for help because when you ask for help then your success is tied with their success and they want to see you become successful hopefully this video makes sense if you have any questions or something wasn't clear please put it down in the comments below I'll answer them for you guys other than that this is it for this video thank you guys so much for watching as always I love you so much I'll see you in the next video
