much as we are because we have a lot of things going on for you today um you can see this is the gmail combo building and you can see that the gmail clone looks a little bit like this right this is what we're finishing up today this is where we left off the last time okay what did we finish off the last time well we built the header right here okay boom right there look how good that looks it looks so good and yes it's like yeah it's right there you know it's beautiful right and then today i'm finishing up what well we've got the sidebar which also looks so good and you can have this you know hover effect and so forth and that's amazing you have the compose button look at that look at that nice shadow oh yeah that's good that's beautiful right and i'm gonna finish up this bottom portion right here aki aki as we say here in spanish okay or as i say ukrainian football no don't say that how's it going everybody hope you guys are amazing this is nas and of course and i'm here with david for those of you who are coming in who are new uh rublin the gmail clone again today we'll finish up this portion if you do not have the gmail part one link is down there okay link is down in the description below to get the github link to part one and you should be able to see this which is right here so go ahead and this is the gmail part one that's already fully installed no problem go ahead if you don't know how to use github do download as a zip right here but if you do know how to use github then just do git clone you can clone this repository if you're using something like this okay so that's pretty easy and then once you have an envious code guys as you already know the process okay once you have the vs code all you got to do is do npm install and then npm start and for you already have our did npm start as you can see here my my code is all running all good um and i think we should get started shall we get started bro yeah yeah we could let's do it let's do it cool guys how are you guys doing by the way i hope you're doing amazing i see a lot of you guys are commenting i see a lot of amazing comments and i see a lot of amazing tommy's in here as well the energy in the comment section is pumped out let's go hello hello hello hello chad and clever programmer beautiful beautiful beautiful as always i'm happy to see you guys okay cool david i think it's time i think it is time let's do it so this time let's go ahead and let's do this portion here again for those of you who have not cut up we have the gmat clone part one down description below click on the github link download it right go ahead and download it right put up live npm start mp install boom and then you got it okay all good what what david is stuck which is great that's awesome that's fine yeah what's up yeah yeah you were stuck for here for a second okay go ahead now all right so david what are we building next tell me um dang what david all right am i back yeah you're back you're back you're back back you're back you're back what are you doing next time finally that's good will you build next oh my gosh okay so with that said we have finished things up on the sidebar button item part correct so that's the top thing over there correct um and next thing we need to do is i think it's going to be the google meet thing correct which is which one which is going to be this portion right here right there yes awesome so let's do that right now exactly that part all right so if you can go back to sidebar.js file or just follow me with the live share that would be amazing i'm gonna follow you on the live shirt actually that'll be let's go i'll follow david right here beautiful hi nice so yeah by the way guys this is an amazing tool to just collaborate and pair program it's live share make sure to go ahead and get it yeah extension server envious code not spencer yet with this code exactly anybody watching from microsoft just click link [Laughter] all right so we actually have three different parts uh in in the meat wrapper something uh we obviously have a title which uh will say which will say meet or there yes it's saying meet and then we have two p tags where i wrap uh the icon that you see on the left hand side and the text on the right hand side into a p tag so everything is going to be inside of the p tag beautiful yeah and we actually for that we will need to uh import a few different stuff so we have the video camera icon the keyboard icon and for now that is going to be it but for those of you uh okay i just dropped it on line eight and nine so for those of you who are just starting out and you might still be npm installing this is from material ui icons exactly right here so we have guys one icon we're using this video cam and again the way you guys get material like it's pretty simple so we'll take a look at material ui just by simply typing in materialize in google just like this right here so material ui just type that in pop it in right here boom right there material ui but not material like this one you want to do material ui icons okay typed it in boom right here with two ui icons and all you have to do is simply just search for one so let's say for example you want to search for a video so type in video boom right there sayonara it's all beautiful and now you got yourself a video icon looks just like this you click on the video icon which one are we using by the way are we using oh this one okay we are we're using the video this cam icon click on this copy this and that's exactly what david did here guys is he just pasted this portion here in right here he did the exact same thing with the keyboard icon found down here boom boom sayonara and you got it that's it that's it okay simple as that nice super simple and that's it pretty much guys all right awesome let's get going all right now we already imported it so it's time to actually use those icons so the first one is going to use the video cam icon um yes okay and for that we will be typing in a text new meeting okay and it should be showing up really soon but it's going to freak out because we don't define now guys what do you remember oh my god the world is ending but of course the reason oh the reason why we turn on the fight because we need to define it instead of styled components let's go and define it you can see i just did exactly that right there if you if we go down here uh whoops we have this uh thingy so we are using style components again and that's basically wrapping the what's it called css into the javascript file so we don't have to mess with all the because most importantly what's going on what's cool now is that component is basically guys it's almost like you're creating a div in html but you know that div has its own kind of like style right so it's wrapping style fully fully fully around uh around what's it called around um you know uh around this title component and you can see here he created an h4 type component now like a div because you can do style.div as we did here but we can also do style style.h4 which is simply just h4 tag and html and so that's kind of power of style components all right go ahead and continue on david davido let's continue on so we have one more icon um to put in the meat wrapper or actually that part and that's going to be the keyboard icon okay nice good so now the one we're working on is this one now the keyboard icon right here go ahead keep going exactly and for that uh the text is join meeting so basically what you can do with google meet is start a new meeting or join an existing meeting beautiful that's exactly what i want to do go ahead good beautiful awesome awesome and now if you go back to the build okay uh it looks a little bit off yeah it looks very much off right so guys let's think about how do we go ahead and make this knot off for one i think we need to go ahead and push this more to the bottom right so push this meat and new medium joint meaning all the way to the bottom right david uh yes yes exactly so for what we will do is we will actually go into the meat wrapper and we will apply some styling over there exactly because go ahead and for that we will be using using position if i can write it down position okay i think i think you're beautiful and you can see here guys that right here this is the me wrapper right here guys and what we're going to do is we're going to position we're going to make that position relative okay and then what's going to happen then david for uh then what we would do is we will say uh leave a third 300 pixel uh right so basically like padding padding like 300 pixels basically we could we could have done that yeah just like that yeah yeah uhhuh go ahead that's 300 pixels okay go ahead and just just to like because in styling all the details matter uh we will do a little border top and that's going to be one pixel and it's going to be solid beautiful and we will be just using the given light gray color nice nice nice once again if i can write it down cool nice that returned it fully to where it was does not see then like it did not like it david oh because uh i forgot to add a semicolon hey let's go forgot to edit my colon that's a typical you know uh you know that's typical typical developer exactly i mean the first like when you face a bug the first thing you should be looking at is semicolons if those are right then there is something error okay all right and now i'm just going to target the inside uh in the p tags inside of that specific div so if we actually go up here in the file those two are the ones that i'm targeting right now and what i will do is i will just go ahead and say the color as a color is going to be gray and we are going to be using display grid because that's just more advanced right now everybody you like this playground right nice music somebody says nice music i'm just saying i'm putting up the comments right now okay hey now hello david nice everybody's like dance nahs let's go dance [Laughter] hi there not not david and i just joined beautiful guys also good to see you alvin can i build a full extra full local site program without all these github and other repositories standing on the far outside servers but only on my own server local of course so this is a question right here can i build a fully recommended but yeah you build a full local site program without all these programs another project and the other repositories standing on outside servers but only on my own server locally for sure you can do that but that's i wouldn't would not recommend that guys i would not recommend just putting your you know a server locally uh your app locally on your server there's no need to that's gonna be a lot of hassle that's why these servers were built you know all these applications were built for us to pull live for fiber is hosting you know to you know netlify and so forth right so again to make it easier for us because if you just do it for yourself yeah you can do it but you know this could be a lot of a lot of hassle a lot of work but if you want to do it fine you can't roll back in case you messed something up exactly next version so exactly so okay good okay let's go keep going david come on let's keep going so we we got the display grid part which you which you are a huge fan of correct yes very much and now what we will do is we will say grid template uh and columns and we will be you giving 14 of the full width of that uh p tag to the icon and the rest is going to be all for the text exactly so again the way it's gonna happen is what david is doing here guys is he's creating biscuit this grid right so thinking about it like every single p tag which is this tech is a grid correct so it's a grid and then he's saying okay the grid column is 14 is this one right here and then the other one is auto so it's going to take up as much space as i possibly can the rest of the space as hopefully that makes sense that's going to be the auto portion okay so that's basically going to be exactly 86 yes yes yes quick math right didn't use offred definitely nope all by yourself david right all by myself all by myself good job good math all right um next up we will be giving it a little bit of padding so that's going to be 5 pixel and then 25 pixel and what happens is above and below it's going to have five five pixels and then on both of the sides is going to have 25 pixels as padding okay that's fine that's fine so basically it looks good so five pixels is the top and the bottom basically top and bottom 25 pixels is left and right now we can't do that that's correct but we can also center it correct so like we can say for example the way we can do that is pretty simple i i would actually do like this david more so here's how i do it i would do like this i will say height let's give it a height what kind should we give it 30 pixels for example let's give it a height okay so let's give it a height for example let's remove this padding for now okay okay so i know i know it's fine no problem whatsoever so i'm going to give it a high let's say and so this for example if you inspect them on this one you can see that if i go ahead and put this to the right hand side that's fine you can see that this specific portion has let me go ahead and see the sp tag has a height but you can see there's nothing centered in that p tag right so here's what i'll do i'll center it vertically so how do we go and center it vertically david will display grid uh it's going to be align items so we'll say align items align items align items right there center boom right there center yeah so if we do that right there you see how everything's centered now you see how it's beautiful it's nicely in the center between that grid you see and so it creates just a very nice spacing yeah i like that i like it a lot and now we do and then we do instead now is i say padding left i will say padding left for example waiting left i'll give it for example like you know uh 25 pixels for example right because that's what uh no how much did you give padding for this one yeah it was 25 it was 25 was that 25 exactly was it 25 really let me see it was let's see how much was this uh heading uh left yeah yeah you're right 525 pixels that's right it just seems a bit odd that's why it just seems like the meat is like not you know where it should be but i guess maybe that's just my my weird i think we could we could add a little bit of uh bottom margin to the title maybe just to fix that up that's true we can do a little body margin so we could do is let's go to the title do margin bottom right there beautiful margin body how much do that give it let's give it like i would say let's give it like three pixels okay three pixels yeah good cool good so let's go ahead that will push that a little to this a little bit to the bottom let me see did we save that save that yeah let me see did it actually push it though it did it did it very lightly very lightly very lightly and then what i would actually see is i'd actually make you also margin top a little bit here let's do this margin top margin top on this one margin top on this one's going to be also let me put this aside margin type is going to be around 4 one right pixels so you see how spaced out a little bit better now we can even do probably let's try eight boot actually let's try this eight pixels boom a little bit better now i would say so what do you think about that a little bit better now huh what do you think about that yeah yeah i mean it you definitely gave it a little bit of room to breathe i know right it's always good when you got room to breathe david right i mean it's not bad definitely yeah yeah yeah exactly so we got that portion okay and even even the coolest part what i can do for example you see oh there's a meat wrapper and there's a meat meat it just sounds like meat you know i just think it's funny so the meat rapper this whole rapper by the way this whole wrapper right we can actually use it as a whole there's a display almost like a display flex actually fully full on um i would actually full check this out to make this meat meat wrapper all the way at the bottom i just think it's funny to make this video wrapper all at the bottom what i would do is the following actually i would actually make this display let me see just to try something out if now we can always do later okay so we can also have the hangouts wrapper so i would actually put them into your div and then move them yeah yeah yeah exactly so how about this let's do the hangouts wrapper then we can figure out the rest stuff so let's go ahead and continue on so we got the meat wrapper guys here it's pretty clean i would say so i kind of like it i mean i don't i don't i like it a lot right here so it's all good let's go ahead and do the hangouts wrapper which is basically this portion right here let's do that actually i just saw a a thing that we can do to make the app a little bit more optimized instead of using meat wrapper and hangouts wrapper we could use sidebar section wrapper and we could literally give the same exact same styling for the two what do you say because because icons and texts i just saw this but oh you wanna you wanna have like a parent that has the same exact styling kind of like that okay let's do it do it do it do it okay that's it so instead of meat wrapper we will say i just came up with this though that's fine good good good bar section wrapper like this this is how you optimize stuff right yeah boom right there too good okay and instead of meet wrapper scroll down and then just we will rename it and then we can remove that thing which is looking clean so far again and the reason why he's doing that guys is because you can see here that this meat wrapper and this hanging rubber they look very much similar they just have different content and different type but that's pretty much it exactly and what we can do is again just give give the same title and then do a p tag okay good and now we need to import another icon which is going to be the account circle icon um right there on the top cool and we will be using that so in the p tag we can say so the pdf we can say things like for example guys so you can have what we're trying to type here is yeah one is going to be the account circle icon which is this one right here and then he's going to type in divergosi right here go ahead exactly sophie now save this portion right there look at that see guys it's so simple right very very simple and now you can have this all the way underneath that specific section that's awesome yeah beautiful beautiful beautiful awesome that's pretty good dang i just saw this i mean we could even go a little further hold on let's hold on david i know you're excited okay i know you're excited i'm excited too well that's i want us to move on okay let's move on let's move on let's move on ah i just want to get all excited he's like oh my god code yes i can optimize all right so next up what we will do is we will have the bottom icons wrapper okay so which is this one right here at the bottom which is this red paper yep and for that what we will do is we will need another data helper file so i'm just going to go ahead and create a bottom icons data dot js in the data folder so he's doing it right here you see guys he just created a bottom bottom icons uh data.gs and he's doing it because he doesn't want to you know manually write uh you know create these icons he kind of wants to define the object for these icons just like so right here at the bottom and then that will allow him to just loop through them you can loop through them really easily and then you can just simply you know show them using react.js so let's go ahead and do that right now exactly perfect so well we will be pretty much doing the exact same stuff that we did above with inbox star so what we will do now is we will have first a person icon good on the top and we will be importing it from the material ui ui icons i mean yeah you could you could pretty yeah exactly that nice good keep going keep going person god beautiful like that nice and of course we have other icons like the phone icon and the phone the format for my quota icon again all these comp guys from here okay so phone icon like for example here one right there see boom right there so we will have the four format quote and the phone icon as well and we will just go ahead and create a what's it called it's going to be an array and we will be exporting it as a module so what we will say is export const and bottom icons equals ray boom and we would just pretty much just go through these so let's just create them icon boom uh format quote icon so nice so if somebody says this if you use react router dom guys so you don't need to use react router down just yet because there's not many pages we don't have many different pages guys okay right react right or down you would use when for example you want to you have when you have multiple pages when you have one page and a second page like there's really no need to use a react router down in this case so you have to be very careful what do you use and what do you not use it's not just about using the most fanciest components the most fanciest names no it's about making it functional i'm sorry make it functional and make it work that's the most important thing all these fancy names simple as possible yeah all these kinds of names well they will come later when you get to the workplace guys it's very simple what can you do in the simplest manner as possible and that's it that's all they're going to look for okay just so you know all right go ahead keep going all right cool so that's pretty much the bottom icons data file right there and you can see it's pretty simple he just created an array like so and he the cool part is an array you can actually include the icons themselves and then you can loop through the array loop through this array and then just go one by one just be like okay show this one this one and then this one good go ahead exactly and and the reason why i actually like to keep these separately is because then it's so it it's just easier to look at whether if i could just i could literally put it in the sidebar the js file but then it just it would be the whole file would be so big exactly and it's already not that yeah it's really big as this so can i actually can i actually do this one right now can i i'm very sure yeah yeah go ahead okay so let me remove this portion okay so guys check this out guys okay so what we are going to do is we're going to go ahead and import part one it's going to import the bottoms uh wrapper so we'll do import import import and we'll do bottom icons bottom icons yeah but you wanna you wanna give it uh squiggly brace because i didn't export default defaults okay so bottom icons bottom icons like this bottom icons right there from from where we're going to import from where well from the bottom icons data you can see here bottom icons data right and to get there we're currently in a sidebar section right so we need to come out of layout and we need to go to data so that means you do dot dash to come on a layout then that will give me back to for example then uh no actually i need to go back to data let me see and to come out of that too you need to go out of components as well and go into data and then you can see i can do the bottom icons data right here just like this and so now like if i can save this this will actually give me access to this specific to the bottom icons right here these ones okay and then what i will do is in order for us to actually fully loop through them we'll just do a dot map right so what i will do is i will go up and open up my brackets and i will say bottom icons bottom icons right like so icons right dot map okay right there and then the map always has one item so let's do item okay and that leads us to what leads us to the actual icon so here's will do we'll do like this boom and then what's going to happen now at this point is we'll say okay let's do the actual icon so we'll say like this we'll say it boom check this out so this right here is actually really interesting this right here you ever seen this is you ever seen this david oh hell yeah yeah it's like a deal it's like a day but it's an empty day of almost oh it's like almost like such not there right and then we'll do is we'll do icon like so so we'll do the not item also icon so let me let me get this icon right here and this should be an icon as well okay so if i save this now let's go take a look what do we get if i save that okay so we got that portion are you ready bro oh not showing up let's go refresh this oh it's right there you can see except it's very badly laid out you can see right so i mean it's pretty good over there i like it there i like it you like it there okay perfect we're done thank you guys so much for watching we'll have you guys have a great day i'm just kidding i'm just kidding guys um all right so that's kind of there of course but let's go ahead and do the following things well the one thing i want to do is i want to center them because you can see that in our finished clone if they are centered correct david right here they're centered right correct so let's go ahead and center them to center them we'll need to go back to bottom under the icons wrapper there's a really cool extension not a close tension or shortcut you can use if i hit if i hold command or i think i think on windows if i hold ctrl and i click look at that it will take me straight to the style.div boom right there you could just use f12 button or after oh there might be right and now i can actually edit my icons wrapper that they have like so so to make it for example to let's say i want to i want to you know center it you know fully i can do let's just use for example display flex right now i think that's completely fine would you say david we can display facts as it is so let's display flex display because you can use display flex and display grid all together so say display flex okay and then to align something horizontally what we do is we do align items now do justify content justify content right there content center boom right there okay so if i save this now let's go back to here boom you can see now this is all fully centered just like so right here boom see right there standard because of the justified content center very very very simple understood david understood understood okay awesome guys we are coming at 198 198 likes can we get to 200 likes and then we'll do a happening dance it's a party the party up in here 198 let's go and smash that like button guys share this video guys with everybody as you can see right this gets it out to as many people as possible most people just smash the like button because then that tells youtube okay great they're doing some valuable content that's the only way they know that you are liking what you're seeing that's the only way so we much appreciate if you smash the like button oh let's go oh oh oh that's what um okay let's keep going and then when the beat drops we'll do a dance yes you will all right so now the question becomes guys is very simple okay the question becomes is how do we move this this to the bottom david how to move this to the bottom i would use position absolutely i will use something different but i think what you have you're on a good path but i'll actually do something different what would you use okay i would actually use display flex uhhuh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the display flash for the rescue but how is the question guys check this out the way we can do it is pretty pretty simple right what we can do is we can how about this how about we wrap this whole thing with display already thank you so much for getting us to 215 likes let's go let's get to 300 likes come on guys you guys are awesome as always awesome so to get this going here we got this wrapper okay cool let's go ahead what we can do is we can wrap this wrap with display flex so if i go to wrapper wrapper where's my wrapper wrapper is right here and here's what i'll do i'll do display flex on this one and something will potentially mess up which is fine display flex on this one and display flex okay let me see let me see uh let me see oh look at this bro look what just happened yeah direction look at this like direction just column let me go ahead and just show this to you just i'll show you the power of display facts okay you ready for this bro column column right there messing up my code no this is good bro column you see it's back to normal that's what i'm talking about bro see now check this out here's what we can do even smarter this bottoms wrapper what if we the cyber section we'll just you know we just wrap it with this section the the bottom section here's what we'll do i'll say it like this i'll say butter i'll create a new component called bottom section section rapper you'll be are you you might be amazed bro are you going to be amazed i'm all in okay let's do it for you bro check this out so i will go ahead and tap this nope nope that's not what i want i will go ahead and tap this out from right there okay and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to wrap this up with what bottom section wrapper now this part of the strapper has not been created yet of course which is not an issue whatsoever but check this out what i will do here is pretty simple ah shoot so bottom section wrapper let's go ahead and make that uh component so we'll say const bottom no no bottom section wrapper i want to copy this one right there and paste it into here oh bottom section wrapper oh you were faster than me holy okay style that dip good okay now so that's div okay great what we can do now at this point is pretty simple i can actually let's let's let's bro you see you know he did the you did the position relative top 300 pixels remove this bye bye see if i buy this you'll see you'll see what i mean look at this here's check this out now are you ready for this bro all i have to do i'm so ready i'll have to sue all i have to do is i have to say justify content justify content yeah justify uh no actually i'll do for this specific one i'll do a line self i think it's a line stuff or something like this a line self flex i think flex end is the way no not here damn it is it justify myself no you want to go justify content because you already made it column and justified content is the horizontal so if you're yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay okay fancy pants okay all right fancy pants all right let's take this out here's what we'll do in that case we'll do is we'll say now i cannot do just my content on yourself so let me see flexbox flexbox right here complete guide to align self uh over her uh item let's do flags basis align self but see it can only align self using default alignment one the specific items okay oh what nope i got it we'll do like this justify content we'll do just the contest space between that's as simple as that that's it here's what we'll do okay i'll go to here i go to here i go to here i say justify content justify content okay justify content right there content and i say space between and i save this oh wait no no no no no no no no no that's not that one we're very close we're close don't worry i'm close i'm close i'm closer this is what happens when you mess up my code i know let me remove this for a second here let me see now how do i align something at the bottom all at the bottom i mean what i can do the best way to do this is just to line it all at the bottom is okay i mean hold on again if you use the display grid no i'll do this okay i got it i got it again so here's what we'll do we'll do row template template top section wrapper look at this top section wrapper check this out oh my god i'm so i i be honest with you he's probably hating me right now but it's okay guys this is this is all about learning okay top section wrapper we'll create a top section wrapper right here beautiful that's awesome and so now we have two items okay now we have two things two things now okay one at the top one the bottom beautiful all right top section wrapper that's amazing okay what's going to happen now is we're going to create a div for top section wrapper as well right here so const const top section wrapper boom it's also going to be style.div boom boom okay save that all right awesome so check this out now now my question is why does it why do we let me stop you for one second what's up bro we got our first donation i think oh we did where yes we did hold on hold on hold the phone you are amazing where is this chandra like a what is 100 rupees is that what it is hey hey everybody my name is chandra and i just tried your whatsapp clone and it's awesome and now and now is time for jimmy clone let's rock and roll you know it hey exactly oh my god all right keep going awesome so a few things okay few things really quickly thank you so much i appreciate you all right so good vibes only that's true that's true that's true okay guys so we got that portion okay somebody somebody actually made a comment let me see somebody made a really cool comment let me set justify contest space between to the rapper hi guys yes align stuff to the child exactly so that's what i'm trying to do here right so while we have two wrappers now one big issue that i'm seeing here is for example for some reason it's being it's pushing the whole dip why i'm not sure why this whole div is being pushed all the way to the bottom do you see what i mean here like it's creating more space than what needs to do do you stand there oh actually i know what that's the case i know i have like two rappers bottom rapper top rapper and then space between i know that's the case that could work i know that's the kids because the reason why that's i guess because we have a height of 100 vh right see right here so the height of 100 h is what's causing this sidebar to actually go past and this what's causing this um scroll wheel right right because if we when you slide the side with 100 of each it's actually going to be this plus the whole height right exactly so what we need to do is we need to do is hide 100 vh minus turn this out minus we'll do calc yeah yeah check this out guys this is really cool 100 vh minus what is the height of the header do you know i think it's like 70 70 pixels something someone let me see let me see let me look at look it up uh yes it's 70 pixels is 90 pixels i think it's like i think it's 100 pixels no i think it is i think it's cool i'd say i think it's i think it's less than 70 pixels let me see look it up it's 71 bro header.js it's 71 pixels okay maybe it's 72 let me see 72 73 24 25. okay all right so calc we'll do calc so for the height of the sidebar we'll do calc let me see where's the sidebar right here side by side where's the height of the sidebar where is it where is it where is it where is it was it right here so we'll do 100 vh we'll do a calc boom right there so kind of we're almost there 77 what i don't know why it's still not i don't think it's 77 i think it's more than 77 i think it's 80 let's try 80. no bro like what went back to header.js huh let's just say any pixels okay fine it's any pixels how about that okay fine 70 pixels now you can see it we still have like a little bit of scroll which i don't fully like but i think the reason why is pretty simple because um well we can figure it out here in a little bit i think most importantly is here's what i want to do i'll go to the wrappers i want to do this i want to say justify content justify content content and then say space between space dash between boom boom right there you see now yes it's hiding all the to the bottom here but that's completely fine that's not a problem we'll do we can just do margin bottom that's that's all we can do right we don't have to do that at all so let me go ahead let me just say this oh see it's not changing at all that's beautiful that's exactly what what i want in here so here's what i'll do i'll do i'll do margin bottom margin bottom how much well how much should we do boom i don't know five pixels hmm it's not even doing that let me see a wrapper oh i think margin bottom on the actual bottom portion let me see margin bottom on the the bottom section so we'll do top section and then the bottom section div we'll do margin bundle for this one there we go oh 100 by 10 pixels hey you see now there you go beautiful how was that okay how's that how's that looking looking good let's do 20 pixels maybe it's a little bit different than what i would do but it's good just it's just as good though hey 30 pixels let's try this one beautiful see i like that now you see now the reason why i like this because then this will always be on the bottom it's not like whenever the thing is i always try to avoid relative positioning i always try to use like the top 300 pixels or bottom 300 pixels i try to avoid write the positioning because that changes things you know what i mean and so that's all that's why we do this got it yeah cool beans all right let's go and continue on with what you need to finish up for this specific portion so we need to give it a color yes and we need to give it like a little bit of room to breathe okay and a border top okay and we're pretty much sad let's do it right now you ready bro i am okay where's the color you go you go now uh so the color that we want to give it is green okay so gray let's go go ahead yep go go go go go gray where is it i don't know how to do your target because what's up go keep going keep going nice i'm not sure how do you want to target this empty div thing that you gave in simple here's what we do we got the is like unwrapper bro and we'll say color yeah color what is the color it's gray grey is it just gray really it's really just gray yeah right there now you see this bro it's gray now right there see let's go and see let's go ahead and add a border top as well exactly and that's going to be a one pixel solid and it's going to be light gray i told you right now boom let's do it let's do let's do it do it what a top beautiful let's go ahead and save that awesome save that and boom look at that now one thing you guys can see as you can see here what we have is we have some space in what can we do bro okay i mean i would just do a simple margin top or actually i would do better even try margin top you'll see a big difference here let's try margin top okay do margin top do like 20 let's say 20 pixels okay now this is challenging me guys i am challenging you save it let's see okay i got it cool okay do do now 30 pixels okay do more hey we have another donation let's go we do another donation also chandra hey guys chandra again so appreciate you work this again for your hard work a regular view remember me thank you so much tech coder is her name i love it that's awesome that's amazing that's so awesome cool cool cool awesome sweet all right let's go ahead keep going okay one second uh let me just quickly mend the chat for one second because we have a ton of spam happening in here and i just cleaned it up cool so yeah i gave it 30 pixels of margin top what are you going to do about it actually it looks pretty good so never [Laughter] mind okay and how about that i want to give a little bit of space between those uh icons what do you say about that okay let's do it which space where space yeah let's do that spice some spacing so now this is this is when the fun fun begins because how do you target those icons that's a good question that's a good question let me see what we could do what we could do is we let's say mui svg icon root which is the default um class name for every material ui icon because you can see it's here that's right here so you guys exactly muisg icon root is every single icon that we create and it has a class of you record i'm usvg icon we could target that inside here so easily right so if we target let's go ahead and add some padding left putting right david patting left heading right okay let's see it let's see it let's see don't do doing doing good so i targeted that and okay beautiful and i gave it a padding of two pixels beautiful so hey let's go that looks good the job done bro that looks good we have a patty of two pixels right here okay but right there that's pretty clean one thing that is let's do i would add maybe 40 pixels to this one margin top maybe let's do 60 pixels just maybe maybe yeah now it's all good and you can see now we've got what we needed and just look at this how good look at how cool this is the cool part about this is that because this is not depending on position reality you see you see this david you see this you see how nicely it works i see your point you see my point now i see you see how good it is all right awesome let's go ahead and keep going guys alright so what's the next portion david tell me all right so next up i want to address the very far right of the application and that's going to be side icons like js so good so good yes exactly so in here it's going to be the simplest possible ever uh what do you say component it's like 40 lines so really not that not that crazy but uh as we usually did with styled components what we would say is import styled from styled components components cool and we will have to import one icon if you actually can highlight the very low uh or the the icon at the bottom that's a little plus icon holy moly we have another donation bro attack tag you guys are rocking when you call me hey her call me her i was like i'm a boy oh okay okay gotcha i mean i don't know all right keep going all right cool and um so what i definitely want to import that so that's going to be the ad icon um okay that we will import from material ui icons again what we're working on guys now is this specific portion right here you can see this portion so he's working on this icon for example right now like this right here and it's also gonna work on this icon this blue one and this blue one and this blue one and so forth okay yes correct so now what i will do is uh let's set up all the wrappers and stuff so we will have the wrapper that's good and now it's going to freak out a little so let's actually say const rapper god styled div beautiful beautiful beautiful which is amazing and now once again we are going to be using display grid let's actually uh put in all the stuff that we will have so what i went ahead and did is actually if you go back to the uh finished version of the application okay we have the google keep the google calendar no the calendar the google keep the google tasks and the google contacts icons beautiful so what i did is basically i just searched them up on google and then copy address or image address and then just put it in an image source okay okay okay so what we can we can do is like i'm pretty much just copying it uh i have this snippet ready so we can we can pretty much say this if you put it into the comments section of youtube yeah i can like yeah exactly copy that right now put in the comment section on youtube yeah exactly i like that yeah yes you can see what we've done here right now is if i go ahead and save this portion now hey oh look how good this is these are some epic icons though look at this let's go let's go so while you're copying go ahead so while you're copying the icons and putting into the thing let's go i'll take a look at how do we actually make this wrapper work do properly okay so go on copy paste icons now okay of course now currently of course this div on the righthand side is broken pretty much guys as you can see correct no yo we got another donation from tech coders holy moly how many dishes can we get last donation i promise thanks so much thank you so much thank you so much all right okay so here's what's going to happen guys right if we go have and have these images right here correct we have these images right here what's going to happen is the following we need to make them kind of align vertically correct so vertically like so now the whole thing the whole thing if i go ahead and take a look at if i go ahead and put my thing at the bottom our whole section right section which is this section which is the main section is created of two grids right two grid components you can see here right we have one one two three at the right hand side one two three one two three one two three now we just now need to make it fit fully fully now to make that fit i said to say display grid display grid right here good okay display grid beautiful and with display glitch you're starting up now we'll do a display grid let me remove our uh our faces for a second here so we'll do grid grid dash template create this template dash rows right and of course now let's think about what rows do we want to use what we want to do the reason why we want to do these we want to do the following role so check this out well how many icons do we currently have well we have if you think about this we have what one two three how much one two three four so four icons to make it fully work here's what we'll do we'll do repeat repeat right there repeat right there four comma what four comma 50 pixels meaning the height of every single thing is gonna be 50 pixels max look at this if i save this now all right let's go ahead and save this let's refresh this and it's not working which is beautiful beautiful beautiful that's amazing here's the thing the reason why it's not working is pretty simple here's here's why our grid now yes is you see you can see our grid now i mean the rows are working the rows aren't working no problem look at that one two three and so forth the rows are working no problem whatsoever right what's now working is what is the actual divs the actual images so we need to fix the image to fix the image you just need to go the image and we need to say the following image and what we're going to say is okay image width right here width okay and a hundred percent because if we say the width of a hundred percent this means that boom right there is what this means okay that's exactly what this means you can see now and now this image you can see is very simple it's just simply the max width of the width of the full container right and that's going to prevent it from going down or from you know uh from having all these weird things now what daily the added here is he added an hr and hit an ad icon which is here at the bottom boom right there so we have one and two and we need to be able to modify this the grid to accommodate those hopefully you guys understand that right we said there's four items but now there's six items okay so we go and take a look at this what's going to happen david well well let's go ahead for the hr which is simply one horizontal line we'll say one pixel okay and then the rest is going to be 50 pixels save that save that beautiful let's go and refresh this oh okay so here's what happens now that's awesome that's all great for the images let me take a look at the grid right now how does the grid look like oh look at this right there look at this oh so the reason why now that's the case is because why david why did why is it that this place items is spreading this whole thing out over the whole width why tell me david why you know why i mean i think uh we need to just pass it on the top i guess so that that's what that would be my my my well i guess i think why it's because you have the place item center i will say place items place items center yeah but that's not going to work either let's see dad ain't working david hold on do you know why i know why uh i think those image things are a little bigger than uh than 50 pixels i i would i would do i would hide in like 20 pixels or something which is ah that's not the reason why they're that's not the reason why they're breaking david but let's try it i know it's david i know it david david trust me i know it you sure yes you can see right there i would do object fit contain too okay that's fine you can do that too all right same thing oh yeah look at that it's smaller now which is great okay i mean we still need to snap all the ah we we might need to just add an auto here let's see what that does save that no nope here nope i think it's all because of the place items it could be okay i think that's why i think it's all because of place items okay and if grid does not work i know how to make it work very simply display flex by the way okay go ahead okay keep going go go guys that's all that's amazing so here's what's going to happen now to make this work you see place item center well look instead of placing let's do i think it's place items so if you look at display grid display grid yeah we'll get them liquid items place items let's actually just remove that line and see what that does why is it spreading it out that's crazy you can see that there is auto well the center stretch there's start right here this is what we want i actually want start is what i want the place to items for but this product is shorthand for the following css properties align items and justify justify items so what i want to do instead everyone is assembled just want to do start so let's try to start one right there since i place items we'll do start start okay that makes sense okay still not it huh why is this not it david oh come on grid template did i say dim plumber rose properly yeah i did right for oh because i think i i think i spelled repeat wrong i didn't actually uh so we repeat let's go now i got it what happened i i had repeated oh hey that's what i'm talking about okay it's not working i'm gonna bug the center now there we go i knew i knew it too trust me just you know cool oh that's funny that's funny that's funny okay cool so we have this icon so you can see and one thing i don't like is the fact that these icons like okay our icons currently are not spread out evenly are they spread out spread out evenly are they or no i feel like they are right they they should be cause because we we place them center so they should be both vertically and horizontally centered let's do this now let's go ahead and make a make up what border left now because we need to create this border left right here at the bottom here so let's do that right now yeah or left is going to be the way for us to go exactly so what we'll say is just uh going to be a border dash left fit cool and we will say it's going to be the usual one pixel solid and light gray okay beautiful boom right there awesome so let's go and save that that's gonna be beautiful okay all right so save that okay oh look at how good this looks and honestly i kind of like it without the borders oh i kind of like even without this border right here i mean i like it better that way but that's not how google likes it no i like this let's we'll make it better than google does i like it better than google okay that's fine so cool i like this plus icon i like everything that's here that's amazing okay let's now go ahead and work on which portion ah we still need to we we have we have two things we need to uh finish up what so what uh one we have to give uh so if you actually go to the original gmail notice that above the plus icon the hr is not going all the way till the very end it's like 60 percent or something that's fine um so that that's something to look out for again um we just need to take care of all the details okay fine i kind of like that without the hr that's all saying you know kind of like to try i know i know i know i kind of like that's not a legit google or gmail it's so much more better bro i look so much more better no i mean so it's okay what do you guys think hr horizontal line this here's the thing yes or no on this horizontal line let us know in the comments below i'm just curious yes or no on the horizontal line right here yes or no let us know in the comments below i'm just very curious yes or no right here this one this one exactly i personally don't like it i don't know what he thinks i mean if we actually say we don't want that everybody can we can just go and and go okay say like yo guys remove that okay beautiful it's not cool all right so we got that portion what's going what's next david what's next is going to be the center portion of the application is going to be the main part uh it's going to be the emails view right now the js phone um so we are we just got another donation hello another donation oh my gosh someone delicious thank you so much thank you so much what's happening okay keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going okay keep going so what we'll do here is uh first let's actually set up all the styled component things yes uh because now we're working on guys is working on this portion right here so this could be this portion right here so this this this portion that can be our next our next goal okay make sense good cool cool cool so for that what we would say is we will have the wrapper obviously the usual good old wrapper and then that's actually can you actually bring up the finished version yes we can right here cool so what happens is actually we have rows all the way now we have a top row which is a little bit different from what we have below in terms of emails so the top row has a checkbox a refresh icon that was more icon or something and that's it and then the emails is actually is going to be a check box once again a star sender um what's that subject a little bit of intro from the email and then a timestamp or something right there and the time step right there beautiful i like it david beautiful cool cool so is this that's going to be the last part part three let's go i mean we will be using firebase today just so you know okay that's awesome i like that too much i like it i like it it's cool i'm happy i'm because i'm gonna say hey i'm excited so what what we will do is actually let's first go ahead and import checkbox refresh icon more vertical icon and icon button yes all from material ui icons no the two two in the middle is actually an icon but the icon button is actually just going to give the little ripple effect so if you click uh on the stars like that right there i like it i like it muy bueno i like it a lot yes yes yes so you can see the icon button is simply just a way for us to go ahead and click on this so and this is not coming from icons you can see it's coming from the core itself right from the core itself and that's what allows us to click on these and actually have like this ripple just like the check box yeah yeah awesome i like it okay yeah so let's use it now so to create those let's go ahead and i'm going to go to emails view here all right so let's do the top ra wrapper first so we're going to create this top wrapper initially right and then we're going to create this bottom wrapper after that so this is called the emails container right so that's what we're doing right now so let's go ahead and do this i'm going to say rectangle and then the side portion is going to be this portion and if i go to my arrows beautiful beautiful beautiful you can see dave right now is very nicely queen of style.div at the bottom right here awesome and then what's going to happen is we're going to create the the top rapper style.div equal style.div beautiful beautiful beautiful and now what's going to happen is we're going to what let's go ahead and create the bottom wrapper which is the emails container as well let's create the email container as well okay beautiful so should we do it now yeah let's do right now let's do right now i'll do right now right now i know i know i know yeah oh let's actually give it a little bit of spacing in the code because nice code is always good we will just say emails container nice nice nice nice nice yes oh so many emails containers there's like three of them that's awesome beautiful exactly what we want okay okay yes cool got that and we will just leave the emails container for now cause there's gonna be some magic stuff happening uh let's just define the uh style.div okay so you can see that david is now creating style that there for the emails container at the bottom right there which is awesome and then what's going to happen we got that portion now let's let's go ahead and create those icon buttons right so those icon buttons you can see the emails container was created the the topper was created and now that's all beautiful beautiful next up is going to be to create the actual refresh icon so he's got the checkbox icon right here right here let's go do the refresh icon right here right but he's wrapping it out he's wrapping it inside the icon button because that will give us the ripple effect correct yes indeed yes it needs let's go ahead and save this exactly like this let's see what we got save this oh look at that if i go and look at this now look at this ripple effect boom boom boom boom boom boom uh uh oh so smash it yes smash it smash the like button smash the like button we are currently guys at 293 likes guys at 300 lives let's go ahead and get to that right now i got 300 likes come on i know you guys got us i know you guys got this okay 300 likes only it's not that much just thumbs up it thumbs up smash that like button crush it if you have to right but just you know show us your love show us what you got that's all i gotta say all right so we got the check box we got the icon button let's go ahead and now create go to the bottom let's go and now create what the the the border should we create the border or should we or shall we create what the emails container whoa what's up i got crowd that's fine that's fine that's fine so here's what what's going to happen is we will now go ahead and create an individual email we got this portion created exactly right let's not create individual email but let's also modify the top wrapper to be a little bit better right so currently we have these icons whereas these icons are kind of you know they're very close together what we can do is we can make them display grid and actually give them some kind of you know width and width and so forth so here's what we'll do i got this exactly here you got it yeah display grid i'll just chill display grid okay display grid boom okay and again we're going to do display grid with the columns okay so every single thing is going to have a column okay so say grid columns grid grid grid dash template that's what columns okay there's columns and then we'll define the the columns meaning the width of each column right so the the first one is going to be 30 pixels but i actually kind of want it to be hmm let's see i'm just very curious um can i be honest with you david though i don't want to use grid here what's up can i fully answer you i don't want to use grid here why no good because your thing is so good then it pushes them together here's what i'll do instead can i can i do something else instead these are nicely spaced instead what i would do is i would actually i like this i will i would instead space them out a little bit and i would instead of doing that i would just give it a little padding to the left hand side of 20 pixels that's what i would do there's no need for them to be grid because they're already centered beautifully look here's will do here's what just trust me okay in this just trust me hey i i trust you bro so padding left penny left is going to be 20 pixels okay just because i want to push them back a little to the left beautiful right there that's all we need okay padding up is 20 pixels the gap here is great i don't see a big issue with this gap whatsoever that's an amazing gap that's all great okay awesome the only thing i'll need is probably him to see this top rapper let me go and take a look at what is the height of this top wrapper okay this top wrapper this top wrapper is great as well it's actually what is the height is gonna be 48 pixels beautiful 48 pixels that's all we need so that means our other things are going to be 40 pixels as well so here let's give it this let's do this we'll do this height of 48 pixels just like that 48 pixels boom all right so let's give give a normal height and now look at this it's all clean it's beautiful no no spacing look at it see it's so clean that it's all amazing the next thing we're going to do is let's go ahead and create the actual what the email right the email now how do we create the email david so for the email we will have a separate um wait what's happening our clothes aren't insane anyways uh so what will happen is for now for this stream we will be using a attempt a temporary folder to store all the email data just like we did uh but actually when we will have the full image email functionality we will be just pretty much uh nice use firebase to store examples exactly so what will happen is inside of the source folder i'm going to just add in a temporary folder which is i'm just going to call it temp create it yep and right there as you can see that's what we created right here cool and inside of that folder i want to create an email data.js cool beautiful right there nice okay let's go and do that and it's just going to be a dummy email the daytime just copy and paste all your emails into here david yeah okay that's good let's do that right now beautiful so here's the emails guys you can see here's what happened right the emails data and all it is it's simply just an object it's an array okay that's all it pretty much is and this array has a few emails one is like this it says start true from now subject yo message sub bro right receive the a20 and read so far and again these are only placeholders for now i know and when we go connect them to firebase then we'll go ahead and actually fully showcase how firebase works fully and showcase how we can connect firebase and actually show proper emails and even send emails in the part three we're going to send emails like we're going to use send grid to send emails which can be really really exciting i'm pumped for that bro i'm really pumped for that hell yeah yeah so now now this will allow us to actually use the emails back in the emails view okay so let's do that right now all right so what we will do is we will pretty much need to go ahead and import the email data so what we will say is import on the top and we will say email data and because it's not default exported we will need to use the squiggly braces beautiful and what we will say is we will need to go up a folder to the components and go out of components as well i believe because you can see in the temp folder you need to go outside the stamp folder to go back into them what no i think the ten folders inside what yeah then we need to go out of no we just need to go out once i think we need to go out of oh yeah because we're currently we're in the emails view so we're currently inside the components and we're currently here in the emails we need to go outside the layout right right here go outside the components right here go into temp right here and then go to empty meals data and that's how we get that beautiful right there beautiful awesome all right let's continue on awesome okay so and then we're just gonna loop through them uh once again this is just a for this stream setup but we will be actually using the almost same structure yep so what we'll do is we will go ahead and we'll loop through the emails data like so right so we'll take email data from here right here i'll map through them right there so just go ahead and type and i'll just narrate okay for you okay all right so go ahead and map through them beautiful and then what's going to happen is as we're mapping through them really quickly guys is what's what's going on here which is really interesting guys what's going on here is really cool is we are actually grabbing the data individual data from every single kind of object right this is called destructuring right it's called to destructure an object when you map through something right you get the whole object which looks a little bit kind of like this right this is the whole object you get right it's the whole object right here what you can do is you can actually structure it but you was doing using a square like these squiggly brackets right here and doing start from and grabbing the individual keys we call it from every single item it's as simple as that understood boom boom boom boom awesome let's go and continue on all right so now we actually need to go ahead and create a new folder with the with the email item because that's going to be an external component so if we go ahead and create a folder which we will call email item boom right there uh it should be there and an email item.js file good so we'll go ahead and do that so we'll have an email item right here so he created a folder called email item guys and then from that he created an email item.js file it's as simple as that beautiful awesome and this is where our email item actually exists this whole email item component will exist there nice yeah and i'm just going to type in rafc because i'm a lazy guy and i'm using snippets so right now component ready and let's actually go ahead and import styled components here as well so it was import style from nice styled components beautiful beautiful beautiful cool and now what's gonna happen is we will just go ahead and make and one email item okay so let's go ahead and we'll make one email item is that right yes yes yes but first let's actually go back to email emails view so we will be testing with the live data let's do it what we already made cool yes all right so what's gonna happen is let's actually go ahead and import the email item file on the top so that should be this one right there right there beautiful good good and what we will say is we will have the email item uh over here to be used nice so we'll use the email item now yes good and and we'll pass in the data into it correct exactly so let's pass another data we'll pass in a star so it can do so you go ahead and type so the pass and is starred then we'll pass and from right there then we'll pass in subject into this component okay after from so passing subject meaningful it's going to continue on then we'll pass it after subject we'll pass in the message there we go received and read just like this received and again these are all parameters that are going to go into the component itself guys okay they're going to go into the component itself that's a really cool part about this awesome so we got the specific proportion that's amazing now let's go back to email item let's see what we got so if i refresh this really see nothing's happening because if we go to email item it's pretty much empty however if i say for example email save this you see now we have three emails because we're wrapping over that's what's up bro what's up that's what's up i know right it's sick right so now we have three emails that we are going to like loop through nonstop okay beautiful now let's actually all we need to do now is just simply modify the email component itself focus on this specific component and just do it the first thing we're gonna do is what first thing we would just need to go ahead and catch all the stuff that we will be we are actually passing in here so we will need to make sure that we actually catch those correct so what these are called these are called props guys these are called props okay but with props the cool thing about props is you can again destructure them right so when we pass at this data right here okay they pass into the parameters of the component it's as simple as that right in the email item when we have to catch that we have to be able to like when you throw something you have to catch it correct yes or no david like if i throw a ball at you you don't catch it hits your face you know what i mean it's not good you know what i mean that's not good at all so what i want to do instead is i want to catch it by using props now once i cut it i can actually structure it and that's why we can do something like this so we can do the whole the whole the structuring with this specific portion which looks a little bit kind of like boom right there start from subject message received red that will destructure the whole thing amazing good awesome all right let's go and keep going bro perfect though all right so we will be using uh the check box once again from material ui and we will have this all these uh little things so yeah so we will be using the checkbox that's good and actually there is a little bit of tweak to it because if you click the star it actually changes oh let's go that's amazing oh that's awesome that's sick and and you might be thinking that okay i might just go ahead and change the color but instead i'm actually changing the exact the actual icon really yeah really why wait really no way so what i yeah interesting interesting what i do is i have this star border icon the difference between the two is the star border icon is that empty thing and the star icon is the full field okay uh the actual freaking icon like can i show you how you can actually change it up a little bit or no can i show you how you can change it up a little bit check this out here's what i'll do instead of this because you can actually make it simpler the way you have it right now so here's what we'll do is let's now first let's go ahead and create the checkbox let's do the checkbox one so let's do a checkbox that's part one okay so we'll do just checkbox here so we'll do a checkbox awesome so we got the checkbox let's uh say the checkbox do we say do you have the checkbox i don't see no checkbox oh i do see the checkbox beautiful oh there there they are so we need okay now the star okay the star is this star i'm a star i'm a star okay so as a star i'll do i'll quit the icon button and then i'll do like this icon button i'm a star okay so i can button right there yes i am all right such a stop i know i'm a stop i know so icon button right there guys and then what's going to happen this can be become the icon button for this star okay now the star is going to be have the star icon now the style icon now changes the penny on a few things now of course if the star is true we're going to because you can see here the emails data the start can be true or false start true or false right so here's what we'll do we'll do here go to emails item and we'll do this start if here's will do we'll say like this if starred starred right if start equals true question mark question mark then we'll go ahead is do this boom right there right so that's going to then we're going to do is we'll create a this star icon looks a little bit like this star icon so check this out there's a star icon and this star icon will have the color of where this icon will have some kind of different colors okay seven cb 69. now if the star is false again this this by the way guys for those of you who don't know this is these are shorthand for if and else so for example if start is true if that's true we do this however if it's false meaning else then we do the following or right there then we do the follow we do star icon star border icon button which is going to be this one specifically right there boom right there so now i'm going to go ahead and save this awesome boom boom let's go and take a look at this hey you can see now these are icons you can see okay and they're all great they look beautiful and amazing and they're just shining like a bright star right now now one cool thing is of course we should be able to click on them right and actually something should happen something like the actual start should should change right now to do that we'll create a div on this icon button we'll do for example the following we'll do on click of this icon button we'll do unclick on click we'll do something we'll do huh does it work like that of course bro okay you know me bro come on bro come on bro come on bro you know how this is done bro so here's we'll do guys for every single component actually what we'll do is we'll we'll use we'll save state i'm going to save state for every single component and if it's start is true or start as false so here's will do um we're going to use use date so it's going to import you state oh god i love this oh god i love coding guys i don't get to code so often because now i have to teach a lot so i love teaching but i just love coding sometimes too so you state you state okay so we'll import state right here beautiful that's awesome and then once we've done that all we got to do is let's go ahead and create a a state com estate value of star so for example let's just say here uh we'll stay const i will say star star right there start right there and then stop and it's gonna say set star beautiful and then what i'll do is in the u state u state and here's we'll do it i will actually initialize it to the start value that was passed in like this start beautiful right so now for example exactly so now instead of checking for start we're going to check for the star which is here because again guys the start is actually now a state component correct a state value right so here's i'll do it now i'll do star star right here which is beautiful star and look it's still working no problem right no problem now check this out on the click of this button icon here's what i'll do i'll do equals right there so i'll do check this out you ready for this bro i'll do this i'm so ready and i'll do set star on the click of this i'll do set star all depends i have to do set stuff depending if it's true or false so this this is where i actually have to create a function let's go ahead and do uh const we'll do cons change star and we'll create a function called equal this so here this so depending on what the star is we're going to change the star right so right you want to do it like that no can we do it like that no no no you can't do that no no no we can't right no no no no no no i mean i mean actually i mean technically here's i mean let's let's check it can we actually try here here's we'll do it here's one no no no no no no no no no no no try try then let's talk set star to what to false right otherwise we'll do such star no not star star we'll do set star star to true otherwise basically here if you're thinking on the click of this okay it's pretty simple if the stars true will set it to fall so basically to make it the reverse correct very simple however if it is false we'll set it back to true the reverse of it as again so how can you function bro how clean is this look bro this is so clean i know so this is like wait wait wait oh it's not work actually fully hold on oh damn it did not work come on i know i know i know i mean that could be a few different issues right that could be a few different shows i know i know so let me see maybe maybe you need to refresh this maybe to refresh it so let me see no no no let me see let's try this again let me see if setstar is it is the icon button actually a div like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i can do this no problem i'll give you an approach okay okay okay so in the valid handler probably unclick did you mean on click oh because i think i did wait hold on i just capitalized it so you might need to refresh and shout out to save save email item because i just uh capitalized on click okay wait wait wait wait wait wait one click so you want to save the file cool and then refresh oh let's go that's what i'm talking about oh yeah yeah yeah bruh all right so we got that porsche that is amazing look you see how cool that is bro how cool is that very cool so cool all right i have 10 minutes exactly before we finish this bro and we haven't finished it we have 10 minutes to finish this bro what's up we have 10 minutes to finish and we gotta go yup we do yep so here let's go check this out the next thing look that's all working no problem it's so clean now too look how clean this is bro oh so clean i love this it's the cleanest thing ever cool so let's go ahead and do this um for every single wrapper one thing i want to do for the wrapper is just how did the padding 20 pixels let's do padding left 20 pixels on here padding left padding left 20 pixels save that oh oh you see how good that looks let's add a let's add a border as well at the top should we add a border at the top let's do border top that's going to be so nice and clean yeah uh i would actually use gap instead of border top and stuff like that because with uh people i mean look look look look look look it looks good what are you talking about look at this it looks great i don't know what you're talking about it's not fancy it looks great bro i don't know what you want man it looks great you know what i mean all right so okay at that point what's going to happen guys i while while there is a little bit stuck here that's fine what we'll do is we'll go ahead and create a few things which is the first thing we're going to create is going to be uh which one it's going to be this nas and qazi so this is going to be the name portion right here so is it that's the name portion correct so from right is that from or two it's from right so let's just do a b a p class with from that's the from yeah so let's do that right now so here's what we'll do boom p class name and what's going to happen is basically here's what's happening if basically if a red if it's red then we'll make the class name unread right basically i mean actually it's a little bit weird hold on if red is equal to no no what you want here is if it if it's not red so if it's an unread email yeah so that that's why i'm saying like if you feel like this the red if not red right there if not red right there then we say okay unread is the class name i know i know i know otherwise there is no class name exactly otherwise there's no class name so this is why now again the unread simply has this specific black like it's dark and you can see that right there that's unread beautiful so that's unread and then let's go ahead and click create the one for the what what the which what is the other one oh for the title right we will have the subject and the message yeah yeah the subject so let's call it the subject so once again we will be doing the exact same red or not red thing yeah that's not so we got that so what's going to happen now is again if it's not red then what we'll do is we'll we'll create the subject beautiful nice yes yes and then we will be using a span in there i think you have too many p tags here i think this one's one should not be here so i got you bro oh yeah correct i got it i got you bro i got you you got me i got your house got you thank you look at that it looks sick i mean it looks horrible but it looks sick at the same time right i mean it gets the job done does it get the job done guys all right the most important thing guys you see you see the sender you see the subject you see everything like what else do you think it's awesome i agree it's amazing i agree bro i agree cool so and last but not least we will need to have a timestamp because otherwise like emails like we just need to have the timestamp right and once again uh we are going to be handling if it is unread or not and then we will be passing in the received prop which i used to received at time and just received in short okay so that's going to be the timestamp um cool so now what we will do is we already have the padding on the left hand side we have the border top which is going to be one pixel solid light gray that is amazing okay so now what we will be doing is we will be doing display grid and this is why i this is why it's so like i literally i love this great grid uh because i can say grid template uh template the columns yeah like um i can't write today what's happening today i know and and instead of messing around with all the columns and all that things i can just say uh the first one is going to be 30 pixels 50 pixels then it's gonna be 120 pixels then it's going to be auto and then it's going to be 50 pixels so we are pretty much what we what we are saying is we are reserving 50 pixels at the very end beautiful see what i mean and then we'll do is we'll align the center to make sure they're vertically aligned so let's do that right now uh we will do in it just a second so before we actually do that uh because we can do it in the display grid we can say we want to give a gap of 10 pixels so we will uh support all the items all the children items inside of the wrapper are going to have a gap in between them of 10 pixels does it make sense i like it i like it i like it i like it beautiful i like it you like it cool and you see like it's actually off a little bit vertically so what i will say is we will go ahead and uh say align items center okay beautiful it's gonna save that so that's oh that's so awesome beautiful nice so i think we are good on the rapper side now we will have the div inside here correct one thing i want to say though one thing i want to say is this one right here on the on the left you see how it's not aligned with this one is because of the width the width here so here's what i'll do on this except this one instead of doing 30 pixels i'll do actually main content check this out okay when content boom right there see main content i also do main content for the star so the star aligns directly with this refresh button icon so also do main content for this one and content all right boom right there see many content no then we can just say ming khan and mean content right this game this gap you don't really need at this point at this point either as well oops what happened here did you make no no no no hey no no it's so good so good so good beautiful look at that oh look at this now that's so amazing that's amazing dope bro that was cool and now the only thing we need to fix is this portion right here because where this portion right here is like you know top to bottom that should be pretty simple we just have to use display flex to fix that so refresh that correct save that your favorite part hey let's go yes yeah yeah hmm and i actually forgot to add the cursor pointer so if i actually hover over i want to like have that little hand thingy instead of the arrow or i don't know yeah cool and uh next up we have uh inside of the div uh we want to target those pens so span and the span we're targeting is again this one right here guys this right here correct these spans of like the message span right here so i would do like they're beautiful so we'll let's refresh this oh let's save that awesome stuff so you can see this pan is this one right now see it just create just a little bit of color the grayish color that that's all pretty much it does and let's now go ahead at that point let's go ahead and do the unread section of it too the unread exactly and so in case and you actually want to make sure that the unread is at the very end because it's going to overwrite everything all above exactly beautiful you need to make sure that that is end so color is going to be black and font weight good is going to be bolder beautiful beautiful beauty so that being said though we're pretty much cool yeah yeah yep yep yep exactly exactly so that's bolder now so it's going to save this that's amazing beautiful and you can see now when it fits on red you see now it's a different color now one that will add though is add a little bit of padding for this padding right right here this uh 820 i'll do a penny right on that one just to give it a same padding so the padding that's right of 20 pixels right there to save that okay that makes oh look at how good this looks just like holy moly that's all good guys oh my god i know oh my god oh my god look at this now you can click the star you can start if you want oh my gosh that's so good and we have the cursor pointer as well that looks amazing guys this one guys this is pretty much done we have our gmail clone that looks sick i want you just to front it right look think about this we have the header look it's even better than what we what we started out with honestly yeah because you're using chrome
