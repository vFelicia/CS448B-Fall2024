what is up everybody this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and you are watching code Khadem e part 8 alright so let's get started today I got my coffee in a Starbucks coffee thing this is going to be I'm actually really excited so we are on at 35% in the Python course and we're doing really well so let's keep going alright we are still in lists and dictionaries okay at 42% if you took the initiative to go ahead and do more in the time between great job but we're going to keep moving on and also it's amazing you've made it so far and haven't quit right so winners never quit and quitters never win keep going make sure you finish the entire series in the tutorial that's why I'm here sitting next to you and we're going through this together alright so maintaining order let's see what they're talking about here alright sometimes you need to search for an item in a list so sometimes you need to search for the item alright here's what they're kind of talking about okay let's go to rebel dot it let's say that this was a really big list with a bajillion things in it and I told you what location does the duck comment I mean you could easily count it right now and go well aardvark is in position 0 badger is in position 1 and so duck is actually in position 2 so you would say if I did animals of two and printed that that would give me duck and you would be right however however if this was a really long list with a bajillion items it would be really hard for you to know where duck Falls right you wouldn't be able to count it that easily eyeball it so one good trick to do to figure out where duck Falls is to do animals dot index okay this is a method called index and we are gonna put in these parentheses right here if I move the print away it will look like this and we will set duck so basically you're saying hey um give me the index at which duck is that okay so it will tell you the index the first place duck is found so imagine if you had two ducks if you had another duck right here it would find this one and return it to so let's go ahead and show you how it actually works we go boom boom and let's change the name of that to this run it okay you see how I gave you back a two so effectively what you can do is you can say animals this whole thing turns into a to write this whole thing converts to a two so we can say animals instead of saying animals at index two I can say give me the animal name at this index obviously it's going to give me back a duck because this whole thing is going to turn into a two and animals of two is stuck cool all right let's keep moving on so duck index use index to find duck simple animals dot index doc boom um your code here print animals okay assign that result to a variable called duck index assign that result then insert the string Cobra at that index okay cool so let's see how that works okay let's take this whole thing and put it in here okay now if I print out doc index you see that I get back a two now if I do dunk I'm sorry if I do animals that answer right and how does insert work insert takes in two font and two arguments okay index this method insert takes in two arguments it takes index and an item so you give it a position and you give it what you want to put in there and then it puts that thing in there okay so I'm going to say for now I'm gonna sit and I'm going to say Cobra or in all small letters and then I'm going to print out the list animals alright so you can see that a position now it inserted Cobra and shifted everything one over so now duck is actually three EMU is four and so on cool another way we can insert instead of putting this two is we can just do animals dot and then moles dot index duck and this whole thing will evaluate to a two or we can just use duck index because we already created that variables and that should do the same thing so you see that list over there now let's go back here and do that so we're going to do animals dot index duck index so that's so or sorry insert duck index and for the item where you're going to say Cobra boom and it's going to print animals so let's check it out aardvark badger in position we got Cobra okay excellent let's keep going for one and all for number in my list all these are so fun finally we get two loops yes I can't remember if we did loops earlier but loops are so fun they're literally the reason why I love programming every time I try to sit down and write something I just want to start off with the loop okay they're the best part so write a statement oh whoops yeah I'm vain right that was just my picture of me playing pool I'm terribly just kidding I'm better than myself and I used to play earlier so if that gives you any point of reference anyways write a statement in the indented part of the for loop that prints a number equal to two times the number for every item in the list let's see how loops work let's get some practice with loops loops are amazing you guys so learn them and learn them well okay so here's how a loop start okay four okay this is a for loop for blah blah blah blah blah doesn't matter in my list print that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah which is what I'm going to copy and paste here and how a loop works is it will run and the first time it runs blah blah blah this whole thing right here will be one then when it runs the second time it will be nine then when the loop runs the third time it'll be three then it'll be eight then it'll be five lb7 and then after seven you see that there are no more numbers and so that entire loop stops so the loop knows when the list or whatever you're running through is completed so here all of the items are completed and so it'll stop running at that point okay so I'm going to run this you're going to see it prints out one nine three eight five seven okay this part here is the part that ends up becoming a number so I'm going to call it number because that's a much better than named and blah blah blah blah but why I showed you the whole weird part was so you can understand that you don't have to put in the variable name that they tell you you can put in whatever you want right this variable name here literal does not matter cool comprende all right let's keep going so for a number in my list the first time the loop happens the number is 1 and then we go to line 4 and it prints out that number and you get 1 then the loop runs again because it sees there's another item the list is not yet over and so we get an so number is then 9 and then this ends up printing out 9 the loop continues running this part becomes 3 so then this part becomes 3 and it prints it out so you get a 3 here then this part becomes a 8 this part becomes an 8 and you see all that printed right there and it keeps happening till it's 7 this part becomes 7 it prints out 7 and then it knows it knows automagically that the list has ended you don't have to do anything special it knows that the list has ended and so the loop stops running some languages don't do that you have to kind of tell it like hey run for this mini amount of times and see I think you have to do that in C++ but in Python it just takes care of it for you ok so coffee is so good for failed bug this is a double tall skinny latte sugarfree hazelnut with heavy cream milk so go to Starbucks and get this there's no carbs and it gives you that right amount of expresso so your brain gets going and then you can program away all day anyways tangents we don't like 10 let's keep going so you just learn how basic loops work now let's do what they're saying write a statement in the indented part of the for loop that prints a number equal to two times that number so we are going to say print 2 times that number simple simple there we go we just got a bad you guys hundred exercises let's keep going we're a machine we're nobody there's ain't no stopping us right so we got to right so number was one and one times two is two and it print out too you see it right there then number was nine right I know loops can be confusing at first so that's why I'm really going through it in detail and if you're too smart you're like this is boring feel free to skip ahead I don't care but I really want to go through it because don't take this for granted if you really understand this well you're gonna understand a lot of what programming is about so it's really important to understand the basic concepts really well like the back of your hand cool so two times nine that's how you get 18 and I'm just going to explain one more number when we get to the last item of the list seven seven right here two times seven you get 14 and that's how you get 14 right there and then it ends because it knows that the list is completed automatically let's keep going okay so more with four loops so now they're having you do more with four loops so if your list is a jumbled mess you need you may need to sort it so an example of sorting is like this okay if I have animals and I do animals sort and print out animals is going to be sorted alphabetically which means the ant is going to be the first one since bat starts with a B that's going to be the second item and cat is going to end up being the third one so let's look at it and bat cat got it if we had numbers instead like three one and two you'll see that it says one two three okay so sorting knows what to do it sorts it so then your life is easier and then you can print out those things or whatever right cool for animal in Adam for animal and animals print animal okay this is a very simple thing to do so I can show you right here simple loop for animal in animals I can call this whatever I want right like but animal makes sense because the first time you go through the list animal is going to be cat and it's a string cat right and then it's going to print out cat basically okay and then it's going to print out or sorry since we were sorting the list it's going to print out and first because the new list actually looks like this right bat and cat so it's going to print out ant then cat this part I'm sorry should actually be animal then animal is going to be bat it's just going to print that bad then animal is going to be cat and it's going to print out cat so let's take a look at it syntax are yep print okay because this is Python three again one of those things don't worry about it but in Python 3 printers of functions you have to put parentheses after it you can see right here add bat and cat okay it works the same way with numbers as it works with strings or a lot of other data types floats right write a for loop that iterates over start list and append each number squared to square list easy let's do it and then square the list all right so here's an example of this we're going to take this thing and we're going to create a square list and it's going to be empty this is a very common operation so really get this one down and maybe make up some of your own silly or whatever kind of examples and do them here's what we're going to do we have a start list but what we want to be able to do is get a list that's squared of that one right so what's squared of what's five squared so I'm just going to do it it's 25 right 5 squared 25 so this list should ultimately look like this 3 squared is 9 1 squared is 1 2 squared is 4 4 squared is 16 ok so start list is this squared list should be like this however we got it empty and let's use a loop to do it because what if these numbers were to change our code should run regardless of what these numbers are right the code the code that I start writing below line 3 it should be so smart that if somebody comes in and changes our line on one and put some different numbers in here it should still be correct right so that's why you can't hard code it and put 25 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 16 because what if somebody comes here and just changes it and goes 4 + 5 and now it doesn't make sense first of all why do we have 5 numbers right off the bat it's wrong should only have two numbers and the first number should really be 16 and then it should be 25 none of the other numbers should be there so we're going to write code that's going to be intelligent enough to do that so we're going to start off with an empty list what we're going to do is for number in start list so we're going to do a for loop and what we're going to say is we're going to square each number so I'm going to say square that would be number squared instead of this in Python we use this right that's for exponentiation and then we are going to say square list dot append Square or let's call that variable squared number okay so we're going to get a number let's say in the start when we're looping through the start list this is going to be a v squared number is going to be really v squared in the start this is going to turn out to be 25 and we're going to append 25 right we're going to put 25 here and this 25 is going to go in this list we're going to get 25 right here okay then when we go through the loop again this is going to be three this thing is going to be three squared which is going to get evaluated to nine we're going to say app and right here with in step n 9 we're going to get 9 right here same thing the next item in the list is what it's 1 right so we're going to get 1 squared what's 1 squared plus 1 right I can prove it to you 1 squared is 1 1 cubed is 1 1 9 right you get the point 1 and then we get 1 that's how pen works adding something to the end append append adding something to the end of the list cool so I think you get the idea this is going to be our algorithm and let's go and put it right here and that should work let's see what's your square number okay so one thing we need to do oh so this is obviously squared number and well one thing last thing we need to do is actually sort that list so right now if I do print square list okay right now if I do print square list you'll see 25 9 1 4 16 which is what we wanted but now what we're going to do is how would we squared right sort and then we're going to say print square list and here then ah look at that right 1 4 9 16 25 beautiful so let's go ahead and put that in here we should be good done beautiful check it out dictionaries then this next part is key okay so there's a pun because what we're going to be working with is a dictionaries and dictionaries hold something called key value pairs okay so dictionaries all right what we have is a dictionary and holds key value pairs so effectively it's something like I can have I don't know Bob social security number or something more interesting phone number right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 boom ok and then I can have a Joanne and her phone number can be they all have very simple and weird phone numbers right and I can have a thousand people like this okay so phonebook so this is called the dictionary Bob here's the key and this is the value hence key value pairs right now if I wanted to get Bob's phone number or Joanne's phone number imagine if it was a list of a million people if it was a dictionary with a million people's names and there is no way I can go an eyeball every single number and every single name so what I would actually do is I would do phonebook so how it works is you do the dictionary and then you put the key that you want and the answer that you get is that value okay so for example if I put in the dictionary which is the okay so the dictionary here is phonebook and if I index it by its key which is Bob right what am I going to get I'm going to get back Bob's phone number run keys not defined oh you're right here to comment that out Oh because so the reason I got that is because it's thinking it's math so what it did is one two three four five six seven eight nine zero so that's how it got negative eight thousand two hundred twenty three so it's a string right I'm just being silly so I have to put this actually as a string and now you get back exactly that okay so that was turned out to be a good example in showing you why you should use a string rather than natural numbers so you get back one two three four five six seven eight nine zero and we got Bob's phone number so this is really helpful this is a lot of what's used in databases that's how your iPhone works okay it's key value pairs literally somebody programmed a dictionary in your phone and so what happens is when you look for somebody's name like if you if you want to call Jill and you type in her name what the code in the background does is it does print phonebook Jill right whatever you put in there is here right this is what you type so if you type in somebody's name it pretty much goes in here and if you do Jill it'll give you back you know Jill's number whatever it may be so this is very relevant right don't just think that this is some little baby stuff that we're doing on code Academy this is very relevant if you learn this stuff you can do mobile development you can do app development you can make your own apps okay so already start thinking turning that brain and getting some ideas and you can actually start using these things think about recipes right you can actually make a cooking app based on this you can have key value pairs if the key is I don't know grill salmon then the value here maybe can be the steps on how to make that salmon right so it can be like first I suck at cooking take out the pan or something and could be grilled salmon and then I can call this recipes and let's take that out and if I do recipes to my spelling I write recipes yeah I'm sewing alright okay and if I put grilled salmon I'll check it out it's telling me the steps and what I can effectively do here is I can do a list of steps right so I can say I and now I don't have to say first take out the pen I can just say take out the pan then the next step is turn on the stove right and now I'm going to do grill salmon you see it says take out the pan turn on the stove right but let's say I want to get step zero which is the first step I can do zero and I get take out the pan if I do one I get turn on the stove so you see these are different data structures we're using a dictionary and using a list as a value of a dictionary key but it's all coming into play and well another thing that you can be thinking of is what if I want to do a for loop here and print out each step one by one I can certainly do that I can say for recipe or I can say first step in recipes write print I actually should rather be recipe because that's really what's going to printing in recipes print recipes recipe right so this is the dictionary effectively right because this is the dictionary so this is the dictionary name recipes this is the key so the first time you loop over you get grill salmon okay just to show you if I do recipe here and I loop through this you get turn on the stove you get our sorry you get grill salmon right here because this print statement doesn't matter you get grill salmon right there okay which is the key and if you put in a key into the dictionary you get back the value right so I can do recipes which is the dictionary I put in that key and I get back the value right take out the pan turn on the stove cool and we can even really take that a step further and print out each of those things right so I can go even deeper in my for loop and I can say for step in that print step and so take out the pan turn on the stove you see so we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here but this is really me giving you um you know like foreshadowing for what's to come and how you can use this and maybe giving you some ideas and you can start developing your you know to start development your own apps or or a console cooler idea than just within the constraints of code Kadim e right so this is how you really want to think start putting these things together and you know this is advance two loops loop within a loop so when I got to talk about this now but it's just to give you an idea of the power of programming cool let's get back to this business so here they're telling the key value key value right you already know this stuff easy print the value stored under the sloth and Burmese python keys accessing dictionary values by key is just like accessing list values by index so things what they're effectively saying here is if I hide or comment out all these lines right what they're effectively saying here is that if this was a list you would say recipes and you would say maybe zero and that would give you back grilled salmon or that might give you back you know take out the pan or whatever but in a dictionary you actually put in the key instead of a number okay and that's how you get back the value of that key okay so okay cool so now all you have to do just print out those things so I'm going to say print residence um sloth print residence right dictionary and then keeper nice Python keys or keys and these are values keys value key and then value that terminology is very important to know okay please avoid yourself if you ever catch yourself saying oh yeah it's just those squiggly things and then it's something with the colon thingy and then there's a thing need to the left of the colon thingy don't do that cuz yeah you might understand it but if you're trying to look it up or trying to explain it to somebody else or you're trying to like learn it later and you want to research it you're not going to be able to find it so really understand the terminology it's so important it's so important so remember this is a dictionary anything that has those squiggly things around it the first thing is a key and then the second thing after the colon is a value what now not everything that starts with a squiggly is a dictionary there are certain things called sets but we'll get to that later for now anything with squigglies and colons that's a dictionary all right let's keep moving on okay so you see residents of sloth you get back hundred and five residents of Burmese python you get one hundred and six new entries so they want us to make a new entry in our dictionary so let's say that we go back to like our phone number example well what if we want to add somebody in so again we come to your phone right and you just made a new friend hooray now you want to get their phone number and put it in your phone how do you do that well you know that's pretty simple go to contacts put it in but in the backend in the programming way what's happening is you're actually inserting something into the dictionary so later it can be looked up very easily so what we do let's say we made a new friend named not very creative names mi Johnny okay and now we want to put Johnny into our phone book so we'll say phone book Johnny and we're going to set this equal to the value 4 5 3 area codes 4 5 3 I don't know where that is in the planet okay so that's what it is and now if we print out the phone book you will see that you'll find John in there so the first thing we did is we got Bob's number right that we already know that now we added in Johnny right here and you can see this dictionary now we have Johnny so as soon as you add that contact information in your adding Johnny in there ok that's your key and you add Johnny in there now when you want to look up Johnny's value which is the phone number so when you want to look up Johnny's phone number you effectively do that's all you have to do okay and that looks up Johnny's phone number and you got it right there 4 5 3 2 3 4 2 3 4 5 ok so this is all related stuff right it's all related add at least three more key value pairs to the menu variable so we're going to add three more key value pairs cool so menu cool this is kind of like our example that we were doing with a restaurant right let's add grilled salmon I like grilled salmon is equal to and we have to put a price okay so here the key is grilled salmon and its value is the price so we're going to say it's 25 bucks let's add I don't know skirt steak and make that value 50 bucks my friend just told me today that there's a great skirt steak place that he wanted to go with me and it's 50 bucks there so it's a little expensive and we're gonna say soup right and soup is probably not that expensive so you can say 925 and let's do black bean soup cuz that's protein and that should be good right so we got skirt steak we got chicken alfredo which is what they put in earlier you can see them using the trick with the dictionary and it's key to get back the value 14.5 then they did there are four items on the menu so how they did that is that that there are then they did shrink concatenation with the plus sign and they got the length of the menu so you can call the Len function on a dictionary that gave them back a four because they added the first item right here chicken alfredo then we added three more items on line six seven and eight so we have had four items in the dictionary so calling Len on this dictionary called the menu translated this into a four but four is an integer so you can't concatenate that with a string so you have to call the string function on that which effectively turned it into a four like that okay and then this string got put together and it says there are four items on the menu and then it said print menu so that's just simple said print the dictionary we got skirt steak 50 bucks chicken alfredo 14.5 black bean soup grilled salmon and we are done okay let's see how far we are new entries this video is getting a little longer so I'm going to end it right here great job you guys for making it this far I will see you in the next video all right take care bye
