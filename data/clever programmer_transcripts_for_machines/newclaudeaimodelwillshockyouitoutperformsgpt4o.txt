Sonet versus Chad gp4 who is going to win we came across an amazing video by Ai sech and we were going to do one on our own but his video is so good honestly that I'm just excited to watch it myself for the first time along with Nas and that we just want to react to it let's [ __ ] go let's go baby so this is a video by AI search on Claude 3.5 this new AI destroys GPT this is a brand new model that Claude released all right can it create a 3D first shoter oh wait what the [ __ ] let's try to make this let's do it okay so I'm trying to make a tic tac toe game but it's not allowing me to do that in Claude but I bet we can make cuz I want to be able to code within here yeah which would be sick and I think I heard something called artifacts so I think we have to go enable it so I'm going to click thing feature preview uhhuh yo okay so let's check that out we did do our research beforehand there we go all right so artifacts are on so now so try to say like in JavaScript cuz probably I'm not sure if we can do it in Python so no create a new create a new I have to create a new chat you think I think so yes okay so let's start a new chat build a tic tactoe game yep enter please go um should be on the right hand side no like how that guy has let's go dude that's so sick that's wild how does it just know oh what the [ __ ] this is so lit that's sick what the [ __ ] okay come on [ __ ] I'm going to beat your ass here all right go for it all right go uh go go go go go oh come on you little come on oh sick yes damn it all right all right oh yeah not it's not going to happen huh yeah no I think you got me [ __ ] [ __ ] let's go oh that makes me so happy oh that's so funny all right okay so what about pack okay make me pack my dude not having to code and it doing it is actually a l right this is pretty it does in Python and can you ask me to do it in JavaScript it is Javascript no this oh this is oh [ __ ] I don't have I don't have my glasses on I don't know how I don't know how I did the last one dude oh my God bro what the heck dude use arrow keys and it just like Works dude and it's really good and it even has a score and the score is really good too what the hell by the way you're not paused right no no no no it's gone oh thank God yeah yeah I know I know oh oh can you ask it ask it to add um enemies enemies add enemies no dude it will not get that there's no way it will get that dude dude I'm like a little kid I'm so excited there's look how fast it is too this shit's on GPT 40 dude I mean yeah especially with like ability to write such strong code where it just work and then just run it and it runs it so quickly it runs it faster than [ __ ] running an nextjs application and waiting for compile even to do yarn Dev and all that yeah I agree how whoa no I mean yeah it's it's there oh oh these guys are scary as [ __ ] oh dude oh they're going oh oh oh they see me they actually can see me you think so yes that's why they attract they get attracted right when I come so like when I'm near enough it gets attracted to me if you're not near enough then oh oh this guy is going look yeah this guy is on game over I can't move anymore dude this is this is next level about can it add sounds can you add sounds oh can we do you think it has sounds I don't know let's see if it does actually super curious to see if it has sounds yeah enemies and sound click to open component it's it's it's in down the right corner there this is so fun coding bro look uh the Git You Know G reposit uh control so you can actually go back to the previous version and the version before that and what happens when I download oh downloads the code the file oh that is so cool and can put it into actual app so this is version two is it playing and this is version three I don't hear anything oh you can hear it oh it broke did it break I heard it I heard it yeah it it something happened let's open it again dude that's so cool dude this is mindblowing dude we need to I lost oh that was so cool so if I can go to so I can go version two and I can just instantly be playing version two and version one and it's just running like it just is so not only am I able to go you know like nobody ever checks out the previous and they have to check out then you have to do like compile this is just running dude this is adding a new dimension of excitement for me for coding building Le learning coding through this would be so much fun I feel like yeah I mean this is like my brother can now code you know like everybody can code they were so [ __ ] developers excited dude [ __ ] developers um this is exciting actually wow okay so let's pause this how do you pause it refresh okay so download file what does that does it gives me the TSX file file wait text oh text file oh TSX file oh it's a typescript file no that's a react typescript file yeah okay what kind of code does it actually have can I look at the code for a second what the [ __ ] is it saying here look look at that here's are The Crazy Ones the Rebels the troublemakers the round pegs and the square holes the ones who see things different that's your script dude no this is not mine this is uh this is uh Steve Jobs uh this is Steve Jobs speech what the hell that's kind of funny why do they have yeah why is it in here can you open in notes or VI code code or cursor that is funny what is that yo why is it I don't see none here yeah yeah but why is it there what the hell oh is this is this a Mac thing is it like a Easter egg or something dude I think it's a Mac thing which is like if if I can't display the actual it just does this maybe a new OS they give homage too dude that's actually a lit Steve Jobs that is f fascinating he's [ __ ] in our computer um okay so great so I can copy so code and then there's the code is actually it's a react code can I look at the actual code mhm dude this is a react code they're actually running react in the back end yeah they're running something the [ __ ] how this is react in the back end yeah that is weird like to run a react application and deploy that fast so then I can like okay so build a app where every time I hit the button it increments a d you can you're going to have to give it some some harder [ __ ] to do no I know but I'm just seeing like cuz then we can just straight up be building react components in here we don't even have to run react code on our own Compu see right away oh my God bro this is like can you ask it to use Tailwind CSS and see how that looks like use Tailwind CSS and it's so fast too and look at its styling too it styling is way better than how the other GPT stuff yeah very clean oh my god with drop shadows and everything bro my UI problems are gone forever dude finally dude I don't have to [Laughter] um make it dark theme oh no way and then we got versions on that you think it's going to make it happen so not only that but we can go so we have different wow dude artifacts is so clean it's like different coding projects so if I go in tictactoe the tictactoe is its own game preview yeah and it knows if I go to simple PacMan it has its own Version Control right here and it's own code and the game and then if I go to simp clot is oh my God that looks God that's beautiful CLA is way too lit guys add sounds for increment and decrements and add decrements GPT for all you need to speaked your [ __ ] up wow this is sick it's doing something with sound inside of react so I'm seeing gain node oscillator let's see how does it have the length of those sounds is a question I don't know and why is it blurry like that I'm curious I have no idea kind of weird wow you can build so much so something about so there's some I wonder how it's creating sound I Don't Know audio and it's but look at this oscillator it's like an oscillator or something also that type sign MH so I feel like you know how for example you can create animations CSS animations that are like exponential ramp to value at time interesting I think it's actually defining like an actual sound like you know how you can define an animation CSS yeah yeah yeah it's defining an actual sound and how the sound is working yeah which is sick that is really interesting this is an oscillator function and then it uses the oscillation cuz obviously it does not like scroll up does it import anything no nothing nothing everything is is it able to import stuff ask it can you uh import a library a sound Library can you use a sound Library let's see if we can do that like can it use howler DJs oh there you go oh D dud just read your mind no no no no no no no ah but then you still need you see it's trying to hit placeholder yeah so no I don't I mean I don't think so but yeah who the [ __ ] knows yeah no no no no no dude it the errors it gives you are so um friendly as well look at the error is super friendly wow this is better than [ __ ] next sh yes errors yeah they looks so friendly ask it this I mean this could be crazy ask it um make this component work in react flow um well because it doesn't have access to libraries so we just saw like we just saw right it didn't do howler because it doesn't have access to the library won ACC there no ability at all yeah so it won't have access to library that's why it's like trying to write it from scratch oh I see that's unfortunate that would be cool if it did though yeah that would be really cool I mean I'm sure they'll start to add that over yeah but they're just trying to do it where like they don't have any dependencies and everything it makes sense cuz like installing all these dependencies themselves is just such a crazy task and keeping all that in check and keeping that updated is such a crazy task too all right let's continue with the video let's go dude three we're 3 seconds in 3 seconds and this is like 36 minutes left yeah person shooter oh my God oh my God can it create a 3D interactive particle Cloud oh my God yeah all those things are actually great um I wonder so that makes me like can I create a um build a pong game um I'm sure that that will be super easy for it to do um because when he said particle I just thought like you know something that can have gravity and things like that what if we build oh what about like a Tetris game dude you know how I wanted to see what what would happen if my mom I and an elephant fell plane yeah first let's actually [ __ ] do that here dude let's animate that yeah holy [ __ ] holy smokes oh dude I bet we could build a chest game too oh dude let's play against each other come on you think it works oh I'm winning dude oh what the [ __ ] I have 55 points get wrecked oh [ __ ] you oh what the [ __ ] [ __ ] why are you winning dude oh bit oh get [ __ ] on I don't know get [ __ ] on I don't know why I put like oh oh oh oh what what now can you hold on one second I don't know why it put on like um 100 Balls or like 5 spe like look at the speed mode on here dude it's going insane um this is way too fun guys oh yeah okay so if so I want to see a physics thing where if me my mom um I'm 63 mhm no wasn't listening um 140 lb and my mom is 51 and 50 lb uh and an elephant jumped out of an airplane who would fall first okay let's see I'm curious what it says Ah it says I cannot provide an accurate physics simulation for that scenario as it involves potentially harmful situations okay let's create a oh there we go feather ball and an anvil oh see I don't really believe that's going to be true man uh you have to add friction so like but this is cool I can actually learn physics for the first time sit here and figured this [ __ ] out can you add like ask it to add wind friction like actual wind and air friction um we're not physicists so wind friction and air friction might be the same thing but who cares because the thing is yeah because that's going to be that's going to make it different whoa the thing is I think it's also the gravity air density drag coefficient pixels per met beautiful yeah there we go and then now we should be able to see it potentially cuz I think that is a big factor who do you think will win who do you think will win oh no no before we do it actually oh dude you can select the win speed look you can actually drag it oh that's funny that's so my guess would be the heaviest thing so the Anvil in this case my guess the Anvil you think the Anvil will be the one to actually win yeah you guys drop your thoughts down belows you would win I think the thing that has the least amount of friction will win I wish I knew what the width of these these guys are the biggest one is Anvil ball is middle and feather so feather ball and Anvil which one do you think will win I think think ball will win okay the [ __ ] okay that simulation is broken it definitely broke interesting tell it that it's broken uh I think I understand this point let's hold on let's see simulation is broken when I click Start It All vanishes and so let's see if it can de bug and how it debugs yeah yeah let's see okay so it's debugging ouch and in the meantime I want to be seeing Oh my God all right can it convert this very boring financial report into an oh so we will'll be able to look at our taxes in a fun way yeah I'll be like hey make my taxes look fun make it Mak it into a game okay let's see simulation oh see I [ __ ] knew it dude it's not oh oh what the [ __ ] yeah with more wind yeah bro still the heav I'm telling you no but actually kind of the same ball drops ball and the Anvil is the same dude Anvil drops just a little bit first I think yeah I could be wrong but we could slowmo but I I'm pretty sure Anvil's dropping first uhuh I don't know yeah Anvil drops first it's the same and then the ball drops reduce the wind speed reduce the wind speed to reduce the wind speed well wind speed reduce everything's going to fall at the same time I think no yeah animal drops like 0.1 MC earlier huh yeah yeah um interesting I could be wrong but we could watch it in slowmo afterwards may you guys can watch in slowmo and tell us um but yeah this is active infographic oh my god wow that looks so good can it create an audio visualizer that would syn with any so okay so it that works and then apparently you can have it make UI that looks really good too so let's actually find UI so I'll just say hey build this UI so I'll go here and I'll say uh build this with react in tell and CSS with the Tailwind CSS and let's just see what it does God this is exciting because then um front end will just go so next level like versel zero won't even come close dude versel is not close even to this at all v0 thing this will even be better than v0 you want to show them v0 by the way while it's loading just so they know um yeah I think just to give them contest I feel like a l might Dev so this is the versel one and this is where you can kind of add in like something with AI and then it'll build it out for you yeah um kind of like this just still not bad it's just not good dude that is really good dude that is really good and keep in mind it's like not using any libraries and anything like that it's like writing it with Tailwind you know but like but how does it have a tailin CS but how does it have Tailwind CSS library though um you think some already prebuilt actually right good question right yeah look yeah it it has access to Tailwind they've given it access to Tailwind or something maybe themselves yeah I don't know that's crazy huh that is crazy I bet they're even built on Tailwind no or you don't think so I don't know oh wow their page you can't read it at all no it's ass their page you cannot read it at all h what is that oh this it just runs horizontally dude my God I think it is T CSS though I saw it um but it looks overall pretty damn good especially if you imagine images here these buttons to be more like inside of it wow and they even got the text 30 years of sales it got the text correctly it got the names of the people correctly the channels it didn't get the images but it got everything else correctly yeah I want to see if I can get give it an IM what if do you think I can give it an image and it could pop that in there like if I gave it an image myself yes interesting okay so let's try that so let's take uh like right click an image and image from our computer and see if we can give it that so I'll just say oh actually the could be that so I'm giving it this image right here that we had made and let's say use this oh wow that's funny image and pop oh wow it's even better now as uh okay let's I don't know if it could do that cuz it would have to host it but I guess it's already hosting I'm confused I mean it is hosting it somewhere yeah but let's see if it allows but it if it allows its own thing to serve it as to actually serve it I agree that would be really cool yeah it's like slow down a little bit it feels like to me no no placeholder no it's not using this let's see but um we can give it a linki image thumbnail yeah I think I mean if we gave it for sure I think if we gave it something like this uh it would pull that like put that in there uh use this image oh wait hold on this is not a normal image yeah go to like a link let's go to this how can we get a normal maybe just go to MGR and find something oh nice yeah great place for YouTube we don't have to so let's actually find this image I'll grab the direct link of this so if I open it it should open there beautiful so let's actually go use this image there we go so I mean that I think should work um because it's a link yeah I think it should work wow this is so cool I love like coding in here it's so much fun right I don't yeah because the only reason I even code on my computer yeah is just so I can paste the code that I got from Claude I've never dude it's been so long since I've written a [ __ ] single line of code so that's the only reason I code on my own computer is so I could paste this thing did it work no no [ __ ] really why that was a direct image so that should have worked I no actually it's not them CU it's still image you are n this is like a direct image is not working so sad okay I'll try one last time but then we should just move on but still really freaking cool that it does all this if I look at the code is it popping it in anywhere yes it is like like imagine that for developers who are right oh it could be like due to image Network issue like restrictions or image hosting restrictions or something on their back cor's issues yeah [ __ ] hate cor's issues yeah all the damn time it's always issues wonder I wonder if it can hit API requests I don't think so like uh placey holder oh like dice API like can it hit a API so uh oh what happened here cool okay so let's see if it could hit um make a UI where when I press a button it hits this API and gets me so let's see so like what does it get by the way gets a bunch of stuff including title so it just gets me back like and then spits back the Json and I think it to tell it what the response is on that's okay it just spits back the response that's fine so let's see if it could do that because that would be really cool if it can hit apis yeah then that gives us access that opens up a lot of what we can do actually that is true I am very excited to see if I could do that okay interesting fetch post users and comments knows about this so good so let's see nice no failed okay let's look at the code pi and then the and you see this the end point uh don't make it Dynamic for the end point um for the end point it's so hot in this house for the end point you can just use to do like this okay so let's see if it does that okay so let's see if this is going to work um no let's see the code like look for any place I don't see any placeholder so this should potentially work no I don't know why I'll look into this but this would be really cool if API yeah work yeah I don't know if they work maybe so a jump right in so I can what cool and so yeah that's very interesting so on benchmarks it seems like it beats uh Claude three and GP gradual level reasoning this is zero shot Chain of Thought and so it will outperform gp4 and uh Opus 2o I mean I thought opus was better than gp4 in most categories but um yeah that's kind of surprising for me so just so you guys know what zero shot means can you zo me on me for a second can you just so you guys know what zero shot means because I did not know this myself zero shot means zero examples so like one shot is one example two shot is like two examples so zero shot means like they give you no examples of like here's what the result should be or it could look like and the AI has to figure it out by itself and be creative uh as possible by itself and this something I learned from you actually yeah um so yeah so it's got zero shot so and then undergraduate level knowledge apparently Claude is just as good as gp4 interesting code it beats Claude and gp4 yeah multilingual math um okay I don't know that don't even know what that is um reasoning over text so claw I mean dude this is such [ __ ] like claude's reasoning was always superior I don't know what the [ __ ] these things are but like Claude always just destroyed in my opinion GPT 4 yeah um so I'm not I don't agree with any of these like for claws I don't agree with any of this but this compared to the others I guess makes sense I have to use Sonic more I'm really curious actually how they test these things yeah I don't know like is there like a standardized test like a [ __ ] act or sat is is it like is it is a result given by multiple humans because if it's given by multiple humans um then multiple humans what they take into account is um how fast something responds so one of the reasons I saw GPT 4 was scoring high on a lot of things is simply because even if it was a little inaccurate it was so much faster that the satisfaction rate of humans who were using it was way higher so it had actually a higher they give uh these Bots ELO ratings there's actually a website MH um um llm leaderboard uh ELO there's a website for this yeah CIS llm CIS and inside of this they have ratings like literally like a chess rating for each of the Bots and so in here you can see at any given time like which bot the people have voted and how good it is so here you can see gp4 has an arena score of 1287 mhm Sonet is 1271 so a lot of the people on this platform 18,000 votes to 51,000 votes so out of those votes they basically said that they're more satisfied with gp4 than Sonic so GPT 40 is still better in that aspect but also GPT 40 does have more votes so what does that mean um that usually means that that's harder to rate higher if you have because it's easier to have a higher rating with less votes so it actually has more votes so people are more overall satisfied with gp4 so it means like a lot of people are still using it pretty heavily um and keep in mind a lot of apis still use it a lot um and so Sonet yeah I still have to use it more but a couple of other interesting things so sonnet's cut off actually is um March April April oh that's pretty good actually year so they might even know about things like versals AISD K and stuff like that ask it let's ask it actually um okay so you use versel as DC to make um a chat route for a chat for a dummy chat between end point gp4 use gp4 o uh what GPT four four Okay cool so let's see if it can do that so this if it does that that means it's it's true that it's cut off is pretty high um actually uh oh wait no it does dude AI use chat react from use chat AI react it's not going to be working that is beautiful huh but then look messes content that's exactly it dude that's yes that's good [ __ ] knows it it knows it whereas I think GPT struggles with that wow that's insane um fantastic amazing so where were we yeah so this is a platform you can go and check things out so let's go back to the video um and in the video yeah so I don't know how this testing is done if it's with people or if it's would like machines score it mhm and then yeah then I don't know some other scores but son is apparently better in everything you can do with it and also test out it in the description to generate presentations and designs and there you go artifact tables and code prompt none of so he basically creates a snake game that's a very interesting oh that's sick that's sick I like that why is he running it on his own computer I know oh no he probably has it oh no he probably took the code oh audio visualizer that is so cool actually yes that's a sick idea I want to try that one so audio visualizer um I think he's he makes that he makes that in so he actually was even using this exact image so let's try that and I'll take take this and we'll put that in here and we'll go here and we'll go like this and we'll say make an audio visualiz visualizer like this uh and play some sounds too so let's see if that works but that is really freaking cool yeah we might not be able to actually do it on here because we we need an audio to actually no I know but I'm saying that for sounds if it just does the yeah gain oscillator thing ah okay try to use builtin sounds with like the gain SL oscillator because you don't have access libraries hit play yeah there's nothing to play yeah and it's not doing that image either yet the way would you would be able to do it is we have to take this code into actual react application and then I'm sure we'll be able to make it happen for sure but here I'm saying don't use any Library so I think this I feel like might be more promising try whoa that's SI though look at that so and then you can change the frequency and it actually visually changes with the frequency look at that that sounds like a plane dude whoa and so when I move it watch how it moves you can visualize the frequency that's so sick oh my God I love this dude so yeah that is amazing so it's like already working as a react component yeah and then if we bring that in and we change it with actual music inside of vs code that would work well work yes I'm going to take a screenshot of that just make coding so much easier like imagine if a developer gets a design from figma mhm from a designer and he's like just takes a screenshot or he just [ __ ] exports as a screenshot and boom drops in into clot on it gets the code creates a component in his app boom it's there like so cool the component would be working already right right there just from the design and then you're like hey look it works and then I imagine like for example the cursor e IDE imagine that is able to actually is integrated with that too then it just fully creates it for you in cursor ID yeah yeah I mean eventually you're right you you'll get access to Sonet and within the cursor ID you'll even be able to play the component inside of the UI that's sick the inside of the chat UI that would be so sick interesting okay any other things that are interesting here so the sensitivity I'm going to wait what the [ __ ] oh what the hey how does oh choose file dude that's what we should do that is sick dude let's add that in so let's add a choose file to add an ability to choose file that is so cool oh then we can get a let's get a sound from like EP epidemic sound or like a copyright free song yeah I'll try to find um do you have a song I probably have something with MP3 in my Mac Wow name contains MP3 no no definitely no the hell is that no nope about to get banned completely oh what about our own song The do you have our own song that we made inside the JavaScript and react [ __ ] the yeah road map yeah the road map song uh let's see if I have it on the computer like I should but I might not 2024 let's see file choose file oh MP4 the hell let's see if we can do a oh there's an MP3 right there dude oh hell yeah yeah dude now hit play it says right there ah oh nothing damn damn it's not playing the song can you make it work with an MP3 file dude this will be so interesting if it does and then it should just play that mp35 audio okay let's give it a try fingers crossed that's cool I'm so I'm so curious actually like I love this kind of stuff it's just so quick and yeah good yeah state is supended that was a genius idea yeah local files yeah you could do local files I totally didn't think about that I could build so many local apps like that and the UI is so [ __ ] good it's aan UI yeah look even the play button is not work until you actually probably get an MP3 you know yeah a road map you searched road map before uhhuh and then that one yeah okay H oh no come on interesting I how the heck okay I'll I'll keep sitting here and debugging it for eternity but let's go through with the video how he did it and this is really ah he did customizable audio uh visualizer HTML page so turn this into a basic HTML page with an audio visualizer for local MP3 files wo look at that beautiful clean wow professional prompter right here super professional prompter so I think maybe with vanilla HTML it might work better yeah um hopefully let's see that's the only difference that I saw that that yeah gentleman did a I search okay let's try yeah the uglier the better preferably yeah when it's ugly you know it'll work come on broken broken now okay all right let's keep going with the video so audio visualizer is a fantastic idea copying a website design is good idea Tetris yes I was really surprised that the dude was able to make a Shooter 3D that is crazy dude that I did not know so um make a 3D racing game racing game yes please oh yes please 3D or 2D 3D okay let's see dude that'd be so cool I'm so I love racing games holy [ __ ] you guys have no idea okay let's give it a try we should get a racing game on our Xbox oh yes please that would be a lot of fun I will [ __ ] on you hell yeah let's go bro I'm excited um okay let's see oh dude that's exciting oh what the hell oh is it going wait it works actually is it actually use erors to control the car it's [ __ ] working dude and look it gets faster and faster it like accelerates and you like turn what if I fall off oh drifting here try damn let see hold up oh oh wait wait wait wait wait wait can I go at the same time wait wait wait come on the car starts getting faster oh oh oh oh look cuz I have to yeah but then it doesn't go fast yeah you have to like hold it's like a balance you got to like you got to like get the right angle and then just see go as far as you can oh that's lit and then you got to get make it a straight line just be like make it into a straight line please like straight line with ob make the track a straight line dude this is so cool this is the first time I'll actually start making games that is so fun and uh if we made 2D we could make it like two player as well oh that would be awesome I like those tapping games where we you see who can tap faster oh yes and we play two players and we play that against each other we we can actually make that game on here dude [ __ ] make a t game and then [ __ ] yeah okay let's see what happens here okay oh that's cool okay all right you want to take off let's go let's see how fast you can go oh how do I know how fast I'm going uh you're making progress for sure um will the track ever end yeah it does right there see I'm I'm I'm almost at the end oh oh oh look look look dude maybe the Earth is flat too maybe the Earth is like this the Earth is flat you eventually just get whoever told you the Earth is round does not know what they're talking about maybe you eventually get to a part like this look I can turn look oh uturn uturns five five point turn wow dude amazing okay this is absolutely awesome imagine if you keep garbage so slide two slide three how cool that is very nice infographic report yeah we talked about that yeah oh yeah turning your reports into interact oh this is beautiful like your taxes like taxes or like sales like if we have a uh sales revenue and then we want to look at like last week how many sales we made for our SAS products yeah we can look at that that'd be cool um taxes for sure uh okay ooh nice so building a neural network animation so for for I feel like for animations it's so good because you can visualize so many things right within here and because for for a lot of animations you don't need a lot of libraries you can just use a normal JavaScript stuff and like CSS you know yes so that's why that's also really good it's so good cuz it could just build it with regular Basics uh HTML and all that yeah um so okay so cost is on the right Axis bro so Sonet is way cheaper so way higher intelligence and way cheaper oh really yeah you see where's I mean it's on it's still not cheaper than gp40 gp40 is the cheapest I didn't say gp4 I said Claud yeah yeah I know I know I'm saying in my head I'm like cuz in my head I was right away comparing it to GPT 40 and I was like damn I wish it was even more cheaper than gp40 sure yeah of course that would be amazing uh but yeah it's way better than gp4 so it makes sense to me for it to be more expensive yeah but like I'm really happy that it's way cheaper than Opus like it's almost in the middle between Haiku and Opus cuz yeah our cost if we switch to Opus we won't get destroyed yeah how we were going to get destroyed earlier yeah so yeah overall this is absolutely amazing and then what is this specs of claw what did you say I'm saying what a model what a beautiful model this is a gorgeous model so um that was awesome to take a look at and that brings us to our sponsor for the video hey ourselves yes so if you want to actually use a visual version haha if you want to use a visual version of Chad GPT um kind of like using Claude but more visually speaking uh you can do that and you can even for example take this AI search video copy the link paste it in here you can grab that video open up this chat bad boy connect it and just go uh key takeaways from this video and check this out oh it actually gives you them right away yeah uh what comparisons does he use mhm and it show you uh what comparisons he use what games does he make and he'll tell you that that he makes a snake game a Tetris game and a 3D first person shooter amazing um and yeah that Claude takeaways right Sonet 3.5 is a powerful AI model mhm versatility can create games visualizations presentations and more outperforms previous models and there's a free access with higher limits yeah but the powerful thing here is that it's not just about talking to one YouTube video it's about actually talking to either multiple YouTube videos or multiple sources so you can have multiple YouTube videos on a specific topic that you're trying to learn so maybe you're trying to learn coding maybe you're trying to learn how to use for example a specific LM model in this video let's say for example you want to take multiple people's video because you don't want to trust just one source of getting your information on Claud versus GPT so you can actually combine both of these videos and you can go based on uh let's actually let's create a new chat let's just go based on both of these videos what are all key yeah what are the benefits M of Sonet CLA 3.5 versus GPT 40 and that's it and let's just see yeah so apparently coding proficiency it operates faster than four I did not know that more cost effective for complex T tasks yeah artifacts feature which was a amazing feature that we saw a great feature yes shitty name I'll be honest yeah it does not Mak any sense I agree like what what yeah I mean I can't think of a better name at the top of my head but definitely should have a better name yeah higher benchmarks in everything yep interactive visualizations data analysis so like now you're getting the information from two of these videos now what if there was um so gp4 o versus Sonet uh Sonet right yeah now let's see what if we have um something like oh I don't know if you want to use right this or let's say we have an article hacker noon article sure great okay so we take this hacker noon article and Weck news oh oh hacker noon Oh I thought it was sucker news for some reason yeah so let's say we take that hacker noon article I'm going to click this website paste it in here here pop that bad boy in and now we'll give it a couple of seconds okay here we go so it not only read through the article but it also changed the title of it at the top so you can actually see that uh and I'll pop that in here and uh let's just say let's ask it like I'm going to create a new chat and I'm just going to ask it like what does the uh article on Claude gp4 un haacker noon say okay and so let's take a look at that y so it says these are the key things 2x speed so let's go here does it actually say that literally in the article it says to wow yes and so it's pulling it from the article so now you have all three of these sources so you know you're much more likely to get the real piece of information that you're looking for and imagine how faster you can learn now and how faster you can do research now may that be for your research paper may that be for your class you name it that this can be used across so many YouTube videos and
