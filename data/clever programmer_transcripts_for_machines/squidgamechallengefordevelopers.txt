are you looking to get a job as a developer well guess what we're taking five people this month and helping them get placed as a software developer but here's the catch I have a challenge for you that you need to solve welcome to the squid game for developers challenge all these people you see over here some of them have passed but a lot of these people have been eliminated so for example we had Luis Menendez who's a lead frontend engineer applied to this from three pillar Global we've had narcissus Marin cat who's a CTO at hereology participate in the squid games challenge we have had Muhammad sad Mateen apply to this who's a lead developer at solution founder information Technologies so whether you're a complete beginner or you're more advanced this challenge is for you now we've tried to make this challenge as doable as possible for you so it's going to prove that you have skill and this challenge will show that you are somebody who can either get their first job or if you're more intermediate or Advanced you should be able to kind of Breeze through it quicker so we're judging people on the relying into this program is can you actually communicate and share your ideas and thoughts as you're solving the coding problem are you somebody who has the coding skills you have resourcefulness are you googling and stack overflowing stuff as necessary to solve the problem and the test and the challenge that we're going to give you you can use all of those things we don't want to make it a whiteboard nerdy you're sitting behind a desk and trying to solve something because I don't think it does a good job of telling you whether you're the right person or not we're looking for Builders if you have the ambition to build and that excites you we're looking for you we have our own unique process that we're using to qualify developers one is going to be really fun two it's gonna be something that allows you to build and show off your skills in Google and try everything whereas in other places you can't Google stuff and they don't allow you to stack Overflow and this and they'll look down upon it and that's no developer develops like that 90 of coding is research and 10 is actually sitting there and writing code in any real software developer will actually tell you that you might be able to to build something but you might not be able to solve a recursive Fibonacci solution now for the challenge you're going to start with a JavaScript algorithms warm up so it's going to be a couple of JavaScript algo questions so we're keeping that stuff pretty simple so as long as you know some JavaScript you'll be good promise you we're not reversing any linked lists here second we're going to give you some frontend challenges which means you're going to be building somewhat of an app and you're going to be figuring it out because again we're trying to curate a community of builders that is the ultimate goal as well of this so one of course we can help you get a job but two so all of the builders are in one place together you might found the SAS tomorrow you might actually build apps tomorrow together who knows or you might just build amazing relationships with other people and other developers who are Builders and love building but only once you pass the trial of fire the test that finds out who you are and finds out if you're a real developer or not all right now you've heard everything there is to hear at this point all you have to do is put your name email phone number and you're pretty much ready to get started you're gonna click that button to go now if you're wondering and you've been wondering what that timer above this video is that's how much time you have left for this challenge once that timer runs out you'll never see this challenge again good luck
