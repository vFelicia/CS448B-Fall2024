hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com um today I wanted to talk to you guys about college this is for college students this could be very very helpful to you and it could potentially save your grade save you from dropping out of University or save you from some really crazy stuff so let me share my experience with you I had had a tremendously tough last two weeks it had to do with a lot of family stuff that was going on and it had a tremendous impact on my college uh for those of you guys who don't know I am a fulltime college student at the University of Illinois at the University of Chicago UIC um and essentially I was you know I kind of missed all the last two weeks so it had a lot of the big final projects and you know I ended up just getting zeros on those and it had some finals in there and I missed some of those and I was in a lot of trouble and I was pretty much at the point where I was like okay if I have to withdraw from the University or get an in you know um what's it called just withdraw that you know I I would kind of have to do that or or fail my courses and I was um I was beginning to accept that as a reality but then I discovered something pretty amazing and this is something I didn't know and maybe a lot of you guys don't know so I want to share this with you um even if you're not in college it's good if you know this because you can share it with somebody who does go to college this is something it's called incomplete okay so if you are a college student and you've had some crazy circumstances happen to you you can at the end of the semester sign up or fill out a form for incomplete uh some teachers will allow you to do that and what that essentially means is they will make a deal with you where they give you an extended amount of time to cover your material it could they give you up to a year but you could do it less than that you could do it the next day uh there is a little bit of a procedure but they'll help you out your counselor will help you out but it could potentially SA save you from a failing grade affecting your FAFSA or your financial aid affecting your next semester uh and a lot of people I know you know they once they think they're failing like me they won't even try to pursue and do something better they they they'll sometimes give up because of the bureaucratic system and you have to jump through a lot of Hoops and when I have to do that I'm just like whatever like sometimes when I get a ticket and there's so much stuff I have to do just to contest it I would just rather pay it off because I don't want to deal with the trouble of contesting it just like that I know a lot of college students who don't want to go through the hoops and so they just won't even do it but I'm telling you if you sign up for incomplete and a lot of teachers will let you do that it can save your grade if you are in some kind of trouble in the last few weeks or whatever okay so don't give up hope uh that's it guys uh just wanted to share a short important message with you guys uh thank you guys for watching take care I love every single one of you I'll see you in the next video oh and also uh check out some recent videos check out some tutorials make sure to subscribe and all that I got to say that all right take care bye
