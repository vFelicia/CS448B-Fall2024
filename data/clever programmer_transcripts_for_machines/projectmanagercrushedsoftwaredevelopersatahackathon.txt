here's a tweet by amjed mad the founder of repet it's a valuation of this company is at a billion dollars and he wrote this tweet at hackathon where a winner is a nontechnical product manager and her work powered by repet plus AI is more technically impressive than teams of Engineers was surprised at first but it struck me that PMS must be exceptional prompting after all that is their job this is happening this is the truth this is the reality the person that W is not technical do you understand that so either you can go into coping mechanism and regress and die off after a couple of years get replaced by these product managers who will output five times you don't need you we'll do it for sense and you'll be sitting there broke and useless or on the other side you can learn how to use these tools so you can learn to be dis effective she made this happen because she could prompt engineer it and she knew the vision of the project and then she worked with AI to make it a reality and that's where we're headed where ideas are being translated into programs so that's all I'm saying
