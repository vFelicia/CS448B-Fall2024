oh what is up guys how's it going this is kazzy here from cleverprogrammer.com today i am here with your boy papa react how's it going guys welcome back to day three of react native build so this is gonna be fun and we're going to be building on top of what we've already done so exciting stuff and we've got a new computer running so everything should be silky smooth right quasi that's right so this is going to be amazing because we have an imac pro and it's brand new so we're going to be installing all of the things with you today whether it's expo or node whatever we need to make this thing work we're going to be kind of installing that with you so that way you can actually keep up with us exactly and we're working on react native today as well and we're going to continue building our react native application the income tracker that we were actually building a few days ago exactly so really fun stuff we're going to be touching on things like expo uh today the main feature is going to be around react navigation so react native navigation so how you can navigate between stacks is something i did a long time ago but i don't remember how to do it so it's going to be fun going ahead and learning that together again um building that with kazi um so yeah in fact uh also welcome guys uh mohammed humza says i love these build videos but i think reactive typescript will also be good 100 we can go ahead and we will be covering typescript at some point as well yeah um yeah everything guys we'll pretty much eventually get around to everything beautiful all right with that said let's jump right into it so in order to run this app sonny on this computer um i believe that we're gonna need to install the expo cli is that right that's right so expo cli is gonna allow us to run so if you guys don't know what expo is um it's basically i mean what's the best way of explaining expo it's like a way to run the react native app yeah it just makes it easier to run the react react native apps instead of needing so many different things like um even xcode honestly i don't think you need xcode right to make this work i don't think so i don't think so in fact we can we'll check it now and also massive uh super chat from gabriel graves good to see you dude oh she said thank you for the donation dude gabriel gabe uh gabriel graves always coming in making our day dude thank you so much for that ten dollar donation let's go thank you dude amazing where am i extremely great content appreciate that dude ah beautiful here are my air horns when i need them boom holy [ __ ] that blew up my ears actually a little bit especially with these headphones they actually blows the arrow ouch that hurt all right cool so dope let's get into it so now i also need npm yes so we're gonna have to install node all right cool get npm oh is that how you do it i usually do it with just uh go to node website download that little link there which one this one download node.js and npm right here yeah that's one from the node website once you install node it comes with npm i'm gonna go with the current one man i want the one the newest fanciest one this part can actually be great on how to install node js on your computer so maybe if somebody wants to clip it yeah you go ahead and like you can drop the time time stamps in the in the comments and i'll help everyone else that we can clip that from the you can actually message uh david or a monit if you want they can clip this moment okay all right cool so that is now installed beautiful let's see all right npm oh nice it looks like it found it let's do it awesome install expo it's working nice also guys you can notice that the command line right now looks kind of ugly right like it's got all this extra stuff going on uh we're gonna install a really handy tool called oh my zsh yes i love this tool it is the best i hate not having it when i get a new computer same every time i started a new job or something and they gave me a laptop i would always straight away oh my zsh and you literally just copy that command chuck it in the terminal and that's it it literally run and okay so this is saying uh rejected so because you're doing a global install aren't you so you might have to use sudo yeah there we go sudo and let's get this installed and while this is installing i'm going to open up another command line and hit this here so and we need the um xcode stuff so while that's doing that asm computing says what's up kazian saying new to the channel three days ago i know html css javascript php started getting to react three days ago and already know my way around thanks to you guys that's awesome dude that's great oh that's actually dope and i just realized i don't have my youtube open so i'm gonna actually go ahead and do just that oh the comments you mean yeah the youtube analytics or comments or any of that like i don't have it open nice bob builder says are you guys going to start building clones of react native soon yes in fact these series like the series of videos that we're dropping right now actually to show kind of warm you guys up to react native show you some of the features the fundamentals in react native like navigation how do you navigate through an app how it's very similar to react as in like how we're used to writing react and things like that um so we're gonna pretty much be doing that to introduce you and then we're gonna be doing some crazy big videos um so so get excited for that so if you guys love the clones let us know in the comments right now i can see uh even avail of availo so jeff says guys i think love you watch your clone videos it's helping me so much to understand and react concepts and all starting to make sense you're awesome i appreciate that dude so yeah i'm going to be dropping videos in react name also melbourne hey nice okay so now i got this thing working cool uh hopefully the xcode is installed what i was looking for no it's on no developers tools were found requesting install um what's going on can't stall because it's not currently available from the software update server interesting wait what did it say it said can't install even though i went installed it it said it gave me some weird error do we need csh we don't need it right like we just need to do it we don't need it right now it's just an additional thing all right i'm gonna just do npm start and i'm gonna get this app going bro okay so so it says opening dev tools in the browser okay nice and then let's open it guys you can scan the qr code that kazi's bringing up so expo another benefit of using it is it allows you to actually go ahead and share your running code so you guys can pull out your phone right now on android pull out a qr code read on iphone literally just point your camera at the screen and go ahead and do that i'm going to do that too and what we can do is everyone as we're coding can go ahead and demo the app on their phone which is pretty fun so it takes a little bit of time to download but once it's up and running you guys can actually see what we're coding on your own phone which is pretty cool yeah that always gets me super hyped up because i'm like hell yeah once i can see it on my phone it feels real to me exactly dude i'm just so hyped that like i jumped in the pool today dude i can't get over that i'm like [ __ ] killed it dude i'm gassed that's it soon you'll be jumping in it every day don't worry be good man freaking cannot find the variable you state a why are we using state um i fixed it i was using state a it was misspelled but i s but i fixed that misspelling i probably just didn't hit save reactive yeah what what is happening all right i'm gonna give you access to reading right and read and write what is why is hold on you state a is not defined um okay so that's actually some strange compiler stuff happening so i just probably didn't save it or something yeah i'm gonna i've stopped the package and then i'll run it again nice and then w to start it up in the browser opening the project the web browser and then you guys can see it starts building it in webpack and should be good oh nice nice nice nice nice nice okay localhost 1906. oh sick okay dude that's pretty sick then so you didn't actually install everything on xcode right to get that no you don't need xcode at all i think that's sick because xcode takes a year like ages to download yeah like i actually think yeah you just don't need it at all which makes it such a better experience in my opinion to use expo because like yeah xcode is just trash it takes so long yeah um go ahead and share your 19006 ball with me um okay cool okay yeah guys if you're enjoying the videos and you're enjoying this series of videos go ahead and smash the thumbs up button allow this video to get out to more people and it tells us that you guys want more stuff and we're going to be dropping a hell of a lot of stuff around this uh this topic and react native and all sorts of new new tricks and topics server side bringing in stuff to enjoy what's up doing like next js type of stuff would be cool too at some point yeah yeah yeah next year dude i actually want to get into that quite a lot as well so um that would be sick yeah i did it once at tesco i was working with xjs and uh it's kind of a mind mind match to get around it yeah but very powerful like really really bad and it's super demand like if you can have nextgs on your on your portfolio as well if you react the tv and all that stuff then you're pretty jacked as a developer so right now all right i'm gonna try to get the app again so i'm gonna scan i just scanned it you guys can scan it too if you want while i hover over it and it's building it on my phone right now okay cool and what does it take to run an ios simulator again um i think i mean we couldn't run it successfully right for some reason oh okay so ios isn't gonna work because that's gonna need xcode okay that's fine let's forget about that then and let's just keep on building on top of this yeah but i mean we can get it running on the phone and that should be good so now we've got okay so it's got massive console log and then we've got okay check the render method of app okay so app 149.9 we have nice that worked okay so i added these two and it actually made a point awesome 9 000 plus 200 gives you 9 200 and that point is um ten thousand six hundred odd to see why is that one yeah wait why is it hard to see should be pretty easy to see is it on ecam it's kind of it's not as clear youtube is crystal um it's a bit difficult to see if you want me to keep it on ecam or do you want me to oh no that's good i've got now i've got a bigger screen so i can see it on youtube as well got it okay nice um share your 19 or where you're seeing that share that part okay share server there we go okay so pamela pamela says guys do you think that i can work fulltime remote as a front end from romania how much can i make as a junior 100 firstly yes you can work fulltime remote regardless of where you're from um we have tons of students in the course who are doing that right now um and how much can i make as a junior that's really dependent on how much work you're willing to put in um you can make money as a freelancer as a teacher and land a job so you can make a hell of a lot of money as a junior developer it just depends on the amount of work that you're putting in um to sell yourself and make yourself valuable as a developer okay um dope dude should we jump in yeah let's do it so uh i've got the app problem running now as well awesome okay hey okay so now guys today we're going to be pretty much adding on react navigation so you know inside of an app how you've got like the different screens that you can kind of click through and things like that um we're going to show you how to implement that now a very popular one that i've used in the past is called react uh native navigation so react native navigation so cause you're gonna go ahead and google it yeah um and we're gonna pretty much be building this from fresh so this is not prepared it's fresh um me and kazi don't haven't done this before i haven't done this in a very long time so it's very fresh as well so we're going to run into bugs you guys are going to see how we overcome them and hopefully it'll bring you guys some value in doing that um yeah so react native navigation and what just happened why did my chrome just crash makes no sense all right so um i'm here the pretty link you see the one which underneath it yeah so not the github one yeah that one this one react navigation.org yep and then we've got so let's go ahead and click on uh redox and then let's just kind of follow the implementation and we'll get this thing built up so the first thing we're going to do is install react navigation native and we're going to this is for building navigations i imagine yeah so navigate so in react in typical react we use react router so that's what we're so familiar with everyone who's done the clones will know what react router is in in a native app obviously you don't just have pages you have actual sort of navigation you can actually tap through so imagine instagram when you're using instagram things like um you actually go into a separate screen right and then you can kind of click back and swipe back into that screen yeah um so we call that uh app navigation so in this case it's react navigation harsh says i made 1100 project by just learning from your react js tutorial you made my career hey that's amazing that's awesome i love hearing success stories guys keep sharing them by the way if you have any more success stories or if you've made any income or anything from these videos um it's actually quite a common thing that we're we're quite familiar with now so let's still okay so that's import that's done right yeah okay nice so the next one installing dependencies into an expo okay so i think we actually needed that one um um really all right yeah so copy that second line expo install um it's good it's cool we just we just keep keep the files when we want but paste it yeah so copy that one and paste that one so you see the second one it says expo install uhhuh i just did it nice and then you can now continue uh to hello react navigation to start writing some code so go ahead and click on that little pub link okay so the way it works in react native is you have something called a stack navigator from what i remember as well so basically stacks are like imagine you push things onto the stack and then when you swipe back so imagine like when you swipe back on an app it pops from the stack and then when you like click onto a new page it pushes onto a stack so imagine like an array or like a list you're basically just pushing screens onto this stack and then that way it can come on let's let's visualize it so i can follow with you so okay so tell me what to draw so imagine like an array okay so i got an array yes yes like any kind of list right so imagine like the instagram home page so let's imagine we're on the instagram homepage let's just have that as an entry inside this array okay so so i'll just um all right got it so this is just a home so this would be the home right now imagine on instagram you know you have the the dms right you have the instagram dms yeah um the messages get sent right now imagine we tap the dms and then we pretty much go ahead and we push the dms page onto the stack okay i see right and now what this allows us to do is now on our app we're going to see the dms page which means that we get to we're on a dm's page yeah um but then imagine so on on apps you have that natural swipe back so you typically would go from the left side and swipe back right yes when you swipe back it'll take you to it'll take you from dms to home yeah because basically what you're going to do is you're going to pop from the stack which means pop the existing screen and you go back to the home screen got it right stack okay and then in this way imagine you're in your home dms and then you tap into a dm so like a message you see how it kind of stacks up right like it stacks up and then it basically you can pop every time you kind of swipe back it pops pops pops until you get back to where you want to go yeah now this is very similar to how react uh ru does it so when we built clones in the past you're pretty much just like redirecting then when you click the back button it goes back a page but now it's the native version so it's like stacks are used instead to sort of mimic that behavior right okay got it that's cool that's really cool okay yeah what kind of shot bloody i'm shocked i remember that because i haven't done this in a while um so what we're going to do is we're going to create a stack navigator all right and hopefully it's going to work first time and the stack navigator it says is a function that returns an object containing two properties screen and navigator both of them are react components for use for configuring a navigator so let's just go ahead and we'll cut this up we'll just play around with it and see cool so let's look at app.js so right now we have the entire app rendering in app.js right so it's going to be a bit difficult to actually go ahead and change any of this so what we could do is refactor this firstly into so this entire page is like a is a page inside of our app so what we're going to do is maybe make this the home page we'll make this we'll call this the home page right yeah so what we'll do is we're going to create a new component hold on let me yeah i'm following you cool yeah let's go ahead and create a new file called homepage.js and it's going to be capital h so homepage.js um go ahead and add a new file called homepage.json do you want me to do it yeah so that way they can see it so homepage.js nice and then we're going to use our neat little rfce trick to go ahead and get it there we go i'm going to change this to an arrow function so it's consistent but basically what we're going to do here is this is not going to be oh yeah oops yep this is now going to be the page that we want to render so what we're going to do is we're actually going to refactor all the code and what i mean by effect is that we're just moving it from app.js to this component okay and hopefully everything shouldn't break and it should be nice and work the way we want it to so what i'm going to do in a very nasty way is i'm going to basically go ahead and go inside of app.js so you need to follow me on on the code i think kazi all right here we go so i'm going to go ahead and just pretty much grab everything inside of app.js right now and i'm going to pretty much paste it inside page and we're going to fix any bugs that come up so i had an issue there and i had yeah yeah i believe nope let me go ahead and do that again that's bad bad copy so we want to go from the top of the file so const app and i'm going to go all the way down to the um the there we go so i'm going to get that and i'm basically going to go ahead and replace this there we go so now i have everything copied from the app.js into this one i'm going to even copy the styles and i'm going to pop that on top because it's a bit easier to actually read when we pop it on top and then i'm going to go back to our code and just literally grab all the same imports and paste them in here so we have everything pretty much that we have inside of app now inside of this new homepage.js okay yeah um so what we're going to do now is we're going to basically go ahead and clean this up so i'm going to go and actually remove all this code so it's just going to be const app and then all of the return we're going to have the safe area view but i'm going to remove the styles i'm just going to have it very very clean so i'm actually going to go ahead and remove all of these imports and remove the user effect and stuff like that and then here i'm going to say render the home page like that oops self closing so this should if we didn't break anything it should work so we have the same app yeah it's literally the same app now it's just rendering from so it's a safe area view is not defined okay so i need to uh just import it from react native so i'm gonna do that but i'm gonna get rid of all these extra ones that we don't need there we go save up and home page is not defined oh yep of course we need to import our homepage so we say import home page from home page like so oops my bad that was me no problem and then that should work now nice okay beautiful hey look at that yeah so this is typically how you want your act structured right so you wanted to have like a page and then you have the at the app now it looks really clean to read the code yeah it's clean right because now it's like inside of a safe area view we've pretty much just got the homepage which is dope like it's very clean that also means inside of homepage.js we don't actually need another safe area view so i think it's stopped following me some weird reason really okay there we go now i'm following you again so so here we have a safer review and then it's kind of nested it within another safe area of you here so this one now we can just change to a actual just a view um because we don't actually need the the two safe arrow views nested because this one is already wrapping the component inside of a sleeper review um not sure the danger of double wrapping it but we just don't we don't want to do that okay so that's pretty cool so we have that now so now it will make it easier to actually go ahead and implement implement react navigation you always want to make it your knife easier clean up the code and you see once you like it may have seemed like a big task but you see we just did it in less than five minutes yeah so now let's go back to the react navigation docs and kazi can you see how this is very similar to what we do with react rua so we get it to this clean stance and then we start to implement the sort of navigation part yes yeah so it's very very similar to like how we do it there and now in their example they've got the separate components they've got function home screen which is essentially what we just did yeah we built our home page yeah and now what we're going to do is we're going to grab the stack so we're going to say constant equals create stack navigator so i'm basically going to go ahead and pop that in actually i'm going to pop in on top here yeah and the stack navigator we need to import i'm going to import two things from that file you can see and that is the navigation container and create stack contain navigator and then we're going to surround our app inside so i'm actually just going to copy this block you know so i'm going to copy this block stack navigator i'm just going to nest it correctly and then the home page i'm going to cut our existing homepage so i'm going to comment this out for a second and then when it says name okay you're going to it allows you to give it a prop component yes and you just feed it the home page and then it knows what to do with it exactly that got it yeah dope see what we did there and you know you don't need the safe view right or do you need it because i assume that this should know how to make things safe no so it doesn't actually know how to make things safe but you're this brought up a good point so we actually previously before we don't want the safer review to be encapsulating the entire app we wanted to encapsulate the component itself um also td tdain blank this is live so yeah everything's live right now um so we're going to go ahead and change the we're going to add the safe area view back to the home page and remove it from here because it shouldn't be here it should actually be at the lower level so i'm going to go back to this preview this the view that we were i don't know why it keeps unfollowing me um go ahead and yeah so now let's go ahead and add the save review back here so save for a review and we can reimport save for review there we go and save it then then you're right we don't need it here so we can get rid of it like that oh you just added it to home page yeah added it to the home because you actually don't want it to be um because some imagine like you have a and the top and that header right the header in some apps actually goes into that safe area and you purposely want it to sometimes because it gives you like a full screen experience yeah yeah so it's in some situations you actually don't want the safe area view because you want it to kind of like be this seamless full screen experience got it yeah so that's cool now let's actually see if we broke anything so it says cannot resolve react navigation stack um so we actually need to uh and we need to install that it looks like oh yeah so installing the stack navigator library we didn't do that so we need to do if you scroll up on the docks it says npm install react navigate yet we need to just pop that into terminal shashank said he says how to learn if i don't even know the basics um so i would recommend literally there's so much free content out there to learn html css javascript you can pretty much go ahead and watch that stuff and then follow with the lives we offer a course called profit with javascript um and that you can pretty much you don't have to have any experience you can pretty much go ahead and join that that's literally cleverprogrammer.com pwj if you're interested um and yeah like and then pretty much you can go ahead and just jump in and you don't need any experience to go ahead and to learn that and you can pretty much go ahead and get running to the point that we're at right now yep so this is the course you can go check it out here's the link and it should also be in the description below and feel free to check it out yeah go ahead and check that out dope all right so we got this going and it should be installed so let's dude it works nice wait what happened it did have a little bit oh [ __ ] i see the home screen at the top that's cool man that's that's super cool damn okay dope that would be excited holy [ __ ] all right now let's um let's figure out how to do our first kind of stack stacked item so we can see now we're on the home screen i think it would look different on the app as well i think it would be in the middle so it would be like native looking i'm trying to build it on my phone but for whatever reason i just cannot get my phone to compile it properly maybe turn it off tunnel mode do it local and it'll be faster for you and then just share your phone on the screen that might be the easiest way i think so not land local yeah do uh do local oh maybe lan because your phone's connected to your wifi otherwise you i think you have to be plugged in i'm not sure all right all right yeah try that all right i'm gonna try lan usually on lan and local it freaking poops out it's giving me nothing it's just like empty blank screen i'll try again yeah boom empty black screen cool let's go tunnel cena sure says you guys should teach us how to market our services to land clients we actually do all of that in pwj we show you how to go ahead and make an income with skills you know when you learn um a lot of courses out there boot camps and stuff they'll teach you how to code but they don't tell you how to market yourself and actually show your value to everyone out there we pride ourselves around that approach as opposed to just being a developer because that's really where you make money so um we actually cover that in the course also we actually run tons of trainings and stuff like that which uh you can feel free to check out there's a bunch of if you go ahead and look at some of the old youtube videos there's a bunch of trainings that we run uh feel free to go ahead and dive out yeah check out all those trainings and we just put together a website called reactbrothers.com so yeah you can actually go there and uh check out what's going on too exactly and uh we put we'll we'll start putting together our like top tutorials on there so yeah you can feel free to check it out and we'll put all our like big react js builds all in one place exactly literally endless value for you guys yeah value every day yeah so we're right now what we're doing is we're going to do a few streams where we're also learning with you like react native and then we're going to do a stream where we're just like building a project and then going all out on it and i think by this week we'll crack the code for sure on twitch and uh we'll be streaming on twitch as well and the streaming experience is going to get a lot a lot better yeah we've got upgrades because like what i'm excited about sunny is i want to put it in 60 frame rates per second so then it has that like silky buttery feel to it but are you smooth exactly yeah oh yeah dude are you getting are you stocking up on toilet paper oh yeah so guys it's locked down too in in uk so um surprisingly i went into my into my sort of like into the side room and we had like bundles of toilet rolls so i think my mom already did that holy [ __ ] everything pretty much yeah let's see lockdown lock down in us start nate let's see if there's another uh one coming soon um i don't see another lockdown coming soon but i feel like it's gonna it's gonna happen very very soon super annoying dude even the gym closes boris johnson imposes stay at home order as cases surge you know crazy man how how like what is happening with coronavirus right now like what's the growth rate as we speak because it's been a while whoa it like slowed down yeah it like peaked and then it came down and now it's kind of like on its second wave up it's like done with its launch yeah literally um okay let's do show all oh no no no it's not down bro look at that yeah across the u.s u.s is quite crazy dude like there is like if you check out uk uk has done pretty decent job of containing worldwide we're like spreading faster than ever how many people are there aren't we gonna run out of people soon to in fact how many people does it say in fact i can't read that 552 000 new cases a day bro holy [ __ ] like it was i remember when i used to track it i had this excel sheet and i would like manually log it and i started creating projections and it was at i think in march and i was like okay 2 200 4 000 new cases 6 000 new cases 13 000 new cases and now check it out bro 552 000 new cases it's insane man that's kind of nuts but deaths have seemed to be around the same yes it's strange right like uh and then but then there's only recorded deaths so that's another thing that's by coronavirus wow um all right i better get out of here because before i go down uh coronavirus rabbit hole by the way the stream is so clear on youtube right now is crystal like i'm just looking at you know it's nice guys go ahead and smash the thumbs up button because literally the stream right now looks so good on youtube i'm just checking out does it look better than normal yeah i mean like it's the clearest i've ever seen it like definitely yeah and that has to do with this beast beastly imac pro let's check out the specs and see what's happening um physical memory is gigs 37. yeah i stop menu too is that an app uh it's like a yeah it's like a one the one one of those apps that live in the top of the sort of you know the helper thing i don't think it's i think you have to download it off the website oh no it might be here it might be i start typing i start yeah i start menu this is the one dude i don't know man it looks like garbage what are you doing with this it's like it's like this one it's the best uh sort of app to tell you about yours wait is it this one no it's not this one this one looks better this one does not look best [ __ ] 3.7 i don't know i don't think i got it from app store but it's so handy because the only app that like actually shows me what's going on in a glance ah i see so i can see my gpu i can see my my even my hard drives uh my upload download speeds i can see everything in one go oh [ __ ] all right i'm gonna just uh buy this and then uh right now oh you're using that one yeah uh you know what i i don't need this right now i don't need to make an impulse buy because of you um i just need to check stop going the thumbs up we're going crazy really guys go ahead did does anyone use istat mini 2 by the way in the comments because it is dope man oh people are like definitely clearer oh interesting solo says bye bye video monetization yeah seriously i talked about chronovirus for so long this video is gonna vanish oh yeah [ __ ] um actually yeah i think it's because of this wait till i put up um obs and then i'll max it out on bitrate and [ __ ] like it's gonna be dialed in dude it's gonna look so good yeah i mean dude that right now is i can't believe how clear it is right now like yeah i could see everything it wasn't an internet problem it was literally a processing problem because yeah processing even i upgraded my mac um then my streams got better when i do solo streams so this i mean imac pro is going to be super like able to do everything how much memory do people have on their computers like people don't have 128 gig right or or ram yeah ram no no no all right yeah definitely no i forgot how much is a normal ram i lost since uh my macbook has 32 gigs okay cool cool yeah like look it says 37 are used so that's why my other computer would be just dead right now yeah exactly so uh it's it is easily worth the investment yeah people are like yo this is awesome yeah like look at how fast this is bro oh [Laughter] all right cool so we're talking about stacks stacks so now we want to go ahead and add a second stack so we've got the home screen which is looking good we have this stack dot screen um over here yeah so we want to go ahead and actually create a second stack and then let's go ahead and call this one um let's just call this like details for now right so it's just like a we're going to call it a details page or i mean what's a nice second screen let's just call it messages or something yeah yeah [ __ ] details details and then this let's go ahead and create a new file called uh messages.js which is just going to be a message screen uhhuh okay so i'll do that hold on let me actually uh pop in something real quick on my uh preferences let's go uh display i just want to drop a little under scan because wait is that happening under scan oh yeah why can't i throw a um oh no i can throw under the skin all right just want to do that just because things weren't like full on the screen really yeah now it should be even more crisp for people watching oh damn yeah oh bloody oh you guys like that is crystal for you guys yeah i just needed to throw a little uh a little under scan you know i'm not even going to pretend i have no idea what underscore me yeah when you have a tv so i'm on a giant tv right now a problem that happens is like you see all this space here oh yeah it's like above the screen so i don't even have access to it it doesn't even fit into the screen oh really yeah so i have to throw under scan to like make the screen shrink in size usually i just do aspect ratio on the tv remote to that 16x9 damn sonny back to react holy [ __ ] all right second stack is let's go ahead and create messages.js and this is going to be like a messages screen right so why don't we create a admin dashboard where we can see everybody's income that has logged it okay we could do that so should we do um so this is the home page so what would this what would a second page be let's go ahead and create like i said oh we could do like i mean a lot page um a login page yeah the login page is good yeah let's do login page because we're eventually going to have a some kind of room for that so login page.js here so and then for the name of the page we're going to call it login and for the component we're going to go ahead and say so login page we're now in login page we're gonna do a nice little rfce trick and this is the beautiful thing it's literally the same as what we've done before guys it's the same reactor we all know and love and you can just do that and it's not a div so remember oh damn actually oh yeah we actually changed that so it's not a div it's uh so rather than rfce we're gonna do our rn yeah what is it rnfc rnfe yeah react native functional something export yeah so and then we're here we're going to say i am the login page right yeah and then sunny i'll be right back okay okay so we're gonna do that and then here we need to just go ahead and say login page and we need to do an import so i'm gonna go ahead and say import and a little trick for you guys if you go ahead and highlight what you want to go ahead and sort of like select on the screen but you do command d you see i've got double cursors now which is dope so now i can actually go ahead and do login page which is pretty sick and it helps you you get very quick at doing that um and and it really does i use that all the time so if you guys didn't know that and you actually found that useful smash the thumbs up button because that's always gonna help you guys out uh ammar rozak says login firebase oh yeah we're going to be doing that um there's actually a really cool library uh i think it's called react native firebase so react native firebase you guys can't see this right now because it's on a different screen but yeah reacting to firebase.io and basically what they did is they went ahead and done all the hard work to go ahead and handle the sort of like using react native and firebase together so so we've got firestore cloud functions cloud messaging guys if you thought firestore was a firebase was jacked for for web apps wait until you see for uh react native apps you can do so much stuff it's crazy and guys if you want to see machine learning that's going to be cool because machine learning so you can use things like i'm going to go ahead and i'm just listing out what i'm i can see on my screen so it's ml kit vision so you can use text recognition landmark recognition barcode scaling scanning image labeling and face detection all of the uh yeah so all of that stuff you can do remote config performance monitoring natural language processing which is bloody sick so um cena sure i said sunny don't you think firebase is a bit slow what how firebase is so fast dude like um i don't know if it's if it's i can't see the thumbnail but yeah firebase is insane honestly firebase is like a it's it's insanely fast uh in terms of the server availability and stuff like that firebase is on fire guys so no i think it is extremely performant um and chances are they do a lot better than we would do it uh if we were manually doing it so firebase is extremely powerful guys um bob builder says bro you guys should do something in machine learning that would be so sick 100 aaron actually did drop something i did a video with aaron even before so if you're interested in some machine learning videos we've dropped someone before on clever programmer but it'll be pretty cool to go ahead and actually have um react native with machine learning i think that would be sick so if you guys want to see that smash thumbs up and we can get that moving uh james gail says more shortcuts please i will show you some shortcuts in a sec uh seen the sugar i say up and every request takes like two seconds most likely either a your network connection or b the way you're sending your requests is nonperformance so you need to look into it could be either those things but trust me it is lightning fast kkpk says what's better for making a website react or django my opinion react uh this is why is the number one most wanted language right now um according to stack overflow survey and for good reason uh okay so bubbles i've been seeing stuff in the internet saying firebase sucks like querying stuff do you think that's true remember guys there's this okay you can either get sucked into the world of opinionated sort of like what is better this sucks that framework sucks or you can just suck it up look at the facts and the fact is it's the number one most wanted language and just become so damn amazing with it right so that's what i would say focus on that because most people i see is like yeah you know like it's not performing and stuff guys like stop wasting time it's an excuse by doing that you're literally giving yourself an excuse to not progress so make sure you just just forget all that stuff just start coding and trust me you can make a ton of money off of this stuff so i would say go ahead and do that so uh we've got seahan says tell me what the dismantler is using randy of web apps instead of react.js um disadvantages deployments are slower you're going to have to approve your app to deploy on the app store that's going to take time whereas react you can just do a quick deployment um but you get all the native features so it depends if you want to put in the work to build a renegade app you actually can have a lot more power including notifications so that's a big one um yeah arabroski dope so what are we doing right now react native firebase stuff so um dude i think as well it would be a killer video to do machine learning and react native oh yeah i would want to do machine learning and react but we could do it with react native too yeah because uh firebase have a ton of really powerful libraries with react native um so so that would be yeah for machine learning sorry yeah i think like tensorflow or something along those lines would be sick i always wanted to uh also do chess with react make a chess game oh [ __ ] i'll be sick yeah all right bro so um what's going on here so like we we're trying to add the next page which is going to be login page right yes so look it's showing up at the top in the navigation yeah so we have to set all that up so right now we actually have um okay so right now this is just setting things up so one thing we can also do while we're here at this point is we can say we can actually pass an additional prop so for the login page if we wanted the title of the login page not to be login page or anything like that but we can go ahead and pass in an options and then what we do is that takes an object and that object takes a title and inside that title you can go ahead and say login or you can say login screen i mean nobody sees login screen you can just say sign in or sign up sign in or sign up let's do that sign in or sign up right uh something like that just to make it very clear that that's actually we're going to see so we've set up the screens right now okay we've got these routes we've got the home screen the title screen and things like that the initial route you can actually go ahead and pass in so right now it's just by default grabbing the first one but you can actually go ahead and add this in so it says initial route name home if you wanted the initial route name on login we should let's try that actually let's save it and let's see if it uh takes us to the whoa there we go nice yeah so you can see we have rooting we have some kind of rooting in the app you know yep um and then what we're going to do is we're going to change up back to home but now we're ready to go to the next step which is um so usually i contact us and use a render callback um okay so now we're going to do is go to the next step so if you go to um back to the docs and go to uh where if you scroll down it'll say what's next and uh they should have a next section button so what's next moving between screens there we go yeah all right so yeah so you can see that that's typically how we do it on a react app so it's no no no sorry that's not a reactive that's a typical web app no a typical web page right so no react app we use link in um but in the normal web page we have it says on pratt on press so navigating to a new screen would look like on press navigation.navigate um login page yeah so the key here is actually that navigation.navigate yep right that button is just medium you can and at any point in your code you can call that navigate uh sort of piece of code yeah but here we'll do the same exam we'll have a button which says like go to login or whatever like that so on our home page let's go down to the the sort of let's add a where we have let's build a react native app let's actually have a button so i'm going to go ahead and add a button and remember their buttons are actually weird they're self closing and then they have a title prop yeah so let's just say go to let's just say login a button called login and then we'll have an on press and the on press would go ahead and it's an arrow function so it's going to be like an inline code or you can actually call a separate function so it's typically how we know and do it and react we're going to say navigation dot navigate and then this would typically be the name so if you remember we set the name of this one as home and the name of this one is login so that's what we're going to navigate to so in this case we're going to navigate to login where'd you get the preload manager from what is this oh no that's that's that was wrong that that just autofilled it should be navigation like what did i miss that should be navigation yeah and then what we need to do is actually import um okay so this is another clever thing um so it actually gets passed down as a prop so uh if we go ahead and i remember this now so if we go back to the top of home page so remember guys this is where the props come in right in react apps you have a component and it can accept some props now whenever you've got a stack inside of this sort of a chart which is a child of this navigator inside of this navigate container all of these chart components actually get a prop and that prop if we destructure it it's going to have whatever props you pass in normally as well as something called navigation okay and this is basically like a navigation handler that comes down so this is how we can go ahead and do navigations.navigate login so at this point we should um see let's go ahead and see inside of our app right now i'm seeing a login button if i click it oh dope dude oh [ __ ] okay go to um i see it login and boom oh [ __ ] that's clean nice that's slick that is even see by default it's putting it on the stack and then we can pop pretty much um damn that's pretty sick yeah they made it they made it a lot neater than it used to be um okay i did i'm loving coding and react native now because uh back in the day used to be a pain to do that really yeah it wasn't as clean uh before and now like everyone that comes to it's like oh this is super clean it's like you guys are getting the nice end of this which is cool yeah so navigate okay so navigate to a root multiple times let's go back to the docs and let's go ahead and check out okay so um so you can do a few things you can you can keep on you see there's navigation.push if we go down um there's this so you so basically navigate is the best one because navigate is very it's very clever if you try and navigate to the same screen twice it's not going to like stack up the same screen twice it will just stack it at once but if you go ahead and push twice it will push twice if you see that gif yeah it says and you see you can keep stacking the same page and in some situations you may need that so it's just worth knowing that you can do that um got it okay that's cool and then we've got the um so if we scroll down there's actually a you can actually have a button which navigates back so you can so by default yes it added it to the header but some apps you might notice that they don't use the default native stuff right they don't always cool that they do it for you that's kind of nice yeah so they do it for you but if you wanted it like programmatically as part of your component um so let's actually try this out let's go ahead and into our code let's go to the login page and let's add a button here with a title which says go to home page oh no just to say go back right go back and then here we'll say on press is going to be an arrow function which is going to do and remember we need to get our props when we destructure him we say get the navigation and then here we say navigation dot go back like that and that should what where is this coming from oh we're giving it to it on the app.js yeah so remember because it's a child of these two things it's like a these are basically like called higher order components so they basically inject a prop into its children which is navigation oh okay yes the way to think of it is just because they're like children of these so navigation container and this stacked navigator and because they're inside of it they by default are going to get that prop so but just think of it that way so they just they get that prop navigation right got it so we can so we can actually use that like that and now if we go to our uh our app we should see in the login page um we actually need to save app.js and log in login page it's not i think you have to save it yeah and even without.js all right i saved all of them that's bad now we should be able to see oh okay buttons not buttons not um defined so we need to define button and then save loginpage.js okay and then we refresh and now log in go back hey so now not only have we got in the header we've also got it as a programmatic file now come for me nothing is changing uh click login there we go huh you see it's got it go go back i see yeah nice right so now we can do it programmatically and we know that it also adds to the header by default so that's that header that gets attached right so now that header you can customize it you can make it look however you want you can even customize the icons that appear yeah also remember on the login screen it says sign in or sign up right so remember we actually added that as a prop here which was options so if you go to login screen so if you click on the login button you see at the top it says sign in or sign up yep and that's because we passed in this title prop got it yeah um so that's like you see like there's just different use cases of props but if in reality when you i know it's like it can be confusing because it's like it's just something new but in reality it's actually pretty pretty clean um in order to customize tiles and things like that once you set up your routes everything is pretty clean and you can imagine now you just code with react pretty much and you have rooting inside of your app yeah and by default this is going to support on android so android phones have a button which is always designated to go back right they have that kind of you know backwards carrier um that's going to do the pop functionality for them and on ios the swipe back is going to do that for you got it yeah so that's pretty cool so we have go back um okay so that's pretty much oh yeah i also know nas wants to learn um react native too actually oh really yeah he really wants to yeah so it will be ill it's something cool for you guys to attack too in some calls yeah yeah we should definitely do that i think even in the coaching calls it will be really cool to start attacking uh react native as well yeah um because it would be like a a circular thing would learn more in the cause it would come back on youtube we can do crazy builds um that'll be fun okay so next section is passing parameters to roots um okay so passing parameters to roots um i mean at this point we could actually implement a a bit of a flow to our app yeah we could actually have a login functionality at this point okay cool just trying to think we want to tackle i think we said something along the lines of last time like we wanted to tackle authentication today yeah so we could tackle authentication today okay so we've got the login page um so in that case what we can do is um go to react nate type in on google react native firebase yeah so this this uh uh sort of like library is actually a crazy library like i'm not sure who's built this like or like it's like a big team but they basically like adapted everything that firebase gives for react native and you can pretty much go ahead and use everything that react firebase offer but they have everything set up but you can see there's like a bunch of things that you can do and signing out and stuff like that now the reason is is that you might be wondering can't we just use the typical react way that we do it before but make sure you use that one the reason being is because they have very clever ways of listening to the login state which is different in an app you don't want it to kind of be glitchy and kind of like log in and then kind of every time you go on the app it kind of logs in and passes you over you want it to like cache the login and do things like that so um let's go ahead and install this into our project so if you go to the top installation um so installation i installed this um react native firebase app oh you did that yeah although okay so um react native firebase app okay cool and then what we need to do as well is if you're developing your app using ios run this command so we need to actually go ahead and and i mean we're not going to do that right now because we haven't got xcode installed but you would have to do cd ios because if you notice inside of um inside of a react native app you actually have a hidden folder called ios and then you you have to do this thing called pod install but we're not going to do that right now later um but what we're going to do now is it says listening to authentication state so remember on on the react clones where does it say that um so you have why does your one look different so your installation go down um oh sorry you're looking at a different you need to go to go up to the top sorry click on the little uh pull out uh burger menu uhhuh and then click on authentication usage oh but you know we should maybe actually get you getting started first yeah because we actually need to install the the course things um so yeah go back to what you where you're at sorry that's that's good idea um so yeah so you see there is a setup involved for android and there's a setup involved for um ios as well there's two separate things that we're going to have to do for those projects um configure file and you see you have to kind of run through these to set everything up it is a little bit kind of clunky but i would say maybe what we could do in this case is let me just check if we can maybe do it for because the the process for that won't be good to do now because of the xcode issue so let me just check on the authentication side i tell you what we could do kazi why don't we show them sort of a a coded example of a login that pushes them to so once you log in with the correct sort of you know hardcoded sure thing yeah yeah we could try that oh sugar show emily's in the chat oh [ __ ] hi baby let's go no oh she's at the boxing gym that's sick make sure you they get their recording really well what the [ __ ] we just got a 50 pound donation 50 euros yeah let's go by pika crazy go ahead and pull that on the screen yeah there we go and wow that thank you for all your work guys i added netflix whatsapp and amazon clone to my portfolio it helped me a lot to obtain a 40k euros a year long time contract as a full stack junior developer this is part of my first monthly pay thank you very much that's amazing that is insane well done that's awesome man oh [ __ ] that's awesome congratulations pika that is amazing wow thank you for the donation appreciate it yeah that's interesting hell yeah bro keep up that music that's insane i love seeing that dude like uh and 40 000 euros a year is actually not bad at all for a junior developer that's a really good salary to be honest as a junior so that's what it really is that's crazy um i was thinking yeah so maybe let's do it as we just have an input yeah we have it and then we have two inputs and then if they put the correct username and password so a very simple nonlayered authentication and then what we can do is we'll run through a full setup of of this once we have everything set up um no so we don't run into it right so at this point let's go ahead and on the login page just let's have the input fields that we're going to need um so right now we had i'm just looking at the input fields that we did previously so input okay so text input is what we were looking for so what we're gonna do is on login page we're gonna have two text inputs we're gonna have text input text input and i don't want this right here so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of these in a sec so this is going to bug out if we save it so we're going to have a placeholder for this one the styles we don't have at this point um i'm gonna pull this forward right so we're gonna have text input the first one is gonna be the username right so it's gonna say enter a username or we'll just say enter your username and then here we'll say enter your password right and then i think they should have a simple form right now right what was that you're just making a simple form right now yeah simple form that's all we're doing right now so um we can go ahead and say for the stars we'll leave that for now and we're going to add two pieces of state so we're going to use the use state hook so we're going to say use state and then we're going to say const username oh god i hate windows our username and it's always like the most random thing that i could like ever come up with exactly like dude oh man you stay and then we'll say blank right and i'm going to copy this paste it go ahead and say password set password and then for here we're going to say the value of the first one is going to be the username and then when they change it it's going to get the text and it's going to set the username to the text and yeah dope dude do the same thing for that that's awesome that's what you call pair programming guys oh that's sick and now for the styles we're gonna actually go ahead and i'm gonna go ahead and create a style sheet at the top and for the input fields we don't have title text but for the input fields i'll keep it very simple and we'll go ahead and uncomment these out and we should at that point have what we need to get up and running so let me go ahead oh man my spacing's all messed up okay so boom boom boom there we go so save now it says style sheet dot create so we need a bunch of things from react native repetitive so let's go ahead and get the style sheet so i'm going to go here and say style sheet import we also need the text input that's going to bug out and then we if we go to login page it's there's another problem where we don't have the text input so i just imported that text input um we should have it now so it should be working though text we have login okay awesome so the border color is red right now which is a bit extreme let's just have standard black orders oops black and then save um yeah there you go and now it should be on that page to log in there we go so enter your username into your password um so the password right now isn't the correct type right so you see if we go to login and we start typing in the password field so click on login login yep so you'll notice when you start typing in password it doesn't hide the characters um so let's go ahead and check how we do that so type text input password type react native let's check how we do that so here we actually just need to change we need to make it secure text entry so we need to do uh it's actually weirdly enough like this yeah it'll be an actual thing like that secure text entry and i should there we go go ahead there we go that works hey nice so now instead of this button doing just a simple go back let's create a function called const login right this is going to be a basic arrow function and here on press we're just going to do a login right i'm going to say login now when we hit the login button we just want to basically go ahead and say if the username this is a very simple dummy example okay if the username is kazi and the password hell yeah and the password is say one two three four one two three four let's do admin one two three four admin no no no no no just admin that's gonna be too hard to remember it's just admin yeah yeah just admin bro that's my shoes here so if if the username is causing the password admin then what we're gonna do is we're just gonna allow them to navigate to the home screen so firstly to make our app super secure we're gonna go ahead and change the initial route to the login okay so the initial route is a login so you should end up there first and then the only way to get to the home page is if you log in so here we're going to say navigation navigation dot navigate to home if you have the correct username and password okay so and then rather than saying go back it should say login so now you can see a typical sort like kind of example uh flow for an app so we should be able to go ahead and see um if we go ahead and use like let's go ahead and say it what do oh snap that's awesome right what's that what is it is it because i put in the wrong password on purpose oh it did nice nice it worked hey there we go all right and you can see like and obviously there's things to consider like at that point you wouldn't want them to be able to go back you would we would have different sort of handling mechanisms for that but the main thing is that by using that authentication library what we would do is we'll combine this with something like the redux um sort of state management library that we talked about in previous builds we would have that working in in sort of partnership with that react native firebase library and then we would basically check when the user is inside their app if they're logged in now if they're not logged in for any reason or if they're logging expired or something we can kick them back out to the login page yeah otherwise we just bring them to this home page right and you can see with that it's actually pretty simple like you can see now we have a fully functional sort of style app with login with sort of um obviously it was a dummy login the reason why we didn't do that is because of the um oh god you see the comments somebody said no holy [ __ ] adrian i live in bmw i hope you're okay bro that is kind of nuts what's going on there like who's shooting the cops are shooting or just random people are shooting that's crazy man because in the uk we just the gun laws are so strict we never really if you hear about a gun it's like oh my god that's crazy man so i don't know how you guys over in the states and stuff have it because it's pretty loose over there with gun laws right um yeah i guess i mean i'm i'm not too familiar with laws in general but yeah definitely not familiar with gun laws um well just hopefully you're safe adrian i mean i would say call the police but it looks like they're actually in a [ __ ] gun fight right now outside the house yeah dude um okay [Laughter] uh neo wt says hey i ended the airbnb clone and i can say i learned a lot from that stream i would like thank you for the effort and wish you good luck with your programs don't do thank you was fun yeah um also guys let us know in the comments any kind of builds that you're interested in learning about so that we have a rough idea about what you want to build what you want to go ahead and see in future builds let us know um oh [ __ ] is that right now right now bro oh dumb holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] this um this is like probably the most controversial live stream we've ever done yeah it's definitely getting demonetized sandeep dust says just spent eight hours yesterday making the facebook come from your channel and today seven hours making the twitter clone with firebase you guys rock that's crazy dude while you're on that spree try ahead and beat us to the next video and get the react native firebase library set up and running um and try and do like some kind of authentication with that before we drop the video yeah that would be a good challenge for everyone to actually go ahead and do um that would be awesome sick now i can't go back bro oh okay the only way through is to log in yeah got it yeah so that's what we kind of like we sort of like you know kind of uh protected against that um so that was a kind of a dummy login scenario and the reason being is because we haven't set up xcode and there's a bunch of xcode work that we need to do to get that installed um but once that's done what we can do is we'll get this out because now we're on the new imac so the next time we go live we'll actually have the simulator up and running so they'll be able to see dude how the simulator will be we'll be seeing it you know got it okay i'm sick um dude i want to get that book on um there's this book on something about resistance like um i hope i can find it it's supposed to be pretty sick i don't know i just thought about it right now like working through resistance um it's none of these not what was this for resistance it's a book i i think it kind of talks about like how to work through resistance so doing things that are really hard i just got inspired because i thought about it i'm like we're setting these goals like for example even you and i we have the workout goals where we want to hit 20 workouts or 30 workouts yeah and then we have the goals of okay 15 live streams and i want to actually train my brain on actually actively looking to work through resistance and this book is actually really great on this except i just can't think of its name damn does anyone know in the comments maybe the book he's talking about let us know or let us know any books that you guys find generally quite useful that have impacted you um right now i'm listening to think like a monk have you have you read that book by j shay i'm uh i'm reading that as well actually that's a really good book yeah but you know i after he got to the part about negativity then it got pretty generic so i just [ __ ] quit out of it i got bored like yeah it went it went a bit kind of down and then it comes back up in the later chapter the start was like really profound where he's like breath is all you have they teach you breathing even if you i'm like okay that's deep that was sick i felt a certain way then it got really like a dad talking to his son about naked negativity is bad you have complainers that complain and complaining is bad i'm like [ __ ] know that dude yeah i switched to uh uh i switched to 10x yeah yeah yeah like i got sick of that [ __ ] thing it was a bit soft and i was like i kind of need someone to slap me with some but brochures mean the breathing the breathing thing was actually really good uh that that was actually a kind of a gold little nugget in that book um kind of very easily overlooked but yeah like uh that was that's pretty bob builder says a book called profit with javascript has greatly helped me you guys should check it out nice holy [ __ ] that's a great book that's a great book man um however if i is it do the workbook why is it do the workbook by stephen pressfield um no not that one and i went through jordan peterson's 12 rules of life but i don't know just didn't do the trick for me and uh yeah ranbir says his books are david goggins was really good but they can't hurt me that was sick that was actually a lot of uh that helped help me go [ __ ] nuts oh yeah at the gym and i was doing pretty epic [ __ ] so that one was really good and uh right now what i'm reading is the one thing the one thing i actually bought the um atomic havocs atomic habits was a total game changer for me that one was huge i i heard you guys talk about it quite a lot so i grabbed that yeah that that really had an impact yeah exactly devon grace i just bought thing like a monk don't tell me i got over 10 already i honestly i think it's not a bad book i'd say give it a read um but like there is a bit after the negativity that does become a bit generic and then there is a bit where i find it picks up but like i would say give it give it a chance i won't say it's a waste no it's definitely yeah yeah like especially the start of it i felt was phenomenal like the start of it alone makes the book worth it so go through that hopefully that inspires you exactly books by ab adam badoush what to say when you talk to yourself um damn oh man yeah look i look in the mirror and i'm like bro you look jacked i have really good selftalk to be honest nice it's like affirmations right yeah but like i i honestly i'm not even thinking affirmations like i just have um i just don't a lot of people are really hard on themselves i'm not that hard on myself at all so like i usually don't have a really strong negative selftalk yeah um i would say i suffered the opposite i'm quite harsh on myself really yeah i would say i'm really kind of like you know like even if you're on a streak i kind of i'm always like attacking it's very hard to feel like [ __ ] oh just that's funny dude that's crazy i mean that's hard yeah that's why the um that's why that breathing thing was really good because because like when you get overwhelmed and stuff like you j says like the only thing you control like from the point that you're you're born to the point you die is your breath like it's with you throughout and it's true like when you're stressed out when you're anxious or anything just start breathing and and it really does like change like you know like just taking a few breaths can bring you present it can change everything in a second so that that was a bit of a game changer yeah that's true yeah that's crazy dude i i never understand why certain people's selftalk is really like like strong against themselves but most of the times when i'm watching something of myself or looking at i'm like yeah damn cool like you know i'll be like oh that's pretty cool nice job bro yeah i i feel like that with the youtube streams dude when i'm watching about the streams then i feel pretty good then i'm like yeah that's sick like when we're talking and stuff so that's a really healthy way of carrying on with that but you're gonna say something were you inside no i was just gonna add on to that because i feel that people are really hard on themselves which makes you less likely to improve to be honest yeah um but i think a good balance where if you can objectively look at it like i think when you start to look at yourself a lot on youtube like how you and i do a lot of videos we can watch it i think you get desensitized to yourself and you start becoming less cringed out by yourself so yeah it's 100 you know what i mean because you have this picture in your mind and then when you see yourself for the first few times like what the [ __ ] like i don't i'm not like that at all how i think i am in my head and then in reality i say this like really stupidly or i come off like a [ __ ] here when i say this and you go okay so in the start i was really harsh but then the more i now i'm like pretty desensitized to myself because i've seen myself so much so i can actually see it just like i see another person and usually when i see another person i'm not like really harsh on you know thinking about them i'm like oh it's cool it's another person doing their thing yeah it's it's so true i remember the first time i went live i was like oh it's so hard like it may sound like the simplest thing just be yourself but like being yourself on camera and on live streams and stuff that is actually really tricky and it just takes it takes repetition of you just kind of getting bored of caring about how you look and feel on camera that's funny yeah and then and then eventually your your true self comes out and that's what everyone attaches to they're just attached to you being you and and the only way you get that and most people and this is something i got stuck at i always thought like oh no it has to be perfect the lighting has to be perfect the camera has to be perfect and then you just like screw all that [ __ ] just do it and keep doing it and then it just overcomes you know like you don't then you get out of that rut that you get stuck in i agree i'm reading um deep emotional things with kazzy and sunny um i just read the comment but yeah i think that just going and getting used to it until it's not a new thing for your body that helps tremendously yeah and gypsum also guys if you didn't know me and kazi just set a new massive goal for live streams because you don't tell them yeah it's kind of a lot actually we are planning to hit a base goal of 12 live streams and a reach goal of 15 in november yeah and what's cool is we started off november really strong so we've already this is our second live stream yeah so two livestreams tonight yeah so so far i feel we're crushing it and if we just keep going at this dude we're i'm excited about getting on twitch dude that's what i'm excited about yeah because twitch is like native to us streaming and you know all of that stuff so i think we we could definitely tap in with twitch yeah and uh and also we're gonna be upgrading the stream like well we we've we've been wanting to dive into this thing right about creating the stream uh we're going to push ourselves and it's pretty much a case of like it'll be a fun interactive stream yeah it will be and i think what we'll do is the next time we plan to go live let's just do it then yeah so we'll just get on an hour earlier and then work on it yeah let's do that 100 i'll be sick dope all right broski so we are at login and now what we're trying to do is get the login functionality to work so we put up a dummy login functionality and that seems like it's working and i'm able to log in so yeah that's pretty great i'm able to add my income and it actually shows it on the map that's also pretty cool yeah uh what's next for us we're a little bit stuck because ideally what we would have wanted to do is have it so we used firebase authentication um to go ahead and log us in and and cache that login and then we would store the information the reason being is we could do it with pure javascript but i would like to do it with um yeah so do you want to uh what do you want to do do you want to like do that work behind the scenes so then we figure it out like we can get started earlier next time and then just make it work ideal use case would be that okay cool yeah because then because what we're going to need we're going to need to crack that side of things cool and then get it all set up and stuff like that um i don't i think it would work if we did this way but the problem is that if we do it the way that we're previously doing it you're gonna get like a glitchy experience it's gonna be like you're gonna go into the app and then it's gonna like it's gonna make a request find out that you're logged in and then log you in you don't want that you want to kind of log you in cache it so that way when you come back to the app it knows you're logged in rather than doing that you know that kind of two second delay thing yep yeah cool so let's pick up next time then and wrap it up and then we can work on that and also maybe work on twitch yeah yeah so we can work on twitch and upgrade the stream and the authentication yeah so okay bro sounds good let's actually work on it and then yeah i'm getting pretty excited to talk with david and amanus too on the ad side yeah that would be sick so fishing outside yeah yeah so we can actually spend certain days uh even going on ads or giving them some strategy with it but i'm really excited about that yeah that would be awesome all right things are crazy yeah these are being this exciting stuff coming your way guys yeah it's i'm i'm excited all right guys hopefully you guys enjoyed this stream where we're learning react native together with you
