hey you what is up it's been a minute since you and I sat down and talked I miss you it's been a while but I'm ready to start jumping back on the horse of speaking with you and connecting with you and this video has something very special for you that I want to talk about it's a concept that's very important for you to understand because it's so actionable and so tangible that's why it's important for you to hear it I've been talking about it with my friend for a while we have like really deep conversations on this I thought that I might share this with you so you can get this benefit as well what I want to talk about is like understanding motivation and behavioral change at a deeper level and peeling back a lot of the layers that are over on top of it okay so you can understand how it works at a subconscious level and you could not only understand but because you get that deep nuanced intelligence of how it works you could actually change a lot of your patterns and a lot of your behavior so whether you want to start and grow a business to six figures or you want to become amazing at coding and becoming just a badass developer or land your dream coding job or it's you want to get a better girlfriend or have just an amazing relationship whatever your goal is understanding these concepts that I'm gonna share in this video will help you get to that with that said let's jump right into it okay so let's first understand like different levels of motivation and what is required for you to like actually cause a change okay so I just sitting with my friend today and one thing I've noticed about him is that pretty much his whole life he's been he's pretty consistent it's something that we just saved that amazing lady behind me so one thing I've noticed about my friend is that he's been very consistent with whatever that he puts his mind to so it's kind of like think of what it requires for you to change your behavior or change your pattern or something right so let's say you want to become better at coding for you to do that you need to code pretty much every day you need to find the motivation to code more you need to watch videos on coding you need to listen to coding programs and read coding books okay surround yourself with people who code surround yourself with people who are great developers alongside your ahead of you and start immersing yourself but for that big shift to happen there needs to be something that in your mind needs to change so then that physical emotional and mental change can actually take place so a lot of things for need for you to change okay now there are different kinds of personality types and if you understand what kind you are and what level of motivation or push you need to get going it can help I it can help you in many aspects in life meaning that you'll know exactly how much you need to learn like what kind of books you need to read to advance in your career what kind of friends you need to be surrounded by and exactly what you need to do okay so I'll give you an example my friend was very consistent in a lot of the things that he does he doesn't need a lot of motivation okay so I've been realizing that he's been going to the gym and he's been getting going assault gym so much they actually got me back on track to going and lifting I needed a lot of push I need a lot of motivation to actually make that change okay so if you think of it like a meter it's like a meter has to be filled up and once that meter is filled up it spills over and then you actually make that shift and actually start taking action on it okay and actually start changing it so for me it's like I had to read 10 X book by Grant Cardone I needed to read be obsessed or be averaged by Grant Cardone kind of get a kick in the ass from there I needed a listen to more Gary V's instagrams you know I'd like kind of follow him on there I needed my friends to talk to me I needed to like look at my son be like you pieces like go to the gym like put in that work lift that weight you know do what others won't so you can look like others don't I'm just a lot of brainwashing right to actually cause a change but for my friend he just had to think about it a few times he's like oh under the gym okay cool the next day he just woke up and he just started going to the gym and he just started lifting and he would just go four to five times a week and he would just do a day in and day out and he was quiet he didn't need to scream it out to anybody he wasn't loud about it he just did it and he was consistent and he did not miss a single day and you look at him two months from now and he looks like garbage no offense you know look at him he's actually helping me record this video right now and you look at him now and this dude looks so much better okay stronger more muscular a lot more hypertrophy action going on okay bodybuilding and a lot stronger more sharper active more engaged more present and a lot of it came from just making sure that he exercised on a regular basis and lifted on a regular basis and so interesting interesting the contrast between him and myself okay it's very interesting because he needed a very little bit of motivation to get going so if we have to look at the meter that's required for him to get going it's very small and once that meter filled up that was it and it didn't even need to be filled up over and over and over again for me on the other hand the meter needed to be filled I needed to get just really worked up and engaged and just like looking myself in the mirror talking to myself talking my friends were kicking my ass reading books that are kicking my ass to eventually just get my ass in the gym and then even when I went every day I would go and enjoy the process and loved it but every day actually still need to watch videos on lifting or listen to something about training or lifting to actually keep having that motivation and not lose it so I need to keep it keep feeding that beast resting on my friend he actually doesn't need to feed that beast he can still put in that work and he can still get those things done okay once he initially decides that he wants to do it he can just keep it going and then he doesn't need to feed it you know maybe you're either my personality type or maybe you're my friends personality type and the reason why that's important to understand is because then you can understand how to actually live your life and what you need to do so I'll give you another example from this now that he knows that he's kind of like them he's like a Tesla okay and initially I called him a Nissan Versa which he didn't like but he's more like a Tesla of willpower and motivation because he doesn't need much of it he needs a very little bit and once he gets it he doesn't need to refuel himself for an extended period of time so what does that mean that means that if he can focus on the right direction he can just continue going on that path for a long period of time without needing to come back or recheck or whatever you can just keep going back a cone going on it so as he's going on that in that time you can actually start working on a new habit and develop a new amazing habit or something new okay so for example one of them can be lifting another one could actually be like addicting himself to books and then he can just read new books and learn about new topics right so maybe he can learn about financial independence and stocks or investing and you can just every single day he'll just keep learning it for over two years and it'll be better than all of us because he just put in that consistent effort that is a pro right that's certainly a pro he needs less motivation and you can just keep going and so instead of having to Reese penned that time coming back to that and refueling his motivation he can in that time pick up a new skill instead okay whereas I'm reworking myself but it can also be dangerous and this is one important thing I want you to know so that if this personality if my friends personality type of resonates with you you can avoid this danger okay and here's the danger here's kind of the con of his personality because it takes so little for him to get on a path and get going it's amazing if you get put himself into an amazing situation right or developing amazing habit and just keep working on it for a long period of time but on the flip side it's just as easy for him to do a less challenging task and be okay with it and less lifechanging tasks and be okay with it okay and he can actually be he can actually get addicted to mediocrity and being average and be okay with it and expend a lot of his life actually on it okay so you know for example he's worked at different jobs that were below his skill level and the amount of challenge he could take in and he was just okay with working at those jobs for one to two years and for me it was kind of like I just told him I don't like dude those jobs it's not like they're below you but you can do a lot more mentally challenging things physically challenged things that would make you a lot harder to replace you have a lot more potential so what are you doing doing that stuff and so you have to be like shaking out of it and it took a long period of time to shake him out of it right or for himself to actually shake himself out of it because it's very easy for him to just be okay with that thing for a very long period of time whereas for myself my same thing that is up is kind of a con for me and a bad thing I need a lot of motivation it's also a good thing as well because I'm constantly checking myself right so if I'm doing something that's less demanding for me since I'm constantly checking myself and I'm constantly like say losing motivation have to feed it back I'm constantly assessing what I'm doing and I'm constantly thinking about what I'm doing so if it's below my skill level or below what I can truly achieve and do and my ultimate challenge that I could face I cut it out okay I cut it out I cut that out so my ability to cut out things has really helped me improve in a lot of aspects in my life okay becoming whether it be becoming top 1% in chess in the world or becoming you know a lot better at coding earning a sixfigure income at a pretty freakin young age having developers under me that I would manage and then starting a business on top of that that did half a million dollars in about year and a half from pure conception okay not even a year and a half honestly a year and just from pure birth of that business right so how did all those things take place it's just because I cut out a lot of doesn't feed my hunger or motivation and I spend up all of my remaining energy and time into things that feed my hunger and motivation right so if you're that if you have the one thing I lack personally okay is consistency it's a challenge for me I'll do things in two to three months obsessive cycles but I can't keep it going because the gas in the tank kind of runs out and I need to go back and refuel or I need to go change the view or I need to go change what I'm basically doing rest for my friend he puts he starts and he just keep going so the challenge for him is to to avoid the bad habits and the bad thought patterns and things that limit him and less challenging things to do not fall into that his challenge is not consistency its challenges cutting out the negative the weird that is happening you know that he might spend his time doing for example checking snapchat constantly checking Instagram constantly posting on Twitter he's extremely consistent with posting on Twitter did you that's probably over 10,000 tweets okay but they're not about building a business they're not moving in forward in the direction of his life that he wants to go there just tweets okay so while they're very consistent they might not be moving him forward in life in the way that he might want to go right but now imagine or like let's say watching the office when you're eating food okay you can certainly do that but imagine is changing from watching that one episode of office and replacing it was watching one episode of a tutorial or one episode of udemy or a course or something on YouTube or reading something and one thing you'll realize is that the level of enjoyment that you actually receive from say watching a video right or watching a show so Washington tutorial versus watching a show like the office Game of Thrones the level of enjoyment can actually be the same now that's really surprising to hear right because most people when they think of learning and think of focusing they're just like right there they're actually paying attention to something and I can literally this is what a lot of people look like when they're learning something new or when they're just learning in general instead of watching something entertaining so when they're watching Black Panther and you're watching Game of Thrones they're like but when it comes to learning they're more along the lines of have you ever felt that way I felt that way and I see people feeling that way quite a bit and there's something fundamentally wrong with that that's happening okay and I'm gonna get to the root of this problem very deep problem to understand because they can really change your life the reason why this happens is because the world of academics screws your brain okay I'm talking about middle school I'm talking about high school I'm talking about college and the more you actually go through the formal education system in my opinion you get more more screwed up and here's how explain it because a lot of times school discourages creativity it wants you to follow the herd shut up sit down now write down the notes regurgitate they don't say regurgitate but they want you to regurgitate right they care less about you applying what they teach you creatively they care more about you applying what they teach you in the exact same way that they taught you they care more about you memorizing an example and repeating it or getting it down on the test the same way the teacher explains that so you could ignite his ego and how amazing he felt when he came up with that definition versus you actually being able to creatively apply in in your life and get a double you get a win in your life okay and what that trains you to do is every time you're learning to disengage your brain and just listen to the words without thinking about the meaning and listen to the words without associating to something personal or something that you care about in your life and trying to apply it to your life okay so one thing that made me a really terrible student but a amazing learner one of the fastest learners out of my you know a lot of the peers that I knew and one thing that allowed me to smoke pass a lot of my peers whether it was in chess or coding the reason why that was happening was I was a bad student okay so I got terrible grades because I didn't know how to take notes I didn't know how to regurgitate information the proper way or whatnot because I just didn't care but what I did was every time I learned something I would run to go and apply it okay so if I learn something in physics this is a terrible example but well the first time I learned like how and I forgot all the physics right now because I'm gonna sound dumb but I don't care so the first time I learned physics I was like okay when somebody's falling you know what's the speed that they fall at so you you calculate it probably using the the mass and the acceleration and apparently is equal to force whatever and what I did was I was like what would happen if I fell out of an airplane how long would it take me to actually splat on the floor okay and I would use the new formulas that they gave us actually apply it and then I was sitting down and I was like hmm how would it be if my mom fell out of the airplane and she fell I love my mom but I was thinking about it and I was like you know how would actually calculate that for my mom versus myself and as I learned coding for example what I would do is when I got when I got a concept in physics right so there would be like shoot something at 45degree angle and that's usually they'll give you that trajectory will give you the best length okay the farthest reach so if it's up you're shooting a catapult shoot at a 45 degree angle or if you're running jump in a 45 degree angle because if you jump too high they'll go too low and if you jump too low you'll get too low but if you jump at a 45 degree it'll give you the farthest amount of distance now I could take this at face value and just memorize this fact and then regurgitate it during the test which is what most people do but it doesn't internalize that information in your day to day life so what I would do is I would use coding and with Python coding I created a catapult okay and it would shoot and then I applied physics loss to it so I applied gravity and I applied whatever else like I literally don't remember any of it right now and then I would shoot this catapult at like 90 degree angle at 10 degree angle at 150 degree angle and like all types of different angles and I would see how far it would the ball or whatever would travel okay and what I learned through just testing and trying and playing around with it was that 45 degree was the right answer okay and in all this travel the farthest with 45 degree so that was a lot cooler and a lot more fun to share because I would go with people and I'm like dude look at this like physics it like works in real life like this is crazy you could actually apply physics in real life and actually works this is amazing like you could shoot it from one level to another and it would just work every single time and I would do this in real life when I learned the Pythagorean theorem I try to apply it in real life and even though I wasn't good at math the very basics I was becoming better than other people because I was constantly applying it to my real life whereas if I ask anybody in school or my teachers they would not have a single idea on how any of these concepts apply anywhere just be like well rule applied in calculus don't worry don't apply it in differential equations don't worry already apply it in real life okay how do I apply it in my code how do I apply it like yes theory is good but bro the same reason why you're a teacher and you couldn't get a real job no offense and you're not working at like a laboratory or you're not inventing the next big thing is precisely because you never ask those questions and you yourself don't even know actually where to apply this knowledge okay you know how about you take that algorithm and apply it to something like tinder and create something like tinder you know because at the end of the day they're actually using a complicated algorithm which is like a elo system which is what chess is based on and it rates you okay so tender how it figures out who to match you up with and what choices you should get is basing is giving you an elo rating and based on that rating the other people have a similar rating yet to see you so the people who are way more desirable than you are out of your league so to speak you I never see them and there's no way for you to find out your tinder rating unless you actually speak to the tinder CEO or somebody in the company otherwise they're not allowed to reveal it to you okay but that was some dude taking the math and actually applying it and some real wait just like that when you're learning the same reason why you're bored when you're learning and you can't focus for an extended period of time is you're not relating it to what you can be using it for okay so when I'm sitting there I'm learning like like more like I'm not that good at frontend development okay never spend time on it never really cared about it too much but I'm spending more time on it now because I'm creating a new courses for my students in the profitable programmer as I'm learning more frontend development it's super exciting actually it's a lot of fun to learn frontend development because I could just be sitting there and like full absorb bored but instead what I'm doing is I'll be like wow a query selector like you could select that and change the style of it from just using JavaScript and then I'm never thinking the exact specific example they're giving me in the course I'm thinking of an example that I've come up with on my own so I'm like I love chess I'm like okay if I had a website what I could do is I could create these Styles like a chess board class and every time I put something in HTML that shows a chessboard image and I throw that CSS class on it called chess board it always looks a certain way maybe the image has like a little depth to it or maybe some shadows behind it or maybe or orange color border around it or maybe when you hover over the chess board it colors in a different way and it looks really clean and amazing and when you pick up a piece and you move it somewhere that Square turns green and I'm like oh this dip thing that they're teaching me where I can control a div I can go inside a class right and class might be the chess board and I can go inside a specific div or target a specific ID I could target the idea of one chess square and when I can highlight that one chess square I can change the style of it using CSS so I'm like wow I could use HTML and CSS and JavaScript in this way and then I'm thinking I already have the backend knowledge with Python Django and all that so I could use that backend knowledge connected to the front end and creates something remarkable create something freakin amazing and it's a lot more fun okay the same way where you know and learning for me watching a video on that is way more fun than watching Black Panther do you like I fell asleep in Black Panther literally like for two hours it was boring it's predictable I hated that movie I literally just like put my jacket and just went to sleep I like watching me like more suspenseful intellectually stimulating films not something that's like super cliche plot armor you know the hero will never die so I put him even in fake danger but something like Game of Thrones you can really it's really suspension of reality because they can actually die but here let me actually connect to the point I was making why coding or whatever learning something intellectually stimulating can actually be so enjoyable take a show like The Office UK or take friends why is it funnier when you are watching season four or season five then just season one how can you just look at Dwight like say in season five right you just you can just like look at Dwight and just see like one facial expression change of his and you'll just burst out laughing whereas somebody who's watching season five for the first time they're just gonna be like this show it's boring why is that a lot more fun for you because you have you have all those like little nuances all those little like baby steps built with Dwight as the character built up you learn the character and now you understand the character at a lot more complex and a deeper level and so you understand that character in all of its facets so when you see that little smile you're connecting it to like every episode of Dwight you've ever seen and what you know about Dwight and what you know about all of the contexts around him so when he's about to pull a prank or he's about to do something in a gym you just automatically start laughing and it's a lot more engaging even when nothing has happened yet and somebody if never watching for the first time it'd just be nonsensical to them or boring to them that's the same reason why the office is funny for a lot funnier for you in season five than season one and same thing for friends okay because you've built that deep rich character relationship and so now it's more intellectually stimulating for you to watch it than somebody's just watching it for the first time same thing with coding tutorials or chess when I'm watching it have so many reference points that it's a lot of fun to watch it because I'm like boom boom boom boom boom and it becomes more and more fun now for me the decision right now for me the decision to actually watch the office or watch coding tutorials is not only easy to make but I'd rather watch the coding tutorial because it's like I'm on season 85 of a coding tutorial when I watch it okay because it's all been building on top of each other so when I watch it I'm like oh like I can connect everything that I've ever known and it's amazing and I can connect how it will all play out creative creatively or in a fun exciting way when you you know connect with it at an intellectual level and understand where your excitement is coming from for things right you're not bored from coding you're just bored because you actually don't really understand in a deeper level and you can't connect it to something you're doing okay so if you have a passion like for my friend right he's a sneaker head when he is watching tutorials he's like falling asleep okay and the reason why he's actually falling asleep when he's watching a lot of just for us because he's thinking of it in a way where he's thinking of it like he's in a class or school class and he's only supposed to take down the notes the teachers saying and his brain literally doesn't even allow his brain to think of any other way to use that information besides in the specific way that the teacher teaches him otherwise he's like I don't know what to think but if he took that time and the same frontend knowledge he's learning could be thinking about oh I can make this amazing sneaker app and when people hover over my shoes that looks beautiful and maybe there's like a little bit of like border behind each shoe or it colors a certain way when the mouse hovers on top of it but when I click Add to Cart Oh when somebody purchases the product I need to store their information what could I use oh I can use a database and I already have learned Python I already have learned Django so I can just use the HTML CSS and JavaScript to create a beautiful frontend connected to my database using Python Django Postgres or whatnot that I already know boom it's an amazing site man I want to maybe just start testing it and maybe I just want to use this already and when he's doing that his eyes would light up he would take in all of the information times ten and he was learning just a much better way and then if you worked on a project for himself using it he that knowledge would be internalized and that knowledge wouldn't just be notes in a notebook that knowledge would actually be part of his knowledge okay so that's what I want to share with you that it's all about like the little habits that you actually build and knowing where your motivation and rear excitement is coming from you can control it okay so for me I know my personality type so I need to read more books like 10x be obsessed or be average you know I'm kind of like kill or be killed like that and I my motivation fluctuates a lot for him it's less of reading motivational stuff he need specially read more informational stuff and he needs to learn specifically how he can make more money he needs to specifically learn the technical skills that are needed to become better at the things that he does okay so based on what personality type you are right and how much motivation meter you need to fill up to go you can decide what you need to read what you need to consume what kind of friends you need to be around for him maybe he needs to be around more technical friends okay for me maybe I need to be around friends who are just keep pushing me okay push me I'd like a really high level doesn't matter if they have a high technical capability or not but they're just you know they're almost infectious or what's a better way they're contagious with their enthusiasm so to speak using that you can figure that out okay using what type of personality or how much gas you need you can figure out what books you need to take in and what kind of information you need to take in and then understanding at a deeper subconscious level where your excitement is coming from and the little habits right it's a little habit of maybe watching a show man it's just one night like I just want to relax I came back from my ninetofive I'm a little tired let me just watch a show if you just changed that habit to watching let's say a tutorial okay over the course of a year you have a thousand hours of coding tutorials under your belt and you're a real frontend developer or you could be that other guy who could spend a oneyear watch the office and now he's watching a lot of the office but he has zero coding skills okay so even though it won't take effect right away but over the course of six months or a year this is a compound effect on steroids okay and it'll get you to where you want to go people ask me how did you become so good at chess in such a short amount of time the thing I did something incredible you know what I did literally every time I would go to sleep as I was falling asleep put my laptop to the side and set up watching shows I'd be like oh man I want to watch this game by Carlson against like klom Nick put my laptop and just watch that game and show wow what an amazing rook lifts oh my god he's attacking his King side that's such an amazing idea while defending his Queen side Wow like I could be doing that oh that tactic literally the same enjoyment you get from watching Game of Thrones I got from Washington's tutorials and while other people just had a database of actors that didn't you and episodes that they could refer to I had a database of real skill sets that I could actually rely on that got me high paying jobs so understand your what your drives our motivation and change your little habits using what you know about excitement enthusiasm and what drives you and motivates you and you'll have just as much fun eating ice cream as you will eating lean chicken using that you can have just as much fun as putting on 50 pounds of fat versus taking all 50 pounds of fat using this you could have just as much fun getting a sixfigure income or turning your business and getting it to seven figures Oh in a few years versus just making thirty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life and using this you could have just as much fun having an amazing marriage that you're proud of with amazing children or just an amazing wife or amazing girlfriend versus having an average wife average girlfriend average life average friends okay that's it for this video thank you so much for watching do comment below if you resonated with something because um I'm trying to change the type of content I produce I want to go much deeper rather than a lot narrower so I want to build a herd of people who are a lot more deeply engaging rather than just like this fluff of high subscribers and high numbers I'm kind of losing a lot of motivation by then I don't want to do that anymore so if this resonates with you and you are watching is the deeper intellectual level and you understand what I'm saying and you know please leave a comment and do let me know I'll really appreciate it and it'll help me make more of these videos okay to be honest that's kind of what I need at this point that's it thank you so much for watching as always I love you and I will see you in the next video
