google tells employees they'll lose pay and will eventually be fired if they don't low vaccination rules basically what google is saying is hey if you don't get the shot you're out and you're fired and this will cause havoc for so many developers and so many developers that have looked up to google and have loved google and now are gonna be uprooted simply because of a decision and a choice for their health that they're making themselves and if they don't do it then well too bad it doesn't matter you know if if you're working if you're a developer it doesn't matter how many years you've been working here sorry either you're gonna start having to uh get pay cuts or you're out and you're done with the company and you won't be working anymore as you would expect the employees fought back and the vaccine mandate has not been universally accepted by employees surprise surprise several hundred google coworkers have signed and circulated a manifesto opposing the company's requirements which leadership said would apply to all employees even those working from home who engage directly or indirectly with federal government contracts even working from home that's insane it's like imagine you're a developer and you're working from home and you're like hey i don't want to take the shot and they're like yep you're fired now the biden administration has actually ordered this with in companies with over 100 or more workers to ensure everybody's fully vaccinated and in response google has asked more than 150 thousand employees to upload their vaccinations vaccination status to its internal systems by december third i'm just gonna jump in and add a couple of my own thoughts actually i was having a conversation about this with my girlfriend a few days ago and i was like i'm all for all types of things right but when it comes to this type of stuff it's like i get it they're both different sides to this but i think at the end of the day people should be allowed to come to their own decision and they should be able to make their own choice you know ultimately it's like i'm for the choice that each person makes because at the end of the day if there's a developer that's working here that does not want to put something in their body because they don't feel comfortable i think they should be allowed to do that i think it's people's choice and i think that's kind of where it makes it tricky right even if you look over here it says in section title represe respect the user this is in the manifesto and it says authors write that the mandate of barring unvaccinated googlers from the office publicly and possibly embarrassingly exposes a private choice as it would be difficult for the googler not to reveal why they cannot return so for example you know that is one of those things right they would have to reveal hey because i didn't get this shot i cannot return and that's a huge problem because this is your private health situation you know uh it would be like if everybody was supposed to just get a diabetes injection if you didn't get one you would not be allowed to come to work okay i get it this is different in this situation where you're actually going and you're kind of stopping a virus but still i feel like that choice should be left to the people and especially for people working from home if they're gonna work remotely like at least if they're just gonna work remotely let them work from home right and then the vaccination could not be required maybe you just can't come back to the office that could be one of the things so that's one of the things that's very tricky about the situation here's a point that i'd like to highlight the documents states it justifies the principle of division and unequal treatment of googlers based on their personal beliefs and decisions the implications are chilling this is something that should be very concerning for you and for a lot of people because i think it fundamentally starts digging deep into our human rights you know and our fundamental rights and i think it's some it's a conversation worth having and anytime a side just goes you are wrong screw you for even bringing this up and tries to shut you up i think that's a problem i think both sides need to be listened to i'm not completely against the side that says hey this should be enforced and i'm not completely against the side that's like it should be an open thing me i'm more like it should be your decision at the end of the day on how you actually proceed with this okay and at the very least if you're a developer and you're working from home hey let them work from home maybe they just don't need to come to the office okay so even if you were to do this and enforce it make it so they can't come to the office and if they work from home then they should be fine so those are just my thoughts you know it's a modern world and i think that we need to create rules and laws that are flexible that then you know work with the people right and actually support the people and give them a choice but you know i don't know i don't know maybe you think different right let me know in the comments below what you think how it should be but when i saw this this and i saw this since you know earlier today and yesterday this concerns me and so what i because what i believe is going to be happening is a lot of developers are going to be losing their jobs a ton of developers a lot of them who maybe are choosing to not do the vaccine right and a lot of them are going to be losing their jobs so here's what i want to do because this type of [ __ ] pisses me off and i want to have everybody get a fair opportunity regardless of whether to get a vaccine or not because you know what it's none of my [ __ ] business it's your business okay whatever you do is up to you so me on the other hand i'm vaccinated but i'm not against whatever decision somebody makes okay there's just like religious beliefs i feel the same way
