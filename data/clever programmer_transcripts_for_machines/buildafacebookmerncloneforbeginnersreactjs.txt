guys how's it going Frankie here haven't been here in a while and today I'm here with my friend hey how's it going everybody I'm David uh or people call me Dr M and what are we going to be building today Frankie yo today we're going to teach them how to build Facebook clone with the mer stack so this is the app that you guys are going to build and David and I are going to show you I'm going to ask a few questions um pretty much a begin in coding hopefully I can bring light to you guys and ask David a few questions so as you can see we have Google authentication right here to sign in and I'm going to go ahead and sign in after that we can see all of this so what are we seeing on screen David so we see on the screen uh firstly the stories of course and then you can actually go ahead and like add a new post yep like if I go ahead and like type in Yo and hit the return it should update automatically because this thing is actually real time awesome yeah I saw you post it I just posted one too exctly let's see seems like it takes a little bit of time right mhm what do you mean it takes a little oh no it's it's right there I don't see mine let's see so I'll do yo and then what I'm going to do is type in yo what's up and then you can also add an image to it and then click enter so in the demonstration here guys apparently I can't see it refresh let me actually just reload the whole page because this is what you guys are going to be building right so there's three columns to it after you sign in with your actual Google account you should be loog prompt into this you you log in with your Google account once you're inside you can see what I was just posting so it's yo yo so it takes a little bit of time just cu the database has to be refreshed that one was a little bit faster so I typed in yo what's up people and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to add an image to it and I drag it there let's see how it appears boom so now you can see that I put the image and I'm like what's up people a little bit of a typo here so what are these three columns David this is kind of like um navigation we have a sidebar on the left with all the buttons from the actual Facebook and then in the middle we have the whole feed with all the posts and on the right hand side we have like an actual Facebook uh MB right yes on the right side so nice awesome so you want to you want to go into the build you want to show them how to build this so let's go let's do it awesome man so what I'm going to do then uh I think I think our live chat just disconnected again okay um left the collaboration session I see it here so yeah I think I'm I'm reconnecting at the moment all right let me know once you're connected so we can start showing the people how this is done what is up everybody I see panu here panu is like same what's up panu panu is a 13yearold student for profitable shortcut and he's an awesome part of this community see aara here as well thara is awesome as well he's one of the most active members right now as of recently so we love the community very very much guys if you have any questions also just drop them in the chat below and you know make sure to ask actually intelligent questions that people can get value from and from there we'll move on so David have you been able to connect to the live share nope it says you're offline so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get I'm going to send you a new link okay so okay here you go let me know once you're ready with that and still says you're off yeah Coy here so this is the build guys if I understand correctly this right column is made out of an iframe right so this is actually is correct perfect yeah and so this is actually connected to our real Facebook page clever program hey Su kakar already dropped an image oh my God they dropped an image oh yeah yeah they went into it guys let's try to keep it clean you know this is learning environment after all and you know we want everybody to learn we want everything to be pretty much PG you know so everybody can see so were you able to connect to the live show David it still says you're offline uh I don't know what's going on uh can you fix something on on on on your end uh is the connection good let me see so I got a red Little Dot here I don't know if this is anything change status no it it's not not not the thing um um I think um you send me a new link okay so I got a new link here let me share it with you on Skype here we go sorry for the technical difficulties guys stick with us you guys are going to learn how to build Facebook with the M Stack this is you know this is part of being a developer guys you know sometimes you need to have your environment ready and sometimes it gives you a little bit of problems but it's just a reflection of what goes on in the real world exactly like this couldn't get any more Reed that's what I always say exactly exactly problems are are part of our Lives okay now I'm connecting I'm joining the collab session awesome awesome so I'm going to go ahead and play a little bit more with the with the actual demo demo is awesome so one of the things that I like the most off the bat it's the way that it's organized right so you guys can see here all of these little icons I believe these were made with materialized right materialized yeah everything is uh actually let's talk a little bit about uh the stack that we will be using so for the front end we are using react as you uh as you know but um we also use material UI for all the icons up there and we are using uh material UI input uh when we are uh uploading files and we also will be using the react context API which is uh kind of new for me too so I'll try to explain it the best I can uh but if something is not clear I highly recommend everybody goes ahead and watches uh Sun's video because he is the react master of our team um but we will be using react context API and then let's turn to the back end so on the back end as you already know we will be using mongod DB we will be using expressjs and nodejs and we will also be using something called The Grid FS of uh mongod DB and grid FS actually will allow us to upload images to mongod DB Direct directly so until up until this time we were using uh Firebase to upload images and then we used the links that Firebase generated but this time we will take it another level deeper and we will be using um mongod DB completely for uh storing every single thing right I I remember this is this was a highly requested um highly requested feature to do so we here you guys we are building it for you today um once I'll be able to join the collab session progress here disconnection um I'm not in there um let's go and let's try to something on the connection part is not working out some people are saying that my voice is low is it low guys let me see I'm going to move it a little bit up so hopefully this sounds a little bit better maybe inside wrong editor window somebody saying okay so for some reason the live share doesn't seem to be working um maybe we can start it from scratch yeah yeah let's do it let's let's start it from scratch oh hold on it just uh loaded for me now WIS code is opening at the moment and let's hope it sets up great and and we will be able to start the build awesome I see that you joined okay now I'm following you awesome yo back in the game guys this is how we do it exactly so you guys already saw what we're going to build it looks pretty freaking fun make sure to stick around you guys are going to be building this the Facebook clone with a M Stack ey frame over here the stories over here we're going to be using mongod DB and as you were saying David what is the M Stack contain what does it mean so M Stack is made out of mongod DB expressjs reactjs and um no JS sorry I had to think a little okay let me see I'm going write that down so the bur stack pretty much consists of mongod DB that's right and then it also I'm going to actually Express JS so Express whoops okay during that time I'll start deleting all these files and so we can start the build thenb then it's also expressjs Express JS then it's also Redux what's the r on the mer no re uh react react it is react react reactjs and nodejs is the last one and nodejs so all of these things are going to be things that we're going to be using today all of these Technologies and so that pretty much is the mer stack it is one of the most used and popular stacks for for actual what's it called web development right now so David I wasn't following you now I'm following you soing out the space for everybody okay uh now I'll try to delete all these files and actually start typing in the terminal are you sharing the terminal too let me see so share terminal so sh terminal there's one and then I click bash yeah read and right uh it should be good okay um I don't see let's actually not mess around with the terminal if you can go ahead and type in npx create react app uh create D react D app and like name it Facebook M um oh oops I how did I click enter so after the okay okay so it will be named my react app uh it's all good so you left the collaboration session apparently oh damn I don't know why it's actually um busting you out of the communication let's see so Bon text says happy birthday Sunny didn't get a chance to wish you hey awesome and then we see here so Sunny saying command shift p Frankie and then type in share terminal command shift p type in share terminal here we go okay so now I can join the session again it might happen that you will be typing the whole thing hey sounds fun um let me see so were you able to to go into the session should I invite you again um I think something on the connection side on your end is is not working out okay worst case scenario I'll be I'll be saying what to type and then you can go ahead and like uh do the whole thing sounds good let's get you on the screen though CU if not that's going to take us a little bit longer people are going to get a little bit impatient but if not guys we got it all handled you know like I said before this is all part of the coding environment sometimes you run into to problems but it's you know what makes you stick through those problems that gives you that skill gives you that you know that actual that actual will to keep on coding and keep on getting better with your skills so right now we're just waiting for David to go into the shared session for the code and we're about to code this Facebook app for you guys right so like I shared with you guys the already like three times we have some people here that are jumping in and they're actually dropping in a a little bit of posts and somebody's asking will you guys share the code at the end yes we will be sharing the code at the end yes we will we will share the code but first the good thing will be would be if I could join the collab session so I sent you another another invitation let's see okay let's try that one which again says the host is seems to host seems to be offline uh which is strange um okay um let's do the other way let's do the firework uh firefighting I'll be dropping the code piece by piece um in slack and then you can go ahead and add the add those stuff into uh the build right cool yeah we can start like that right now I'm actually having I'm actually having a f FaceTime with sunny what's up Sunny say hi to everybody man yo Sunny command shift p let's get it done cation session and collaboration session I I can't see it so command shift command shift P start new I don't I don't see it new collaboration no I don't see it let me go ahe you see ahead know command Q okay so I'm GNA open it up again done you open again start cation session so command shift p start elaboration session okay I see it now and Live share. start got it y stop and this usually restarts everything okay now I think you can drop it in in the chat and we can finally finally finally wait so I did click I did start collaboration session now should I invite David again yeah okay we go David should be the new link okay okay vs code is setting up guys we might be able to start it right now let's get it okay so seems like it's loading up bosi has joined awesome nice perfect okay so I'll start testing it by starting to delete all the files and it seems like that we it is working okay now if you could share your terminal with me I share the server you said Sunny okay and what do I put enter the TCP Port 3000 3,000 okay Enter done enter enter and then share terminal command shift p share terminal yeah and then read and write awesome got it and then you guys should be good to go yep and apparently I am following you David right yeah permission to I just yeah make make it read and right and okay focus terminal boom boom Sunny for you guys saving the day let's get it and whoa we just got a donation Sunny 28 Canadian dollars oh my God thank you Alexander thank you guys so now we're going to jump into the build thank you Sunny for helping us troubleshoot this Cod man and appreciate you byebye okay now we should be able to start okay so I'm going to start uh building the app by typing in uh into the terminal MPX create react app and I'll be naming it uh Facebook so I'm actually not seeing you I'm not seeing what you're doing says deleted deleted let me see you're in another JS right uh no I've I've already deleted that cuz I don't see I can't see what you're doing seems weird so I'm only seeing deleted ones and I see you on the another. JS h okay I just created a yo. JS yeah I see you okay nice okay and can you see me in the terminal I'm in I'm in terminal one zsh terminal one okay I see you now let's see okay awesome awesome okay so I'll go ahead and delete yo. JS cuz we don't need that that was just for testing purposes and now as in the terminal I will uh start creating the react app now guys thanks you so much if you stick with us and and you're here with us now uh it finally looks like that we were able to troubleshoot every single thing because we had issues with audio we had issues with connection we had issues with live share but now it's all set and that deserves an air horn I believe exactly love that nice let's jump into okay yeah let's jump in okay so we will be starting uh up the we will be starting building the app with the front end so let's actually everybody go ahead and create a react app with the good old MPX create react app um command and I'll be calling the project name uh Facebook react and I think that's a pretty good name and I'll just go ahead and like hit return now it's going to take a little bit of time while it loads uh but don't worry this will do everything for us now uh on the left hand side you can see that it's already creating a folder with the package.json file and yeah um so on the front end we will be using like I said react we will be using react context API we will be using uh material UI and we will build the whole thing with lots of components um so while actually that is loading yo what's up with the phone Instagram stories let's go Facebook live hey what's up so I think you can go ahead and and open up a browser and start setting up our database so if you could go ahead and open up Chrome and share it with everybody um so let's go to mongodb domcom because we will be using mongodb right so mongod db.com is the thing yeah and I have no clue if if you guys have a have an account or not but in the middle there is a start here button you can uh go ahead and easily sign up right there um and it's actually a free nosql database service that we are going to be using so Frankie you want to go ahead and set up mongodb so how do we go ahead and do that just give me direction let's go and let's go and just uh hit the middle button uh the start here button uh right in the middle of the screen it yep that's the one and you can go with Google sign in that's going to be the easiest way to go about it and select whatever account you want to go with and okay now it's going to take a little time yeah just accept everything thing and submit guys this is literally the process of signing up to mongod DV so if you haven't already this is how it looks like and this is a stepbystep uh guide on how to go ahead and start up with your first very first mongod DB database right so up here it shows like uh let's get your account set up you just want to go ahead and uh click JavaScript down there there and just go with the green button uh on the bottom right hand side uh and you want to go with the create free cluster and that is what we will be using so there is nothing to set up here uh you can leave everything just the way it is now and you can just go ahead and uh create the cluster awesome this is awesome if you guys are barely starting out you can see the whole process from the beginning so right now we're setting up mongod DB exactly exactly um okay uh B yeah and oh I think I think I I think we see saw everything okay okay for some reason the great react app um just failed uh okay so now it's going to uh take a little while while it loads up uh so mongodb is pretty much what is it the database right so yeah exactly it's it's like a it's a no SQL database right so something like firee exactly so this is a no SQL database we are not going to be using any kind of uh SQL stuff like normally you would use with uh with of course SQL uh it's a lot more easier to set up and and it's a lot easier to work with uh in my opinion and for beginners I think it's um it's a it's a great way to start uh working with databases right what's your what's your take on on that to be honest the only experience that I have with these nosql databases is Firebase and you know I like it a lot just because it's it's very real time so it doesn't you know everybody can use it it's free you know for most personal projects it's free and it's a good combination to use with react but today you know we wanted to switch it up a bit for you guys and actually teach you guys how to use the mer stack and so you know exactly actually we will be making mongod DB real time as well so that's if if uh if you're pumped about that just drop some love in the comment section or something drop a fire Emoji if you're pumped about um making the mango DB uh real time and actually at the at this time um the create react app is running and I think it should be done in any minute and hopefully it will be very soon so this is still running right here so we're just waiting for that as well exactly yeah yeah so right now what is it doing is it connecting between these two nope uh so on mango mongod DB is currently building the cluster where uh all the where we will be so it's basically setting up a server to run our database uh and great rack app is like going a totally other way uh it's just creating uh a front and application for us other than that uh so these are not connecting at the moment um but yeah we will be connecting them very soon two different processes going on at the same time oh your computer is sing too a I see I see okay uh now it's installing all the note packages as far as I can see yeah okay by the time so actually uh the cluster got set up so you can go back to mongod DB and let's actually set the whole thing up so on the left hand side there is a network access uh button you can go ahead and click that says network access on the left hand side yeah in the in the nav bar here we go yeah so you want to click network access and just go ahead and add an IP address and it will pop up a little screen but just go ahead and hit allow access from anywhere uh it's up yeah that's the one and if it's 0000 Z that's good just go ahead and confirm that and loading up pending that's cool that's good and you can go on the database access as well now my connection is lost again to the live share yeah live share and it says the same thing uh the host host of the workspace seems to be offline which is uh qu so let's let's set this up first and then I'll go ahead and just redo the same process okay so let's go and just uh add a new database user and then you can just type in admin uh right there exactly and like create autogenerate a cql password that's uh yep and you want to go ahead and copy that and yeah and just save it somewhere save because this is the last time you will be able to do this and we will be using it uh once we want to to connect to uh mongod DB right so you want to have it uh somewhere safe and just go ahead and add the uh add add the user with the green button at the uh buttom yeah that's the one you want to click it's going to go ahead and create all the stuff now it's actually um creating the rule uh to creating the rule uh to be able to um connect the database from anywhere with that user MH and right now it's uh my vs code says I'm unable to connect to to the host so we got the database ready what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to X command Q out of it and I'm going to reop it so visual studio code and then wait up till it loads after we're in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to start a collaboration session command shift p and then start collaboration session that's right I'm starting it uh so youone need to sign in with GitHub sign in with GitHub let's go yeah and yeah I think you can use Club programmer that's cool and authorize and with the done okay cool was this computer reset by the way started maybe yeah MH I see okay uh now you should be able to uh drop me a link I'll drop you the new link let's drop it in chat for you so now what I'm doing is I'm inviting David to the collaboration session again apparently it seems like it cuts off after a little bit of a while of inactivity so we're about to join the same coding session and from there we're going to teach you guys how to build the Facebook merge stch so now we got the mongodb database set up right David exactly yeah right I see here that you just joined the collaboration session okay and I think I'm going to need uh read write access to the so I'm share server with you right no it popped up on the bottom right and you can go ahead and make the terminal read and right okay awesome okay uh Focus terminal it's not currently editing assured document says yeah um okay now for and also cre react app failed for some reason um so I see you now I'm following you now okay perfect I see that you wrote the names Facebook react or Dash that's a problem because that's not what happened no okay now the terminal oh okay so the terminal should be okay perfect so I'm going to go ahead and type type in mbx create react app Facebook M front and and let's go ahead and hit return okay now it's starting up the react project again because for some reason it just failed last time sorry guys for all the technical difficulties part of the journey exactly now you learn learn from our mistakes don't make these mistakes guys yeah so right now we're giving it a little bit of time for the react app to load yeah but like I mean everybody has now time to follow us and actually guys if you have any questions drop them in the chat and now is the time to answer some stuff I think yeah also guys if you guys are enjoying this content which we still haven't gotten into the meet make sure to follow us on Instagram IG David ri. JS he's dropping amazing content there for JavaScript and just I just want to say David you know your skills in in react and JavaScript and everything have been you know very refined uh you know throughout these few months it's it's amazing the skill level that you require yeah I I'll I tried my best to uh reach as as high as possible um so yeah but I mean it required crazy amount of work yeah right you can't there's no there's no such thing like a shortcut I mean there's no shortcut in coding you have to put in the work guys you have to put in the time you know it's all pretty much process of repetition and you know that's what's going to build your skill exactly I know David has been going live you know this past week with sunny creating crazy amounts of builds and now this is going to be a really really good one as well okay so now it says I have to agree uh the X code license agreement um space space yeah space space space lot of space okay uh so it's running I think it's needed for for the Git Version Control I see oh okay agreeing admin privileges okay uh we might need to um rerun the thing do you have xcode installed on the computer by the way xcode I mean I should but we need X code that's uh just to yeah just open it up uh I think I think it's because uh xcode was updated so just open it up and you need to agree all the licenses so everybody yeah go ahead and just agree and you will need like an admin password to agree there and guys if you are on Mac and you have xcode installed and it's updated uh then probably you will need to go through this process as well I've I've had to do it with both of my Macs and and yeah uh without that you are not able to create a g version controlled uh project so yeah by the time do we got any questions so why are we using xcode because xcode is used to make you know iOS development apps right so yeah so it's actually just because we are using MacBook and when you're using a Mac uh git is built into xcode and and the part of uh Apple's infrastructure and it was recently updated uh to I think I think xcode 12 is the new version so you can you know that you have the fresh version if the hammer on the icon is black so if it's still silver you don't have to worry about all this stuff uh you only have to worry about it if you have it uh have the hammer black right makes sense so we just need to do that and like yeah it's kind of like the Apple stuff yeah I've actually used X code before it's it's really good it's kind of a heavy IDE to use but to be honest with you compared to you know Android Studio which was what I was using before that man Android Studio is so heavy it's so exact yeah compared to Android Studio it's a simple ID yeah exactly Android Studio is just it's like coding in Java like you just need so so much yeah like actually there are a lot of memes where people like putting uh some meat on their computer when before opening Android Studio because it's going to uh heat up so much oh yeah meme time I'm guessing yeah let SP out something so this is still loading guys it's going to take a little bit of a time I see actually xed out of it let's see where it's at so now here we go so we're a little bit more than halfways done so yeah okay cool now let's let's respond to a few questions cuz I know you guys are very active right now know yeah exactly let me so hope continue the back end with Mongoose do we use Mong in this we will be using Mongol that is right we will be using Mongol and we will be using grid FS with um for for [ __ ] TB and the back end stuff awesome so okay let's see another question so Rak rukaya asks why functional components over class components um guess what man we got a $5 donation by tane Blake thank you so much that deserves an air horn let's get it awesome thank you so much to Dane appreciate you man you w to you want to answer that question what's it saying what's it saying uh let's first answer the question the first one okay so why not class classbased components first I'm not too confident with class based comp components that's the main reason probably but second of all actually functional components are are the future right clausebased components are outdated uh nobody is you like yeah there are lots of companies which are still using cloudbased components but they will be uh starting to trans uh transcode everything to functional uh we just I mean the world is changing everything is changing the way you code is changing and everything is moving towards to functional components right and it's much easier uh to learn and to master because I mean functional components are so much easier to write and with with classbased components that's what uh sunny and I are always laugh at that is the this keyword and you have to put it some random uh places and it's just not beginner friendly at all so we're just not not doing that uh up here I think we will be dropping a couple of contents on how to how to use that um but just later on all right uh let's see another one let's see the donation question danne Blake he donated $5 thank you so much man he asks thanks a lot hey let me actually take a picture of it so you guys can actually see this so he asks hey first time catching a live stream nice up welcome dude see if I can actually zoom into it so you guys can check it out mhm saying hey first time catching a live stream discover this channel couple days ago thanks for all the videos I'm learning a lot thank you so much man make sure to stick around bro cuz we're going heavy on the content this past month we were having a a conference meeting a little bit ago and we realized that we put out 100 videos on YouTube the last 3 months pretty much is almost every day dropping videos every day so you know that's that's our plan still we're going to continue doing that right now we're waiting for this the xcode to install its component so that we can proceed with the code but you know this is one of the builds that you guys are going to be building the Facebook mer stack build and it's actually the new Facebook UI right David that's correct that's correct we are not not going with the old stuff we are always going the with the newest stack and the newest stuff so yeah we normally try to see you know what what is the most popular thing in in the industry what type of you know market share you know each programming language has I know that right now the mer stack is really one of the most popular Stacks Tech stacks for web development and you know we're tackling all of the projects that we've made before with react and Firebase but now using the M Stack that is right that is right so okay it's almost finished installing it's almost like what 80% nice nice awesome awesome so let's take a few questions as that is loading so somebody asks Mr H asks hey guys do you have any resources to learn how to catch a Donley uh what never mind a I don't know what that is if anybody knows what that is drop it in the comments below he will please explain what's that uh I see the last one is tagging me yeah David could you please explain how to update the active status of the context on Real Time basis so the active status of okay can you like make it like huge then we'll make it big okay could you please explain how do you update the AC status of status contacts on a real time basis um I don't think I catch the question the essence of what you're trying to ask but we will be using the react context API and we will be uh shooting into it every single time when the uh application reloads and we will be adding the new uh signed in person but because react actually has like a shortterm memory whenever you refresh it will be wiped out and you will need to sign in again and that is the thing uh that is the user that we will be adding to the context API I hope it answered your question by the way awesome then aara says maybe you could use sockets are we using soet we could we could use sockets but that's a lot of headache to set up so we we we will be using uh Pusher to make [ __ ] DB real time okay MX create um now I'm just testing out if it's working in the background make sure I have that so that everybody can see npx createreactapp yeah I'm just trying to create the app again and delete the other one that was uh that stopped uh there and FAL asks can you please save the stream when you guys are done yes so all of these streams are going to be uploaded to our YouTube channel if you guys want to see it you know on your own time you can just always go back to it and you know make sure to leave a comment if you guys are getting any you know good things to learn from it also you know the love that you guys bring to us you know we love this community it's insane really just drives us to to build more and more projects right David exactly that's right that's right okay um now it's loading I think we will cut this part out uh from the uploaded version mhm just so we can save you guys a little bit of time yeah exactly if somebody wants to rewatch it uh you can just watch the watch the uh cut version so right now um so right now what are we doing is it's we're working on what specifically so we are creating another react app uh with the accepted stuff uh so we are setting up the front end at the moment okay so I'm going to put that so that people can see setting up front end and awesome so we will be working on the look and fail of the app yeah uh you can actually X out that file that you're in at the moment um I'm creating a new one nice and you can accept that too okay I hope I really hope this time will be going cool and I think we accepted everything so we we should be good to go now seems like xode is finished running nice nice nice okay should I do something in it no no no we we don't need xcode anymore you can Comm Q out of it awesome got it so I'm here now now I'm in package.json exactly uh you can actually X Out uh we will not need that for now awesome um so now we are installing node so at the moment cool yep I see the terminal node install. js I see so let me know when I should follow you because when I click follow it takes me to package.json okay yeah okay sure sure oh yeah that was the last file I was I had open but okay aara asks are we using es6 Imports in nodejs yes we will be using es6 Imports uh we are trying to keep everything with the newest stuff and we try to teach you guys the newest Technologies so of course we will be using es6 in nodejs and guys I think we are good with setting things up because we we actually back uh pass that point and yeah we initialize git repository and we are installing the dependencies nice nice so we are getting there we are finally finally finally getting there so another question Raya again she seems very active right now she asks are you guys going to use react Contex API or Redux we will be using react react context API so if you're more interested in uh Redux you can go ahead and watch Sunny's uh yesterday's video yesterday's live yeah uh with sunny because Sunny was showing uh Redux on that video okay nice testing libraries all those stuff yeah and I I already see that we got more and more files so if if you can actually click the top left corner uh there is those file file icons yeah and just open up that folder so we H we are uh actually getting everything set up uh we got lots of files in here and that's good that's what we won yeah yush Pand says yeah very well explained yesterday yep a lot of people got a lot of value from that Redux video that Sunny dropped and it's actually I think it's sitting on like 15,000 views in one day so apparently a lot of people are watching it it's amazing thank you a hey we got the react app let's get it yep hey finally okay so guys when it says happy hacking that's when you know everything is on the everything is working cool okay so I'm just going to uh CD into the project CD into yeah uh into the react app with the terminal so I'm just going to go ahead and type in CD of V now I'm inside there and if you are using oh my Z Sage you may be able to see git and between the parand there's a master that means the git reposit is initialized so and and you're currently on the master wrench so I'll just go ahead and type in mpm start just to see uh if everything is working correctly and Frankie it will open up a new uh browser window if you could uh go ahead and share it with everybody that would be awesome uh so actually it starts up on Local Host 3000 unless you have um something open on that board right do opened yep uh awesome and can you refresh it it shouldn't be looking like this H it's strange oh nice that's the one that that's what we wanted to see so guys if you are at this point it's a good place to be that is where we will be start going off okay uh let's go back to vs code right now and let's actually do our cleanup process awesome should I follow you so now yeah now now you should be following me so I'll be showing around uh you guys and if you pass a command J we will close up the terminal and if you press a command B it will close up the left bar so we will have more uh space on the screen for the code and actually if you could uh put the uh running react app next to the code that would be awesome Okay cool so we got this here and then running react app here yeah that's awesome okay there we go so this is react app ex out of the terminal um press command j instead I don't know if it stops the terminal or not just okay awesome okay so I'll be um I'll be showing the um cleanup process so first thing first we need to delete uh the second line which is importing the logo then we will need to actually delete everything uh inside of the div and I just uh like to start up the project with a H1 and like say hello clever programmers and now I saved it it should be some it should be rerender the whole page on the right hand side on of uh Frankie screen we saw right now that it it made it had a little bit of an error when you started typing and then all of a sudden it's refresh right yeah let's let's do a refresh I think it should be good now L clev programmers nice that's the one that that's the thing we wanted to see okay now let's go back to WS code and press command B okay and let's show the F let's show them the files because currently we are deleting all the test files so there was an app. test.js file I've already went ahead and deleted that now I'm actually deleting the setup test.js file right so we do not need those files you can just go ahead and get rid of them and now I'm also deleting the logo.svg file and this is something that we call the cleanup process so now we can actually uh hide the left hand side uh pressing command B and now we have all the things ready okay so I'm just going to go ahead and like mask things out um so we're starting off doing the front end right exactly I'm just going to sketch out a couple of stuff so that we know what we will be building so the app actually consists of three main parts one of them will be the sidebar uh the next one will be the actual feed and the third one will be it's kind of like the widgets and actually we're getting short in time so I'll be running uh pass through it like pretty fast uh the front and stuff so that everybody is getting as much value as possible guys feel free to stop the video at any time and just uh go ahead and try to build it at your own base but I actually recommend everybody just watching it and then uh try out the whole thing again after the live right and now it's the time for you to ask questions uh Sunny if you can go ahead and uh pop me any questions and like stop me at any time that would be awesome awesome with that said let's jump straight into building it okay so we will actually first have a Heather uh which is not in the jotting down so I'll just uh pop in header right here uh nice and let's actually create a folder uh which you can do by opening up the left side with command B and there is up top there is a little uh button which you can hit and say uh like name name the new folder components which I'm doing right now so we have a new folder called components I think yeah it's it's right inside of source nice and I'm adding a header. JS file and as well as a a header uh. CSS so guys with the um throughout this build we will be using es7 Snippets it's actually a nice little extension um that you can download for free for vs code and it allows me to code very quickly so if I go ahead and type in R off R afce uh that will create a react Arrow function component and will export it right so it's literally the initials of these words so if you kind of like know what your uh what you want to build uh you can actually create like a react class based component I think which is RCC right so that's actually a classbased component but uh and what Sunny likes to use is a react uh functional component and but I I actually prefer rafc because that will create an error function uh which for some reason what's up what's an arrow function for those that don't know yeah exactly exactly that's the as6 standard okay with that done I have actually created the header. JS file and now is the time to open up the terminal once again and I will stop the application from running can you open up the terminal with the command J there we go okay perfect and now I'm going to go ahead and start uh start importing a couple of dependencies so first thing first I'll be importing um material UI so I'm just going to go ahead and type in mpm install uh at oh mpm install at Material uh UI oh um what's happening in the terminal oh okay so it's just uh bugging out for me mpmi at materialui uh is it oh okay I see I see okay and and slash call and I think now we should be good and it's installing right rolled back failed op okay now it's what's up seems like it's okay mhm okay so it's installing nice nice awesome awesome so let's see if somebody dropped a question that's worth answering somebody asks what is the extension name again so it's called es7 react Redux graph QA Snippets but if you start typing in es7 Snippets and maybe put react uh it will give you give it it to you uh as the first one right okay so that's that's like a super powerful tool it saves you crazy amount of time actually uh and you want to go with uh saving time okay now we got that installed but we also need to install um material UI icons so I'm just going to go ahead and use the exact same uh command and just delete call from the end and type in icons instead so we are getting that as well yeah material UI icons is one of the most popular icons right now right in the it's a it's a very powerful um what's it called CSS Library exactly exactly exactly it's super powerful and it takes you after to the next level actually yeah you can pretty much find everything there it's awesome exactly I also heard that bootstrap stopped using material UI oh yeah so they have their own icons now right going on yeah exactly I mean it's so much better than than bootstrap right okay uh now with that done what we want to do is we kind of want to have like a logo um oh and we also be using BM naming convention so if you don't know what that is I highly recommend going going ahead and uh Googling it up uh but we will be using uh the BM naming convention and inside of the first div we will just name it um we will name it header right so that's part of the b b naming convention okay next up we kind of want to have uh a a logo and we want to have another div which will contain this logo right so I'm just going going to I have a snippet here already so I just created a new div and I've searched up the Wikipedia uh Facebook logo add in an ALT text of Facebook logo and I should be able to see it uh on the app which is not running at the moment so I'm just going to go ahead and type in mpm start and it will fire up uh on uh on Frankie's screen um with that done let's actually go ahead and import that into our app.js file right so I'm just going to go and start typing in header and it will it will or will not show up okay so it's not showing up at the moment so I have to import it manually so I'm going to go ahead and type in up top import header from um components slash header right okay now we should be good to go and we should be seeing a Facebook logo soon on the right hand side you can actually go ahead and uh refresh Frankie there we go nice so it's small I mean it's a it's it's an awesome looking logo thanks Mark very big logo yeah okay um next up we want to add an input uh right under the header uh which will just contain like it's going to be like a simple uh text input and I'm actually removing the H1 we do not need it anymore so we have the Facebook logo we have the input right there and what you want to do is import uh the the search icon from Material UI icon and that will actually yeah search icon see Nikita asks a question where were where are we deploying our back end uh so we will be deploying our backend on Heroku using Heroku guys yeah exactly we will be using Heroku okay nice uh now it should be good and on the right hand side if you scroll down we should be able to see a input field somewhere with a search icon yep here we go on the bottom uh yeah if I think you need to move our uh faces like actually you can move move the uh move our profile pictures oh yeah nice so it's a small one let me see if you guys you guys can't see it anymore but I'll bring it down to the screen so it's going to be here in the bottom guys give me one second I'm going to try to make it bigger so you guys can actually see so I'm scrolling down and making it bigger so you guys can see I'm going to show you with a pointer nice the search is going to be here nice exactly perfect awesome okay so with that done um we kind of have the searching fun fun ality we ALS so if you go ahead and check out the new Facebook uh Facebook header uh there are a bunch of icons in the middle so we will be creating another Dev and we will be adding a new uh another other uh other amount of icons so what I've done is I've created a div with a class name of header Center ENT and I've created an another div with uh called header option uh and I've added the head option active um class name right and inside of there there is a home icon which we want to be large so I'm adding the font size large in there and we also want to have like a flag icon um the subscription outlined icon and all these are actually almost the exact same thing as uh what they are using uh at Facebook and we of course we need to import all these uh icons I'm actually going to go ahead and divide as I'm importing so we are importing home flag subscription outline storefront and supervised user right and with saving that uh down there it should be showing all the icons right right yep so now I can see if I scroll down all the way down I can see I'm going to move our images from here so you guys can actually see right here in the middle so all of these icons is what David is talking about let me actually make it a little bit bigger for you guys and then scroll and then point it out so right there these are going to be the icons pretty much you can see the the flag to Play Store all of those things yeah awesome okay next up we will be creating the right side of the header right so I'm just going to go ahead and like create a new uh div which will have a class name of header whoa whoa whoa header right um why isn't my M working hold down okay so I'm just going to go ahead and manually create a div which will have a class name of uh header ride and we will be adding a couple of other stuff in there too so we will have another div uh which will have the class name of header info so these are going to be essentially the icons that you see on the right hand side so it will have the drop down the uh the add icon and all those kind the notification and all those kind of stuff right okay uh and we will also be importing the Avatar which is going to contain the image of the user that is currently logged in right so we want that to be uh on the screen okay so I've just added the AAR which is Curr Curr not imported um but yeah and we also are going to be adding a H4 which will contain the name of the user who is actively logged in so I'm just going to say uh Frankie logged in cool let me let me see so this is what you're talking about pretty much right let me show the people uh we yeah on the right hand side of the to uh top bar you can actually full screen that exactly that's the thing that I'm talking about in the right top right so that's the Avatar the picture is the Avatar and then the H4 is the the username that's logged in exactly exactly and I've added and now we are going to be adding all those icons next to it right awesome that's what we're working on right now yeah but before that I'm going to import a couple of uh dependencies these are all from uh material UI you don't have to worry about these just uh go ahead and and import them as we speak and you will be able to um make this application work all right with that done uh I'm going to import um first the add icon right then Forum icon then we will be uh oops we will be adding the notification active and we also need this other one nice so with that uh so if you go ahead and Frankie if you check it out M let's see so I'm going to click refresh and just refresh and down there we should be seeing new newer icons so I'm going to go here and I'm going to go down so you guys can check it out again I'm going to move our image here it doesn't go that down but let me actually full screen it a little bit more so right there so those icons where you see Frankie is going to be the ones that we're just adding In This Moment exactly exactly and we've also imported something called icon button which will make which will add a nice little animation to these icons so I'll be wrapping all these icons into icon button right and that will if you scroll down a little in the code um yeah so I'm actually wrapping everything uh inside of these icon buttons and that will make the whole thing like have like a nice little squiggle or like this uh nice effect so if you go ahead and like try clicking those icons on the right hand side that would be awesome to like show off uh how it actually looks like so let me actually it up see oh damn so I'm sharing it on my other screen I just want you guys to see it you can like make the um make the top smaller uh okay yeah so now if we click these right it's what David is talking about yeah exactly behavor super dope okay so I think with that done we are done with heather. JS for now uh what we want to do is we want to actually style this so let's go and actually import up top the uh header the uh CSS file nice uh and with that let's actually go into header at CSS and nice so we will be we will be uh adding like a couple of styling stuff so first thing first uh the whole header needs to have display Flex right um something is header CSS cannot found header CSS oh I think I I think I know what I uh where I made a mistake I need to add this uh at the actual bath okay nice um so we we adding this display Flex We will be adding uh 15 pixels top and bottom and we are adding 20 pixels right and left hand side padding uh for the whole uh thing we will be using justify content space between to actually space uh things nicely out uh we are making the header stick to the uh stick to the top so we are using position sticky uh we are setting the background color to white the Zen index is going to be 100 top is going to be zero because we actually want this to snap to the uh top and we actually want to uh give it like a nice little box Shadow this will all make sense when we uh style everything out okay so let's actually get that Facebook logo in order so we will need to have two uh two more styling stuff so up here uh we have the header left which is going to be display Flex right uh we have the justify content which is spaced evenly and right uh when I added the he of uh head for the image the logo uh to 40 pixels it actually all rendered out uh the way I want it to look like so as you can see it's currently it is display Flex right awesome um do we got any questions Frankie or are we good to go see Umar kusum Mani asks hey clever programmer can I make content for you guys yes my friend right now we're looking for developers that can actually you know speak in front of camera show other people how to you know build their skills as programmers if you guys are that person whether you know JavaScript maybe even in Python you know reach out to cazi at on Instagram and we'll be in touch you know review whether your skills are are good if you're a good fit for you know the company or everything but if you guys are interested in creating content for us you know we are currently looking for developers right David yeah that's right that's right okay with that said actually let's go and style the input awesome so we will be uh adding like a header input uh which is like we want the whole thing to be like Flex right so as you can see on the right hand side uh everything is so the whole um display uh or whole input uh got aligned into a row yeah and we want the items to be aligned in the center that's why it's like in the uh middle uh we want to set the background color to this E2 F5 uh nice little color thing because that's actually the exact same color that Facebook uses uh for their uh input fields we also want like a 10 pixel of padding uh margin on the left as well and the Border radius of 33 pixels now we also want that uh ugly looking input field to like kind of like be transparent and we will be just adding like a header input uh and like actually notice that I'm in um I'm targeting the input inside of header input right so I set the bordered none background color to transparent and the outline width to zero nice uh next up we have the header Center which we actually want to have display Flex again and we wrote Flex one here because we want the uh the header Center to take use as much space as it needs as possible and we just want everything to be uh in the center okay nice and if we go back to header. JS now um here is something I want to call your uh attention to so we are adding header options inside of header center right and that's what we are going to be targeting right now so for header options of course we want to have display flx we want to have them aligned to the center we want to uh add zero padding uh top and bottom I actually added a little bit of cheat sheet over here uh Frankie can you scroll up a bit uh in the CSS file nice so so the comment in here here is actually a bit of a cheat sheet um oh I think I lost the connection to the editor again to live sh yeah uh that's weird I still see you here can you actually follow me no you're not following me because I'm clicking around I see let me see try again yeah I think I see you are you in Justified content um nope I'm actually not in the file now it says uh the host seems to be offline again that's weird we kept getting that connection problem so should we do the same thing that I just did yeah yeah let's actually restart the whole vs code on your end and won't take long so let's just command Q out of X code I mean sorry Visual Studio code then open it up again waiting for it to load awesome what we're going to do now is invite David again seems like we're losing connection yeah seems like we need to do it a couple of times so start collaboration session done sign in with GitHub let's get it currently signing in with GitHub once again let's see so I'm just doing this on my other screen guys so you guys don't have to you know go through the whole process again yeah like I mean live share was such an awesome tool and then it started to have all these bugs I think it's actually a bug on their side yeah I I we had this issue with the sunny last time uh for some reason L the okay got the new got the new link nice open it up okay so I'm joining at the moment as we speak I see you're here okay nice um it says you left though once again it says joining now you joined again okay nice awesome awesome yeah I see all the files now okay perfect okay uh can you follow me Target is not currently editing a shared document uh that's not true okay um let's try that I go into header. JS still I'm in header. CSS now there we go so I think okay sure now I'm following you yep now I'm following you okay nice okay so what I what I left off is that I left a little bit of cheat sheet over here so if you add these two properties into petting it will mean that the first number is going to be uh for top and bottom and the second one is going to be for left and right and we are going to be using that again with the header options so uh I'm just going to pop it in so header option we have a display Flex uh we will be aligning them into the center um we are adding padding like no padding up top and down below and we will have 30 pixels of padding like uh in between them and whenever we hover them hover over them we want the cursor to be a pointer okay next up let's actually make it look super nice whenever we hover over them so uh whenever you hover over like actually we need to add like a colon here uh with a hover Word file following so first up we got uh we want to set the background color to the Facebook Gray uh I'm just going to call it Facebook Gray from now on uh we want to set the Border radius to 10 pixels uh align them Center of course um with the same padding and we want to disable uh B border and buttom right and one thing that we want to do as well is to set nicely and blue uh set those apps to completely blue oh I think uh I think we need to fire up the application again because it's not updating can you give me yeah perfect okay so I'm typing in mpm start yeah it goes ahead and does oh um sear file directory oh I see see okay yeah I I know what happens so I wasn't in the correct folder yeah B and PM uh start nice so now we should be able to see it updating on the right hand side as I do decoding so let's wait a little while it starts the development server and so it's loading up the page again right what's up it's loading up the page again yeah yeah ah yeah that's the one uh can you full screen it yes so what we just done is uh those Center icons right so you can see that uh the one that we actually uh made active is now uh the Facebook blue because uh I'll be explaining it a little bit and we also also have those uh hover over effects right so it can just hover over uh one of the icons nice so that that's the other thing we did two things right it's it's the it's two things on the hover over it's one it makes the mouse a pointer and two exactly it makes the background gray so you know you want to make design very much intuitive because sometimes you know you add icons but you don't add the hover effects like this and it doesn't give directions to your user to let them know that you can actually click on these icons exactly that's right that's right okay let's go back to the code so down here I've actually added this uh mui SG icon D root and that is actually a class name which is automatically added to all the uh icons inside of material UI so if you don't know what this is this is basically targeting thing all the um material UI icons inside of the header option active class right that's all you need to that that's how you need to translate it for yourself okay we also want to add uh to the active icon some nice little uh border button so it will actually show that this is the active stuff uh can you full screen the uh current build yes go nice so you can actually now see if I go ahead and remove that for a bit um it just it just disappeared that little uh blue line right on the home yeah now it should be there very soon um so let's refresh the app so see it I couldn't save it actually okay oh damn uh you can remove the uh command oh connection is lost again from live share mhm what is happening with live share today man it's crazy I don't know I have no clue dude let see I'm going to invite you again here's the link I'm not get to x out of it this time though okay okay it says you you seem to be offline again okay so when that what is going on yeah when that happens what I have to do then is just cancel find Visual Studio code this this has been working so let's continue doing it and save you guys a little bit of time and then start collaboration set session there we go and here should be the next link David you go bro okay let's try it out okay nice it's loading okay hey likes to restart the whole application like five times yeah oh cool I just saw you join let me see let me actually follow you okay nice okay so I'm just removing command from the uh from that bro cool and it says okay live share failed to update oh Jesus what's going on wait did I see you or did you just leave again okay no no it's there okay it's there okay nice oh okay it's live it's working finally Yuri is like live share ever programmer promoted you so much is this the way you pay back kind of okay um so we now need to yeah so oh my God the other one just died we got so many sessions open okay so with that okay nice so I've just added two more um two more properties here one of them is going to uh trigger all these um all these material UI icons and make them gray all the other ones right yeah so the active is going to be blue and all the other ones are going to be gray uh gray and we actually want them to turn blue whenever you hover over them so if you can go ahead and demo that that would be awesome awesome so let's actually make this full screen so you guys can check it out should I reload it yeah no no no uh I mean oh hold on I think yeah because uh because I need access to the terminal again so I do command shift p right command shift p and then share terminal then read and write there you go yeah okay um um okay boom nice okay I think yeah M awesome boom there we go and now I just go ahead and type in start says hey guys I'm going to go head out now I need to do some important work see y'all in the community awesome thara is one of the pwj students if you guys are finding any value in any of these teachings any of these bills that we're getting out for you guys make sure to click the link in the description below it's going to be the first link and that link is going to take you to a free 1hour training on how to actually profit and make money from JavaScript as well as you know develop those JavaScript skills so if you're interested in that exactly click the link below right David yeah exactly just click it it's going to be a session uh I think by kazy right okay I think the app now should be running okay so now let's let's actually reload it I don't think I even had to do that but now they're turning blue now you can see they turn blue that's it right that's the that's the thing we wanted to uh see okay uh let's go and I'll let the rest because I don't know how much connection do we got so header info we want it to be uh display Flex We want everything to be centered and we want the text to be uh have a margin left of 10 pixels we also want the header right to have uh display flex and you can demo that too so it's going to be the right hand side of your screen with the uh Avatar and all those kind of stuff uh Frankie can you can you show it let me see um so the Avatar is this yeah so now everything is streamlined added to the center and made made like we arranged them nicely yeah so they used to be all in the middle now they actually have a little bit of order to it and it looks like a like an actual navigation bar type of thing right you got the Avatar over here with a username you got the menu buttons right here and then we also got the input field right here together with the exactly yeah okay so that pretty much concludes the header build let's go ahead and create this sidebar um so what you want to do is go ahead and create a new file in the components folder yeah is it the left sidebar or the right sidebar that we're working uh left sidebar so the right sidebar is actually going to be widget yeah so I'm just going to go ahead and create a sidebar. JS file as well as a sidebar. CSS file currently I think I'm not following you so let me let me go back to it says that I'm following you okay okay yeah I for some reason it's not creating again there we go go you're in display Flex right now nope I'm nowhere actually um yeah connection is lost again wow I have no clue what's what's going on okay I'm going to do it faster now I don't know why this is happening today yeah let's see but it's nothing that we can't tackle or we can't fix so moving right ahead with this now what I'm going to do is start collaboration session yes yep now I'm going to send you the new link on Skype let's get it boom sent now what I'm going to do is I'm going to share the terminal as well and read and right for you okay perfect now I'm joining and all this kind of stuff and hopefully 10th time let's get it yeah yep let's crush it hey everybody by the way how do you like the build we got the header component ready for y'all it looks amazing amaz amazing hover over functionalities to it now we're going to make it even prettier oh damn it says uh your network connection is poor mine and I couldn't I couldn't join uh because some Network issue it says it's your oh my God it says you're offline again it's so annoying let me see um okay I'll start up slack and I'll start dropping uh the code piece by piece to you and just say whatever um you need to put it okay let's do that while that happens and yeah going to try it again okay I'm going to need to open up slack for now okay perfect kis remember yeah yeah it's kazy okay um boom okay uh try out this new session just invited you again no okay let's try it out if it doesn't work let's just go with the uh slack way of doing yep he joined now I'm going to share the terminal read and right okay here we go s boom now um says you're currently not in the shared document I think you're still getting in so I just um I'm still loading okay let's not waste too much time on this it for some reason it doesn't load at all now um let's go with the other way okay so I'm going to drop you the whole side let's uh okay so let's actually create a are you in the folder I'm actually not even in the folder now I don't see it right so Commando yep M maybe that's why I couldn't start the session with you okay so I'm here now I'm in the folder right yeah yeah yeah okay um let's go ahead and create a new file called sidebar. JS uh with a capital S inside of source and uh inside source and components so let's click components components uh it's it's right yeah okay so that's where you want to go ahead and create a new file yeah and that's going to be uh sideb the JS with a capital S at the front uh no no no uh like the Side Bar yeah yeah uh just simple J yep perfect and what I want you to do uh paste in there is going to be a snip it um okay I just uh sent you the snippet on slack and I'm going to explain what's what so let's go ahead copy everything from there and just uh Chuck it in there nice so what this is so up top we are actually importing all Lads of kind of emojis and um and all those icons that uh we are going to be using inside of the um inside of the component and then we are actually creating the component so actually there is a line that we do not need so con user dispatch uh line 15 you can delete that we will be adding that later on okay um so uh and we also okay so it's going to freak out because uh the sidebar row is not actually created just yet so uh the first cbar row has uh user photo URL we don't need those let's just uh for further URL let's just leave that completely empty um here user photo URL yeah and and the source uh user Side Bar Row first one I just delete everything and just add like a um okay hold on uh let me let me send it again uh okay uh boom I'm actually G to try okay let me prep stuff for you I'm going to to do the start collaboration session once again okay okay let's try that too so that's the new link check it out okay let's try it out hopefully this time around it will work nice so I see Joel green answered to Daniel so this is I think a good answer for the questions it's awesome that our community is active enough to help other beginner people you know other beginner developers answer the questions and Joel green says at Daniel capitalize your document names it's how react can know it's a file and can be used as a JS tag exactly exactly that's why I had to capitalize the s in the sidebar. JS file that's right were you able to jump in was it loading uh it is actually loading as we speak Peak awesome that's cool I've just sent you the new snippet uh let's actually change everything to that cool let's see what the new snippet is got it okay nice and just uh delete everything and and chck that in okay so I'm going to do command B to hide that and then I'm going to actually do this and okay so what we are doing up top is we are importing uh the sidebar. CSS file we are up uh we are importing the sidebar row component uh next up which is not yet created but we will be created uh in a minute then we are uh importing a bunch of icons uh the local hospital Emoji flag people chat storefront video library expand more we are importing all these icons and then uh Down Below in the return section the rendering session uh section of the file we are actually uh adding a sidebar row uh which the first one will not have a source and the second uh and the title is going to be Frankie that is going to be showing the active user at the moment and once we set up our data layer that's where um that's where our uh the photo URL and all those kind of stuff will go uh next up we will have like a the local hospital icon as the icon that we pass in and the title is going to be covid19 information center we also have it for Pages we also have it friends messenger Marketplace videos and more and in in order that that's uh how we add all those icons into the project so you yes you can actually uh pass through um icons to other components let's actually uh go ahead and create the sidebar row. JS file um you can do that uh on the left hand side I'm still joining actually the uh session okay so I create a new file or what yeah yeah yeah so it's going to be called sidebar row with a capital S and capital r so it's like camo casing yeah sidebar row um this right side bar row. JS yeah we Capital yeah that's exactly and we want to have actually a sidebar that uh CSS and the sidebar row. CSS so another one called sidebar. CSS right yeah sidebar. CSS and sidebar row. CSS side r. CSS awesome and then we got and the sidebar row. CSS side. CSS that's right okay um so sidebar row and actually uh inside of side oops sidebar. CSS we're not adding too much stuff uh we pretty much just uh adding these things um let me send it to you real quick uh see this maybe try closing your Visual Studio code yeah I I can try that too yeah okay I'm going to Comm and Q out of it and see and I'll add that sidebar thing to the sidebar. CSS file right exactly got it seems like joined the collaboration session now I see you and now I'm following you awesome now I'm going to show you the the terminal so short terminal and read and write dope got it nice perfect okay I think I'm I'm I'm back here nice okay perfect uh are you following me actually let's go everybody yep yep I'm following you I think that deserves a air horn okay fine back in the game bro let's get it yeah okay so one thing I want to add is inside of sidebar the div should have the class name of uh sidebar right so other so any other way we will not be able to Target it nice okay um I'm going to uh yeah perfect okay mpm start I just fired up the project so it should be running in any minute also we have 170 people live at this moment thank you guys so much for being here and staying throughout the whole technical difficulties but like I said man it's part of the journey it's part of being a developer thank you guys for being here we're at $26 in chat donations thank you guys so much air for y thank you so much guys appreciate it yeah uh are you following me actually let me see yep app oh damn connection lost again hey let's get it yeah I'll just I'll just do everything just um send me send me the the Snippets and I'll and I'll make sure to do I'll go let's go with the Snippets okay so inside of sidebar yeah nice okay so let's actually go ahead and set up the sidebar uh row. CSS file right so so sidebar sidebar row that's CSS okay is going to be what I just boom um so we are pretty much targeting targeting the whole thing uh Frankie is going to be able to copy it very soon yep so make sure I get everything for y'all okay sidebar row awesome yeah side row CSS nice there we go okay so first thing first we were targeting the whole thing uh we want to have it display Flex align them to Center padding 10 pixels cursor pointer we also want to make it light gray and have a border radius of 10 pixels when we are hovering over those stuff uh and we actually want all the all the text inside of there because remember uh there is text in there uh which is currently we haven't built just yet um but we will be do it very soon so the text in there should have a margin left of 20 20 pixels and the font weight of 600 and side by row and Target all the um material UI icons and have the font size uh like extra large and the Facebook blue give it yeah yeah the Facebook blue uh Facebook blue nice okay um so what we need to have inside of sidebar row that JS is going to be this nice so I just sent you the component nice see okay set by row that's the component jsjs okay so open up in the files .js here we go boom yeah and just B it so pretty much what we do is we are importing Avatar and we are importing the Side Bar the JS file um and inside and there is like we're destructuring everything that we are passing through inside to this component right um and then we are uh creating a div uh which will have the Avatar and which will receive uh a source and if we have an icon we are uh dropping in the icon which is also popped into uh as a dependency to the uh component okay so with that said actually if you could go ahead and uh start running the server that will be great so just open up a terminal and let's okay so it's running um let's actually go into Google Chrome then and see how it is nice just uh refresh the whole thing refreshing here we go I don't think it's saved right um yeah let's go back to um yeah and with a control C you can uh shut out like sometimes it forgets to render uh let's just type yeah and just let's uh type in mpm start again npm start yeah so it's it's refreshing or loading up actually yeah nice that's good that's good little bit of time LOL I remember what we haven't done so let's go back to app.js and app.js okay yep exactly and what you need to do is import uh the sidebar from the component slide sidebar just sent you the command to it uh yep and you need to import the whole component up top nice and then you also need to add uh the the actual sidebar to the app oh uh and you need to close the tag uh instead of the dot I I made a typo close the tag like that uh nope no no no uh you need that like uh down there down below uh at line three line 10 no no no line 10 yeah that's where that's where you're actually adding the uh the sidebar component right okay but what do I add here the semicolon or the apostrophy I just delete that that uh delete this side bar yep and you actually want to add uh this add side okay so close it I see yeah yeah awesome so now close the Side Bar yeah just like that perfect now it should be importing uh and something is going south on up there uh if you can just go ahead and uh import it again I don't can see what what's up let's see okay let's see I'm in app.js import should I put it on the top all the way to the top or something no no no that should be good actually uh no wait hold on um CSS what kind of what kind of is it not like CSS or something no no no no no no no it should be like that uh the quesa mark uh what kind of quesa Mark is it apostrophe right oh it's the other one so it should be this one yeah and let's change the first one as well should be it should be this one right and then change this one to this one yeah and yeah it adds a double in uh and just Del a second okay that should be good okay so it was a wrong okay apostrophe yeah okay what what's it saying now uh can you make it hold on let me let me try the zoom uh I can't no no no um just can you just show the error message okay can sidebar to comp something's something not right um this side BJs well hello I may may be in in the uh code actually oh h on 91 wait so you're back here now I can follow you or what I think so yeah that's crazy okay okay that's okay I don't know what what's going on awesome sorry guys this is um bit crazy today but we're going to go we're going to get through it guys stick around you guys are going to learn a lot of things definitely a lot okay nice is not defined yes okay so what I'm doing now is basically import uh creating the whole thing again and for some reason um import Avatar something is not going well four um okay we might need to add like an actual um link actual link to it uh okay so I'm grabbing one copy image address um yeah right there now it's uh it's about sidebar row somebody says there is an error in line four okay it says now it's working okay okay check it out on the right hand side oh I see so I see finally beautiful okay so I'm gonna make it should I make it full screen uh yeah yeah let's actually check it out and yeah this is how it's looking right now this is the Avatar with Sunny's face and with the my name your name yes yeah this is the Side Bar okay so if you hovering over it uh is it working so I see the pointer but I don't see I don't see the other okay so it failed to to compile right now there we go just restarted mhm checking out the hover effects they don't appear yet seems like it hasn't refreshed for those side bar row without CSS oh my God now this is getting to become a debu session again yep yep shakar asks why don't you guys add a session in the mongod DB then you won't need to log in every time you reload the page we could do that but that would like be like lots of work and I lost the connection once again that's a good idea okay l guess I lost the connection again okay let me know what Snippets I should add so that we can proceed with it not right now while we do that I'll also share another link or something because we need to get this fixed apparently yeah live share is giving us attitude guys yeah we definitely need to find an alternative because this is just um ruining a lot of stuff let's see you want to share with me few snippet of codes so I can start doing it um I mean let's fix this first um can you actually share uh the eam viewer with me uh so I can have a better view what's going on so you need to find I thought I was already sharing eam with you no oh yeah on Skype yeah yeah like just just a uh just cam okay uh don't matter it says you just left the collaboration session awesome let's see okay I'll try try to commment Q out of it again and see if that solves the issue so that I can let me see share collaboration session there we go then I got it here I'm going to send you the new one I just messaged Sunny see if he has a solution for the debugging of the live share should say open and browser try that okay start a live share in the browser start a live share in the browser he says h should we test that out let's see let's see so second so M shift p start C how do we do it in the browser though you know how I have no clue okay it says you're offline again I think there is kind of like some connection issue uh on your end so I'll stop collaboration uh I don't know actually can you zip the zip the file and try if I go ahead and uh do the live share with you and then like present that okay so just tell me how do I zip it okay so let's go let's find the containing folder uh where the project is second yeah okay so what were you saying um in finder just uh find the folder where where the project is yes so it's going to be and umh okay nice uh going to Facebook M no no no uh go into Facebook M and delete the known modules folder delete it okay yep just delete it done nice and go out and zip out the whole uh third 30th of September yeah yeah just compress and drop it over on slack and I try to work it out dope so dropping it over on slack nice where's the your disc hopefully just hopefully this will work okay uh send it sent so it's loading up for you and it's about let me see right there there we go nice Okay um I'm saving it I'll be there with you guys in a moment just debugging this right now let me see while this is going on I'm going to start another collaboration session just cuz um I'll I'll start uh I'll start one and drop it to you and hopefully uh you will be able to join that and then and then we are going to be able to work it the other way around so that I go ahead and uh do all this stuff okay so joining Visual Studio code awesome there is no application to set open okay now I'm installing all the dependencies which would have taken crazy amount of time if you zip them so while you're uh loading up your vs code to share it I'll just go ahead and um set everything up and how do I I'm here I'm here on this thing but it doesn't let me join it should just refresh refresh and it should uh pop up uh that it wants to open vs code uh what's it saying what if we try doing it through the browser because that's what Sunny said right now I mean I'm trying to send you a collab session so that I am going to be hosting the project and you will be able to uh connect it through it and then share what I'm doing uh on my computer and then it's going to be uh I mean it's going to be the other way around it's just I'm going to be the host yeah the only thing is I can't actually choose the visual studio code insiders see what I mean I'm go back to Applications it doesn't it doesn't actually let me choose it join manually what does that mean let's see join a session manually oh so Sunny's calling me what's up Sunny yes um is it the full Facebook David yes right it's the whole it's the whole Facebook Facebook yeah right now we're doing the sidebar okay in that case rest mean okay okay do it so it says I'm just trying to see yeah so I'm trying to so David actually sent me a link and I just open it up but the thing is right now it's loading and it doesn't actually let me choose you code as the southware to should I try browser or something yes David has the code and shared with me his live share I mean it was the other way around up until nowen another zo M so yeah that's what set mic and do a screen awesome so I share my screen right of of him sharing his screen on Zoom got it okay let's go that way it's one crazy way but do that then thanks man appreciate it okay [ __ ] crazy all right yeah so that's what we're going to have to do guys what we're going to do is David is going to share his code through Zoom so I'm going to open up you want to send me a zoom link uh yeah we can okay so we're doing Zoom okay yeah so you're going to be sharing your screen through Zoom make sure to mute the mic and I'll make sure I'll mute it for my end and then I'll be sharing that with the people okay okay so I'm just joining Zoom and starting up in a bit sorry for the technical difficulties guys but it's what doesn't kill you makes you stronger as the quote says and exactly right now we're going to be strong [Laughter] AF okay um so I'm waiting for you to do the okay let's you can actually go ahead and uh join the zoom I'll be setting up everything uh once again um boom like all the stuff that we got yeah razi there we go Zoom is loading up now I'll join I'll Jo with audio but let me just mute it there we go mhm so okay so now now we should be good to go we are connected on Skype we're connected on Zoom perfect awesome just make sure to to actually zoom in a little bit more on the code cuz it's a little bit small for me MH okay okay I have it have everything zoomed okay guys so uh I'm just in before uh the things went crazy before creating the sidebar so I'm just going to go ahead and do the sidebar thing again so I'm creating a sidebar. JS I'm doing the RFC who I'm I'm doing the RFC rafc stuff uh that we have already done um and I'm going to be creating so I'm going to be importing a bunch of stuff uh which are essentially all the material UI icons that we are using throughout this um this very um what you call it component right and down here I'm actually adding a class name of uh of sidebar and that's what we uh we will have here okay and I'm also adding a couple of uh sidebar uh elements uh hopefully this time we will uh we will have everything uh working uh and the title is going to be Frankie nice and we also need to import the CSS file which I haven't created just yet and let's do it right now and we also need yeah uh so we have the side barow so I'm actually dividing it up a bit so guys you can actually go ahead and copy this uh code so what I'm doing here I'm importing react with the normal rafc uh type of stuff I'm importing the sidebar row component which is not defined yet but we will get there in a bit uh I'm importing all these icons which are going to be used in here and essentially these are going to be on the left hand side uh where uh all the sidebar is going to sidebar stuff is going to happen uh we have all this text in there that we want uh want it to display I'm removing all these lines and the first line essentially is going to be the one that will have a icon uh which will show the logged in person's uh face and the name but we are actually mocking these out with uh with a couple of um data So currently it should be sunny Sunny's face and Frankie's name which is kind of crazy but that's what I had on my clipboard okay let's go ahead ahead and create the side whoops uh let's go ahead and create the side uh bar. CSS file which we are already importing and we have already um have it okay nice so we are actually adding a padding uh up top and down below at 25 pixels and 10 pixels to the right and the left and we are also adding a flux uh of 33 nice so with that done I'm just going to go ahead and uh close that and let's see if actually it this thing loads up but this doesn't load up because I haven't imported it into app.js so now is the time to go ahead create a new row and go ahead and type your uh sidebar and if you can oh damn uh sidebar so I want you to see it on the right hand side that it is saying Auto Import so it's actually importing it right right here so you need to add that line if it doesn't import it for you but because it did for me uh I don't have to worry about that can you actually zoom in a little bit more on the code David oh yeah sure uh is it cool okay nice um something is going yeah uh because I don't have the sidebar uh row file ready just yet but I'm just going to go ahead and create that so sidebar row. Js nice uh I'm just going to go RFC perfect so with that done this is how the application looks like right now why it's not showing anything uh good good question because we are importing this stuff uh which doesn't actually have any single thing uh inside of uh there right so if you go ahead like sidebar o doesn't actually do anything so actually what I'm going to be doing is I will be adding all this stuff so we are actually capturing the source which will be the link uh for the Avatar right so you can see it right here I'm uh I'm also passing in an icon and a title uh which will be used for the actual um the actual uh yeah so this is what h what is happening at the moment right and actually one thing that we forgot with the um C no no no with with the cleanup process at the very beginning which is my mistake uh is cleaning up app.css so we just go ahead and delete everything from app. CSS I'm sorry guys uh this is being a rough day and we also need to add a star uh which is margin zero uh to the index. CSS okay now uh we should be good to go yeah so now everything is getting uh in order uh we got Sunny's face we got Frankie we got all these uh logos so it's getting good actually believe it or not we are going to be on track do we got any show the app on the side of the code um yeah I can do then boom okay nice uh and I will actually make it a little bit smaller and then I can so I can okay so is the code easily readable yes nice okay uh so we have the application on the right hand side I will just make it bigger once we are uh once I'm showing something and otherwise it will be like this small okay so now I will be actually going ahead and creating the uh sidebar row. CSS file uh and closing that thing and I'm actually importing it because we're going to be using that for the styling and for the sidebar row uh we have a couple of stuff going on so notice that uh on the right hand side uh we actually had these things done right so what essentially happens is that we added a display Flex to the whole thing so every single row will be uh flexibly displayed that means it will be passed into a one row everything is going to be aligned to Center ping is going to be 10 10 pixels cursor pointer uh Side by row hover so whenever I hover over them you see this is the animation that that you got right and so that's the light gray background and the Border radius of Thum pixels so notice it's not not too huge but you can actually see uh that there is a border radius right so that's H that's crazy okay um nice and we also added uh every single row like 20 pixels margin left and the font weight of 00 nice and we also targeted all the uh material UI icons right so remember all these uh all these little icons have a have this uh class name where and we targeted them to be extra large and we added them the Facebook blue color nice with that done uh we can say that we are done with the Side Bar hey that serves an air horn air horn on the time nice okay uh let's actually go ahead and start covering up the feed so what are we going to be doing the with the feed uh we actually have the H whoa there is some party going on in here so the feed is going to be this part uh where we have all these stories we have um we actually have couple more components this is one uh uh big uh big component which will have a couple more components right we also have this as the message sender component and we also have this huge po which will have a couple more smaller components so I hope this visual breakdown helped a lot for you guys and actually this is what we are going to be working with uh right now so I'm just going to go back to my local one and let's actually go ahead and create uh the necessary stuff so we will have a feed. JS file which will which will have a couple of stuff inside of it okay so let's start up with an rafc awesome and we will be importing a couple of stuff but let's just not uh worry about those for now um what we will have is basically um boom so we will have we will give a class name of feed um right here we will be uh importing the story real uh which is actually uh this part all right so that whole thing uh which will like have more stuff we will have the message sender which is this part and this is something that we will be do later on all right so uh let's actually add a bog post instead of this and we will be using it later on when we have the back end ready right so so let's actually create the story real first and the message sender first um so let's create a story real. JS file and the uh message sender. JS file nice um so I'm going to be adding this is not going to be used yeah okay perfect so now we have a not crashing application that's a good uh good sign um store real what's up that's always a good sign yeah exactly I love the story today right I love the story real components because they make it so that it's not just you know a blank kind of like an input bar and you like you know it seems it adds so much layout to it it adds like almost Dimension to it other like otherwise it would look a little bit Tod in my opinion so it's good experience yeah so I actually got these crazy images from the internet I just uh typed in obstruct portrait I think and got all these uh all this stuff okay so what we will be having inside of here is basically a class name which will be story real right because we somehow we need to uh Target all this stuff and we will actually adding more uh components inside of here right so we want to have like a story which has a couple of stuff like an image a profile pick whoops profile pick and a name which will be a title this time so this is what we want to have now um okay so perfect uh what we want to have is create a new file which will be story. JS we got a tons of components this time guys this is crazy okay so the story is basically importing the Avatar right because that's what we will be using for the person's Avatar Photo on the story we're going to have the H1 that's going to be the title which is going to be the name and this is where we are putting the um stories so sorry the person's profile Source right okay um and we ALS o want to have like a background image uh for the whole uh div which will be the image URL which we are passing in from the story rail right and we are currently notice that we are using inline styling which is literally like adding a style to the div which we uh and we're adding the background image which is going to be have a URL and we are passing in the actual URL into that uh styling right and the class name is going to be story so that we can style the whole thing nicely now let's actually uh go ahead and import and make it look nice but first um let's actually import is the background image the the art pictures that you got exactly exactly exactly so I went back to app.js so that we can actually check this thing out later on when it works not now of course uh but notice that I've imported it again with Auto Import okay all right um so inside a feed so message sender is not def yeah uh what happened is that story real wasn't important as well as uh message sender either yeah so I'm Auto importing everything you need to have these two lines of code to in order to make this app working nice so now we have it so store real uh we basically want to go ahead and import a story right it's again it's going to be Auto importing and we will be passing in a couple of stuff that we just had in here right so image profile source and title those are the stuff that we want to uh import inside of there um and I actually have these uh ready um story real so uh we will be adding those like this so we're adding the image which is going to be um story. CSS um because I haven't created it just yet so this is currently how our story looks like kind of ugly MH uh but yeah and I'm adding two more and you can literally like pass in whatever kind of image you want in here and whatever profile Source you want in here and the name again doesn't really matter as long as you're passing in these three uh properties right so and so the story is just going to go ahead and render everything everything out nicely uh on the right hand side okay so let's actually go ahead and create this story so create all the uh CSS files that we will be uh needing so we will need a message sender. CSS we will need a story. CSS um story real CSS and I think everything has a CSS and ajs pair nice so um so the story real but CSS is basically not going to be uh super complicated we just want it to be display flex but in order for to make it actually work uh we need to we need to actually go ahead and Import in right import um story real. CSS right so now we have everything in one row nice that is perfect yeah exactly uh okay with that done um let's actually go to the story. CSS file and let's make the story look super nice so what we want to have is basically uh add a position relative uh we want to like Center the background like this we want to go ahead and and like have the image uh cover the whole background right uh so that's going to be background size because remember we actually uh added it as an inline styling so the background image is going to be the image we pass in right so the uh it needs to cover it doesn't repeat we want to make sure that it only shows up once the width is going to be 120 pixels head is going to be 200 pixels uh we are adding a nice little box shadow of uh with these uh properties and we are actually adding a border radius of temp pixels um with a margin right of 10 pixels as well cursor pointer uh cursor needs to be a pointer right so when I hover over uh you you can see it turns to a pointer right okay and we also want like a nice little transition yeah which we will be adding just now so if I go ahead and hover over it uh it should be scaling right beautiful yeah you can even see the Shadows under it so the Shadows actually make those images pop up a little bit more they're very subtle but if you see under the images you can see a little bit of Gray gray right there's a little bit of gray gives a dimension makes it seem like they're pop out plus the animation is called ease in and so that's that's what you're seeing right now okay so this is how we created all these stories nice we also want to Target the story Avatar uh and add the margin of 10 pixels and the border of five pixels we want to make it uh we want to make it like really look like like Facebook is so notice that there is uh that nice little uh border we also added a little bit of uh margin here and here and we also made the Border look the Facebook blue and it's actually right uh like true here H as well as it's true over here nice and we also want to uh position the text nicely so we we add the position absolute uh the bottom is going to be like we want it uh 20 pixels from the bottom we want uh 20 pixels from the left hand side and we add a white color to it just like this right so this is the uh left 20 pixels this is bottom 20 pixels looks white and yeah that's pretty much uh setting up the individual stories that's setting up the names right on those on those covers yeah and and actually the story is is this we now we need to uh move the story real up there uh it's going to be happening very soon awesome okay um so to actually put the story reel next to uh the sidebar what we need to do is go into app.css whoops we need to go into app.css and we actually want to make the background like this uh this Facebook is white oops and we want to have we want to add the app. body to have a display Flex which is for some reason doesn't seem to be uh nicely loading but we will get there very soon okay um nice perfect okay that's CSS uh we now want to go ahead into um yep so we are kind of done with uh these stories let's actually figure out why these are not uh going next to the um right there okay we will we we will figure it out uh in just a bit let's actually go and go ahead and create the message sender um so the message sender is going to be where you make the posts pretty much right on the Facebook exactly yeah that's right so the message sender is going to be this part we will be working on this part right now okay um so the we are actually in the message sender uh. JS right now and kind of like what we want to do is uh just let's just first uh make it look nice so we pretty much have uh we want to add the class naming which is going to be uh message sender of course um we want so it is it's actually divided to two parts there is a top and a bottom as you can see on the right hand side uh I'll be zooming in a bit somebody in the comments says is says or is mail says app.js add class name appor body oh that's right nice okay got very active Community here and thank you so much SM smile thank you so much man yeah appreciate your help oh yeah um sometimes you get course if I don't add it it's not going to work sometimes you add so much thank you so much into the the actual dirt that you forget to you know have a bigger vision of what's going on it's it's very natural oh hold on okay something oh because I've add added the header inside there okay there we go there we go I just fix it awesome man okay so what I did uh and thank you so much for the comment so I added this uh class name the app. body and I just wrapped the sideb and the feed and later on the widgets that are going to come here as well inside of here and what you need to uh make sure is that the header is outside right so as you can see it's not in the app. body okay um let's actually go back to the message sender. JS nice so what we will have we will have a message sender uh top and that will contain an avatar oh I'm going to hide the left side so we will have an avatar which will have a source uh I'm just going to pop in um the usual Sunny image yeah and yeah it's right there uh you can already see it it's right there nice and we also want to have a form uh which will pretty much contain an input actually uh two inputs one of them is going to be a text and the other one is going to be for a file so we will literally go ahead and we will be uploading files to mongod DB right so so the input so the text input is going to be a type of text um we will have a place holder with them what's on your mind and on change we will be triggering off the E uh we will be setting the input so we want to save the input so we need to introduce a UST State hook right and that's something we haven't imported yet so we need to import them of course and that is kind of and that is actually a way of um saving like like adding variables to react so we will have a const input um and set input and we will be using it as a use State uh and initially this will be completely empty right so inside of here uh the input field is going to be a type of text we'll have the class name uh we'll have the placeholder what's in your mind the value is going to be from this state and whenever we hit a button we want to have uh we want to uh set the input to this uh thing right so whatever we press we want to save it inside of input yo what's up yeah I was just saying that it's it's taring targeting the value that you're inputting right exactly exactly that's right that's right so next up what we want to do is import uh the input as well so it's going to be a material UI input and what we need to do is Define the uh Define what how we will be uploading files so we will need to have the input with the type file with the this uh class name and we will be uh introducing an on handle change function which is essentially not going to be doing uh something super fancy it's basically going to be uh setting the image which is going to be an other um and that's going to be other um uh use state so what oops once these are done we just want them want to uh sa whatever is in input and whatever we uploaded to the uh file uh to the as a file okay next up we will be creating the sub Handle Sub submit which is essentially not going to be doing anything for now uh only when we um when we created the back end okay so it's just going to conso like submitting and that's kind of it so notice that on the right this is how it looks like at the moment but we will be adding a nice little uh styling in just a bit okay and we also want to have the button right which will trigger the handle submit uh and we also want this button to be completely hidden done okay so with that done let's actually go ahead and style this part so uh oops uh one thing we need to go ahead and import it because otherwise it's not going to work so message sender. CSS nice um nice perfect and there we can see it yeah so we want the whole thing to have like a display Flex We want to have like a margin on the top um we also want the flex direction to be column uh white background color 15% border radius a nice little um box Shadow so on the right hand side you can actually I think you can actually see all this stuff going on and with a width of 100% nice and we won the top uh to have display flexed like as you see everything sna into uh order and we want to have a uh give it a little border one pixel solid and this uh this type of white whsh uh pading bottom is going to be 15 pixels and a and a general pading is going to be 15 pixels I don't think that line of code is actually going to be necessary ni so the padding of 15 pixels is that just padding all the way around exactly so if you're just adding that one thing it's going to be add it all the way around MH okay and we want to go ahead and Target the form and want this to be use up as much space as possible and we want to have it a display Flex right so it's uh actually updating as as I save the file right this is how it looks uh at this moment and we want to actually go ahead and Target the actual input and like literally design it like this so give it a background color of this Facebook is gray uh we want to have a border radius of 999 pixels we want to uh remove the margin from above and below and add 10 pixels to both sides and the padding uh it's going to be five pixels up and down and 20 pixels on both sides and we want to disable the borders and the outline width so that's kind of how it's going to be looking like okay nice and we literally want the message sender to be like little tiny little uh we want this to be uh not like just 20 pixels that's all we need and we also want the button uh to be completely uh unseeable so we will be just adding these uh stuff and it's done it's gone so the height is zero width is zero uh background color T transparent color transparent and borders none that's kind of what how we uh uh disable the button one thing which is um which I don't like is that this form is not looking like how I want it to look like um as it's under the form uh let me actually check the other file oh yeah so here we go um so we should be actually using up as much space as possible but instead well we are just not doing it okay okay uh and one thing I forgot to add is is we need to make the message sender input uh to be uh Flex one which means you use up as much space as possible and as we need right okay and now let's go ahead and actually create the bottom so the bottom is going to be it's not going to be super uh super hard to code but that's actually I have a snippet of code with all this stuff so what we are essentially doing is is uh basically we have the message message sender btom uh we have like message sender options inside of here so it's actually div inside of another div uh we have these uh video camera icons which are not imported just yet but we will be doing that very soon uh we want to add the title like actual text that will be rendered next to it and we are literally setting the color now I'll be going ahead and importing all these stuff yeah it's freaking out uh right so this is literally the uh only thing that you will need to import so the video cam icon photo library icon and the insert OT icon and these are the paths so it's pretty easy it literally tells you what to import and you will have all these uh lovely code uh icons right there so the red camera photos and the feing nice they look exactly like the Facebook ones it's awesome right so I bet Facebook uses a lot of material UI right yeah I I I actually think so I actually think they they really do it okay um oops okay so let's go back to our CSS file and make that look nice as well so um so the message sender button it should be display Flex again and we should like uh evenly uh justify the content right and evenly distribute the space and we also want to add a 20 pixel padding to all these uh buttons like all around uh we want to have we want to uh make them display Flex align everything to the center uh give the text uh of a gray color and the margin to be five pixels uh and let's actually set the um option let's actually design these Tex stuff so notice that uh I added a font size of medium right so I made it a bit smaller and I added a margin so right now there is no space in between here but uh as I'm adding this there is our space right 10 pixels I think it breathe I like it yeah exactly and now it literally looks like if it was Facebook yeah yeah when you don't do that that it looks a little bit less like easy to read yeah after you have the spacing then it's easier to read yeah like I mean it's it gives the whole thing like a little bit of breeding as you said okay um with that done um we also want these two uh light like have a little bit of background so if notice that if I go here it has a little background and and if I go here there's no background so I want to have like a border um no I I want to have a hover stuff I'm talking stupid stuff so I want whenever I'm hovering over I want the B uh background color to be set to this Facebook Gray and the Border radius to be 20 pixels right that's kind of how we do it it's super simple okay uh do we actually see any questions by the way as of now I don't see any inent questions people have been dropping guys if you guys have any questions you know David and I are here and we're here to answer everything so make sure to drop some questions below and we'll happily just answer them for you exactly I think the technical issues kind of like threw everybody off yeah people the the weak ones you know Only the Strong R yeah we we are actually 124 strong hey I mean that's the core team imagine imagine a room full of 128 people that's a lot of people I that's actually a lot lot of people guys literally if you find this valuable like drop a comment hit the like button like show that show the support and show that you're still here with us uh even through these hard times when we are facing all these technical difficulties right that's right let's see I think I got a I got a question here okay from yuf he says clar programmer is CSS in react component scoped meaning if CSS styling is applied only to the component it is imported to yes that is correct but don't forget that you can actually import the same CSS file to over all the components so normally so the CSS is only applied to that component where you uh import it but you can go ahead and import it to several other components as well okay um nice let's actually uh go on and I think we are done with the message sender we are done with uh stories let's go what's left the right I think right side bar our right side bar is definitely left and we we need the posts don't forget about the posts the post yeah that's right so we have all this stuff going on here but what we need now is going to be the um so so the post. JS right we also have the post. CSS so notice that whenever I I'm creating a JS file I'm uh immediately creating the uh CSS file to it so that we have it also uh the div should automatically include uh the class name that we want to use which is at this moment is going to be be post and I'm already importing the uh post. CSS file so I want forget it and let me actually see if we are missing anything so yeah we have the story we have the message sender now we need to go with the post so let's actually go ahead and import post now I'm Auto importing again so up uh it's going to be here and what I need to do is basically uh pass in a couple of stuff so we are literally passing in the profile pick because a post has a user which uh who who actually has the profile pick right oh damn hold on uh so I'm going to be uh adding the usual uh SU pick and we also will have a message which is going to be yo this is a message nice can you hit command B to hide the side what's up can you hit command B oh yeah yeah right thanks thanks yeah we are also going to have a time stamp which we will be using to sort everything so that the most recent one is going to be up top and all the others are going to be down below but right now let's just go with time and we will have an image name I will explain that later on why we need that but we need to get the front end working first like looking nice and then we can jump into the back end and then I can explain why it's uh the way it is so the image name is going to be uh image name for now and we will have a username uh which is going to be uh let's let's go with with Frankie because Frankie's name and Sunny's picture is the best combo Best of Both Worlds yeah exactly nice so we literally have a uh post ready for us which is not getting rendered out because the post is actually empty so um what we are going to be doing is basically destructure everything that that we receive we can do that like this so we are putting these quiggly braces profile pick image name username time stamp message all this kind of stuff uh nice and what we will be doing is so the post actually has two parts again actually yeah yeah two parts so one of them is going to be the um post top uh which will include an avatar uh which is going to be so the source is going to be the actual profile pick right that's what we are passing in and the class name is going to be post aat Avatar right nice so yep and next up we will have have a post top info which is literally not going to uh include too much stuff it's basically going to include the Tim stamp and the user's name right so not nothing super fancy but we will have it uh so that it yeah so that it functions nicely so what we are doing here so we we have the Avatar right here we we have the username the h3e right here which is Frankie and we have this line of code which I'm explaining just now so what we are doing here is we basically grab this Tim stamp we will be parsing it into an integer I will explain that later uh when we have the co uh backend code ready so we will be uh creating we will be uh having uh time stamp something like uh it starts with 116 and then like comes random numbers this basically means that the how much seconds have uh passed since I think 1980 Something Right 198 something yeah yeah Unix time time date I don't know what it's called yeah yeah exactly and we will be um passing that into here but we are going to be storing it as a string inside of our database so first we need to forse it into an integer uh and we will make it a date format right so new date and we want to uh display it as a UTC string so notice that over here how it looks like boom that's what we will have and I think UTC string for those that don't know so UTC is the winter time of Britain so you know uh all the time zones are adjusted to uh England's time zone but actually England switches a time zone between summer and winter and so that everybody has like a standard only uh like time zone that doesn't switch all around because United States actually changes times uh at a different like I think two weeks ahead of Europe or after Europe I don't know so there is a two we Delay from for uh one of those uh when you're switching to summer time or or the Standard Time interesting I didn't know that yeah and the UTC is basically the the winter time zone of England right so it's kind of like that's what so if you're have like an international business and you you're setting up servers you want to go with UTC times always and you want to convert the UTC time uh uh according to where the information is relevant so actually this is kind of like what type of uh how it looks like uh I don't think I can show uh that too much but let's try it this way so I just uh flashlight it on this uh line of string I think I'm going to just go ahead grab it and so that you guys are going to be able to see how things change when I'm passing that um so this number instead of time so notice that right now it's yeah so it was invalid but as soon as I pass this thing in it turned into this stuff right it's pretty pretty sick and it actually shows it in GMT time zone nice um so with that done uh we kind of have one post ready uh yeah perfect and we will be adding more stuff uh once we have our back end so for now uh let's not worry about the image name uh and all those kind of stuff uh for now let's actually add the reaction things so let's just make a note here so image has is coming later so yeah it's freaking out again because I have all these icons not imported but let's just uh do that right now so here we go nice and we have all these icons right here so it's pretty much just adding the thumbs up with the uh text and we had the post option or we could like literally say post reaction and notice that there is another uh class which is post options it's plural so we are adding all this stuff nice okay uh I will be zooming out a bit out of it let's actually go ahead and style it okay so the whole post will have a width of 100% margin or radius 15 pixels uh background I think it should be color uh White and like give it a box Shadow nice uh we will have the post image later on don't worry about it for now it's going to be a width of 100% and nothing else uh Post stop we want that to be display Flex um oh damn I think I screw yeah uh I think oh okay so I added a post options inside side of post um post top info and post top so I want that to be out of that right right just like that okay so this is how I want this to look like for now nice okay uh so post up and we actually want the post Avatar to have a margin R of 10 pixels and we want the posttop info so literally the name we want that to have the font size of medium and the we want the time stamp which is under the P tag we want it to be gray and we want that to be small so and the post button I think that's going to be the image so let's just add it to here and once we have the back end ready we will be working with the post button so it's going to have a margin top of 10 pixels margin buttom 10 pixels and the padding uh uh top and below is going to be 15 pixels and 25 right and the left nice okay and the post options which we have just added it's going to have a padding of 10% uh 10 pixels uh one pixel solid light gray uh border top uh literally that thing over there uh we want them to be display Flex so they are right next to each other uh justify content space evenly and font size medium and we also want the color to be gray and the cursors to be pointer and the padding of 15 pixels nice uh we also wanton the post option uh each and every one of them so that we have the text like right next to the them uh we want them to be centered in every single way so vertically and horizontally and we also want the P also want to give them a pading of five pixels and we want them to uh float nice uh so post whoops so post option b uh we we are actually literally targeting the text uh Tex stuff going on here right so only only the like right I hope it's clear uh only and only the comment so not uh we're not targeting this time um the icon so it's crossed out wow I love love this screen brush thing that is amazing okay yeah okay uh oops and once we hover over we want to give it the usual uh Facebook Gray and the Border radius of 10 pixels so just that thing okay nice uh I think we kind of are done uh with designing how it looks like for now really nice really really nice so what does it mean when it's floating um I think it's kind of like floating above uh it would be my guess soing on the bottom it's what's up like the padding or the little like it gives it space on the bottom I think it's like a 3D animation ah I see I see yeah yeah yeah um one thing though we haven't added is the actual um post message so we need that in between the post top and the post options boom there we go that's going to be the message right and inside of the post button there that's where the image is actually going to come later on Boom here we go so for now post is done uh but we will be working on it a bit uh very soon okay nice um and let's actually I think the last thing last to do uh on the front end side is going to be the widget I mean I I think so going to be the right the right side bar yeah exactly that's actually we will be calling that the widget um. JS nice and what we will have here is essentially an an iframe which we are so let's actually first add the class name so it's going to be widgets and what we have here is basically an iframe which is kind of like embedding another uh web page to your website right so we're um so you can literally go ahead Google it up like uh Facebook embed iframe I think this three keywords if it's in your Google search it will show it up and Facebook is literally giving you this code and I set up the width to uh 340 head uh, 1500 and inline styling so just you know like there is the CSS kind of styling and there is the inline styling we kind of want to show you both uh so the style of border is going to be none overflow so whenever it's um going over uh on those 1500 pixels we just want that to be hidden uh we don't want it to scroll uh frame border is going to be zero uh transparency un encrypted media so these are literally like stuff that Facebook is giving you and the reason why Facebook gives you that link is because we chose to share what's in right now our live uh Facebook of clever programmer right so yeah exactly the the items that are going to populate inside of that if frame that David right now is writing is actually the real things that are being posted on our Facebook feed that's what you guys are going to see exactly and Whoa man two donations at the same time it's like they paired up at the same time thank you thank you so much man he says you guys are doing great and then a ro says you guys are great let me see you guys are great keep up the good work thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much lit that's the core team that we still have yeah that's what we core team of 109 people thank you guys literally if you like it stay with us yep yep stay till the end guys you guys are going to pick up a few great skills yeah exactly okay um and please do not spam the chat because I will block you I already blocked rush rush yeah okay um I think with that said we can literally go ahead and start up the backend stock so Frankie actually set up a mongod DB but I'm just going to go ahead and show it because there was so many stuff going on and things were like crashing and all this kind of stuff I'm just going to show everything once again this is uh actually the live applications database at the moment I just refreshed it and there is all this stuff going on so yep uh so what you can do uh is literally create a new project I will be uh going ahead and name it like FB M uh I think that's going to be more than enough I'm not adding any members uh over here so that's where you could add like uh if I I can actually uh invite Frankie um to join if he wants to nice and I can actually like literally add like uh read write manager and access admin and I'll be the um project owner so it's kind of nice so we both will be able to work on this project thank you nice anytime dude so let's go ahead and create the uh project let's go build the cluster it's um popping this question to me every single time but Pro most of the times it just doesn't do it it's just for some reason for me it does it uh and you want to go ahead and create a free cluster we don't need all these feny stuff we're is going to go with precluster you don't need to worry about any of this stuff going on and what I'm just going to do is create a cluster with the button nice uh and it's going to act so it says it's going to take 1 to three minutes but it actually usually does a bit more uh by that time I will be going ahead and uh hitting network access that button over there and I'll be uh adding an IP address nice so this time I will be adding allow access from any anywhere but disclaimer do not do it in production do not do it with any kind of client because this literally means that I could hack your database and I could do whatever I wanted to do inside of it and that's kind of like losing money so you don't want to do this in production you always want to get the IP address of the server that is going to be using it and add it inside of here you can literally add the comment I will be naming everyone uh but you can add it add like whatever server so the client name uh server uh and you can actually set it to uh six hour long whoops too much stuff uh six hour long so it's GNA expire but I'm just gonna not do that for now okay so it's going to uh work for a bit uh it's still deploying CH uh my changes and by the time I will be going ahead and uh set up the database access which is essentially uh creating a database user um so I'll be naming it uh Facebook client um aut to generate a SQL password and you want to go ahead and copy that as much times as possible so that you will have that on your clipboard I'm using offred so I'll I'm having it in a safe place but if you're not using offred you definitely well first you want to go ahead and download it or just go ahead and like add somewhere safe inside of your code so that you will have it because this is the last time you will actually see this password and let's go and hit user or add user nice so going back to the Clusters it's still being created it's doing its stuff nice uh but by the time let's actually go ahead and create our um backend stuff right so first thing first we will be what is this thing okay we don't need this stuff so first thing first we will be creating a new folder uh outside of here so it's going to be Facebook backend uh for me and I'm opening up a new terminal um I'll be actually create a um how do I create oh it's a plus button nice um so I'll be seeding into the Facebook backend and now now that I'm inside of here I want to have Git Version Control uh initialized so I'm just going to type in in it um why it's taking this much time I have no clue okay nice I must have uh made a typo and now I'm going to go ahead and start up the backend stuff right so I'm going to go ahead and type in mpm in it which is literally initializing our backend project what's up so two things two things one Vibe with us just dropped a beautiful comment much love thank you guys so much and he says Hey CP I just want to say thank you for all your content on YouTube I have learned a lot in the past one month than I've done in two years in campus basically where I am right now is because of you wow he's learning that's literally what our goal is so I'm actually attending the college as as well and um I've been there for like 2 and a half years and while I was inside of pwj and watching these lives and actually now doing these lives I've learned like 10x more than what I when uh what college has gave me W that's crazy man even even in debugging like today that was crazy oh so much bonjour Tech thank you man a $5 donation beautiful we love you guys we really appreciate you thanks for sticking around we'll continue and I also see 100 rupees from somebody up top 100 rupees yeah it was I believe it was a last oh thank you dude I no it was rushi rushi my thank you man oh my God we got so much donations nice thank you guys yeah we're at three $33 in chat donations and 454 likes that's amazing guys let's try to get that to 500 guys so smash that like button if you guys are still here and let's Carry On Let's carry strong literally our team is getting stronger we are 122 active user uh Watchers so awesome let's let's teach everybody how to code let's get it yeah exactly okay let's jump back into the code okay so we have the uh G Version Control initialized and what I'm going to do now is essentially initialize the backend Pro uh okay I was in the wrong W uh window okay so this is going to throw so when I type in mpm in it it's going to throw a couple of lines here which I've honestly never read uh this is I think it's some kind of General advices and stuff uh but right now I'm going to go ahead and name the package give a version description I'm going to leave it alone entry point make sure to set it to server.js test command empty get rippo empty keywords empty author uh Frankie oops and David whoops and the license is I see perfect now uh it's going to prompt if I'm okay with it yes I am so there we go so the Facebook back end now that we are done uh let's actually import a couple of dependencies and we will have a bunch of them this time so make sure to watch it as I'm doing it so I'm just going to type in mpm install and we will of course have Express we will have Mongoose we will have course we will have motor which we will be using to upload the image anyway you can actually drag it a little bit up so that we can see it on the screen it's like cut cutting up a little bit I mean what I could do is exit full screen and like do it like this I I I I hope it's it's better now it's cool okay nice um so we have so we have Express we have mongus we have course we have motor to up upload images and now we will have motor uh grid FS which is a no stuff so guys if you're already here this is going to be the juicy part this is going to be new stuff and this is what like literally is going to make the difference uh it's actually a motor grid of a storage so this is how we will be storing mod IM oops images inside of mongod DB uh we will also have crit FS uh stream and we will have the body parser oops body parser nice we also want to have path and we want to have Pusher because we want this we will make this real time okay so all these packages are going to take a bit of time to load but I mean I just hit return uh on all these and I'm just going to go full screen once again so so it's quickly set up and we also we already have the package.json file nice I will be closing the terminal because we don't need that anymore um and what we really want to do is up here like right on the main server.js we want to type in type and the type that we want to select is module that will allow us to write es6 code uh inside of inside of here and next thing we want to do is start and that's going to be node server.js it's going to be necessary uh for when we deploy the app to uh Heroku we will not need to worry about Auto starting the app is going to start itself up next thing you want to do uh is add a dog ignore file uh because right now on the left hand left hand side I hope I can move this thing away um okay so over there you can see it says 2K that's because we have the node modules uh inside of the uh Version Control so I'm just going to type in node modules and boom that's went back to 27 uh get ignore nice and with that done uh let's actually go ahead and create our server.js file which is for some reason the focus is always lost server.js nice so inside of here we what you literally want to do is import everything so import Express from Express uh you want to go ahead and import [ __ ] from [ __ ] uh course motor and all those stuff that we just did uh you can go ahead post your video here copy all this stuff this is how you want to go ahead whoops this is how you want to go ahead and import everything nice um what we will be doing as well is gri [ __ ] is going to be mongus [ __ ] we will be using it later on we will be um this is literally the storage that we will be uh adding our images to okay next up uh what we always do is line out the whole app so we will have an app config uh we will have middle Wares oh yep we will have some DB config it's going to be brutal today and we will need um API routes nice and we want to have a listen part okay so let's actually cover all these stuff so app config is for now it's just going to uh it's really create the instance and Define the port where the application is going to run at next up we will have the metal Wares so first thing first we will have the body parser which will literally uh parse everything into Json format so that we will be able to make rest requests and we will have nice Json response and we are also using the course headers just there okay perfect um and let's actually create our first very first API uh request and that is going to be a routes nice uh so we want so what here happens is whenever I'm calling the app uh with a get method I'm going to show everything to you guys on the rout so there is no no endpoint just the API itself and that will fire off a function which has a request and a response uh property uh then what we want to do is set the response status to um 200 which means in server side language it means okay and then we want to go ahead and send back whoops uh hello world world nice and I think uh a bracket was gone and now I think we should be good but for some reason we are not um okay nice yeah so this is how the full line is going to look like okay awesome and we also want to go ahead and make the up listen which we will be able to do by say app. listen and that is where we pass in the port that we uh defined uh up here so this thing so it literally we we could actually say 9,000 but we we uh we are saying for instead so we can literally go ahead and like set it the way we want to and so yep and let's fire off a console log which will just give us an idea of where everything if everything is going right so this time I'm not using quotation marks I'm using backx which is on the United States keyboard it's right next to number one uh and on the British keyboard it's next to zed nice and guess what David we just got another donation rash Nish Kumar Gupta say hey thank you so much love you guys and I was not spamming a thank you man I appreciate you sometimes we just see repeated messages so we have to you know clear out the chat block a few people we want to keep it so that everybody can have a good learning environment but we really appreciate your donation man thank you so much thank you a lot yeah yeah um so let's get back to the code so what we want to type in here is basically like listening on local host and you can literally like add in with the string connation the actual Port so that's pretty much setting up our very first API it's I mean lots of stuff is not even needed here like all this stuff um but yeah we we will be just adding those anyways we will be using all of these stuff later on nice so we could literally make the app uh listen okay perfect and let's actually fire it up so I'm just going to go ahead and say um I think it's FB back in nice perfect and I'm going to say node Manon server.js oh okay it even found with chaos okay nice so it's actually running and I'll be opening up a thing called Postman which is a nice little app uh that we can use to uh to call the uh to make requests so I'm going to closing up everything here all these mess and I'm just going to go ahead and type in Local Host and 9,000 and I think I can zoom into this one one as well uh is it easy to read Frankie yeah now it's better perfect and because it says hello world that's how we know everything is working fine so let's give it an air horn actually we have our first API let's get it first API nice yeah exactly okay so next up what we want to do is let's go back to mongod DB uh during this time sorry my hair during this time uh our cluster got set up and now let's go uh oops I hit the wrong button so you want to press connect and you and you want to press uh connect connect your application nice and just copy this thing and let's hide it and inside of uh DB config you definitely want to go ahead and create a const [ __ ] U and and actually go ahead and paste this thing inside of here but notice that it has this password thing which is not the password that we had this is why you needed to save the password when I said we need it so you want to go ahead and and paste your password inside of there boom oh oh damn okay um I'm pressing buttons all the way boom uh so that's my password right now and for the DB name I actually like to I'd like to call it Facebook DB I think it's pretty descriptive right okay now what you need to do basically we will create two different kind of connections um but it's basically it's going to be almost the same the only thing that we will be doing differently is first we need to save it into a variable and we are using the create connection function and the other one is just simply connecting so whenever the server is starting in up we will be uh creating a connection and this is what we will be using for the GS storage and the other one is going to be like a general connection uh for saving the posts uh there is a bit of difference between these but I just don't want to go into it because it's uh super super hard to understand um so now let's go ahead and actually initialize uh let's actually say that whenever um let's actually uh say that once the first connection is done uh so we we were able to set it up we want a console log DB connected and we want to create a GFS um which we actually need to uh say we actually need to initialize here what's a GFS so GFS is going to be grid FS uh and gr FS is I think it's GD file system it's basically a file system for mongod DB so what happens is it's actually it's normally it's created for files that are larger than 16 uh MB but we would just use this for every single file uh and because normally you could use the binary way and the base 64 code for actually saving images but that's like crazy hardcore and you just don't want to do that uh this is a much simpler uh way to do it right um and what you want to do is so when so it's initialized you want to create the grid and the connection uh DB is uh going to be in side of here and we will pass in the mongus [ __ ] so and the great collection so the collection where we want to save all these images uh is going to be images right and one thing so grid FS storage is literally um saving stuff in like 200 kilobyte of chunks right and that's how we are actually saving it and we will just put it together uh when we're retrieving stuff okay and the other thing we need to uh have to set this thing up finally is is creating the storage so it's going to be new grid FS storage with the URL of [ __ ] URI which we have up here and the file so it's kind of like when we create the um this schema for this for the files and we're doing the exact same stuff here as well so we will have a file name uh which we are concatenating out of uh the word image a dash and the date now and the actual extension of the file and the other one is going to be a file info uh which is going to be consist of the file name and the bucket name which is images as we are saving our stuff into the images collection so pretty much the file is going to be whatever type of image right that we're putting in yeah exactly exct I mean it literally could accept videos as well okay so yep and we're just going to resolve it with this stuff nice uh and the upload instance is going to be this um motor so whenever we are uploading a file to uh to this uh server it's going to be using this storage to store it immediately without asking any questions so this gives us our next API route which is going to be this thing uh for Simplicity I'm just going to delete that so whenever we are calling the app with a post method on the SL upload SL image and point and we attach a file which we need to do in a bit of a different way than we just normally create a Json file uh it will fire off a request response uh callback function and we just literally just send back the file and all the details so let's try it out very quickly um inside of here so upload uh image I think yeah that's the thing we want to have and whenever we are using um what's called it Postman you want to go to the body you want to go to form data set the text to file actually and what you want to go ahead and select is um I have a couple of images over here so I'm just going to go use this uh profit which JavaScript logo um yep and it's going to be inside of there and if it's working perfectly and I hope it does when I send it oh because I'm getting it let's go what is happening un unexpected field okay here comes the debu session hey ready for that let's get it yeah so we are expecting the file right um let's see what the terminal says actually let's restart nice nice DB connected perfect um so we're actually okay I know what happened so what happened is that I didn't give a name for the field and we are actually expecting the file to be file coming in the file name uh file name field so the that should be a field which has a file name and that's where our file will be nice okay so add file let's send it again and now it's taking longer so it's good and these are literally the stuff that we had okay uh let's just uh see what's going on field name file right original name original name it was image.png it was a 7 bit image uh it was a PNG file uh it gave them random ID which is some mongod DB stuff don't worry about it and the new F name is this stuff right so this is the uh with with the date string uh all this stuff we don't need to really worry about it um there is some lot of uh nice stuff going on here if you want to spend time finding it out go ahead but it's just not relevant for today's build oh my God we're doing it for such a long time yeah it's a marathon we've been here a while yeah oh Jesus it's actually 1 a.m. here oh wow yeah 4M here yeah yeah yeah I actually have my I have this computer set to uh Los Angel time now I'm I'm working with you guys so I I just want to know what the time oh my God I have a call with Alex in less than half an hour oh wow that's okay no sleep tonight yeah exactly ah sleep is for for the week for humans yeah okay next up um what the usual stuff that we always do is actually what we want to do is have a schema for our database right so what that it's going to be it's like uh post model. JS right it's basically we are creating a uh database model so what we are doing here is let's type it up so we are importing [ __ ] uh from whoops uh mango right uh and we are going to be creating a uh post model uh which is going to be a [ __ ] do [ __ ] schema and this is where we Define all the fields so we will have a user which is going to be a string we will have an image name name I'll tell you why uh we need this so much but we need it uh that's going to be a string of course uh text which is literally going to be whatever the uh person wants the text of the uh post so that's going to be string again we are going to be saving the Avatar uh so that we can so whenever the person logs in with Google which is yet to come um we will be uh saving the the Avatar to the database so that when we refresh the application and render out everything again we will see the nice Avatar going on okay and the last but not least the time stamp whoops which is going to be a string as well and we need to export Rec it yep what's up all of them strings yeah everything everything is strings that that's the easiest way to go about it honestly oops um made a typo I mean there are all these data types but string is the easiest so we will be exporting a [ __ ] model right and we need to uh give the collection name here where we want to say it so it's going to be post it always plural uh this is something you need to watch out and we were actually danging it with sunny for minutes uh that mongodb pluralizes all the connection names so the best thing is to Define them plural uh by default and we are actually adding the post model as the model to it nice so we pretty much have it let's actually go back here and import that too so we will be importing uh DB post I think um oops h no actually we will import [ __ ] post and we will be uh importing the post model uh .js file whoops oh my God okay uh so down here we now what we want to do is literally just save a post um and what we will be doing uh when we save these stuff is we go ahead uh save the image first into the storage into the images collection and afterwards uh we will be going ahead and saving the image name with the post to to another collection so that way we will have track of everything so which image uh goes with which post right so that's what we will be doing just now so let's go ahead and create an app toop post on the um upload whoops upload slash poost and will fire off a request response uh callback function and inside of here what you want to do is basically save uh whatever comes in the request body and you can go ahead and conso log it but I'll just not do it uh for now and this is where we call uh the uh mod that we just created right so you can go back and see what's up here and we will be creating a new uh document inside of the collection with the DB post or we could literally pass in request body inside of here Buton yeah and if there is an error we want to set the response status to 500 which means internal server error that means something's went wrong or else you want to go ahead and set it to one which means created that means it was successfully created and everything is up and running and good um so yeah that's pretty much the uploading uh procedure and yeah actually let's go ahead and stretch everybody because let's let's get the energy High guys I know it's been it's been a while but you know sometimes you need to stretch a little bit so that your mind can work even a little bit more exactly yeah yeah yeah H we've been live about four hours almost 3 hours and 50 minutes thank you for the 100 concurrent viewers that we have right now it's actually about 200 if we're counting Facebook but 100 on on YouTube thank you guys for sticking out this is this is NI that's so awesome thanks a lot guys yep thank you guys yeah okay nice perfect um so what we want to do now is actually uh retrieve all the data that we have inside of here okay so how do we do that so we need to draw a bit of a process here so I think yeah this is how I open up the uh whiteboard so what you want to do is basically save the image then uh save the post with the uh whoops with image name and oh damn okay save image then save post with image name this is necessary because you can only r retrieve the image if you literally uh adding the um name of the image at the end of the endpoint right so we will be retrieving the post first and grab the image name and then retrieve uh the image uh the image itself so was it kind of followable uh uh Frankie could you understand it so you retrieve the post you retrieve the image of the post and then you retrieve the name of what is it the text the the actual post or the image uh no so actually how so we need to filter down okay so because we are saving the posts and the uh the images into two different collections we have to keep track of which image goes with which post right so that's why we need to save the name next to the post so that we will be able to uh filter uh using the name right so first we get back all the posts and we go over them one by one check out which image go uh uh goes to which post and then retrieve those images one by one and snap it next to the post when we are rendering it out does it make sense I I see yes okay perfect aw awesome so what we will be doing now is first let's create the uh post retrieving endpoint which is going to be app.get right I'm going to scroll down a bit uh and we will be saying a retrieve and post and oops and we will of course request response as always and here what we want to do is first get everything back from the uh database and second sort everything uh in a descending order um based on the date right or or the actual time stamp and then throw it back to the front end and that will do uh the conversion and all those kind of stuff so what you want to do do is [ __ ] post uh find and because we're not adding any kind of filtering inside of here so we could literally add filters in here but we're not doing that because we want everything to be sent back so if there's an error uh we're going to make the call fail and if there's data then here we go so if error let's handle that oh error um let's set the res oops response uh status to 500 and send back the error so that we will be able to debug what's up uh nice else and this is uh where the interesting part comes in we will need to sort the data and this is literally snipp of code that I found on the internet today so we will need to sort the data based on the time stamp right so that's uh kind of it so it's funny because the time stamp is it's kind of like a string right exactly that's how it looks in the back end but once it's converted like you said to the front end then you can actually see what is the UTC time zone that we chose exactly actually it kind of knows kind of knows the difference between where you're at yeah like like the time stamp so even if it's string it still knows the difference yeah which one is bigger and which one's not I don't know how I mean literally I got this code from uh got this nippet from the internet actually I think we will be doing uh a couple of twitch sessions when we are like preparing and then I can like share you all these insights like how I go on internet find stuff how I debug and all the all the stuff that you actually see here but it's going to be official that I'm that I'm preparing right it's actually pretty cool man yeah I've heard a lot of people wanting to know you know the whole workflow of how we make these projects kind of like exactly how they are all organized and really like you said the resources that you use to build them so that's awesome exactly exactly like guys actually if you like the idea drop a comment and let us know because then we can show it to kazy and then we can just fire the project up ASAP yep drop a coming guys we're excited for that exactly yeah yeah I'm pumped and what you want to do now uh is literally uh create the filter um filtering endpoint that will just throw back the image uh to the front it right okay so what we will be doing is saying app.get and let's say retrieve um it's going to be images and and single because we are uh retrieving a single image and don't forget to add the quod Mark around it um and we will also have of course have a request and the response in the cobc function and inside of here what we will be firing off is the gridfs find one function oh no it's going to be the G the files because inside of files that's where we want to find one find one file that will uh that actually has the file name uh so remember uh when we created it this is what we are searching for so the file name is um is equals the request. query do name now I know this is already getting like crazy I will show it I will demo it right after uh I've built this part okay so if there's an error handle it if we get file that's cool uh and let's actually go ahead and do the error handling as usual so response status 500 nice and send error perfect and else boom so else we want to check if the file is actually the file that we want so if it's like an actual file so if there's no file or something um or the file length is zero we just want to go ahead and say 404 and file not found however if we found the file we will create a read stream which is essentially like reading the file out of the rast storage and we will go ahead and grab the file and like like just push it back what's happening here let's go ahead and find it out so now that we have it inside of here uh let's actually go ahead and create a new one uh Rich which is going to be retrieve images and single and what was that query once again so that's going to be name and that's where I want to put the uh the file name right so I'm expecting to see the pwj logo um when I hit return and oops here we go oh wow nice so this is literally pushing the file back so we will actually be calling this link inside of uh the post file right okay so with that done um for now we are done with the back end let's go back and let's actually Implement what we have just done but first let's actually deploy this stuff so that we don't have to worry about like Local Host and not Local Host and all those kind of stuff so let's go to hu.com and and I don't know yeah I I have I have enough stuff okay um so inside of here I'll just say Facebook M um clone and live nice okay create uh you can do it just uh just that simple and I've already logged into my heru CLI if you haven't or you don't know what this is I recommend going uh onto this uh wo onto this page and whatever you got um even if you have a Windows or Mac I uh oops not this one I recommend installing the CLI this way uh not with any of the fancy Stu up here because uh I think it's a lot better and once you're done you're just going to go ahead log in the CLI CD inter your project initialize a git repository but because we have done that I'm just going to copy this part and actually create go back in here and set the uh remote git right so this is what I've uh pasted in here and it's done and what we got here is uh yeah so literally just copy paste all stuff next up we will do a g commit so get add do nice so we will see get status um all these files changed and actually added and we will be committing so get uh am and we will say um almost done and perfect and notice that all the changes like all this stuff stuff like went back to White and what we will be doing now is basically say k push Heroku Master boom and that will essentially go ahead and push everything to Heroku hey yep first part of deployment dude that Des an air horn you love these horen you got to celebrate exactly and what I like to do is actually uh watch the herac logs as well you can just do that by typing a her/ tail and once it says starting to up that's when you know things are ready so uh whoops this is three second yeah and this is the link that we have we can literally go ahead and go in here like got the hello world back like uh super easily nice and we can try it out with this uh part of the link as well like check it on uh right after it just uh remove the double slash and here we go so it works and now it's live it's crazy and and let's actually go back to where is yeah this is the front so let's actually close the back end for now just got a sale man let's get it hey nice beautiful perfect who do we welcome welcome Ceno sorry it's Carol that was the email so Carol asedo welcome welcome to the community thank you so much for joining really appreciate hey welcome welcome nice so what we kind of want to do is go ahead and inside of the front end you oops uh inside of actually the source you want to go ahead and create an xjs file and before we go any further you need to install a dependency which will be uh the AOS of course so mpm install xos and hopefully it's going to be fast so axios is literally letting you to make like rest requests pretty much let's actually go ahead and type your import xos from axios nice and and what we will be doing is create um an instance right so we will be just simply creating an instance which will be yeah so x. create and inside of here we will add the base URL which we have just created which is going to be this one and and let's remove the Slash from the end nice and oops um we will just go ahead and Export default the instance boom so now we have our axal instance done uh let's go ahead and so what are we doing here exactly we're so exactly um axios is it's kind of like fetch okay right so fetch is lit making uh requests to API um but because I mean fetch is like the more beginner stuff we want to go with axios and axios is like a more professional uh thing literally and we are just setting the base URL and outside of here we will say something like A.G which is literally mean which literally means that we we want to trigger this instance and let's go with a get uh function and the endpoint is going to be uh upload slash image and that way with just this line of code and a couple uh more like when we actually add the image but just this line of code we can uh literally Poe the image up to the database and with otherwise with fetch you would need to uh go go with the whole uh whole. link slash upload uh image and then you will need to uh say like this is like the body and all those kind of stuff so it's just uh making the whole thing like into one little instance and then we can just reuse this stuff again okay feed let's go to feed um hold on so inside the feed um yo David just as a because kind of an as an approximation how much do you think we have left off of this build in hours or time um I mean we could make it fast because kind of like all this knowledge uh so using axios using all this stuff is actually up uh in here and we are pretty much just reusing stuff so we could actually say that uh um from now on it could be a homework um and just wrap it up right here because the new new part is literally uh inside of server. is uh saving the image which is already covered everything else can be done uh using a couple of videos with the uh with the m builds so if if if we need to wrap it up fast we can go ahead and do it now yeah actually cuz we are a little bit time sensitive today we are getting few things built here in this studio we're going to get the TV mount and everything but we'll make sure you guys get the whole knowledge that we are you know teaching you guys and as David said we're going to leave a little bit of homework for you guys it's pretty much what we've shown you yeah yeah exactly so we may we literally uh showed you the new stuff you can now just go ahead and reuse everything that is in here and everything is going to be working okay I think we can go ahead and wrap it up here then and um you can make the improvements on the studio and oh my God it's almost 500 p.m y cool so you want to continue this build in another live is that the plan what's what's better I mean can that part as well or we could do the whole thing once again um without the glitches and all those kind of stuff okay we will figure it out later let's actually wrap it up for now awesome I think and then uh we will figure it out how we will be sharing all the knowledge beautiful okay so let's wrap it up today um that that's a lot of work that we did today connecting the back end the front end all the front end functionalities are there guys David did a great great job doing that explaining that and we also ran into a lot of technical issues actually which just makes us better at coding it just makes it a little bit more flavorful you know sometimes things don't go as expected so this is just part of life man but but it's cool anything that you want to share before or you want to explain before so that it's easier for them to have this build up to this point I think um guys literally like whenever we uh added like hardcoded data you just want to go ahead and uh and snap it out and change it with some kind of axio schol or you can use fatch if you want if you're more comfortable with that um and other than that that's kind of it awesome I think it it can be uh done with any other uh with with the help of other videos cool yep we'll continue this build on another video this week guys let's show them the the finished demo yeah okay so the finished demo is literally this thing and what what I want you guys to do is like hook up this button uh to the uploading functionality first save the image retrieve uh and you will get back all the data because we have already done that check out the um uh file name uh save it somewhere and then go ahead and make a post uh with this stuff going on in here and then save it to the uh to the other collection and once that's done I want you to go ahead and fire off a pusher that will uh refresh the whole uh feed inside of here and then also uh what I want you to do is is uh is like literally uh make the make the post uh make every post like render out like this nicely and inside of post I want you to pass in the image name and make the uh make it as the uh make this thing as the source so that so the link that you will be building up with the base URL and the image name I want that to be made uh made this source that's kind of pretty much the steps from now on pretty much it nice beautiful beautiful all righty guys thank you so much for following this build this was long man it was long 4 hours wow we're tired you're tired more tired than I for sure but you know it's it's uh we're building up that stamina that coding stamina if you guys did get any value from this build make sure to click the link in the description below we got a free training for you where kazy teaches you how to become a profitable JavaScript developer as well as building up those those technical skills so that you can get your first job get your first client even just make money with JavaScript in general so link is in the description below it's a free training register now before we don't offer it anymore and going to be learning good things thank you so much guys so that was the Facebook app yeah and and David David is an amazing developer and you know he has a lot of passion to show you guys you know everything that he learned during these months it's amazing to see his growth and and learning and now teaching you guys so anything you want to finish off with David I think you pretty much said everything I'm going to go to bed hey yeah man have some sleep yeah uh I think I'll upload the finished code to GitHub and then just post it in uh on this Facebook build and then guys you can just go ahead and check it out for yourself I think going live again with it um will be a bit uh a bit of a friction but yeah we will figure that out I'll just post it post the GitHub links inside of here awesome check the links in the description below guys we'll be showing you the finalized project as well so stay tuned and thank you so much we'll be seeing you guys in the next video exactly peace guys peace everybody much love byebye
