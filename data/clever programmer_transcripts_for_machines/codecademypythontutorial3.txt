okay guys welcome to part three of code Academy course let's start this thing all right we left off at 17% on Python and the part that we were working on let me change my mouse control to reverse so I can scroll correctly on my laptop okay so we left off at 66% at mixandmatch we're going to pick up right from there and get going so we're going to be getting two pretty cool stuff like Pig Latin for now let's click conditionals and control flow and keep rolling with it okay so we're on the part we're on so we did mix and match and now we're on conditional statements and tax okay now conditional statements are the meat and bones of programming okay they are the main things that we use to basically provide logic for our programs make it intelligent this is the case where you give your program the power to actually reason through something and then make a decision based on that okay so this is if you've ever heard of ifthen that's kind of what's going on here okay it's in ifthen scenario and the example here is showing it's saying if the answer is left the double equal sign means comparison so it's comparing the variable answer and seeing if it equals left if that's the case it goes hey this is a verbal abuse room you heap of parrot droppings so it's a little lame joke that they put in there you know a little irony but um other than that you know that this statement is going to evaluate to remember we were working on boolean and this statement is going to evaluate to true because answer on line three we made it left we use the assignment operator the equal sign and we said hey take answer make it equal to the string left and then we came down a line four and we're checking whom is answer equal equal to left now remember this whole part is going to turn to true and any time an if condition is true then the block underneath it executes so in this case after the colon we have this block here print and that gets executed and that runs but any time this situation is false the block underneath that if statement does not run okay so for example let's say if we were checking if answer answer equals two right in this case what do you think is going to happen do you think that block is going to run on line five or do you think that block is not going to run okay if you answer that it's not going to run perfect because this will evaluate to false right because answer is left cool let's go back let's see what they want us to do in the instructions here they're just telling us a little bit of if eight is less than nine eight is less than nine so this statement will print and in the instructions that says if you think the print statement will print to the console set response equal to Y otherwise set response equal to n so now if you think line five that statement is going to run and we're going to print out the verbal abuse room go ahead and put Y in the response if you think no go ahead put no but if you listen to pretty much what I've discussed so far you know that the answer here is going to be Y because we know for sure that line five is going to run because line four is going to evaluate to true anyways beautiful so we got it correct on the righthand side you can see that it printed out this is a verbal abuse room heap of wrappings ignore the nun that if you were writing a real program that actually wouldn't even show up so it's it's just code Academy thing start next lesson which is why I would recommend download Python and get something called idle and run things in there so for example if I open up on my Mac idle this thing opens up right here and I can type in code here so I can say if or I can say write equal equal left and it's going to say false but if I said write equal equal right it's going to sit true so it runs it immediately and you can check what's going on okay great now let's see what they're talking about let's get some practice with if statements so we're going to do some more practice with if statements in that etre you'll see two functions don't worry about anything and familiar will explain so enough replace the line on line two and expect ok so we have to replace this line on line two with an expression that returns a true statement so you could say pretty much anything you want as long as it evaluates to true okay so we can say a banana write is equal equal to apple and to be extra fancy here's what we can do boom okay so let me ask you is banana equal to Apple no so that's false right so this whole thing inside turns to false but then the not outside is the opposite right it's the negation or the negatory operator and it turns that false into a true statement so that whole statement then turns to true so this is just a fancy way of having a true statement and the reason why we're having a true statement right there is so then line three can run okay because if this whole thing evaluates to false we never get to line three this needs to value the truth which is why hopefully it's making sense why we learned about the boolean because otherwise if conditions we won't be able to run them ever if we don't didn't know about the false and true stuff that's going on okay not says on line six I'll replace it with an expression that returns true let's keep it simple five equal equal to plus three okay five is equal equal to five um it's going to return success number two if we do this successfully it should run line nine and it should say success number one and it should run line ten and it's just a success number two now to break it down a little bit further there's a little bit of stuff that's going on here we have a function okay let's just look at from line one to line three we have a function what's the name of this function the name of this function is using control once okay de f means defined so we're defining a function called using control once the reason why we define functions is we want to name blood it's it gives us a way to name blocks of code and then whenever we're going to refer to that giant block of code we can just use the name of the function so look at line 9 we're effectively just using that function and then it runs the whole set of instructions okay imagine why we use a variable to store some information in there like if you had some inconvenient number right like boomboomboom instead of trying to remember it every time it would make sense to kind of store it as a variable then refer to that variable right but what if you want to write a block of code that you want to keep using again and again how are you going to save that in a variable well you can't if you did something like this print around a print hello that's one line and then you said return success or something that's not going to work because variables can't store blocks of code and so that is why we use a function so we can use those blocks of code for whatever we want okay now we created a function called using control once in that function we use the if statement and if that statement runs fine and returns true then we go to line three and we end up printing out or returning success number one now let's look at our function that starts from line five and ends at line seven what's the name of this function it's called using control again and it does the same thing it has a if condition it checks if it's true if it's true it returns success number two okay now here we're just defining the functions when you're defining the function is kind of like if I said V is equal to blah blah blah blah blah that's not going to print out V that's not going to show you what V is you have to then call V so you can say V or you can save print V right and that's going to show you what V is onto the screen onto that you know this black screen over here okay but same way you call the function okay so we created this function and now we want to call that function so it actually shows it out to the screen so on line 9 you can see we're calling the function using control ones and on line 10 we're calling the function using control again and the beauty of functions is that call it with just one single line and it uses those blocks of code so what do you think is going to happen if I run it do you think it's going to say success number one and success number two if you said yes you're right good job okay that was simple enough let's keep moving on else problems I feel bad for your son this is a reference to a jayz song 99 problems but oh you know what ain't one so I like their sense of humor code Academy okay so the else statement complements if statement so basically you have if or else okay it's not as complicated as they make it sound it's just like real life if you want to go outside and get ice cream cool also we can stay home and be bored I don't know okay so it's literally just like that in programming you have if statements that you can compliment with an else statement and that will complete most of the times complete your logic you know if this person worked this many hours of the job then pay him this much otherwise don't pay him anything okay or otherwise pay him less depends on your situation okay so it says complete else statement to the right note the indentation for each line so our indentation okay hmm all right so my screen is kind of small so things run through a little bit but we'll try to work through it and we'll check out if our indentation is on point answer test but a scratch nothing wrong with that it's grammatically curve but sent actively correct we're defining a function here called black night so now black night is going to be used to refer to a block of code if answer is test but a scratch return true well answer is test but a scratch we did yeah we made it that so this is going to return true otherwise it just returns nothing but this note here says make sure it returns false so obviously we have to put false here okay what happens here line four if answer is equal equal to two splitter scratch it returns true but if it's not test but a scratch it returns false so it goes to this else part okay if this part evaluates to false we skip over line five and we go to line 6 and then we execute line seven if this part returns true we go to line five and we never go to line 6 and we never go to line side okay because if you go outside to get ice cream then you're not going to be sitting at home being bored at the same time right so think about it kind of intuitively okay French soldier if answer so answer is not go where I shall taunt you a second time because answer is tis but a scratch I see it right there so I already know it's not going to returning true it's going to go to this else part and then the else part we have to put false as the note says next to it so this is going to return false the next one is going to return so and this one is going to return true and I think at this point we can just run it and see what happens cool it just says start next lesson beautiful okay I got 99 problems but a switch ain't one again Jay Z's reference L if is short for else if so you know you can also say else if okay if we do this else if we do this or else if we can do that okay now that gets a little bit different then why don't we just use multiple ifs but let's not think about that let's keep it simple and just think think about we have three connections here we have if else if and else okay so we have a situation where if something is true then we return 1 if that thing isn't true we go to the else if part and then we check the condition in the else if if that condition evaluates to true then we return negative 1 however if the condition of the else if returns false we skip and we go to else else doesn't take a condition ok so if I had to give you a format for this it would be 4 if conditions it would be like if and then the condition goes here if that condition evaluates to true we go to this block okay else if same thing it takes in some kind of condition conditions or things that evaluated true or false okay then we run this block and then if we have the else we don't have no condition ok no condition because else just means if none of the conditions match then this happens this block okay just to give you a little bit of an intuitive sense okay so I'm commenting out hopefully your number of comments this part is just ignored okay so it says online to fill in the if statement to check if answer is greater than 5 hmm okay simple if answer is greater than 5 so answer is greater than 5 online for fill and also so that function outputs negative 1 if answer is less than 5 if so answer is less than 5 okay so that's simple so if answer is ever greater than variable answers ever greater than 5 we return 1 else if answer is less than 5 we return the variable negative one okay when's the condition this won't work when the answer is five exactly right if the answer is five exactly we should return zero so else return zero I don't like their ifelse conditions they're not very logical they won't make sense they're so arbitrary that it makes it hard for you to understand what's actually going on right if else if the perfect example they could use is imagine the game rockpaperscissors right if user picks rock and user to pick scissors then you know user one wins because user want picked rock that's a much better example that they should use like turn one NIF answer is greater than five that's okay not a problem we'll keep going okay so let's save and submit cool yeah so this function so now something new is happening is that we have this function here we're defining a function called greater less equal five and it's dependent on an input called answer you can call this input X but you have to make sure that everywhere you say answer here you call that X or we can call this input whatever we want okay but we have to make sure that on line 2 and line 4 we stay consistent right and we call it the same thing and how we use this function so we just define this function there it doesn't do anything there but then we call it at the bottom so you see we're calling this function and we're passing in four so we go to this function and instead of answer we actually are passing in a four and then it goes for if 4 is greater than 5 is 4 greater than 5 no is for less than five yes so it returns negative one that's why you see negative one right there at the top it never goes to the else part now line 17 puts five into the function so answer becomes five if is 5 greater than five that's actually not true so we don't return one is 5 less than 5 that's not true so we don't return negative 1 now we jump to the else condition else statement else doesn't have a condition so we don't check for anything and we immediately go to line 7 which says return 0 which is why you get 0 right below the negative 1 and lastly we have 6 is 6 greater than 5 yes it is it returns 1 that that's how will you see the 1 there it never executes this part of the code here and we are done ok let's click Next and I think so we're at the conclusion and we're just going to be reviewing this stuff pretty basic so here's what you've learned in this unit you've learned about comparators so comparison operators or like this one here less than greater than or equal to equal equal not equal okay so 12 not equal 13 that will return true 10 equal equal 10 that will return true 5 greater than or equal to 5 that will return true and 3 is less than 4 that will also return true boolean operators everything that evaluates to true and false but more than that boolean operators are known as you know you got the or you have the end and then the not okay so true or false right true or false anytime you have an or statement again imagined a silly example I gave you earlier of ice cream and poison you would respond yes because you like at least one of those things which is probably ice cream so you'll respond yes so the only way an or statement will be false is if both statements are false right like you like snakes or poison I don't like either of them to scare me so both are false as long as any one of them true the overall statement is going to turn out to be true so here true or false is going to return true okay over here again you have a compound expression with the end so you would evaluate this part you'd evaluate this part and then you'd read that with an N and see what happens so for example 3 is less than 4 that's true that this is true you have true and true and that will this whole thing will end up turning into true okay this is just talking about some random functions this and that and we have no idea what they are so we can't possibly evaluate this to a true or false in our heads we would have to know what these functions actually are but just know that not negate something so just the opposite of something conditional statements pretty straightforward right if something is true we print out or we execute the next line of code else if you know so if the first part is not true else if you know if another part is true then we print or execute that block of code but if none of these things are true up here we go to the else part of the code and we just execute that whatever that is ok so here they want us to do write an if statement in the flying circle so the flying circus so they want us to go into this function and write an if statement and it must include an if else if and else statements at least one of a door not a comparator and must return true and evaluate it so cool let's see how fast we can get through this okay so I can say if um five is greater than six and seven is less than five at the top of my head I didn't think what's that can evaluate to so what is that seven is less than five that's false five is ready to take thus false false and false is false here and we're going to say print or print bananas okay it doesn't matter what we say to print in the elsif condition' we are going to put a five equal equal five we don't actually need to put anything else and then there a one else statement so we have satisfied this where we have if L if and else we have satisfied the second bullet point which is that we have included an and we have satisfied the operator you can see we have equal equal we have less than okay let's make it fancier I guess let's do this and let's do this right okay and then finally the flying circus must return true and evaluated so when you actually evaluate it it should return true okay so I guess what they're trying to say is that no matter what happens it should return true so we need to make sure all of these end in a true so it's five let's make it 5 is less than or equal to 6 now this part is true let's make this part and/or because now automatically I know this whole statement is going to be true even if this part is false because it's an order ok so I can say 5 is not equal to 5 which is false this part is true true or false is it getting true so we're line 4 is going to run and is going to return true line 8 is guaranteed to run if line 3 doesn't run and then we can say return true and this should be good boom okay guys we have completed the conditional conditionals and control flow that was a lot for this one video I'm going to stop right here for part 3 stay tuned for part 4 it will be coming shortly and I'll see you guys there take care bye
