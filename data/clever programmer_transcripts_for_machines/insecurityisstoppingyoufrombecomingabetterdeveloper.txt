insecurity might be the biggest reason that's stopping you from becoming a better developer and making the money that you want to make and having the career that you want to have I have a funny crazy story to tell you but it's affecting but I can tell you this it's affecting a lot of different areas of your life and it depends on who you're around also depends on you as well um and so so it it really like makes a difference between everything like you being able to achieve your goals or not so a funny thing happened today uh one of my friends or one of the people that works on my team reached out to him and I said hey um somebody on my you know uh were like yo you're kind of getting fat and and I just reached out to him and told him directly said hey you're getting fat you have an environment that's making very comfortable and cozy and you are getting out of shape and I don't think that's something that you want and you've expressed that to me already and what's going to happen as a result of it if you keep going down this path okay and again the reason I'm telling you the story it's important and I will tell you why to you it actually involves you as a developer as well but let me just finish this right so I'm like why you're going down this path and bro it's not a good look on you when you have kids 10 years from now five years from now or whatever and you want to play with them and hang out with them and do all this stuff like you're not going to able to do a lot of those things because you're going to be huffing and panting and you're just going to be one of those dads that just sits there on the side and watches their kid play and it's kind of useless right can't play soccer with their kids can't do this can't do that you might want to but like it's hard for you because you're [ __ ] fat and like out of shape and you have no stamina left and you're going to regret this and so what I recommend is you go to the gym and like take care of yourself and here's the cool thing here's what happened he listens to this sends me a message and goes thank you so much kazy this was a much needed message I really appreciate you he's like I saved your audio and I'm going to listen to it every day and he said it's 1100 p.m. right now and you know what I'm going to go to the gym right now and then he sent me a photo of him going into elevator and another photo of him at the gym actually working out and I was like this is amazing this is fascinating I just spoke to him and just gave him actual feedback and then 2 minutes later he was actually already implementing it and improving his life and who's really going to benefit out of this like am I really going to get a huge benefit whether he follows the advice or not I'm really not nothing really changes in my life I will continue doing what I'm doing but he just took the advice and he got no ego involved in there and he's just is becoming a way better person and he's changing his life and like his girlfriend will thank him and his kids will thank him if he has kids eventually in the future and like he himself will thank himself because he just added like another 10 20 years to his life by making these decisions it's a domino effect if he goes today he he's more likely to go tomorrow if he goes tomorrow he's even more likely to go two days from now and I just told him like bro you have to start today because you're going to regret it as a day passes a week passes so like you cannot you just have to go [ __ ] today and so one it's being able to honestly tell people your opinion but two it's how people perceive it so and I'm going to give you another story as well which is the actual complete opposite but to make it relevant to you right now I'm just going to share with you it's like if you are getting feedback from somebody on how you can improve as a developer and you're not able to take that that's going to hinder your progress you're not not going to get to where you want to get to you're not going to learn the skills that you have to and developers are very insecure like one of the reasons why I believe a lot of the developers don't even look into chat GPT or Claude or use it heavily is because they're worried that they're going to get replaced so then if they just don't use it that's kind of their way of boycotting it and not falling victim to this inevitable AI that eventually will be the allseeing all knowing thing that like almost everybody will have to know how to use and it will do all of the coding underneath you and I'm going to expand more on this but let me tell you now the opposite story I was on a call with another friend and we were talking and I was like hey we should do XYZ and we should work on this project together and this friend was like pretty excited and so we jump into and you know start working on this project and once we started working on it um her and I she started to have like issues with how I was communicating it because I was really excited and I was telling her all these ideas she thought I was being demeaning to her and patronizing to her and not really caring about her opinions when in fact what was actually happening was I'm when I get excited I get excited like a child so start blurting out all my ideas but I am a very assertive very expressive very communicative person so to people who are nonassertive or slightly lower on the confidence scale they often get threatened by that and think that what's happening is I am attacking them and shutting them down um and if you have followed me or you know me from the channel like that's just how I speak and Nas who's my best friend and also my cofounder in in the business that we're building right now him and I are speaking like this to each other all the time like dude what if we run Facebook ads and we do this thing and then we get like five new customers and he's like yes and also if we do a YouTube thing on top of it or do Instagram ads that could add another three to four uh sales a day and then we just keep building on top of each other's ideas and so what happened was like her insecurity was kind of triggered with that and so then we started going deeper into it it's like hey what's going on like why are you feeling this when and she's like well you know like and then what was happening was how this insecurity was coming out she would just keep saying stuff very didactically without any level of curiosity and she be like well this thing that you're saying is just this right and I'm like yeah it it is she's like it's just this right and I'm like yeah it is um but we wouldn't get into like she wouldn't ask me actual questions like oh what are the things that we could do with these Facebook ads are there things could we do like could we do a 7Day thing could we do a 10day thing what was happening was when I was sharing my ideas on these Facebook ads she was just really frustrated and upset because she's like well you're telling me something that I have already learned and so now when you're doing this you're patronizing me and condescending to me so I'm going to spend all this time on proving to you that I actually know but do it passive aggressively and it just got weird and we ended up wasting like 2 hours like talking about it or 3 hours and I and you know I'll be honest I was disregulated and I was triggered as well because I was frustrated and I was like why the [ __ ] do we have to go and have this like random battle and waste all this energy when like you could have just shared your ideas and I could have just shared mine and then we would be like 20 ideas later like talking about something absolutely incredible and like building something absolutely incredible and instead what has happened is like we just talked about something nonsensical and and whatnot and so it's like everybody has their own opinion but and I'll be honest I got disregulated and I got pretty angry and heated in that and I shouldn't have and I think I could have replied better and dealt with it better but my point is not that my point is this look at the two different scenarios on one side you talk to somebody and they just instantly Implement on the other side you talk to somebody they get defensive they get insecure and they just shut down and when they shut down here's the and let me tell you here's the interesting thing with the person that was motivated when I told him like to go work out and then he did well guess what now I want to take that advice even more because I'm like oh [ __ ] like now he's going working out so I got to go and work out so like not only did he improve his life and add massive value to his life but him taking action that fast I want to take action that fast and I want to go to the gym even more tomorrow and so like both of our Lives actually got massive value now think of the other situation where there was insecurity involved she got insecure and then she kind of shut down and then I kind of shut down and what happened as a result is like no progress was made on the those ideas and then next time I'm about to get into idea generation or brainstorming sessions with her I'm going to be much more hesitant much more like um what's it called like walking on eggshells right to actually share my thought and I think that in the development world when you're coding it's the same exact way which is you can have two people that you could teach coding to you could have one person where you just tell them exactly the feedback that they need to improve hey you need to actually write your code better you need to refactor your code better hey you should use Firebase instead of this other technology hey you should not leave uh your Firebase code and not do like unsubscribe and you should make sure you unsubscribe so you don't have like random memory leakage hey instead of doing all this classbased react components you should make it more functional and the list goes on and there's one person that just instantly does it and going twice the speed and then taking your ID and building on top of it and goes yes you're right I just learned about functional components and guess what there's actually even a newer way to do it and with next you can actually use server side actions and there's a and now these two guys are building and they're giving each other feedback and they're just like flying right like Ping ponging and flying and then you have the other guy where you tell him this and he's like well I already knew this I know this and you're like yeah you know this but you still [ __ ] suck like you still actually got the problem wrong you still wrote like classbased code so like knowledge doesn't mean anything like actually make it functional yeah yeah yeah functional functional I already no functional jsx uh react 18 you're like do you have Tourette's like what is going on like why are you just randomly blurting out these dactic things that you just know stuff but like who cares like it's not even about that it's like doesn't matter if you're right or wrong or you know more or I know less like let's just do the thing correctly like sure you know everything but let's let's just do this thing correctly and what happens is in the process is like one person is what like there's one pair that's winning and the other pair that's just stuck in taking each other down and all of it starts off with one [ __ ] being insecure um two is horrible but like starts off with one and it's like it could be you or the other person that could be insecure but it will lead to your downfall so look at your friends that you're learning coding around you're trying to become a better developer around if they're really insecure people you have to then be like I have to maybe around somebody who's not as insecure and has more confidence because you guys are going to ping pong each other to success two look at the reflection and look at yourself are you insecure are you having trouble taking feedback are you having trouble applying the AI stack and like actually coding with it becoming a better developer if somebody gives you a resource hey use this Library do you try to use that library or you just go no no no it's better to code with hands because you're actually getting insecure because there's something there's something somebody else knows that could be better I believe it's keeping a lot of people stuck and not allowing you to improve your level so I challenge you to look for one insecurity e either in somebody you're working with or in yourself and try to improve it and when you get feedback or criticism instead of spending time defending on your defending yourself if you think they are objectively I say it like this uh I made a rule with nas I said if you give me criticism or feedback on something that will improve my life I will never fight you it's a simple rule that's it um outside of that yeah I will get ugly and fight you like if you say some weird [ __ ] like he said something the other day which was like kind of pissed me off and I was like bro I was I'm offended by that like why would you think this and then we kind of talked about it right but if it's something like you know before uh if he's like dude you chewed with your mouth open don't do that I before I might fight him or he might fight me if I tell him that now we just go okay cool why because it's going to improve my life like I already know I can think one step ahead and go is that going to improve my life or hurt my life if I actually listen to him if it's going to improve my life I'm going to shut the [ __ ] up and I'm just going to do that thing only if it's not if I don't think genuinely it's going to improve my life then I will have a conversation about it but most things that's my rule so if somebody's talking to you and they're saying something and if you do it and improves your life try not to defend yourself just do that thing instead peace
