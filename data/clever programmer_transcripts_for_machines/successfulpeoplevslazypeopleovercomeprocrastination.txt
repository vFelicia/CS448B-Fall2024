hey guys what's up how's it going this is kazy from clever program.com and in this video I want to talk about one of the most important key characteristics between successful people and people or lazy people so in this video I'm going to talk about this and without any further Ado let's jump right into it okay so one thing that I kind of want to drill down and this is one of those things that you will be able to take away right from this video and actually start applying it in your life um is this most people consume content and we're really good at consuming it you know we will sit there and watch Game of Thrones we will watch House of Cards we will watch online tutorials we'll go to websites like stackoverflow.com to get our programming questions answered or we will scour the internet we'll be on Reddit we'll go to YouTube watch videos but you'll but then you'll start to realize a pattern you'll like a you'll enjoy a video on YouTube but you won't find yourself actually hitting the Thumbs Up Button you'll want you'll you'll see an answer on Reddit but you won't see yourself uh adding a comment and adding to that that discussion you will see a video um on or or show on Netflix or whatever but you won't ever see yourself as part of the discussion so yeah you will see us you know we will do a lot of things that we enjoy but we won't actually be collaborating with the community and adding something of value to the world right now successful people on the other hand will add value to the world will add value to the community so one of the main things that I would want you to focus on is stop just sitting there and consuming things because you won't learn things as well everything that is um that you pick up those habits won't be a part of your lifestyle those will just be something that's very passive but when you teach this to others or it's one of those things that you collaborate with the community in right then it's something that will be ingrained in your head so here's what I mean let's say that you are learning something new why not blog about it or why not write about it and share it with your friends even if you don't want to share it online if you are picking up new skills or there are new things that you have coming in your head you know put it in a forum on a website like stack overflow.com on a website like reddit.com collaborate with the community the next time you see something that is thoughtprovoking you know put it leave a comment on it and I don't care if it's for my video even if it's something that you see on a website like github.com or again stack Overflow or Reddit you know those are the ones I'm I keep using because those are the ones that are coming through my head but start with small acts of contributing and creating and when you are creating things you're becoming that top 1% who is actually taking part in this world whereas the other 99% Mily consume it so even one of the key things that that that helped this channel grow is in the start it wasn't this awesome Channel with all of you guys there right it was just me and what the heck do I talk about I wasn't like professional content creator and all the all this stuff all I did was I learned learned about factorials and I was like cool I'm going to make a video about it and share it with the world I learned about some random stuff I wrote a Blog about it uh anything that I was kind of learning about you know or even when I was in college any new thing that I learned or thought could provide value to the world all I did was make a video on it so I didn't have to go oh I have to like be a professional content publisher just like let me just document what's going on in my life and maybe I can help other people and as long as I got one comment or two views or one like that was enough for me because that told me that somebody in some part of the world was finding this valuable now let me give you some other big giant benefits that come from this so let's say that you are learning computer programming right now you're a complete beginner what would be the benefits if you started writing about your journey one even if you're if you're a complete beginner right because sometimes we worry or we have to be an expert to write about it keep in mind I wasn't an expert when I was writing about these things so let's talk about some of the benefits let's say you start uh writing a Blog right or you start writing about this one of the things that's going to happen is you're going to become damn good at the subject because you're going to have to crystallize your thoughts to actually write it and then it's edged there forever so you can actually refer back to it okay one for you very beneficial another benefit if you go to apply to a job you can show them your resume which is cool you can show them your curriculum VTE you know your CV that's cool you can do an interview with them that's cool but hey how about check out my blog or even better yet how about if they say oh we have checked out your blog so that brings me to the third benefit of it which is people can find you people can recognize you and find you and be like hey I want to work with you you don't even actually have to go out and get to work people will come to you right they can come to you and in the other scenario where they don't find you at least it gives you something very powerful that when you show to people it gives you that giant Edge over everybody else right this is one of the things I want to talk about unfair advantages not unethical advantages but unfair advantages meaning that they give you a boost in life that other people miss out on right so you want to get as many unfair advantages that you can get but make sure that they're ethical obviously you know one of the other unfair advantages is waking up early but that's for another video in this video I just want to talk about get in that habit of creating now I also want to show you one of the students at clever programmer okay you see my channel you guys can go back to my older videos and see exactly what I was doing but I want to give you an example of somebody else uh so this is one of the students at clever programmer and I've actually been even working with him uh oneonone a little bit but all like all of this stuff that I'm going to be showing you he pretty much did on his own okay so you can check this out his name is Dennis Dennis Murphy and um it's really cool what he's doing so for example okay we worked together oneonone and we we built a basic flas Gap okay and I barely I showed him just a few things about how flask Works in Python then he went ahead and instead of just sitting there and watching tutorials all day right which is again what unfortunately most of us will do he went in there and he started building things okay so this didn't just happen in one day but you can see he put together this full website from you know from uh from pretty much scratch using uh a framework called flask using HTML and then using I I believe bootstrap and some uh one of the themes from bootstrap but all the technicality aside he is a beginner in Python he's getting better through just working at it but making sure that he's actually producing things and making things so this is one of the Prime examples of you actually working to produce content rather than just taking it okay um so you again all he did was he built this website and for the idea all he's like okay this is just going to be my uh you know my portfolio essentially so he built a portfolio he says he's a WordPress developer a python developer and he buil this using flask framework cool now another cool thing that I want to show you is that all throughout his journey right you can see he's just been blogging about it so focus on social media write a blog python apps behaving badly in flask so now he's so there's a there's a blog post about python suspend the filters I have no idea what the hell that's about but sounds pretty cool right he had an idea and he wrote a blog post about it a third way of living and then again you have deploy flask app to Heroku and this is really cool and I think a lot of you can actually benefit from it especially if you've uh you're in my oop course and you watched my flask video if you click on that blog post he talked about how he published that flask app you know so if nothing he might be able to get a junior developer job faster than most other people simply because he's writing up about it and those who hire him can see his passion for it and they're like this person is trainable and they can look at his consistency of him creating things and he doesn't just sit there and consume yeah and then also then he went ahead on medium.com and he's been blogging and he started recently I kind of pushed him to you know start medium but then I'm not pushing him anymore and he's doing it on his own he's consistently been blogging even on medium.com you can do the same things doesn't take rocket science you don't need a degree you don't need crazy levels of experience and you don't need to be an expert in any of this you can literally blog or write about or um make a video about what you're currently learning and maybe it'll resonate with somebody else maybe it will get you a higher paying job maybe it will make the convincing of you getting a job easier maybe people will recognize you and maybe like clever programmer you might actually be able to build your own business right and get a following of people who find what you're doing helpful so get out of the habit of just consuming start getting in the habit of creating and start small you can start by leaving comments in places and if you think something is bad dislike it instead of just walking away if you think something's good like it and again I'm not talking about my YouTube videos which but you can give it a like that would be awesome but I am talking about literally if you're on a post you're on a forum you are like on a random website and you read something you know just get out of that weird cycle of not doing anything I'll give you an example on GitHub um it's a website for developers made by developers um and I was stuck in this problem for one problem for a long time so I went on github.com and I went and deep into this one forum and like 30 threads down or whatever right 30 pages down in this thread I still didn't find um I still didn't find a solution there but finally I was able to figure it out so what I did is I went back to that thread wrote exactly how I found my solution and then you know I kind of left it I'm like whatever I'm just going to write down how I found it maybe it'll help somebody else few months later you know I got people who were thanking me they're like thank you Rafa Kazi that worked thank you this worked and here's the cool part two years later I got stuck when I was doing python development in the same problem but I had forgotten about this solution or anything I went back on github.com went to this thread was 30 pages deep in that thread just going bashing my head spent like 5 hours trying to figure out couldn't figure it out went and I saw some some people were saying thanks thanks and I'm like oh so maybe somebody found a solution that's why people are thinking let me go go to the person that they're thinking and guess who that person was it was me and I basically solved my problem two years before and it helped kazzy from the future so it can even help you right if not for anybody else but it's cool to help other people along with helping yourself all right so that's the message for this video stop consuming start creating that's one of the key differences between people who end up becoming successful versus the people who stay where they are again take control thank you for watching and as always I love you so much and I'll see you in the next video
