I'm video hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm we are live on Instagram YouTube Facebook this video we're gonna be covering a little bit more technical stuff related to Python okay so if you have been like hmm when does Kazi gonna teach us some more technical stuff don't worry today we're gonna talk a little bit about more technical things along with the soft skills that are needed okay some of the things that we're gonna be talking about is what is the best web development framework for Python okay what do those frameworks the developers who develop in those frameworks what did they get paid on average and we're gonna be talking about the best code editor for Python alrighty and I'm also gonna be looking at your guys's comments and checking them out do you for them yeah buddy cool cool cool yeah awesome got nobody on Facebook what's going on everybody's sleeping we got some people on Instagram hi Brina Jude what's going on here on YouTube let's check it out let's check it out dude I got a coop for programming all thanks to you what does that mean but I'm happy that happened Jillian Reynolds has nice shirt quasi thank you so much yes finally I'm not looking homeless I get it I also got a haircut I'm looking fresh on point for people who want to feed into my self validation and need for love just telling me that my haircut is looking on point which to be honest it is but it's still nice to read it and it's cause EQ azi I love you guys but you know please guys somebody just spelled my name correctly I get it spelled wrong so many times including the emails or it's written right on top it says Kazi and they're right quasi and then these people wonder why they're not getting the jobs or those interviews that they want details guys they matter pay attention to details it almost says hey man just got finished watching part 2 I love you I love you more Domo thank you and I'm happy that that helped you on point bro somebody says I'm this guy's neighbor that's weird I have a guess who it is the Pasha is that you Pasha are you watching this live stream oh maybe I should turn tone down this guy a little bit wait oh the gain gain is really down so maybe they can't even hear me and in this video we're also gonna be talking about how you can build your own Python freelance character and take your own skills up as a Python freelancer okay if you want to be a Python developer and work with a company or be a site hustler you're also welcome here I'm just gonna be focusing more on this freelancing part and I'm gonna be kind of talking more about that as well Larry says thank you so much love the portfolio guys the second video is out make sure in the description it lets them maybe know that a little bit but guys the second video the part two of the master class is live okay this master class is what shows you how you can become a Python developer in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck this master class is absolutely free and in the first master class we covered a lot of things like soft skills we covered just overall lots of things like for example your Python earning potential how much you could be looking to make okay so if you haven't watched the first one go watch it it's absolutely free and it's in the links in the descriptions below so go enjoy that and I have some other stuff for you guys let me just pull up some of my notes coolly okay make this half on this screen but a BAM bada boom well what did I press being a programmer and all I should really learn how to use my computer this goes here and this goes here and we are golden okay for people who are having trouble opening up the portfolio guys it's just like like literally you know I made it so you can doubleclick and open it or you can just go on and open a new file in Chrome if you're still having trouble google how to open an HTML file that's it just Google how to open an index.html file and Google will give you all your answers okay because in the second video we go over all of that okay so in the second video that got launched today I show you the number one secret to how you can become that developer in less than 90 days okay this is if you don't have degree you don't have money you don't have time and you don't have technical skills it works for all of you guys I also go over how I went from being a 2.0 GPA student and making $100,000 in one year and I kind of give you guys that as well okay so I give you how I did that while being a bad student so some of you guys can relate with that and it would help you knowing that you don't need to be smart enough and see that practical path that's also in there yeah we're gonna do the Q&A for a little bit but yet so the where this live stream where the idea kind of got conceptualized in my mind for this live stream which is I say build your Python freelance character is I remember when I was younger and I would play video games like Sims or like Skyrim or I used to play this one game called Dragon Age Origins and what what a lot of these games have in common is you have a character and whatever you do with this character you get these skill points and your guy becomes better and better in those particular skills so for example if you're playing a game like Dragon Age Origins and your guy is focusing on being a mage and he's doing spells or whatever or if your guy is being an archer or a swordsman whatever as you spend more time with those weapons or those things your guy levels up in those skills or take Sims where when your guy spends more time reading books he becomes better at reading more books and also he becomes more knowledgeable so now he can make new foods that he couldn't make before and he can do a lot of things he couldn't do before or for if he spends more time in the gym your characters get those skill points in the gym he starts getting better and then it takes him longer to get hungry and all that and there was a point in my life where I kind of loved games and then what happened to me was I kind of realized that if you spend time on yourself and you build up those skill points just in life it's kind of the same way even though there's no gamma fication happening you know you're the gooey bars are actually not building up and you can't go somewhere you don't get a notification for it right and when you log into life when you wake up you don't get a little notification that goes Boop you got a hundred points for sleeping on time and getting seven and a half hours of sleep you don't get a little notification for going to the gym today you don't get a little notification for being nice to your parents you don't get a notification for it getting your girlfriend a little gift and what starts to happen is when we don't have that instant gratification we look in other places those other places could be video games those other places could be things like drugs and alcohol and those other places could just be you know whatever like places where you're fine like Netflix you're watching stranger things you're watching house of cards you're binging on some anime you just found and that happens to us a lot and that happens to me at times too and as you compare what you're doing in those video games and in those movies and how the drugs and alcohol might make you feel with where you actually are in real life the contrast it kind of it hurts because one thing is so awesome and fun and instant gratification whereas this other thing you're getting farther and farther from your goals every day you're just sitting there like if I just started going to the gym I had that thought like seven years ago and I thought I was too old to go to the gym seven years ago and if I just done it what would I look like right now or you have that thought oh man I knew I could have done that job or started that business and now my friends doing it and look how well he's doing or I should have started a YouTube channel and look where that would have been now or I should have done this for that and look where that would have been now but then BOOM switch let's watch some stranger things baby let's watch some house of cards let's watch some Fargo forget about everything else and we kind of get caught up in that but here's a cool thing if you can if you can get over that instant gratification thing a little bit and not getting those little notifications in life and you start to really focus every day you take 10 to 15 minutes analyzing where you are your own life is kind of like being that video game character if you spend more time dealing with tough tough conversations maybe you're at work at whatever your current job is and you go in to ask for that promotion it feels uncomfortable your how it hearts pounding your hands are shaking you're sweating whoo scary right but when you go and do it and you get through it and maybe you get that promotion what just happened your skill points improved in negotiation and now you could use those skill points at other jobs isn't it freaking cool like after you kind of realize that why do you need to play Skyrim you kind of don't what happens when you put some time into going to the gym after a little bit weeks you know a few weeks you'll start to see some results and now you're putting points into your own physical fitness and getting better your character in real life is getting better and guess what when you put that controller away the character doesn't go away it's still there with you forever if the lights go out and the game ends or the hard drive crashes and all your saves are gone it doesn't matter because that character is you and that's there forever that doesn't run out of batteries if you spend time coding like Python for example or whatever language and you're coding you're building your coding skills tree you're becoming a better developer and if you spend time doing this and you're building cool projects it literally feels just like playing a game except you might be making six figures doing it isn't that nice now contrast that with playing video games watching stranger things abusing drugs and alcohol and sitting in your mom's basement versus playing this other game called being a developer web development working on projects I feel literally like a game except it's like a glitch in life and people are paying you money money for it and at the end of the day you have something to show for it and you're doing this from a nice apartment overlooking a lake or something I don't know whatever it is that you like to overlook maybe you could be overlooking dumpsters that's your thing I don't know I don't know that is something that excites me these skills if you work on them on your own in real life when everything else goes to these skills are there with you forever they're there with you to stay there with you and you're getting money as a benefit as a bonus and now you can not only support yourself but your family you also don't have to feel like you're you don't have confidence you also don't have to feel like you have that lack of control in life because doing these things and working on yourself gives you that control in life okay so this is something important to keep in mind as you move forward now what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk a little bit about web development and the differences between different frameworks okay so we're gonna get a little bit technical and we're going to talk about Python again in the meantime I'm going to look at some of your guys's what you guys are saying maybe some comments maybe some questions and kind of answer that no questions so far not too many questions I am looking for some questions that I can ask for you guys or answer for you guys can you make neural network tutorial for beginners using Python yes I will be making I will be doing some stuff with machine learning later on not at this moment in time because I'm focusing more on web development with Python but don't worry this is something that excites the hell out of me so I will be doing some neural network stuff and I'm gonna be bringing on best developers in the world on this channel and they're either gonna be helping me build some kind of awesome curriculum for you guys or literally I'm gonna have them make some videos for you guys too so AI or whatever it is that you guys want to learn not a problem here's what I urge everybody to do right now I'm gonna give you like 20 seconds as I go through these q and A's have a pen paper with you because the things that we're gonna be talking about are extremely valuable you don't want to miss them okay I would share the slides with you but again I'm on three different live platforms so I have to respect that because if I share the slides with everybody on YouTube if Instagram doesn't see that and if I share something on Facebook YouTube and Instagram doesn't see that so I have to respect all that so guys go get a piece of paper pen whatever and write these things down because they're gonna be very valuable to you as time Prague makes progress okay so there are two big frameworks in Python but before we talk about framework let's talk about web development in general okay web development has to do with developing things on the web everything you see online and the main one of the main things I want to kind of touch on is web sites versus web apps okay or basically like solutions to problems so regular web sites I want you to think of like imagine I don't know your regular contact me pages your restaurant web sites that are super boring and just I don't know have like static stuff on it you can't really do much there just go just read their menu that's really yet or it maybe has some dudes phone number and you can call them or email somebody that's your static website but those things you can build in WordPress or Squarespace if you guys are not familiar with these open another tab and type this in so you can learn or write these down so you can learn them later you actually don't open and there are other tabs right now I want you guys to pay attention right here to me and just write this down and then later you can open up other tabs and do this okay so WordPress is basically like a pointandclick build a website Squarespace is a pointandclick build a website thing wakes and Weebly similarly those things people don't pay you a lot for those are commodities you can have 12 year old learn it very quickly and and also a lot of those are outsourced and there are a lot of people that can do them ok so any skill that's easy to do you're not gonna get paid for ok but a skill that takes a lot of time and is difficult you're gonna get paid for it and quite a bit because it's hard to replace you like right now and think about this where you are working how easy do you think it is to replace you if the answer is pretty easy then it probably also makes sense what you're getting paid right so if you think you're getting paid some low income and then you think that it's not that hard to replace you put the two and two together and the reason why you're probably making a lower income is cuz that it's easier to replace you but now as you start to get more specialized and as you learn more skills it's harder to replace you okay so generic websites that you can build with web web wordpress or whatever they're not too hard to do so you don't get paid much for it but the things that you do get paid for is for example and I'm gonna use big company name so it you guys can tie that in your head but most of the times when you're starting out you don't have to work with these big companies you can get started with a lot smaller companies that are under the radar and are trying to get their foot off the ground and get going but with the things that you get paid for is for example like Spotify is a music streaming problem and if you can solve it that's something you can get paid for so that's like a web app how about Domino's right where you can go and it'd be really boring if the pizza is just pictures of them were there and you just had to call them and order something but it's pretty dynamic you have to click on it you can order you can increase your order you can change your order when when you're in their app when you put mushrooms on your pizza you can choose if you want to put half on one side and half on the other you can choose what's your quantity you can delete and you can remove so for all of those things and being able to add that functionality that's a solution to a burning problem and the developers that got hard hire to do that would get paid a lot same thing with snapchat there's a huge networking problem there to fix how do you have all these people in the world sending each other pictures it goes fast it doesn't crash and our website and they're able to send pictures and videos like instantly boom boom boom how do you do that without your servers being overloaded right and here's a word I'm gonna give you guys it's called crud so write that down that's one of the things you have to know about as a web developer and be able to do pretty fast crud c ru D in caps so if you guys are here write that in comments and also write that you call caps crud and then I'm gonna tell you guys what it stands for okay so write that down on your notes and once you guys write this down on your notes or your hands I don't really care write this down then let me know say something like three I don't know three yeah number three just say three once you write it down it'd be better if I just add them say crud cool crud means read it means create just making sure you guys are paying attention it means create read update and delete okay for things I don't know why I do it like I'm in Germany in United States we do it like this for but I think it's just cooler when I do when I do three like this I think it's really cool so I'm gonna keep doing it but that's what that means okay crud create read update delete write that down next to you on a piece of paper preferably and what that has to do with is I'll give I'll give you examples of where it's applied when you're when you're in Domino's app and you're trying to create an order for those of you guys who don't know dominoes dominoes is a company that delivers pizzas this off the pizza problem okay when you create a order for a pizza that's what part of the crud I'm now gonna quiz you guys as you guys watch this live stream when you create the pizza what part of crud do you think that is is it the see is that the or is it the U or the D what mines are taking them so long okay good Eric cool thank you for being the cool one yes good a gamer's pro tube he says who doesn't know Domino's you'd be surprised because for one you misspelled Domino's my friend I think you're talking about the Domino's game Domino's Pizza spelled differently legendary nerd laughs some people say I want to ate now roasted live on clever programmer calm that's what happens to being tried to roast other people get your get your own game in check or anyway sorry got off tangent okay that's the create part now what about being able to let's say you put that order but now you want to change that order okay now you want to make that order something different what part of the crud do you think that is when you've already created the order but now before hitting checkout you're like I don't want pepperonis on my pizza I just want some green peppers and jalapenos what part of crud is that good that's the update part all right and before I go further for those of you guys are like what are we doing web developers get paid a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year and believe it or not this is one of the things that is massively helpful and right now I know I'm having you just like kind of learn it and regurgitate and memorizing it was like oh it doesn't make sense but I promise you right after we're done with this I'm gonna kind of give you examples I'm gonna be giving examples of it and this is this is gonna be one of those things that saves you years of your time and also helps you now it's researchable for you so you can actually look at online tutorials be able to do this and get those jobs that pay you a lot and you don't need years of experience to get these web development jobs like in my PLC or my video part two of the master class okay that got launched it's called why most programmers are broke in that one I also share with you what things I was working on and what client paid me twenty thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents for two months of work and it was pretty much just me knowing crud and working on it so now let's continue forward so you guys know you guys have it in your mind why this can be actually really important helpful for you all right now when I am let's say let's just do last one and this is so obvious if I don't want my pizza anymore I'm just angry I don't like I just call Domino's service and that lady just didn't have the right attitude she just pissed me off rubbed me the wrong way and I'm like all right all bets are off and I go and I hit X on that order what part of the crud did I just do yeah oh god damn it was closed sweet good job you guys know your stuff patty that's hilarious patty poo says I do that all the time delete nice that's one of my friends too he always made YouTube videos of guitar and he deleted them and he would have had millions of views but instead he has zero views on his guitar channel yep good job guys it's the delete part so if I delete my order I've deleted so again crud create read update and delete okay and lastly I want to give you an example of the read part what if you have ordered your pizza but you don't know what the heck you ordered and then you go click view order what part of crud is that create read update delete what part of the crud is that you being able to go oh what the heck where what what pizza did i order you know clicking that view button boom man you guys are legends some people say we're lost it's okay if you're lost you just have to probably watch the stream a little bit back but just to keep you uptodate if you're new right if you just enter the stream right now we're talking about web development and how in web development there's something very big concept called crud and Sanford create read update and delete and now I'm giving examples of Domino's a big company like Domino's uses crud a company like Spotify users crud for example if I want to add a music to the playlist maybe that creates a new music in my playlist so that's create if I click on it that gives me goes into it that's read and if I want to maybe shuffle it I don't know that's like updating it and if I want to remove it from my playlist that's delete okay same way with Netflix same way with YouTube every all of these apps can be pretty much summed up with one word if you want to call it crud okay that's what we're talking about and right now we're just quizzing everybody live on crud and making them understand the concept of this looking at comments just whoa nice okay awesome Tomo is now the moderator of the chat because he bribed us first with some with some super chats no not just kidding he he's doing a good job with the chat wow that's really cool I didn't even know you can make moderators well welcome Domo yeah so crud is love okay so for again for those you guys are new write these things down best development frameworks in Python there's Django and then there's flask write that down I'm gonna come back to that point okay what we're talking about is the big picture view of web development we're talking about how much Python web developers get paid so according to indeed.com if you look at it right now average Django Python developer makes a hundred and ten thousand and six hundred and ten dollars every single year and one of the key concepts their entire job could be summarized in is with one word crud okay so say it with me what the crud I get paid one hundred and ten thousand dollars a year for crud what the crud it's crazy so if you've written down crud if you've written down Django if you've written out flasks all these things you guys can research later also Python web developers and how much they make you could research later we've talked about WordPress and Squarespace being able to build boring sites but Python can help you build web apps okay that can provide solutions these are not things that you can just do in Squarespace and you know pointandclick these are things that you have to use real powerful programming languages for to solve problems things problems with things like Dropbox cloud storage problem solved with Python YouTube video sharing problem solved with Python I've already talked about Spotify reddit a social network for sharing links and threads and I don't even know it's very complicated for me a reddit was a social problem solved with Python Instagram similarly a photo sharing problem solved with Python so you can see that these massive companies are using it Google a search engine problem solved with Python okay so you have to build really custom solutions for it and ultimately again it comes down to crud alright it comes down to kind of one thing and crud is all over in games as well when you're playing video games okay when your character creates a new weapon then being able to see that weapon you click view weapon if you want to then add a little bit of firepower to that weapon so it increases its damage that's what you know be thinking about it so as I ask you just quickly in your mind just be active don't just sit there passively watching it just breathing because if you're just breathing and watching why even beyond the stream you're not getting anything out of it okay so I want to respect you and your time so that's why I tell you to actively learn and as I ask you questions just be quick and be right there have your pen and paper and just write down answers to everything I'm saying kind of like I'm right there with you okay alright what did I just say do you remember I lost my train of thought I got it games right okay so when you add magic to your weapon that's the update part all right and then when you maybe don't want that weapon anymore you don't want that shield anymore you that's the delete part so keep thinking about crud as you're going through life and be looking at things like that because that's another thing that can be helping you build that can be helping you build your own Python freelance character okay you're building the skill points so maybe in your skill tree you have Jango and as you put more time into Jango and build that skill tree right then maybe you learn about things like crud along that Jango tree or that flask tree and you become more and more valuable getting yourself closer to being able to land those jobs that pay you a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year oh look at this proof I went to you told me to show this right proof I went to Oakland Community College look at this it's showing correctly here oh look how a mustache my pen so if you guys are enjoying this so far give me a hell yeah before I continue because if you guys are not super chatting me and paying me money on YouTube you guys got to give me something so I continue let's keep this right here and I just monster has to sponsor me at some point and pay me for this yeah okay good good good good this is awesome man I love these guys could be here like I wish that we could just be in like the seminar place and then I could just like help everybody I'd just be running around be like boom boom boom boom boom and helping you guys build your things Hudson says I love your face no Hudson I love your face more my friend okay so if you sounds like you guys are loving this I want to pause for a moment before I continue again a lot of these things I go into deep in my profitable programmer masterclass which I just launched this class is absolutely free okay free2go and part two is called why the best programmers are broke and then part two again I show you how you can become a Python developer in less than 30 days if you have no time no money no degree and you feel like you're old or whatever and I'm just saying these things so people who jump into the livestream now they know where to go and what to do okay in this part 2 training series you know training video in my profitable programmer training I also go over how I made one hundred and four thousand dollars as a Oakton Community College student and apparently I have this pen too which is cool cuz just proof for you guys mmm not that I know you guys believe me but just want to throw it in there for those of you guys for luck and I go through that and I also show you guys literally my behindthescenes code some of it that I used to build this Python app okay for that client who paid me $20,000 for two months of work less than two months of work and I got that client in 90 days of me going from zero coding skills knowing nothing about coding knowing not a single line of code to then landing this client in 90 days and then making 20k with this client and then going on to make 100k that one year okay that was my first year I started to code and that was my year yeah I was doing Python freelancing so if that's something that interests you right now pause what you're doing open a new tab click the link below it's called clever programmer 2 slash master class followed by whatever and it'll take you right to the master class so you can sign in sign up for it and then as the three videos that are supposed to get launched they're gonna get sent right to you also in the second video also in this second video I'm gonna be giving you your portfolio as a for a Python freelancer it's built specially for Python freelancers that you can literally download okay and steal from me and then what you can do is it has a my work section so as you continue your journey as a Python freelancer you can plug and chug your Python projects in this portfolio so I'm gonna be just giving away a full on portfolio again by itself this would be like a hundred or two hundred dollar course but I'm giving that portfolio away to you guys for free I'm also sharing the behindthescenes code for those of you guys who have missed part one of the training big mistake but it's still up all of these training videos are up for a limited time until I take them down but in part one we cover a lot of things a lot of things what do we cover so in part one like my friend said we show you your Python earning potential and we have put together a calculator for you that can show you what your earning potential for as a Python freelancer would be like okay so for example say that you got one client at $50 an hour you work with that client for ten hours and write this math down to because I'm gonna go through it fast because I've went through it in my last live stream but you again I'm gonna start again fifty dollars an hour you work with this client for ten hours a week and that's one of the lowest rate you can charge the Python freelancer week one you make five hundred dollars and in monthly you make two thousand dollars and yearly from that one client you make twenty four thousand dollars two thousand dollars pays for all this extra stuff phone bills Netflix Hulu whatever office rental stuff car insurance dental insurance I don't know whatever and the twenty four thousand dollars you could be using to start a new startup or put in 401k or Charles Schwab or make that investment you've always wanted to make extra income does not hurt and I help you calculate your Python earning potential by giving you the calculator you could literally steal and download and then also I have a worksheet for you that helps you figure out your Python freelancer lifestyle again all of that is for free unbelievable I can't even believe I give you guys all the stuff for free so just go and take advantage of it all right please would you do that for me if you're here go ahead and do that link is in the description on Facebook the link is in bio on Instagram and link is in description on YouTube now with that shameless plug being out of the way let's continue moving forward okay Sheldon here's what I want you to do on YouTube I see you say when I load the profitable programmer portfolio I only get plain HTML I want you to email us I'm not gonna announce what the email is because then this YouTube video gets launched in the sly stream gets washed and everybody just emails us at once go to my website clever programmer calm at the bottom hit continue to website and then go to the contact page get our email from there and then send me an email and I'll personally get on a call with you and I'll help you figure out how to put that portfolio together for yourself Sheldon okay also for those other people that might be going through the same problem don't take the index.html file out of the folder everybody this is for the people who went through part two of my training which is called why most programmers are broke and in there I let you download a portfolio app that's built specially for Python freelancers and when you open them that portfolio you literally have it you've just stolen it from me like this and I have video instructions on how to copy it but if you take out that index.html file that I gave you in the folder and put it somewhere else and then double click and open it it'll kind of give you wrong stuff meaning it'll give you only a plain HTML file without CSS there meaning the styling so think of it like a human without clothes hTML is like a person without clothes was just naked and then the CSS part the cascading style sheet is what gives you that style puts on that clothing and makes you look good okay so you're still a person meaning your website still exists with HTML you still have links and you have you know words on it but it looks really boring and it doesn't look interesting and it just creeps people out but then when you ask CSS to it then it makes people feel comfortable and actually enjoy spending time on that website okay man we are making some dough for making some money on YouTube man all right monkey says how much money doesn't create apps course cost monkey two three one six again I want you to go to my website hit continue to website go to contact email us it's email us and I will tell you exactly how much the course cost just for you okay if I am on the live stream and if I say how much the course cost if this video is being used later and the course price has changed whether it's down or up it will just confuse the heck out of people so I don't want to do that to people and confuse them I want this video to be up there forever and give value to everybody okay so make sure you go to my website and you email us and what the hell I'll just say it it's support a clever programmer calm okay just email us there I don't care how many people email us there will reply back to most of you it's hard to reply back to everybody cuz there's just so many people but we promise we'll try to get back to every single one of you whatever questions you have so monkey 3 2 1 6 thank you for the donation and we are gonna answer your question alright Tiffany and Smith says I want to help clients generate leads creating custom quizzes is Python the best language for this ok Tiffany I actually have experience with generating leads with creating custom quizzes with Python and without Python here's what I'm gonna tell you if your job requires you to know programming and build this with Python and integrate this with Python then yes Python would be a very good choice to make this happen but if you're just looking to help your clients generate leads so then you become a more profitable consultant or they pay you more and you become that trusted advisor you don't have to do this task on your own you can use an amazing service like typeform comm or you can use Survey Monkey comm to create custom quizzes and qualify leads essentially okay I assume that's what you're trying to do right you're trying to ask your leads if Tiffany asks a question in here just let me know in the stream but basically what you're trying to do I assume is help your clients qualify the leads that they're getting and make sure that they're good leads right these are people who actually will not waste the time of your clients so something like typeform calm is great it was awesome for me when I was trying to get oneonone students for clever programmer and work with them oneonone and do mentoring now I don't do as much mentoring I've pretty much I haven't been doing oneonone mentoring for a while because I want to provide content to all of the students so that's why I've kind of stopped but I was using type form for that hopefully that answers your question Tiffany but again if you want to use something with Python look into Django and you'll be able to put together custom quizzes fairly easily look on Stack Overflow and now point you in the right direction thank you for the $5 donation yeah qualified leads from social ads I figured yeah cool Glenn says I would like to do a CRM project awesome Glenn you can use Python for a CRM project as well I in my part two video why best programmers are bro or my most programmers were broke I literally show you again that app that I made and I show you some behind the scenes code and that AB that client paid me twenty thousand dollars for that app is actually made with that app I made and the project was on CRM so I built a customer relationship management system for my clients and I give you guys a little sneak peek of the work that I did and some of the work that was involved this last teams livestream song is pretty cool I like answering technical questions it's me going also it's probably the monster Matt you're welcome hey guys um on YouTube or wherever who was able to download the portfolio and it worked well for them just say what should we have them say he always my friend all this comes up with one okay so say one if you were able to download that portfolio and it worked well for you also I'm scared my live stream might die on Instagram let's just check it out 9% keep it reminding me to check it out okay so monkey just monkey monkey three two one six just emailed us so just respond back and let's see what's going on here okay yeah alright so for people it worked for some people it did not work somos thank you so much for moderating the chats he says he has school tomorrow yeah thank you thank you thank you and you did a great job Tomo enjoy your school somebody says 0.5 why couldn't you download it Naruto yeah it's supposed to show you the final file and in that final file when you click it's a folder when you click in it it has index.html come here dude just so they can see your face your face looks on point they want to see you from now they're gonna think I'm crazy and I'm just talking to myself just say hi to them they miss you there we go that's my boy Mustapha goes by Clark Co CLU X I owe Glen link is in the description my friend so go ahead and do that guys just go go through the video I've put together for you that will help you get the portfolio alright anyways now let's talk a little bit about Python frameworks so there are two big frameworks Jango and flask like I've mentioned here are my recommendations flask is pretty simple but the problem is that okay let's just talk about quickly what a framework is so if you were to do web development Python you would have to pull out your hair not because of Python Python is awesome but because web development you'd have to write all your own code but if you use a framework with Python like flask the benefit of that is that it does all the big heavy lifting for you that you don't have to worry about anymore so creating servers and making things go online on a website okay make other people be able to see your website it's super easy you can do it with just a few lines of code flask is super light weight again as I'm talking write these things down flask is pretty lightweight and it's cool but the problem is because it's too lightweight sometimes it's you have to write a lot of code to make things work whereas Django is a little bit more advanced looking and can be confusing sometimes but it's what we call batteries included and it comes with a lot of libraries a lot of big things juicy meaty things built in there so think of it like bunch of developers who gave up and had sleepless nights God probably divorces because it works so hard and like got huge eye bags writing all this code and creating this amazing thing for you and now you can just steal it with just a few lines of code and use it okay so think of it think of Django like that and you could build things pretty quickly so me I'm personally more a fan of your mic is too good I can hear you gulping down what are you drinking I'm drinking monster and I did not know you guys could hear me gulp okay somebody just said can we see more cluck Co I don't know guys do you guys want to see more of cluck Co how much would that ya type one all was his idea to type one how much would that suck if they're all like none of us want to see you like they just start typing zero oh yeah we should do that have you delirious yeah create apps and land your first climb with Python course it will be prerecorded but you'll get each piece of content like a week from now like every week essentially oh man oh man Akash Renaldo all right you heard him this is what they want somebody just says a child's kids yell okay come on in bro what's up everybody how you guys doing clicks you back again welcome back to Ghazis livestream all right click Co so talk about some technical Python stuff and help I will not be able to answer any of those questions but uh if you guys need some photography help YouTube help I got you guys yeah he's just a pretty face for this live stream we both got our like haircuts today I was looking on point my hair is kind of messed up right now yeah I didn't gel it up or anything but straight out of the shower we are looking fresh yeah yeah this guy's been like my brother we we became friends when dude like when we were 10 years old like 10 years old I heard those of you guys who don't know hilarious okay sorry guys all right inappropriate back to the live stream about I I was born in Pakistan and I was born in a very very very small city that most of people don't even know exists its called Peshawar and every time I say that to people they're like ha ha pshh our like a pee shower I always get a kick out of it and he was born in Pakistan as well but he was he's from Karachi okay so literally everybody who comes to united states from Pakistan it's not like two cities okay its Karachi and Islamabad and that's pretty much it every other city nobody makes it out of there and you know nobody does they're all just stay in Pakistan even though to try to come to America I came here at the age of nine and then I met him about when I was ten years old and then we we have known each other since then so it's been a long journey I'm now 23 years old and yeah we used to be like little tiny babies and we used to make these stupid videos and now we grew older and we still are little tiny babies that make stupid videos except now we just have beards oh yeah that's literally the only difference 30 year long time friends damn yeah they know we were that old no no not 30 okay fine I'm not gonna I'm from Kazakhstan exactly it's pretty much the same thing as long as none mean it's just a little spelling difference Wow pom pom laughing emoji love the glasses mine or cozies I'm from India cool cool I'm it's not such a small it's not such a small city Lahore Aslam but I'm from India cool cool pretty cool the shower can now be called a small city grew up in Chicago all right okay so oh we're going offline on Instagram I want to give you value before Instagram goes offline okay so I have one minute and 20 something seconds okay give a round of applause to cluck Co so send the clapping emoji okay so web development django developers make about a hundred and ten and dollars a year jingle is my more preferred framework it's a little bit advanced but if it's taught to you the right way you can pick it up fast and then you don't have to look back jingo is my preferred way to go write that down second best text editors or coding editors for python so there are a lot of them there is sublime text there is at hum and then there is PyCharm sublime text and atom you can use interchangeably sublime text that annoying thing is it keeps asking for purchase whereas atom is completely free so you guys can just download atom to write your code in pie chart is my personal favorite IDE or let's just simplify and say coding editor it's my favorite but I would recommend you guys to get into pycharm around the second or third month mark of your coding because it is a little bit more technical and it is a little bit more advanced and in the start it might confuse you more than it helps you because of how big it is but again is just a few practical things you need to know and then boom boom boom you're all caught up look at this how many collapse you're getting all right oh damn it I couldn't give my outro to San Instagram it's okay Instagram still knows we love them ok just saving it and then I'm gonna hit share um coo coo coo coo coo cool alright so for someone who wants to enter into web dev what would you advise them Jango seems challenging with their setups and admin Django is honestly pretty simple to get started with just the starting part is sometimes tricky but once you get past a little bit of starting time it's pretty easy to build things up really fast with Django so again I'm a huge fan of Django but if you have extra time in your life learn a little bit of flask maybe spend a week learning flask and that will show you the things you need to be doing with web development and how you're doing them because you're gonna be writing each line of code yourself you'll get a good grasp what the heck is going on and then when you do them in Django you'll just be like oh it's just like this thing I did in Flast except it's easier now and it won't confuse you okay so that's really it and let's put this or actually I'm sorry I'll just do it okay got it see easy PC selfie stick guys this is awesome by the way boom you can increase it boom like this then it has this remote the Bluetooth so you can press this button to take a picture you can change it landscape or portrait mode for your phone and this Bluetooth thing it's like a remote and it even comes out and then you could put this far away and you could take a picture and then last thing I didn't show you guys this is pretty cool you get actually it has a little tripod and boom you could put it on the table you know and then set it up and there you go and it's very compact once you pack it up looks like this man I should be doing some affiliate marketing all right yeah free advertising unfortunately but feel free to super chat me on YouTube so if you super chat me and pay me money I will love you and I will answer I answer everybody's question but I might go deeper into your question but just make sure it's a good question unfortunately I'm not getting paid to advertise that but I should be um Elias says do you play any video game if so which ones I used to play a lot of video games and love them but again as the title of the stream which has build your own Python freelance character what I realized was my life was like a game and if I built points I could stay with them and they don't like leave you when you end the game and that's when it hit me and I just stopped playing video games and like before I would guilt myself and be like why am I having just a conversation I'm talking about when I was young like twelve thirteen and I'd be like what am I talking with people I could be spending this time in the video game and my character would be leveling off now we're now about to play a video game I'm like why am I gonna level up my character in a video game when I could be leveling up my character in real life me and building those skill points up so now when I closed the game the character is still there and when I sleep and wake up the character is still there and if my hard drive is lost or my playstation is broken or my xbox is broken or my computer is broken or the lights go on out in my house the character is still there and then in life I just had to decide which character I was gonna be building and at some point I was like okay you know Python freelancing from a courier situation I was trying to do IT absolutely hated it and then I'm like okay I'm not gonna be building IT character I hate that freaking character and then I found Python and then in Python I found freelancing and I'm like okay I'm gonna be building a Python freelancing character and boom boom boom let's go and that's when I really stopped playing games laughs hilarious Rose shraddha says Kazi level 23 yes geo says what's your skills besides Python and Django absolutely none I'm useless don't really know anything just get by with luck okay other skills I couldn't see any question so I guess it's time to brag bring out the big guns not really but other skills you kind of have to know as a developer they're not that many but and you can learn them as you go and they're kind of interchangeable and mixed together okay so for example I know multiple skills so when you know Python and you know Django there's some other things that you end up learning along the way without even trying so html/css that's one of those things you end up learning okay maybe you can learn other tools like JavaScript okay and we'll get more into that and maybe later actually in the next livestream I'll talk about api's all right I'll talk about api's I'll talk about HTML and CSS and how it all connects with Python I'm taking these notes so I could talk about this and um got to take them faster actually have a better idea why don't I do things that you guys want instead of coming up with my own things which I'm pretty good at but you guys are better at it because you know what you want more than I do so in the comments for the next livestream why don't you guys tell me what I should cover and what you guys would like to know and if those things were good maybe I'll go over them in the next livestream and just keep looking at the chat whenever you get a chance so we know what things cuz sometimes what happens is we close out and then the last chat goes away and we lose everything oh yeah that's a good one front end back end I forgot yeah that's a good one front end talk about backend frontend backend and full stack Jesus okay I also don't want to overwhelm you guys with too much in one so I'm gonna be trying to give you one tip after another and I'm gonna be trying to go live every single day so don't miss out and before I continue forward again guys all of this and more I've put together the profitable programmer masterclass for you so you can learn all of these things and more get your first client in less than 90 days get that first paycheck with Python so go in the link click it and then sign up for the master class I've put together three amazing powerful lifechanging videos for you guys in there that will guide you through from what the hell is going on what is web development how much can you be earning what's sure Python earning potential all the way through giving you portfolios that you can literally download and steal learning potential calculators that you can steal and use for yourself so you can figure out what you'll be earning as a Python freelancer along with the roadmap that you can follow to become that Python developer slash freelancer slash somebody who wants to do it as a side hustle or work for big companies in less than 90 days okay without needing a degree without needing any experience without needing any technical skills and without your age being you're in high school or you're about to retire okay so go in the links right now in the description and get on my master class the profitable program or master class it's in the description on Facebook and it's in the description click the link on YouTube and do it now okay that's a good one Julian asks how the hell to use github and she says it with two exclamation marks okay so we're gonna be going into that in the next few days so keep out be on the lookout monkey says when can you where can you make websites for people for money monkey I love since I love you so much upwork.com is one place to look at but then there are other problems that arise like how do you land a client on up work how do you come up with the job proposal what kind of jobs you have the skills to do now or what kind of job skills you could be looking to do in the next week or two and how to prepare for them so there are a lot of problems that arise but if you are ready and you want to just look at it and you're interested go to upward calm and just type in Python jobs okay that will tell you what kind of jobs you could be doing but again these are things that I'm gonna be helping you guys go through step by step and that's my goal to help you get that client and know what framework or what system or what roadmap to follow to be able to do that and get past all those problems Patti Pugh says I would like to know how much if any sequel is used in relation to Python when you use flask you have to know quite a bit of sequel but if you use Django there's something called an ORM there is an ORM in flask as well and it's called it stands for an object relational relation mapper okay so an object relation mapper ORM write this down but this won't be important for you till maybe a few weeks into your web development start working with databases okay this was something that I don't know why the hell nobody's explained on the Internet and it took me literally like so long to figure out how to make apps and put them together and make them come to life so for you I'm gonna be saying this and write this down again when you use an ORM you really don't know you don't have to know how to use sequel and you could be using Django and sequel in and as one so python is sequel as one and ORM lets you combine the two without having to know sequel too much sequel but obviously having the knowledge of it would help you Hadj edge amamiya asks your class enough or have to follow other courses my class will give you the roadmap my course that's coming out midnovember will give you the exact howto and all the code and everything that goes along with it and that will be enough for you to go from doing zero Python to having apps and having portfolios having the tools and the skill set you need to land your first client and that course will help you land your first client in less than 90 days okay that's the goal of that course along with I'm gonna be interviewing people from places like uber and Google and people who might even have made codecademy and I'm gonna try to interview the best fulltime Python developers I'm gonna try to interview the best freelance Python developers Python freelancers and I'm gonna try to put it in a vault for you guys so you guys can also get those interviews and those will be massively valuable Cassandra Blackman says will there be any discussion and how to negotiate pay with people who want to hire you absolutely in the PLC videos I will be covering some of that and my course will go in a lot of detail about this my course will be a lot different because of that 85% of your financial success guys comes from your likability or negotiation skills your commune education skills 15% of it comes from technical knowledge I'm not saying technical knowledge is bad what I am saying is if you want to be able to comfortably support yourself get paid what you deserve travel spend time and your family maybe even be able to support your family and be able to do that as fast as possible you have to put you know when you're building a Python freelancer characters skill tree you want to put those skill points in places that get you paid the fastest okay and have you doing practical things and working on projects and working with companies the fastest and those are the skills I want to give you negotiation is a big big big skill and we're gonna be talking about that so you can learn it and you don't have to worry about it anymore throughout the video someone keeps coughing is another CP team getting sick don't worry too hard guys don't worry guys we drink we drink airborne and that helps us stay on sick actually immune and makes us a mute all right should I continue watching live or watch part 2 if you're here sign up right now to the master class and start watching the second video watch the first video and watch the second video they're both very important and they're tied together if you just skip ahead to two you're gonna miss out on what the heck is going on and my friend just put the link in below so go ahead and click that link and join it Elias says I'm a community college student I major in civil engineering but I'd be recently huh I've you recently started to become interested into programming any advice watch and take online courses that might be free so you can just kind of get the idea of it and then if you're interested invest in some courses good quality courses but work on practical skills okay also try to find mentors in real life so places like meetup groups or helpful all right but in the start in the absolute start I want you to spend more time playing and building fun things rather than going through tutorial after tutorial like you have some kind of purpose and burning yourself out so if you're starting out my advice is have fun doesn't matter if it takes you like you know a month or like 15 days to make a simple I don't know age calculator app it doesn't matter what matters is you have fun as you go along you feel like you did it on your own you gain that confidence and you enjoy it you have your full lifetime ahead of you to get better alright and I'll show you guys hacks to get better faster my whole thing is getting fast better faster in months and not years alright and that's what I want to help you do I want to help you become Python developers and freelancers in months and not years zakir says young savage while you trapping so hard well you got a 12 car garage but only got six cars and then I love that song if you guys are here on this live stream right down this is another important note Rockstar I love that song so much and then there's another song that really grew on the entire clever programmer team and whenever it comes on we just go like absolutely nuts it's our new mantra now and it's called honey but PI zero seven zero shake but zero seven zero shake um and I mean I don't know there's something about this song I gotta say it's this song as an investment it's six minutes and thirty seconds long but the more you listen to it it grows on you alright and just go and start listening to it and you you'll know what I'm talking about you'll enjoy it and once it's helpful email us and let us know that it was hopeful so I went 17 minutes above time for you guys because I did not we kept delaying the livestream is supposed to be like 2 p.m. then we had to push it to 5 and then we have to push it to 6 thank you guys for still showing up so that's why I'm you know going above time we're supposed to be just hour exactly but I'm going above let me know is this has this been helpful and valuable to you so far somebody says hey honey 007 that's not it nice patty Pooh says I can answer that found him right after I was laid off bored and watching beauty gurus on YouTube been following him since I have hope now awesome patty Pugh glad to hear that and guys here here's one thing I always say is just as easy to stay exactly where you are and it's just as easy to continue growing simple hacks that I have done to get a lot of results and I'm not saying I'm the best I'm not I'm not even a Python expert I just got I had mentors and I followed kind of the you know the right things quoteunquote that just gave me this giant big shortcuts and regardless of me lacking in school and being one of the worst students seriously like really low GPA terrible scores on my high school AC T's and yeah just and these were the things that helped me and some simple things I'll tell you now is it's just as easy to sit while you're eating food and watch stranger things or I don't know I forget what other shows are there sweet suits I always say house of court suits or office Game of Thrones yes thank you there we go it's just as easy to sit there and watch that as eating food and just watching something on Python and it you don't have to make it feel like it's some kind of thing that you have to do and if you don't do it it's like homework assignment it's like work just think of it like oh cool like sweet I get to learn this and right after I'm done eating food you know what I'm just gonna put together something for my friends it's gonna be hilarious it's gonna be an insult generator and it's gonna be hosted on here Okuda in Roku which lets you put your websites online and you could be like they could just go to it and type in and you know type in whatever or type in their name and it automatically generates an insult or maybe it automatically generates a compliment so they go to your little Python app that you made and they type in you know raffia qazi my name is Rafa kasi and it says Rafa cause you are awesome and then and if somebody else types it in you know clucks your Mostafa types it and he goes most of all it says most of you're great or must have a you rock but if you want to create an insult generator it could be like most of how you suck most of your horrible and it could just be hilarious so have fun and have these ideas that make you have fun with it and then you'll improve at the same time having fun and then you'll improve a lot faster it's like how animals learn they don't sit there like the tiger dad is not going like has a whiteboard and this is how you run this is how you hunt they just let the kids run around and have fun and then figure out how to do all that same way if you kind of learn football soccer or basketball instead of having a teacher sit there on chalkboard teaching you theory for also long just go out and kick the damn soccer ball have some fun with it try to do some tricks and mess up try to shoot shoot it in the hoop and mess up its who cares if your form is off who cares if you suck at dancing practice it improve and then when you watch the video you're like oh I'm connecting the dots it's fun and I could be building things as I go along I could be taking things things from my head and putting them out there into the real world that people could use that people could share and could not only be fun little games for my friends and family and for myself and inside jokes which is awesome but could also be something that could make an impact in the world could also be something that makes me money it could also be something that gets me that job that I've always wanted and could also be something that becomes my way of being able to travel and wake up whenever I want to and work from wherever I want to I just had a talk with one of the students from my older courses Opie courses his name is nazar Molly and he told me that he's a cg generalist freelancer and the reason why he loves freelancing for example is that he doesn't have to do a he doesn't have to do a commute that saves him two hours so one cool thing is he can wake up and boom be at work so he's never late another cool thing is that he's a father and he gets to spend time with his little daughter he gets to see his daughter grow up he doesn't have to miss those moments with his daughter those special moments and that's invaluable I don't know about you but I can't put a price on it and that's what I mean when I talk about a rich life it's not just money but it's other things involved in there and then he went on to make $1200 using Python in four hours so after he took my course he built this thing that he could use to automate these graphics all right and he was telling me that it took the team in Brazil seven days to do this and it took him four hours to do the same thing and he charged the same as that entire Brazilian team charged and he pocketed $1,200 and got it done in four hours so think about that somebody who works as a as a graphic artist or you know somebody who is working on creating animations and graphics and videos gets to use Python to automate it so even whatever you're currently doing you can use it and it could be practical it could help you boost your income even if you love your job it could help you get that promotion maybe you're not ready to just leave your job and jump into Python which I get can be scary I had I read this comment by this girl I forget her name but basically she said I have a job I'm a single mom I have to take care of my son and I have to take care of myself so I can't just leave my job but I want to use Python to earn that side income you could be doing the same thing I get it some of us have a lot of responsibilities and we can't just jump the ship and burn the bridges and storm the boats we have to go one by one so why not integrate Python into your life to become more valuable at your job maybe get a raise if you can't do that maybe do some side projects on the weekends and if you put in ten hours at $50 an hour in one or two days you're bringing in two thousand dollars extra that's twenty four thousand dollars extra per year if you add on another client or you increase your rate all of a sudden you're bringing in three or four thousand dollars extra per month and now you could start to maybe think about changing from your current job and going Python you know all the way alright alright hopefully this was valuable and helpful for you guys we have went well above our time but again I hope that I was able to bring value I was able to be of service to you if you've loved this trust me just take my word for it the master class I've put together for you is gonna absolutely blow your socks off go in the description link click it it's just a class you can sign up for it and I've put together three amazing videos for you that can honestly change your entire life if you're interested in becoming a Python developer Python freelancer or looking to just use this to boost your side income these three videos will take you from literally zero coding skills to giving you the roadmap to becoming that freelancer or Python developer who lands his or her first client in less than 90 days and gets that paycheck so if you're on Facebook the link is in the description if you're on YouTube go ahead Klink click the link on the description and sign up once you do sign up type in my friend's favorite thing one okay I'm gonna wait for you and then after this we're gonna be wrapping this up so sign up and once you've done signing up type in that beautiful number one look at what Sheldon loved it oh man it's just these live streams are so tiring whoo thank you for the donation papa bar nice I think it was me jumping around this guy code you hadn't yet hilarious oh yeah but isn't YouTube gonna shut us down hey let's find some like no man let's not play around with that that stuff is scary because YouTube is scary let's find some royaltyfree music hey if any of you guys are artists or something you know we'll give you a shoutout but give us some cool music like I don't know I like dubstep hiphop is cool some cool beats I don't know trap whatever you got give it to us we'll might play through the live streams or we'll play it in our videos we'll give you credit and everything and I think it'll be cool so email us at support at clever programmer calm and we'll do it no not $12 and one and a half hour but not bad I get to sit here and talk and you know it doesn't seem too hard monkey says I love your live streams but I can't make it that early can you try to make them later in the day I can try to make them later in the day this was actually later in the day it's 5 P 6 p.m. right to started CST Chicago time where are you located monkey so this is a good time ok so we'll try to make it a little bit later in the day but to respect the larger audience we have that's around 11 a.m. or 10 so unfortunately we're gonna have to do 1100 1000 or 1100 a.m. these videos will be recorded and generally I leave my live streams up I don't leave my webinars up and I don't leave my master classes up like for example this master class I've put together for you guys this is a limited time only I'll be taking it down in just a few days but something like live streams that are recorded they're up so you can come back and watch them and you'll get value out of them okay so just go on YouTube and it'll be there yeah if I can go this time we will like maybe there are some days we might go twice but generally we're we would like to go in the morning that's when everybody is up all right so we have some other people who are saying the like this time as well all right awesome guys thank you so much for watching as always I love your faces off and YouTube and Facebook YouTube I'll see you in the next video
