how to be imposter syndrome as a developer the best way in my opinion you ship stuff you build things if you can build something even if it's a very tiny thing click it and it just says your name you click it button changes the color of the website whatever it is however small it is once you ship something and build something real it's going to take away imposter syndrome like this thing is real you can touch it feel it and every time you do something it works more stuff you make the more you will kill your imposter syndrome
