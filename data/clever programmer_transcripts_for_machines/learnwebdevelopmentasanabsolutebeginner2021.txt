what is up guys frankie here with cleverprogrammer.com i'm here with my friend amanath what's up amanda yo what's up guys how's it going so glad to be live with you guys and share some knowledge hell yeah man i love this kid today we're going to be talking about learn web development in 2021 so we're going to discuss the best ways that you can learn web development as an absolute beginner and it's awesome because ominous developer journey is is very recent as well right amanda yep exactly so i started holding april or april nice go ahead yep so i kind of started in april but i was working with python for a while about like one and a half years back but so this is kind of new and i've also like learned a lot about what web development is like like kind of like a fast track way you can go and also a lot of resources that you can use and everything yeah man it's it's amazing so we got a fresh perspective on it and then also just you know the whole company's perspective on it so let's move forward with this web development 2021 you know obviously for you to pick up web development the first thing that you got to do is pretty much just do it you know like my friend shia i don't remember his last name what's his last name uh who's last name this guy she uh um debut for something okay anyways so if you want to learn web development you have to start on it guys and that's the best way you know if you do enjoy our content we're putting out fire content every single day we're going live for you guys teaching you guys the best resources for web development and just the best projects in general that'll help you land a job so if you do enjoy that that specific content that we put out what should they do aminos just go smash that like button guys just smash it hell yeah i love these animations by the way so what's going on here in the chat okay we're sunny sunny is actually working on some react modules for profit with javascript guys and that's going to be awesome and what else do i see here first video nikhil is it first video nikhil what's up man how you doing it's not our first video but maybe you maybe it's your first video from us frank reminds me of guilfoyle from silicon valley damn that's awesome dude that guy is freaking awesome anyways guys uh i stole this slide from sunny speaking about sunny and i think it's really amazing if you guys right now just pay attention to this live stream because if you do at the end of this live stream you're going to get out to the best roadmap that you can get as an absolute beginner to actually learn web development so get your phone out right now put it on do not disturb and turn it on back on when we're done with this presentation hell yeah so this is how we start do you want to explain a little bit about this amanov yeah so when you're starting with development you must have an end goal in mind because that's finally it right so when you're starting with a football match that's what we put this gif right over here why do you start to play football or you're starting with the match your end goal is just have more goals than the opposite team so this in web development or in your career as a web developer it's not you're competing against another person it's kind of like competing with yourself so when you're starting out have an end goal in mind like when i started i had a goal of creating a web application for my dad's education uh institute so it's kind of like still uh under creation so that was my end goal so i was thinking like when i started in april i would be able to create that application by november but the thing is it takes a lot of time and you must be dedicated and always just persevere be relentless just keep going but always have an end goal in mind you know that's a beautiful way to put it man end goals are really your destination so always keep it in mind and a good you know motivation or angle that you can actually look into make it tangible you know sometimes we got end goals that we never actually take into practice something that really does you know show how much practice you've had is and and it's not for i'm kind of generalizing here but obviously you know the amount of money that you can earn on a job really kind of objectifies the way that like your skill it makes your skill objective right so the better programmer you are the more you're going to earn so this is an example that we decided to just pull up out of indeed.com and it shows the actual frontend junior frontend developer salaries in the united states and it's actually higher than this in a lot of different um what's it called states like california is a little bit higher but overall in the country this is you know what you earn going in as a frontend developer a junior one exactly and also uh what when people see that name saying united states they think like okay so since it's in the united states you might not get paid as that much in countries like india or you know in uk or countries in africa like they might think that they might not get the same pay but the thing is with the current trends like with the kobe 19 it's everything is remote work right so literally you can work for a u.s company from staying in india or staying in the africa africa you know like right now i'm in sri lanka and i'm working with clever program which is in the us right so that is possible guys so don't think that when it says it's united states it does not mean kind of like it's only based in the u.s but remote work also pays you the same amount of money you know man and also like when kazi says like it's money you know yeah yeah man i love that perspective that is so true and you know guys it is it is true the world is very global right now in this moment because tech is that advanced but even like amanda said right now you know the whole hovid thing happening everybody's working remotely we actually are going to have a student for one of our personal mentorships um to become a pro uh he wants to become a junior developer and we're going to help him just do that specifically you know he's going to work hand in hand with causing the whole clever programmer team and he is from east africa he's from east africa yeah that's awesome yeah yeah and it's amazing man so this kid was able to pay the mentorship and he's actually working for a firm in new york so it is very true we live in a time right now where you can actually get jobs anywhere and yeah amanath has actually been working with us for for quite a few months now and man this guy was giving so much value that it would be hard for us not to get him as a company as you know as a company and him working with us being part of the team and everything so that's just an example of how perseverance really does help you a lot in life and even dictates even more than where you're coming from so moving forward with this you know if you do want to become a an actual web developer or earn six figures with javascript we have one of the most amazing resources right there right now on the web and it is called profit with javascript and profit with javascript is of course where sunny being the main instructor of the course teach you just you know from the fundamentals to advanced javascript ultimately you know to help you build your portfolio help you build those skills because nobody can take those skills away from you and then land a job which would be pretty much i mean a lot of people's and go please people do not be spending the chat spamming it because i will have to block you let's keep it very clean here because everybody's trying to learn trying to bounce back ideas and get some great insights from this so moving on with this you want to explain this a little bit among us yeah exactly uh so to learn web development there are like you have to learn the foundation with the foundation there are stuff that you must know like the tools or it's kind of like the advance that you have for a developer so number one we have vs code so vs code is where you're going to be doing all the coding stuff so that is vs code and then we have git get is where you like store all your records it's kind of like a time machine and you can call it doctor strange of developers you know when you make a mistake when you make a mistake or you break your code git is there to save you like go back in time and you know that's what git does and then we have firebase which is really really powerful in like it allows you to do hosting it allows you you to have databases many uh no sql databases so it's really powerful and that's what we're using for almost every build that we're doing on youtube and then we have github github is an online code repo hosting repository that is like you upload your code that you're working locally on your computer online so you can collaborate with people from different parts of the world or even different parts of your company so that is github and then we have postman so postman is kind of like a backend kind of like stuff that does uh uses uh what do you say uh it takes api calls and gets the data from the api so that's what postman does so suppose you're working with a weather app with react and you want to extract with the data what you do you use postman and extract all those data from an api so that that's what you use postman for so with all the basics like html css javascript react these are literally the really most important tools that you need to know as a developer definitely guys so don't sleep on them it's one of their one of the most used vs code being one of the most popular ids right now in the world firebase being a heavy heavy hitter right now in no sql databases and just you know nonserver databases um postman is awesome to test out like ah monoth just said uh you know the api calls github now owned by microsoft is a huge git repository in git is the way that you version control the code so moving forward just going a little bit deeper into these specific tools you know one of the big tools that you're gonna have to use is an ide and id pretty much you know these are actual these actually are text editors most of them you know they're not really they're not really ides but the thing is nowadays we don't really need an ide you know we don't really need these huge clunky softwares like netbeans and eclipse and you know even even jet brains the what's it called huh it's called webstone and also pycharm and python too yeah exactly all of those are heavy heavy heavy bs code is so light it's no wonder it's also owned by microsoft so microsoft is not sleeping in the coding industry these guys are buying everything that they can it's actually developed by them so vs code is definitely what we use the most also like when people try to select this is kind of like really crazy because people always kind of find a way to bring kind of like an argument when you're selecting something like even when you're selecting react view angular you always have a fight you say one says react is better you once say angular is better once a view is better and that's kind of the same thing for this like people say no you need to have webstorm or you need to have pycharm it's not the thing guys the thing is you just have to start coding that's the most important thing so the most popular one being the vs code i think we can just all the other ideas or text editors are really great i don't disregard them like sublime text is really great like when you consider vim that's really powerful but the thing is you must settle down to one thing when you are starting at the beginning so when i say when you're beginning your journey as a developer vs code is the best and also there are things like you can add extensions and all this stuff to like power up your experience like you have tab nine that auto fills your coding and then have prettier that prettifies your code there's a lot of stuff that you can do with vs code that's not there in other text editors so if you're starting coding download bs code start coding yeah make it simple for yourself you know don't this is what people do you know they're trying to learn something and then they're like okay i need all of these tools now i have to master all of these tools then i'm going to become good at developing exactly and also like they all over complicate and think like you know i need to have a fancy computer you know i need to have all this fancy lighting i need to have all these fancy softwares to start developing that's not it and you have to check your mind because when you do that for developing then you do that for everything else then you start making excuses for everything exactly seriously yeah like when i began my journey i was like thinking wait i need to have a really powerful computer i need to really have something like this i need to have fancy keyboard and all this stuff but the real thing is you know it's not it's just you're finding yourself an excuse to just not do it you know you're logically kind of giving yourself an explanation or justification of why you cannot start doing you know start coding right now pretty much exactly and the reason i started in april it's kind of i i just really love to share this is like i saw an instagram post that literally said like if you don't come out of this quarantine or this lockdown without a new skill or without a side hustle started oh i've seen those i've seen those memes and just like motivational quotes and everything what they say is if you don't come out with a side hustle or a new skill you didn't lack time you lack discipline you know so that really hit me so hard that made me think okay seriously this is so true that we have a lot of time right now that we are not just finding excuses so that's what really motivated me to just start coding you know that's amazing man something that i see in you is like you are such a hard worker and also you're very focused so you do give a lot of good you know energy to your time and your focus so if you're doing something you're actually doing that and that's what i see a lot with people that just procrastinate a lot they always leave things for later and even if they're doing things right now they're not here now so that's really really bad and it's amazing the to see your growth man and soul mates growth in so little time and i think that can serve as inspiration so going back to the presentation here you know stop making excuses vs code download that start coding right now and also vs code is cool because it has a huge community and i actually forgot to mention this but we did get a donation it's amazing let me actually see if i can zoom into this so it's a little bit blurry so shashank mv thank you so much man really really appreciate it 40 indian rupees whoa let's get it first donation of the day guys thank you so much he says hi how do i become a writer on the cp medium that's awesome man if you guys don't know we are actually dropping amazing articles right now on medium and they begin they're getting thousands and thousands of hits guys and if you're a good reader go check it out for sure yep some people don't like to watch videos some people like to read and what type of articles do we have on medium right now amano so right now we have uploaded the amazon clone we have the spotify clone we have the airbnb club we have we are literally doing the same thing that we do on youtube in written medium so if you are like you cannot uh spend hours and hours on a video and just coding it out what you can do go check out our medium just go medium.com cleverprogrammer and you find all the articles for the clones that we're doing so also we have a lot of motivational articles and like how you should start coding and a lot of stuff so do check that out for sure guys that's awesome let me see if i can write it here for them so it's gonna be oh yeah it's gonna be cleverprogrammer.com so guys this is the link if you guys want to check out the actual articles i'm gonna make it bigger for you guys if you guys want to check out the articles club medium at cleverprogrammer.com is what you should be putting in your url bar and here you're gonna see step by step how we create the builds that we're showing you on the channel also just you know get reading in your life also one thing don't forget to give a clap guys yep you go in and then appreciate it exactly we're giving a lot of value guys it takes time money effort sweat tears and everything so make sure to give a clap i know we lingered a little bit more on the tools of visual studio code and everything but i think it's good you know giving you guys a little bit of context and also we are at 230 likes right now amanath and that's insane that's awesome thank you guys so much if you guys are enjoying this content what should they do amanda just smash that like button and if you haven't subscribed it hopefully you will have subscribed just subscribe and also don't forget to share this video with your friends and family or people who might be thinking to start to learn coding because literally this is the best place you know to be yep yep make errors um find guidance and start to start so if you want to start what language should i learn first this is cool and we actually while we were working on this presentation and we really wanted to make it so that you guys are able to understand and pick up you know what what is the fundamentals what is the foundation of web development in general and what is it so the reason also i just want to say the reason that we're doing this video like there might be people who have already built all these clones and stuff i might be thinking why are we doing a really basic one today the reason is that we saw a lot of people who are coming without a basic knowledge trying to do the react clones and they don't find a lot of good guidance so that is the main reason that we are doing this video so if you have had troubles working on the clones this is the best video that you can watch and learn from this and start applying i'm working i'm putting in all those work okay guys so back to the slides so like if you were yeah sorry no mind took you off but if you want to learn the foundation that's the first step right that's where you start so that you can go into react and build those projects so this is what we want to dive into and the foundations pretty much are going to be html css and javascript now amanoth can you give them an example of how html works and what is all the exactly so html and css are not programming languages guys so they're just markup language and a style sheet not a programming language okay and also i've seen some of my students getting confused because the thing is when they start with html css it just goes really smooth and when they come to javascript and they say oh no i just learned html css it was so easy but when i started javascript it was really hard because yeah the thing is html css is pretty much nothing but javascript is programming language what it's kind of like you trying to talk to a computer and make him understand right so that is javascript and that's why it's harder than html and css yeah html is actually html and css are actually in my opinion very like human they're kind of very human languages to understand javascript is a little bit less it's not as bad as java you know or maybe c plus plus or something like that but it's way better than them exactly so this is an actual example of how html code looks and also the formatting and everything and how it actually looks on the websites so i know there's a bunch of movement going on there's a bunch of arrows pointing everywhere but tell us how this works so you can see the h2 is like the tag that we use in html so these are all tags and within them we type in the text this is uh if you can if you if you guys are really old and have seen really old websites like the old professor kind of website yeah now you're just bragging that you're that yeah that's that's cool yeah that's true it's like early 2000 websites were so simple they used like they kind of looked like this a lot of schools websites look like this that's why you know if you're if you're a student it's good to get your school as a client because normally their websites suck and that's what we've seen a lot right so right here um li pretty much just means list um i believe this is is this no this is just list on order list and this is how it actually manifests here so it shows the bullets i like apples i like apples oranges and then oranges and then if you do want to add an image you put image storage source which is pretty selfexplanatory this is the url of the image and here's the image on the website this is the width it's kind of like just quoted up to me like i like apples oranges are just okay for me but my favorite is pineapple bro is that true maybe you made this bro who knows uh and by the way we got this from a cool youtube video which we were heavily based on you guys should check it out it has the same title but 2020 and it's cool you know it's good to get um inspiration from different places i feel like that video really did explain things very well and so that's where i got this specific screenshot so shout out to them i don't remember who the actual creator is coda coder nice check them out thank you thank you so much for that so what about css so css it's the style sheet so what you do you have you create this button on html and you see it's really lame you don't have a lot of style on anything so what you do you use css you color it give it a border you give it a width you give it a height and you know it says it gives all the look and feel it's kind of like the makeup you know yep for your website so that's css yeah css is cool i remember one of my teachers in college um he spoke about css as being yeah the stylizing of the web but also the color also the shapes what you see visually so a website with html looks like this as you can see there's no color there's no sections there's no separations there's no effects there's nothing that's html css is where it actually becomes colorful and the way to do that is if you want to get a little bit more advanced into css obviously you know the foundations would be like we just explained here these three but going into the middle one css you know foundation i'm sorry um frameworks of that some of them could be you know css grids another one would be css flexbox another one would be actually bootstrap so here's the frameworks some of them are libraries as well but you know the cool thing about them is that for example if you're building a website and you're building just any modern responsive website most websites have very a lot of similarities and designs so you're gonna find whether that's big photos that have you know a slight show or anything like that maybe a video slideshow maybe just you know grids of actual items that they're selling things of the sort all of these things are already created for you right so in development i think if you're just starting out you have to understand that one of the biggest things for you is to become resourceful and looking for these type of libraries like css flexbox grids bootstrap material ui all of these is going to help you one become resourceful two learn how to use different tools and then three use things that people have already done so don't start don't quote from scratch guys that's really really big you want to mention something on this i wanna play yeah so it's kind of like you don't need to have a lot of code to become a better programmer you must be resourceful like i've seen people like you know no i don't need to use all this stuff i need to code all this stuff it just only takes time but it's really it's it can be also annoying like when you find a bug it's going to take a long time for you to do so when you're starting out you don't always need to do everything from scratch always be resourceful like css flexbox is really great also if you want to uh practice on flexbox go to flexboxfroggy.com so flexboxfroggy.com is kind of like an interactive game where you where it's 25 levels you can practice flexbox and also css grids it's kind of a is it like this xbox.com exactly yeah so css great it's kind of like flexbox on steroids like it's kind of like the next level of css screen so it's a bit harder than css flexbox but it's also a really good thing i mean a really good concept to learn and apply in your websites and other than that there are boots uh css frameworks that you can learn like bootstrap material ui bulma material material lies there's a lot the best and the most popular one is bootstrap so if you're starting out i'd say the best uh advice is learn css and then go for bootstrap or other css frameworks of your preference you know yep bootstrap is the best yeah bootstrap is the most famous framework for css in the world not kidding about that so the only fundamental that is left now would be javascript and exactly what is javascript man what is javascript how do you use javascript how do you use it what is it used for so javascript is what creates the functionality of a website like you click this page i mean you click this button and suddenly a popup comes out or it asks for something from you there's a lot everything like all the interaction is because of javascript i think we have that gif right after this slide right bro that's very funny one so this is an example of javascript code but i did want to mention um javascript is is amazing because yeah like uh amano was just saying it's the functionality it's like that it's it's like the 3d dimension of coding of web websites if i can say so because you know html and css are pretty they're just designed they're just text there's their way to stylize and share information javascript it's what is what it's like if that's length and width but oh you can't say it as the nervous system like you can have a body you can have a skeleton you can have a body if you don't have a nervous system your body does not work so javascript is the nervous system of a website whoa that's a beautiful way to put it yep yep it's what connects everything pretty much it moves everything so okay this is an example of a javascript code and it kind of it's funny because everybody was actually they thought about javascript as it not being it was a joke in the beginning i remember it was a joke people didn't take it too seriously and this was like 2010 and stuff and then everything started changing when it became super strong so now it even has a little bit of backend with node.js now you can pretty much do everything with web development and this is a great example of what you can do with these fundamentals that we just taught you so you want to explain a little bit about this yeah like you say students who get bullied at school when they are young are the ones who shine very well at the end right so javascript got bullied and it started shining really well so html gives the skeleton for your website like what you saw it's really name you don't you know you don't see uh beauty in a skeleton right that's how the same when you have pure hdmi oh wow that's a great bro i love all your freaking metaphors they're amazing and by the way don't mean to cut you off but we just crossed the 300 likes on this video guys thank you guys so much so much we're at 309 let's get it to 350 guys that would be amazing but don't mean to cut you off man you were saying skeletons are not that beautiful so html whoops kind of resembles that right yep exactly and then what you do you add a skin you add some makeup and you get css so css is kind of like the skin for your website like it gives colors it gives you a nice appearance it gives all the width and height for the buttons and all those stuff you know it just gives a beauty and then you have javascript it just goes crazy that's what javascript does javascript just dances so you know let's say that you have a button in your website and you want that button to open up a link you want that button to do something specific to hide a column anything like that all of that action that's being taken is going to be actually directed by javascript so javascript right over here to do a dance like that yeah yeah yeah that's why he loves javascript you know that's why nas is the main instructor because he dances just like this meme so javascript is the functionality of websites and all of these things put together are pretty much the foundation of web development you need to learn this first before going into any framework any library just make sure you you learn you understand vanilla javascript you understand these type of basics of html and css and libraries for css that's it guys it's not that complicated so when you say javascript it just pure javascript exactly that's that's why they call it vanilla because javascript like i said it was it was um what's that word it's it was kind of like an underdog in programming languages but as soon as it started getting super powerful then you started to be able to do anything with it the thing is there's so much to do with javascript it gets very confusing so what you want to do is make it simple for you learn the foundations and learning the foundations of javascript is called vanilla javascript which is just you know plain old javascript from there you go to frameworks like react angular view all of these so do you want to explain a little bit about this um yes front end back end full stack so that's what's like kind of like the second level when you start learning the basics and then people ask okay so you have learned the basics what's your aim is a frontend backend or full stack so for now if you're just beginning out just ignore full step for a while okay and focus on front end or either backhand so if you're kind of like a really creative guy you know about colors like frankie you know he loves colors and all this stuff so if you are really creative go with front end and also if you are kind of like logic and you know things like cozy go with backhand that's why he chose python so but now you can choose you don't really need to know python for backend you can learn javascript and learn node.js and use node.js as the backend right and also another thing is i really like to make it as known is even if you're not creative you can build a creative mind like considering myself i was literally the designs that i'm making right now i just cannot believe because the thing is the more you expose yourself to design and all this stuff yeah you start building those skills it's kind of not a talent it's kind of like a skill you know that's true you can build creativity that's awesome man i i would think that you were very creative actually because of i've seen your designs and i myself love design so you know originally originally as i was studying computer science i wanted to become i i knew that i want to do something visual with it first it was a mobile developer so i was like okay dope i'm going to become an android developer because i want to see the things that i create i want to see them on my phone i want to be able to touch them i want to be able to interact with them and i want other people to see it then after that i was like okay like android is kind of dying but not really like still in the world a lot of people use android but i started using apple and i started falling in love with swift and i'm like cool mobile development is oh so awesome but then i kind of started to fall a little bit more in love with design which i wanted to go into ui and ux design i think it's very important as amanoth was saying right now you know front end is more for people that are a little bit more visual don't let you know if you are very analytical and stuff don't let that dis discourage you from from learning it but front end is regularly visual in what you see on the browser backhand also front end is seriously really important as backend because the thing is you can have a really good backend and have all this functionality and finally if it looks like a lame website where you don't know how things interact and all this stuff it's just going to be a waste so future front end back and both are really really important so yep i would even say i mean both are very important yeah i would even say front and is a little bit more important i know i'm gonna get hate for that but i do really think that because for example if you didn't like the way that instagram looks if you didn't like the way that facebook looks you would never use it if you don't like the way youtube works and how efficient it is how it looks you would never use it so run in is sometimes even more important in the back end even though both and also they won't even be watching this exactly yep exactly it wasn't like it is right now so you know going into the front end part of this teaching you know these are some of the most popular frontend frameworks out there right now it's they're huge so you want to mention a few of them so it's wartime it's wartime yeah because people literally fight a lot right yeah view you know they fight a lot so if you're a beginner just ignore the ignore angular and view first for a set for the time being and focus on react because react it's not because we do a lot of videos on react it's because react is really easy and it's also really lightweight because it's not a framework it's a library right so if you are beginning first learn the basics and learn basics of javascript kind of like functions and how all this stuff works and then go with react you know and the best way to learn is building projects so you can build projects like that we have the netflix clone the hulu clone the airbnb if you have all this stuff so you can learn react just by literally watching all these clones you know you have all this stuff so yeah man react is amazing because it's the next step if you did learn vanilla javascript what's cool about this is that damn you get to realize how much tech companies how much influence they have on the coding space obviously so react was made by facebook it's what they currently use uh javascript library framework that they use angular is made by google it's funny because vue was made by uh an angular developer so you know it's both of these are pretty much google and this one is facebook and they're the one of the most um you know famous frameworks for front end and javascript in general and as amanda was saying right now the best way to learn react right now in my opinion in youtube at least is go to our youtube channel and check out all of these amazing projects that we've built so you know what are some of these projects among us so we have starting with the todo list which is the most basic one we have the netflix clone the instagram clone the really really advanced at the most amazing amazon clone we have tinder hulu kobe tracker we have almost i think 20 clones yep yep or even more man i don't know yeah like once you kind of like finished with all these loans you're gonna be the react god or the next papa react yeah guys seriously guys seriously if you guys are not playing and you do want to get an atlanta job as a developer you do want to up your skills as a developer you need to start working on projects and we decided as a team to work on you know let's dissect the biggest websites in the world right now the biggest websites and apps and let's show people how to build them so that they can put it on their portfolio for free and also another reason that we are doing bit the clones is because the designs have actually worked you know because you can come up with an idea from scratch that's huge the design might not work but the design of facebook the design of instagram have worked and that's why people are using it and that's why we made a clone of those so you can learn how you can build designs like that in your own projects you know yep we could have easily said okay let's let's teach them how to create a website with a database that pulls out movies and then maybe even place trailers okay we can do a tutorial like that or we can just build netflix because netflix already put in so much so many millions and millions of dollars into testing their ui testing how their customers interact with the whole website so just model these huge companies that have already tested out these things that's the best way for you to learn the best way for you to integrate you know things that are efficient and effective and not just be so hardheaded and thinking like oh okay this design like a monolith just saying this design i think it's gonna work because i really like blue and i really like squares no bro that's not how the world works you know actually model things that work and also the thing is we students have landed jobs just by doing these clones like frank ramos did the spotify clone and landed a job at sonos which is the biggest u.s audio company and then we have jen who landed a job like twice the amount of salary she has yes she was earning just by betting tracker i think she was earning yeah 46 000 and then she started um earning 96 000 after joining profit with javascript and also building this specific video literally this video got her a 96 thousand dollar job she put this she finished it put her on a portfolio and she got a job after losing her job in covid which is an amazing amazing story so yeah guys don't sleep on it pay attention to this actual content we're putting out it is real world so take it into practice now going a little bit deeper into the other side of web development which would be backend frameworks i know it's a little bit it's a little bit blurry guys so bear with us so you know these are the differences of 2018 and 2019 some of the biggest languages out there so off the bat you can see that one of the biggest frameworks right now sorry i said languages but it's frameworks some of the biggest frameworks right now on um what's it called backend is going to be node.js made by javascript different uh javascript framework benefit is the benefit of learning node.js is because you just only have to learn one language you know like suppose you are front like if you go back about 10 or 15 years back you didn't have node.js and the thing is you have to learn html says as javascript for the front end and then you gotta have to learn something like python or java or dotnet to build the back end but now the benefit is you just have to learn the same language to do the do both you know exactly exactly and node.js a lot of people are liking it right now community big communities being built up it's really popping it's really in you know it's it's it's like the new generation of backend languages or frameworks sorry so angular was pretty big on 2018 then it took a little bit of a dive in 2019 and net went up so pandas which would be every python then react native is another you know javascript framework so all of these are the the famous one django you can see spring is a javascript as a java framework i believe yeah yeah tensorflow it's also ai and python xamarin is a hybrid there's a lot yeah it's a hybrid of um it's it's hybrid development just like react native anyways so these are all examples of back end one of the biggest most popular backend framework right now is what amana the one but this just came up and praveen i actually came up like two minutes ago i forgot to pull it up but praveen uh donated had a donation of 20 indian rupees thank you so much man we really really appreciate that i love you guys love the cp fam i think that deserves a dj airhorn let's go thank you guys so much we love you we are at 277 likes that is amazing guys let's keep the energy up we're about to finish this presentation and you're going to take home some amazing knowledge that amanoth and i am dropping right now we were hitting on the merge stack so burn is one of the most popular backend frameworks like amano was saying and what else so we can say it's not kind of like back in framework it's kind of like this combination of frameworks yeah combination of frameworks that you use to create a full stack application so we have mongodb which is a nosql database we have express js we have react as the frontend framework and then we have node.js as the backend framework a combination of the all of this can help you build a full stack application the thing is while we were building the react clones we built the same clones in one so once you have mastered react you can go do the same clone with one stack and learn all four of these technologies you know so you're going to become dr moon like david says yeah so these are actually all of the videos that amano was talking about right now we got the whatsapp mern clone we got the instagrammer and clone the tindermern clone and the tiktok merlin clone learn how to build these put them in your portfolio they're actually so useful for you to get a job people have already gotten them like we were saying thing about this and mern stack is that if you want to become very knowledgeable and you want to come you want to become a full stack developer this is one of the stacks that most people are using mongodb express react and nodejs as we were mentioning node.js is one of the biggest frameworks for backend right now react is one of the biggest frameworks in front end right now mongodb is one of the most famous and used nosql databases out there and then express what is express i don't know what expresses do you know express it is called the run time and i think yeah it's kind of like the onetime involvement you create to run the application i see it like i know it's kind of like a server kind of thing okay so it's express js nice beautiful so all of these things are super in right now so learn the merge stack these are some of the resources that we provided for you guys maybe take a screenshot of this we think youtube might be one of the best one and it's also free so what's better than free knowledge education that can actually up every single different stage of your life every part of your life you know from your monetary to your knowledge to your relationships learn it from youtube and honestly anything free so what are other learning resources man then we have free code cam so you go to freecodecam.org it's kind of like a modularbased lessons you get modularbased lessons with quizzes exercises that you can work on so just go to freecodecam.org and you can pretty much learn the whole web development i mean learn for development and then we have frontier mentor so frontend mentor is a really great place where you can practice what you've learned so that is what i did like i what i've asked my brother it's kind of like a challenge that i'm doing with my brother is he learns all this stuff and then i ask him sorry oh my my own brother yeah how old is he um he's 15 i guess yeah 15. nice and you do a challenge with him yeah so i just want to inspire him and he is taking challenges from frontal mentor and he's killing it and he's doing all those projects you know like i gave him a challenge to do a slack clone i mean the slack landing page and he just did uh the same exact web page you know wow that's crazy man and at 15 wow like these things are not even taught in school that's the cool thing about it like it's actual practical real world knowledge no excuses guys you have all these free resources and just the thing is you just gotta do it you know the only thing stopping you is just doing it so front end mentor you get challenges like they give you a landing page and what you've got to do is just recreate the same page from code so that's a really way to practice what you've learned then we have w3schools and mdm web docs it's kind of like the documentation for html css and javascript and htmlreference.io and cssreference.io is also kind of like the same and also two resources that i'd like to add to this is one is called reactive flux so i think if you can type it out that would be great a frankie so it's called reactive flux give me one second so yeah let's put it here react t flux t i t i no uh it's just one t sorry t i f l u x so reactive flux is a discharge yeah reactive flux is a discord server where you have around 150 000 react developers and also i got stuck in an error when i was working with react and i just dropped only one message and people started helping me helping me because the most important thing when you're learning to code is having a community like the clever programmer community the best coding community you can find in the world so if you try if you cannot afford like pwj or thing you have a lot of stuff you can learn from you know no no excuses so check out reactive lux and the other website is called react resources dot com and you can literally find resources free resources to learn anything in react so reactive flux and react resources dot com ah a bonus if you have been watching around till now nice those are amazing man and it's great that they have helped you personally i do want to mention that somebody just gave one another donation man it's insane people are going crazy this is insane let me actually make it bigger for you guys um here we go so i think i have to like this to share it oh man i lost it so anyways let me take another screenshot of it really fast because we're really grateful for the people that do take their time to donate man because you know it doesn't matter the amount what matters is really the intent and we're all here to learn if somebody can you know do put more wood into the fire that's that's amazing man and harsha modini says what are your thoughts on flutter one languages three os on floater one languages three os i don't understand the question completely um i think he's asking about flutter so flutter is mainly for web i mean application android application and ios application developer so what you can instead of your flutter you can learn react native so it's kind of gonna become a whole package for you like you know how to create web applications plus mobile applications which is really valuable you know like if you learn proper you can only be developing mobile applications but if you learn react and react native you can do both yep that's a great way to look at it man flutter is the framework for the language start and dart is made by google so flutter is cool because it's it's google's response to facebook response to hybrid development which is pretty much you know making an app that works pretty much everywhere uh android and then also ios and then also web development pretty much so and also another advice is like the thing is most people is kind of like they say what what if i do flutter what if i do react what if i do this what if i do it's not the thing you just do it if you think okay i need to do flutter just dive in try one one or two months into it and see if it's gonna work for you if it does not it's just not a waste of time you just learned a lesson you know exactly exactly just just test it out test it out that's it that's today's model pretty much just test things out don't take anything for granted um don't give too many too much spice space or time two things and you know we were speaking about a lot of resources right now we think one of the best resources in the world as a developer would be definitely google yep yeah man it's funny that's how you learn everything you know that's how you answer all of your questions as developers and a little bit ago i was just mentioning that you have to be resourceful and big big big portion of the development jobs have to do with researching and pretty much googling things man because most people have already stumbled upon you know the bugs that you have stumbled upon your code so there's a lot of forums like stack overflow there's a bunch of you know different resources in the web right now that can actually help you out with your problems so this is a funny meme that we found and it says when you start working as a programmer how to get date in c plus right and then 10 years of experience later you're still in google and literally googling the same thing the thing is if you can't remember thing it's not it's not the motive of programming you know the motive of programming is just creating solutions to problem it does not mean like you need to remember how to create a dictionary python or how to create a function in python it's not the motive the motive of programming is to create solutions to problems so if you can't remember that's completely okay it's completely fine you know you have google as a savior yep you don't have to code things from scratch guys most of the advanced developers that i know always are googling stuff and even code faster than people that are coding from scratch it just doesn't make sense so people and this meme right here says not sure if i'm a good developer i'm good at googling it's pretty much the same thing man it's pretty much the same thing now at this point and i'll take off that image so you guys can see it but moving forward you know one of the big things about resources is that you know resources help you learn but ultimately what's going to help you learn the most is choosing a project to work with just like omanath was just saying some of the projects that we've built for you guys are already on our youtube channel they're free for you to see you can put them on your portfolio maybe even land a job like most of you know a lot of our students have and this is one example of the websites that we build you want to add something to this so this is the netflix club right so choose a project just work on it you know and also a threestep strategy that i use is when you're working first time on a project i mean like when you're watching a tutorial and doing it just watch the tutorial and just code the thing up and make it working you know so that's one accomplishment and the second time what you do is you don't watch the video you start on your own like you got the idea of how the project is done right so what you do you start coding on your own and when you get stuck you refer the video or the tutorial of the article that you did and the third time what you do you don't literally don't have access to the tutorial or the article or anything just start coding it up and when you find yourself stuck what you do just google it like how can i create the date picker or how do i create this component or how do i style this component just google it and try to build it on your own that way it's going to concrete the knowledge in you you know like you it's kind of like you go from beginner level to an advanced level one project like to learn because the reason why people are stuck in tutorial hello anything just they just copy paste code or kind of like just see okay so he's having use effect over there i'm just typing it there so you don't literally understand why you use use effect over there why do you use the remove event listener why do you use the this device use that div and all this stuff you know yeah man i completely completely agree it's a difference between taking in information and making your information practical that's it it's like you can get information for the rest of your life but if you never practice it then the map is not the same as the territory like people say you know a map is just uh it's just a symbol or representation of the territory that it's mapping out right so it's not the same thing and put it into practice guys don't lose your time this is another example of one of the builds that we made one of the most one of the famous videos that we released actually one of the most popin ones and it's the amazon project in this amazon project we did it two ways we did it with react and firebase and we also did it in the mern stack with which uses mongodb if you guys want to learn how to build that this is amazing it's a full ecommerce functionality website and we show you step by step not only do we show you step by step but we even make it cool we make it fun for you guys it's not like we're gonna sit down and just program right exactly man it we make it fun you know it's that's the thing and that's the whole point of clever programmer really programming can be fun it doesn't always have to be depressive boring and stale so programming is fun so yeah man i want to describe this a little bit because amano actually does a bunch most of the posts and use of two that we release on instagram our instagram has been growing like crazy if you do enjoy this content make sure to follow clever quasi so that you can follow the clever programmer instagram so you want to go a little bit deep into this honor yeah so tutorial or tutorial purgatory which is really common with wannabe developers you know who just dive into coding the reason why you are in tutorial health so before what why you are here what is it it's kind of like you feeling yourself that you are not making progress and you're kind of stuck inside a loop of watching tutorials again and again and again so how can i escape tutorial help right so uh frank you can't just go to the next slide bro cool i was just seeing that people are saying that there's an echo can you guys hear an echo drop it in the comments if you hear an echo i don't hear one but okay cool so what is tutorial hell so you follow along the tutorial and understand everything they do and you do create what they do by coding along but you cannot create things on your own oracle and rely on tutorials for everything yep that's what you were just mentioning exactly so the reasons you're stuck is you find it easy to just keep following tutorials because when you try to code things up on your own you find it really hard because it's just the beginning guys you know you cannot become the greatest developer in just two months that's not how it works just gotta put in the work you gotta put in the motions you gotta put in the dedication and all the all this stuff to become a great developer so the reason is you find it easy to just follow all the tutorials and the second thing when you follow tutorials and you build projects just watching the tutorials it gives you a sense that you're making progress and the second thing is why you don't want to come out of tutorials is because you feel yourself as insecure when you come out of a tutorial you know yeah i think very bad sound quality let me say very bad sound quality is that better guys tell us if that's better i think they said that there was an echo but you know tutorial hell is actually um give me one sec so somebody says yes no change cool so tutorial hell is actually interesting because a lot of people find themselves there it's actually kind of like one of the stages of growth to be honest with you and people find it easy so that you know you follow the tutorial copy paste the code and they think that they're getting they think that they're actually getting um what's it called advanced progress exactly progress and they're not directly and also another thing is i like to say is tutorial hell is kind of like the word depression you know like when people bit sad they say oh no i got depression and like when new wannabe developers just get into coding they say you know what i got stuck in tutorial hell it's kind of like a what do you say a fashion you know to say or kind of like a trend yeah you know you say oh man you know i'm stuck in tutorial hell you know yeah yeah it's kind of like looks cool when you're saying those stuff you know exactly yeah now people started rocking it like they own it so that's it's good and it's bad at the same time so you know starting off with code at the end of the day practicing code is what's going to make you a better developer not anything else so people do ask this question a lot and the question is how long should i code every day and amano has made a really cool diagram for you guys that i think can be very practical if you take it into practice and this will greatly massively improve your coding so this is the 30minute rule you want to explain a little bit about that man yep so the thing is there are people who might be going for work and doing jobs and all this stuff and they might not find enough time to do coding so if you are really into it the best way to start is doing 30 minutes every day you know if you don't have literally no time just start doing by 30 minutes every day and those 30 minutes will add up to how many hours per week or three and a half hours so it's half hours per week you know one two three four five six seven okay so when you add all these up it comes up to 168 hours of coding per year you know it's kind of like the amount of the hours of coding that uh a cs graduate does right yep frankie yeah yeah yeah um i don't know exactly how many hours a cs graduate um does code honestly i would say it's it's a little bit more than this i would say more than 168. in my years of um of college i'd say a little bit more than 168 honestly but dude if you quote for 168 hours a year like you're just gonna be a beast you're gonna be a beast and it's not it's not even about guys really do take this into account i'm going to be very serious with you i know we were having a lot of fun but this is serious if you are going to put in 30 minutes a day like we're saying it's not about putting in 30 minutes a day it's the quality of the practice that you do you can literally spend 30 minutes doing doing nothing learning from the worst resources ever and you're not going to get anywhere it's not about putting in the 30 minutes it's about the quality that you put in those 30 minutes practice perfect practice makes perfect what is it perfect practice makes perfect it's not just practice okay so make sure to to get the good resources and put in the time also and also like you finding an excuse to say you don't have 13 minutes it's just you know like you can go on instagram and just go on instagram for 30 minutes you know you don't feel that time but if you can just put those 30 minutes into coding without you knowingly you're going to code for 168 hours in just a year you know and you're going to become a beast yeah man you spend freaking 30 minutes a day just coat just literally scrolling through instagram literally like not doing anything anything like that bro like just allocate your time a little bit better and be responsible that's it so that was how to code how much you should code every day check out the instagram if you to go if you guys want to see more diagrams like that amanov and yusuf are dropping really far once every single day to so check them out so amanda's was showing me this specific website and i think it's really amazing man we were talking about different roadmaps or careers that you can take with um with just you know web development in general so this is the website and let's actually go to it yeah for sure bro cool so it's what is it called man it's called roadmap.sh make it bigger for you guys so you guys can see let's see does that look good okay i think that's great awesome yeah perfect so yep it's uh roadmap.sh we'll try to put these links in the description below guys and this is kind of how it looks so it's a different developer roadmap so off the bat here you can check out and you can see that there's front end there's back end there's devops there's react there's android postgres a little bit more back end devops yeah also if you can just go to the front and we can show people how you know what the format is yep and that's the cool thing about this website is if you want to learn a little bit more about front end it's going to tell you the road map to it like right here so from the developer then the internet how the internet works how the websites work how everything is connected together and yeah man it's it's it's it gets very complex if you do insane if you do follow it man it's it's really going to help you understand you know how everything is connected what part of the journey each thing is in like here you can see bootstrap you know the css libraries that we were just mentioning or frameworks and you know how progressive web apps are connected to whether that's actually the map only just looks so complicated but the thing is via actually when you're using react it's already progressive with maps you know and also it's just simple stuff that you just over complicate the map just shows you the road map but it's not as complicated as it looks you know yeah take it step by step you know learn to digest it put a little bit of time into it just go through it so that it makes sense so that's the front end roadmap this is the back end roadmap and it starts off the same you know showing the internet what is http all these you know secure type of um verifications the domains dns how all of that is connected no sql databases also i think when they say about like you know always and general knowledge i think seriously it's kind of like more technical stuff but if you're just starting out i don't think like you nee you need to have a basic knowledge of how internet works and all this stuff but i don't think like you need to go really deep into all those stuff you know yep i agree man don't go so deep into you know learning how a computer works like how all of these things work most computer science students they make them go through that route i think it's beautiful to learn those things but if you really want to get you know the skills you really want to get the career you really want to get the money and the actual knowledge guys make it practical actually drop the complex complexity like if you make it simple it's going to be easier for you to start it's going to be easy for you to actually put you know things into practice guys so let's go a little bit into android these are all the different road maps guys you know check them out i don't think you should delve so deep into them but there's so many different ways that you can tackle this whoops so i'm going back to it again but going back to the presentation so these are the career paths and honestly guys there's so much to do we do want to wrap up because we've been talking about for about an hour we're gonna you know save you guys his time anything that you want to mention at this point among us so yeah my drop yeah like obama yep oh you cannot drop that mic yeah boom let's try this let's go i'm kidding but yeah so yeah that guy's guys go ahead man take action start coding and also hit me up at um wait is it where like this yep it's right there come on and just wait can i touch it yeah you're go a little bit down right there right there right there oh yeah oh yes quickly so hit me up at amanda.dev and yeah if you have any questions just feel free to reach out to me on instagram yeah i'll be glad to help you guys so yeah guys hit us up on instagram amano has amazing knowledge he's killing it for our instagram and he's also bringing so much knowledge to the whole community we want to wrap this up guys thank you guys so much this is pretty much going to be you know the road map that you should take if you are uh an absolute beginner in web development you want to get an idea what to do hopefully you had fun hopefully you get you got good resources off of this hopefully you also got a good mindset off of this that i know amanov has and i have been working on it as well it's a big part of being a developer it's not all just technicalities it's also psychology so don't forget to take that into account now before we do leave i want to say that if you are serious about becoming a sixfigure javascript developer we do have the training for you and this training cause you put a lot of hard work and love into it so if you're serious guys please please please go into the description below because i really care about you guys future if you guys are serious about it you know if you're not serious nobody's going to be serious for you so these top three mistakes that you should avoid when becoming a javascript developer training i think is amazing man it's going to give you a lot of context onto what to do next how to earn money from it how to become a six figure developer so go ahead and click the link in the description below to check that out and in that training you're going to see how to join profit with javascript as well because profitable javascript might be one of the best resources or actual i was i wasn't showing the screen i thought it was but profit javascript is one of the best resources out there so that you can pick up javascript and make money from it so we're not all about the theory we're actually all about the practicality so practicality is what's going to make you money what's going to build your skill and here's the top three messages at the end right exactly man so if you do stick around the training you'll see a deal at the end and that deal is not shown anywhere else but yep that's pretty much it guys and like always if you do enjoy our content what should they do on onenote for actually the third time smash it hell yeah just smash that like button until it turns blue like ram stefan says and check the guy out he's amazing um anyways nothing related until your hand turns blue kidding but thank you guys so much for being here we ended up at 434 likes whoo that's amazing man that's amazing almost 500 likes i wanna how do you feel bro yeah thank you so much guys so much love means a lot so much love from the community guys thank you so much let's let's actually take practice into account guys let's leave here
