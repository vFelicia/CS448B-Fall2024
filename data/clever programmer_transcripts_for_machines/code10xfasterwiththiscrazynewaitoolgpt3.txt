check this out what's up erin what are we talking about today yeah so we're talking about this new ai tool from open um ai so here's a demo of it real quick i found a video just it's just easier to show you guys but check it out this guy types in uh he just describes an app to this thing called dbuild.co and it literally just spits stuff out so check it out he's like he says an input that says enter a to do and a button that says save to do and then show me a list of all my to do so very simple to do app i'm sure most of you guys have coded this before but he just types that in and then it's uh it's generating and then right there you have the app generated on the side interspersed there so the input you hit the button there and then look there's all the react code it's react code straight up react code what like um what just generated there blew my mind too i mean like yeah there's like code completion and stuff but this is a fullon app and look there's even another one here where uh look it says designer it says uh create an app here design so an app that has a navigation bar with a camera icon photos title and a message icon a feed of photos with each photo having a user icon a photo a heart icon and uh something else and then it literally just generates this no it's the ground yeah yeah that is mindblowing i mean this is like a month and a half old but it blew my it blew my mind it blew my mind wow guys what do you think about that drop them in the comments what are your thoughts on this this is freaking insane can you show it one more time for everybody to go on here time yeah show one more time uh all right let's go back let's go back where is it boom i can't do i mean it's the same thing there's a bunch of other examples but let's just show these same ones first real quick so yeah so this you just type in you type in what you wanted to code and then the ai will literally figure out how to code it for you like it'll it'll like parse your what you said to it it'll understand it and then it'll actually code up the code with correct syntax and it's functioning there in about two seconds no man come on this is i mean the first thing that came from guys we are taking our jobs they are taking our jobs is what they're doing no it's not cool yeah yeah pretty much but i mean also that but also it's like i feel like like this is gonna like drastically change like how we how we code because if you can get something up and running like the like 80 of it with you know like a sentence and then you just hit enter and then two seconds later it's pretty much done you have the whole framework of your idea implemented then it's just a matter of going and debugging and doing all this stuff that isn't quite smart enough to do wow wow everybody it's so funny it's so funny everybody's like rest so landers like rest in peace my job uh yeah jokes i know you guys breaking news that was the first slide here look i got a presentation bro so don't freaking spoil it i was like breaking news ai has just taken all our developer jobs bro we freaking played ourselves we just gave up our own jobs to ai like wow god damn elon daniel freaking taking our jobs man not cool everybody's like resting peace coders like trying with china exchanges like in the house like rest in peace coders yeah dude you know how sunny is doing all those live streams with the react in firebase so quickly yeah i figured it out he's just freaking using gpt3 he's not quoting himself he's posing on the stream so this is the big reveal this is the big reveal of all the streams for the past clip guys what do you think about this guys let me know let us know in the comments but like i just wanted to say guys welcome to the stream this is this is some we're talking about some crazy stuff about ai today which you probably haven't heard about now the cool hangout session talking about some cool crap exactly yeah okay we're gonna learn a lot we're definitely gonna learn other things now before we go ahead and start out one thing i want you to do really quickly here okay really quick very important okay here's what i want you to do we gotta you gotta you gotta help us out on this okay we're providing a lot of value to you we are you know we're taking our time to do this we're taking our time to do a lot of research to build all these epic clones for you and what we would like to ask is you got you guys go ahead and help us out with liking this video like this video right now just click the like button right there below click that like button exactly tell youtube that you like coding videos you'll be shown more coding videos exactly hit that like button so like the video below go ahead and share this guys subscribe to the channel very important fifty percent of you guys who are actually watching these videos are not subscribed like what like what that is insane 50 of you right so make sure you subscribe this channel very important gaming i wanna i wanna i want to make sure you guys very important guys go ahead subscribe like this video let's get this video to 500 likes we're currently at 239 guys let's go let's pick it up okay let's pick it up guys so and one thing i want to share we also got an instagram panel so go ahead and tag us on your instagram post we got my instagram right here nas we got aaron who's right there just right there well you take us so long can we just get started like yeah i know i know but just you know i just all right let's get to it let's get to you guys ready let's get to it we'll get to it let's go yeah yeah oh did you mention the free webinar training yeah see you you cut me off that's awesome i was about to do that yeah yeah guys free webinar training in the description if you want to learn how to uh do javascript stuff and learn how to code react from scratch instead of using gpt3 you know yeah yeah but um yeah yeah free training check it out link in description if you're if you're interested in becoming a javascript developer some really cool stuff going on so link in the description check it out okay all right let's get this bar deep started some dang you don't perform well under pressure do you what i'm telling nothing what are you trying to say man what are you trying to say huh what are you trying to say i'm good i feel great yeah yeah we know nice yeah your confidence is unshakable yeah grounded in all solidity guys guys all right guys anyways guys let's tell this guy something guys tell this guy this this guy this guy needs to be i don't know tell this guy something anyways yeah so yeah this thing gpt3 um he's gonna take he's gonna be taking all of our jobs pretty much oh it's gonna be doing this it's it's uh open ai's new ai called gpt3 so open ai uh if you guys haven't heard of it open ai is actually a open source ai company and their purpose is kind of to responsibly develop ais so that we don't have an ultron or terminator incident um because once it's a certain point once the ai gets smart enough to like learn faster than humans and blood with them we're kind of screwed apparently it's called the singularity i don't know if it's true or not nobody does until it happens but that's kind of open ai it was founded by elon musk and sam alton sam something i think his name is um but he was cofounded with elon in 2015 i think and they've been working on it since uh if you guys have heard about the um the ai that actually because there was already ai's that be like the world chess championship and stuff like that uh but opening i was were the guys who actually coded up a bot that beat uh video gamers so like the professional worldclass video gamers in um dota i've never played dota but it's kind of like league of legends uh basically coded in ai for these people and it basically just shot on the world championships no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait so let's just call it it coded up in a ai game yeah it's a bot no no no so it's like it's a bot that plays the game and then when the when the players were playing against the bots they were free because it's like you can they're like i can tell it's not you it's too perfect they can tell it's not human it's too smart it learns faster it counters everything before they even do it so guys we're on the verge of the zombie apocalypse out here the apocalypse coming soon it's a couple years ago i know yeah zombie nah bro the robot apocalypse what are you talking about zombie apocalypse already here that's the corona it's the irobot you know we'll smith anyways dude we're taking too long but yeah so if you open it i did that a couple years ago but now now they're doing some big boy stuff where they're doing some like actually real stuff instead of just video games like games are cool and they're fun but i mean when you're talking about like real ai doing stuff in the real world like coding or other crazy stuff then that's when it starts getting really interesting and the applications get um insane instead of just like within this one game yeah so um so let's go on so what is gpt3 because i mean it just looks like um it's like some it looks like a car model or something you know like oh the nissan gpc3 oh my goodness but so what it actually stands for is um uh general pretrained transformer three which makes no sense to explain a little bit later but that's just what it is in general yeah or generic pretrained transformer three something like that yeah that's not like a movie oh god uh but pretty much it's an ai that can write code as you guys saw so like like straight up like it can anything you tell it you can tell it anything you want and it'll figure out what you mean and then it'll just spit out the html the css um the everything that you need the functionality the buttons all the math behind it all the logic but no syntax errors like it just figures it out like no matter like any arbitrary thing you tell it you can be like yo uh code an app that like like uh gives me pictures of watermelons and random stuff blah blah blah and it'll just do it like like look here so here here's a little you put up an app can you can you code up an app that will that will make me thousands of dollars and uh in terms of stocks um i mean i don't think it's that smart yet if it was that would be i mean if it was that smart honestly the ai would be richer than everybody in a few days you know because if it could do that but but look here so this guy uh this is a similar thing so the guy just types in he wants a button that looks like a watermelon and then he clicks you generate and it literally just spits out the it fits out the html code right there the correct tag it's the html button tag and then it even knows what a watermelon looks like and it has like the color like it understands what a watermelon looks like just by saying that and then it'll like actually make a green circle with a pink interior with in the word watermelon on it and it's a button like it doesn't do anything because it's like a like a really simple example but like it's just a completely random thing like you just type in a he could even type orange and it would do the same thing would be an orange circle or apple it'd be a red circle um unfortunately i can't access the code i'll explain guys later why you can't ask the code right now i'm kind of limited to just showing you guys uh this this content i found online but look here's another one so he says uh give me some large text that says welcome to my newsletter and a blue button that says subscribe and it just no way it's pretty fast i mean it flashes pretty quickly but look it says uh boom welcome to my newsletter and the subscribe button it says subscribe man no i don't like this anything i don't like i like it guys i wanna i wanna hear about this guys let us know in the comments do you like this or not like i'm very curious to actually see this like let me know so in the comments put down the thumbs up if you liked it give me a thumbs up down if you don't like it how can you like it dude like it's awesome like it's innovation like stuff is going forward i mean some of us might lose our jobs you know i don't know man i'm still questionable on this stuff i'm still questionable man yeah not a conservative married what well we got people like aaron out here trying to take our jobs you know trying to like oh you know let's just all take over our jobs and stuff like that you know i take souls not jobs bro i'm working he's next hey but anyways um yeah so those are there and then of course i already showed you i already showed you guys this one with the uh the instagram clone by just typing in this thing it just spits out an instagram clone um on mobile so like it must be doing uh something i don't know exactly though i couldn't get the code for this it was just what i found online right and then um yeah the the to do the todo list app again but yo it's it's pretty crazy man pretty crazy we got frank we got frank was saying like hold on what honestly i love jackie chan jackie chan oh my auntie jackie mindblown auntie new jackie channels did you know that what my empty new jackie chan your aunt your friends your aunt you dickie chan yeah my uh my my uh family's from hong kong bro oh wait really oh wow no way i mean they were super tight like they were kind of like acquaintances or something like that my mom told me when i was younger and i was like mine that's like a mind blow within a mind blow wow guys oh man isn't it aaron is so cool he's trying to say that he's someone related to jackie chan but really he's not you guys know that he's trying to be a little cool out here you know i just worked on your stuff but yo yeah so i found this but i found some other stuff too like guys i found this um uh this twitter page of this guy who got access to the code because the code is locked because elon musk uh and people guys are opening i don't want just anybody using it because it can be kind of dangerous so you have to like request access like um if you go to open a website like they say you can download api but you have to actually have to like join a waitlist here and um so you can actually download the code oh no it's an api so like you actually have to run this on like a super computer like on a cluster somewhere because it's huge i'm going to go into some of the details about how it works later right um but just like show you i'm just showcasing it now but like everything that we know about it and we found but yeah you have to join the api waitlist and then if you get access then you can actually um access their api and use it um which is what those those those code generators were doing it was just using the api and then actually running on on their cluster on their super computer um but i mean it's very limited access like not everybody gets it so i didn't i applied but i didn't they didn't get back to me and uh a few people only a few people did a few a few companies did you know but uh so like yeah it's funny you know it's funny we got some um elec is like like he's like uh write a program that can help cut it to remind exact time of starting the the stream yeah guys guys that program will that program will never will never be perfect yeah there's going to be always new bugs you know you will never know yeah i mean yeah yeah streams are just whatever they are but yeah anyways so this guy this guy sheriff shumim i found him on twitter um he actually i don't know how he got access but oh he's the ceo at d build.co okay okay he's the actual guy who uh he's the actual guy who developed this thing which is using the api oh that's cool okay yes oh um awesome so yeah let's just go down and look at some of the things he built so like i just want to show you guys that this isn't a spoofs so check this out check this out okay so let's see what this one is there's like there's like 20 of them let's go through all them so boom describe your app a header that says mood tracker okay and a button that says happy sad and sleepy okay when i press a button show text that's set right let me go fast okay this is taking forever where x is my movement how about you because you can you can do you can do 2x 2x speed on this is a twitter gif or something oh okay okay then you might not be able to do that you can just hand here let me see it's taking forever so look boom mood track happy sad sad sleepy right now i am feeling sleepy and it just like spits out the code look the react code right below what look he just can add on where x is an emoji for my mood oh my god i'm feeling and then he changed so he's using x but he's gonna plug in an emoji in place of x here okay no right now i'm feeling sad look at that bro no he literally just types literally just types um that that piece of that piece of text in hits generate and then it generates the code exactly like it understands you this api when you click on it does actually perform the function when you click on it yes that's running this code they're there like it's it's running like bro like that's what i'm saying like wow the ai understand what you're saying no matter the english you use like it understands english so well like this is like a this makes siri and alexa look like freaking babies you know like little toys like child's toys and this is like a this is like a real like a real language processor this is actually called the natural language processor ai so that's actually what is under the hood it can it can deal with any kind of text so it understands english and can pump out code because all of it is just english even the code is in english yeah considered english even though it's code but it's just text so it can understand how to write any arbitrary text even emojis as you saw like it can understand how to write anything just by through machine learning so strategically thinking i'm just kind of curious here out here so strategically thinking like possibly positively thinking yeah let me know let us know guys what do you think like what would you because obviously this still can't replace this still can replace a fullon like us right we're pretty smart no like no we're pretty smart like lucky or not like we're pretty smart people we're most people you know aaron can be questionable but i'm kidding i'm kidding bro so so so we're pretty smart people right so you know this is not not able to replace us but but i think it does frank i think mentioned actually on here he mentioned that it can help us out in terms of like it can help us out in terms of making boilerplate stuff so like boiling exactly you know what i mean yeah so like do all the dirty work for you it's like the long grueling dirty work like do you even like not even dirty but the way i see it guys let us know what you guys think like uh let us know like what would you like what would you use this for right if you think of this on a positive more side okay instead of the negative side i would use it for actually thinking personally here's how i use it for because this can be pretty easy i would use it actually for unit testing oh yeah how would you do that easy create a unit test for a function for a class for let's say for a class car right okay to test to test a button click on something something where you know when you click the button it should display the text you know hello world i don't know wait what do you mean by like unit testing like unit testing to me is like when you're coding an app you want to whenever you add a new line of code you want to run it to make sure it doesn't break no no no no no no what i'm saying yeah well it's a function basically you know test is a is a task separate from your code it's a code that tests other people's code oh yeah so you mean like actual like unit test snippets yeah like actually actually it would actually code up unit testing because this can code up react it can probably in that just code up anything python right javascript that's the real that's the real unit testing where you have to like do everything properly and nonsloppy you know it's not for me yeah yeah no but seriously i i honestly think guys what do you think give me give us a thumbs up you know if you think this might actually be very useful because i know i know i don't like to write unit tests nobody likes to write unit tests but we gotta do it sometimes yeah yeah you could like pump it you could like give it your entire app and then you could just be like test if this function works and it would write the unit test for that thing test if this works test if that works that's interesting bro yeah really cool and then we got you know citation of it because you use it juno says use it to teach code to others yeah that's true that's good too yeah that's actually that's that's really smart bro i mean we don't have access but like as soon as it has public we have public access to it then yeah that's that's a really cool application and frank is like if frank was like if it helps with bulletpeco we can add more value with the business logic and ui exactly there you go yeah like do the human level stuff that the ai can't quite do yet we can take care of all that yeah but yeah let's just go through a couple more of these bro because this is mindblowing like i haven't even seen all of these i just like skimmed through a few of them but here here's this one um what does he type he says uh a button that says roll dice and then displays its value okay so a button there we go roll dice wow and it just and it knows to it knows it understands to call math.random what so look look look so he types in he types in he types in a button that rolls the dice and displays its value so how does it know that roll dice needs random like you see what i mean like it associated roll dice with random no and then called the random function like it makes these connections through machine learning narendra thanks so much for the donation uh yes donation it says you guys are awesome ocean of knowledge of course i appreciate your donation very very much narendra thanks narendra appreciate it and you get yourself a really cool sound effect yeah there you go yeah awesome super chat yeah the super chat yeah okay let's keep going so here the roll dice i think he adds something to it he says so he rolled dice display a value as dice and then one two zero to a hundred so a hundred sided die okay a header that says a button welcome to gpt dungeon and dragons dnd then a button that says uh it takes a little bit because you're accessing the api and it's running it's computing doing whatever crunching so welcome to gpt dnd damn man wow insane stuff guys that is a single mind not a single bug in the code now explain why there's not a single bug later i mean why we think there's not i mean we technically don't know how it works like only they know how it works exactly but we kind of have like speculations if we can kind of like interpolate exactly what's happening but let's just keep going for a little bit more okay next one let's just like blow people's minds in my mind too so an input that says go ahead enter okay where do you saw this one this is the todo list one okay uh next let's go to here an input that says uh that says enter to do we just okay this is duplicate post is like can we create an ai with an ai um yeah so what we're going to do is we're going to add gpt 3 to code gpt 4 and then no way what it's like gpt3 can you code up gpt for that no way i mean that wouldn't it doesn't look like that there's limitations we'll go over later too okay of this like there are a lot of limitations like actually like inherently in it um and i'll explain like that stuff like i actually go into like some of the ai theory later but i just still i'm just like fan going over this look at this what is this okay so a button that says add three dollars a button that says withdraw five dollars and show me my balance so it's doing some math i add three buttons in the button and withdraw five dollars and show wait why is it says at three dollars but it's withdrawing five dollars it's like it's like a little banking app so he says if you look here okay if you look here it says is there a way i can annotate oh yeah there we go so if you look right here it says a button that says add three dollars and a button that says withdraw five then show me the balance so it's just like a little um like a little uh banking app so there you go it says uh add three dollars and withdraw five so those are two buttons but what the cool thing here is it understood that withdrawal needs the minus operation in math like it made that connection you know it's like like it knows all this [ __ ] like i mean like what like oh this is some black black black black blocks magic out here like black look then he adds more to it what does he add here i didn't see this part and a button that says give me all my money and show me my balance give me all my money yo give oh give away all my money just like resets it so it understood give away all my money okay so it it said okay give away all my money means make the balance zero like okay like it understands this [ __ ] why would you want to give away all your money i mean i don't bro like come on man stop being so practical it's just it's it's blowing my mind like don't you think i'm trying to be practical out here oh my god okay what else is here what else the button that says we just saw this [ __ ] dude come on uh here another one so the google oh this is the one the first one i saw this is when i heard about it uh it says describe a layout the google logo a search box and two light grey buttons okay that say search google and i'm feeling lucky so the google home page okay eight accessing api accessing ap oh wait what oh no i paused the video accessing api and boom no it created a google clone created a google chrome react html not even react html google clone and two seconds what's up sonny what's up job is gonna get replaced soon he's the clone maker like oh my god like isn't that mindblowing i mean there's more look there's even more but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go through all them like i'll just let you guys go yourself um i'll link this in the description um obviously i just look up this guy sharif shamim on twitter just find his twitter good to go but let's get back to the presentation because i want to kind of have it that's what it can do this ai can literally code whatever you tell it like you literally just talk to it like a human and then it understands what you're saying only works in english right now i believe um and then and it does what it says yeah like what you say like again my uncle jackie chan uncle i'm cool crazy yeah you wish yo you're being racist you wish she was your uncle jackie chan this right now i'm not being racist no i'm just saying i'm just saying the truth out here man all right god i got it okay well so so um actually um it's not even just for code this thing can actually do anything text based so it's not even like it can actually write poems it can talk to itself it can do everything siri and alexa um text space i mean it'd be very simple yo my man silence your phone sorry um but it can it can literally as long as you can like voice out what the text is saying you can actually turn this into like a siri alexa that's way better just by having it speak it doesn't speak it is only text space but it's very simple to go from text to speech because that's what alexa and siri does um yeah like i said it's a much smarter siri or alexa so why don't we go over a couple of those things like okay uh or or here here here let's go to this one first so i don't know if you guys can even read this it might be too small um yeah they can read it guys they can read it i'm sure they can't get it so what this is is this is the um this is gpt 3 talking to itself by the way guys 400 likes right now on this video that is epic we have 400 likes we have four almost 500 people watching let's go guys keep hitting that like button smash it more as much as you can but anyways just keep going actually before i show you this it makes more sense so i found this other article here from the verge okay so um a college student at berkeley he was able to get um one of the phd students there like he couldn't get access to gpt himself when it came out like you try to you have to like again you have to go to the wait list here and then you have to like get in and blah blah blah they only let a few people in uh but a phd student at berkeley actually got access they got approved to use it and this other college student at berkeley was like yo like let me use it i want to do this thing so what he did is he used gbt to write fake blog posts yes he created a fake blog like legit and like no when i show you it it literally looks like a human wrote it it's like it's original writing it's 100 original writing that has never existed on the internet before it wrote [ __ ] and then it's coherent like it makes sense it's crazy okay do we have any examples uh yeah i'm going so going through here he wants he said he just wanted to prove that yeah i could pass as a human writer okay um so uh yeah if you guys didn't know if something can pass as a human if a computer can fool a human to thinking it's a human then it passed something called the turing test uh which is based on alan turing who actually entered the first computer in world war ii a little bit history there uh so past the turing test then then it basically says okay this computer is um intelligent enough to pass the turing test so like that's what he's trying to do here so the the dude's name is liam poor okay something about mit i don't know something's uh lovable but anyways here uh his here's the blog post here's the actual blog post okay this is one of the first blog posts um here's a sample uh so he what he did is he gave him the title and then it wrote it wrote the blog post so he said the way the way this ai works is you give it some seed text and then from there it interpolates what comes after it's like you know what i mean by text what does seed text mean so for and see like he seeded something so in this case he seated the title so the title is feeling unproductive maybe you should stop overthinking he gave the ai this and then i wrote a blog post here let me read some of you too so he literally gave it he gave it this he gave it this feeling unproductive maybe should stop overthinking it got the picture it got the picture okay and then here let me start reading what the ai wrote okay in order to get something done maybe we need to think less seems counterintuitive but i believe sometimes our thoughts can get in the way of the creative process we can work better at times when we tune out the external world and focus on what's in front of us i've been thinking about this lately so i thought it would be good to write an article about it so what exactly does this mean well for starters let's start with some definitions and then it actually has like two structured definitions here definition one creative thinking is the act of using your mind to come up with ideas that are not already present in the reality or that you have never existed before or is it like look how long this is holy the possibilities are endless the important thing is to keep an open mind and try new things don't just limit yourself to one form of creative thinking expand your mind and explore all the possibilities that are out there i wish you the best of luck on your journey i hope that your achievement will achieve all of your dreams fit and even it even stole this because a lot of bloggers use finn as like finished so it learned that from other bloggers and then it it now understands how to write blogs so bloggers you lost all your jobs too it's not just us coders um all authors uh jk rowling you know harry potter you're screwed wow it can it can even write poetry it can write poetry and write knowledge guys you're gonna write like they can write anything it's like what's it honestly i'm speechless right now man i am legitimately speechless right now it wasn't copy and pasting like little things from the internet it literally wrote everything word by word through machine learning literally everything word by word just like the code it literally wrote each line of code and this sounds variable by variable line by line semicolon by semicolon literally understand all it's doing is saying okay if i have this like um here's one example of when i was looking into it about how it worked it says when it sees the word fire okay it's more likely to be followed by truck because fire truck then it is to um fire the beef to be followed by fan so like fire truck is more likely than fire fan because fire fan isn't a thing it doesn't exist uh as you can see right here i think this is where it was it says uh yeah so like fire truck and fire alarm are much more likely than fire lucid or fire elvish which makes sense it's just like a very basic machine learning principle but they just basically made this thing so they trained it so so deeply i might explain why it's so powerful um they just give it so much of this predictive ability that it can now it can do any arbitrary text based processing and they can actually speak and pass as a human which is as a developer as a blog post writer as a [ __ ] poet it can pass that human it doesn't matter what it is no like this is one step this is one step towards uh getting closer to the general intelligence of like being able so that's what i always thought so interestingly i've always that's what that's what i've always thought that things can be a little bit different i don't know what to say i don't know what to say man elon musk was right bro he's right to be scared about yeah he's gonna take all our jobs in our lives he was scared remember i don't know if you guys remember but remember that uh when uh with the whole thing when he came up with the ai or some kind of ai and he released it but then he was like he's like yeah ai is scary we need to really look after this and really to look at what's going on because this this stuff can get really dangerous through time and so i've always thought personally i mean i mean watermelon buttons but like okay go ahead okay watermelon butts i'm not gonna do anything but that's what you think bro but that's the blog the blogging yeah that is some crazy [ __ ] yeah you could even like train it like to have like a writer like in somebody's voice and then you could like do like you know how like they have like machine learning like like deep fake video content and you can like fake their voice fake the video um that and now they can fix the writing so like you can literally completely impersonate somebody and capture their personality and everything the way they look the way they sound the way they write and then like use machine learning to like completely represent that person and create content after that person is dead so we could literally we could literally bring shakespeare back to life like we could have his face have everything and just have him write like shakespeare from learning learning from his previous wow wow you know what's funny somebody said like tic tacs like hey you're both faces match 80 similar and like i'm not sure how similar our faces are but that's pretty funny but in any case like what what i've always thought but i will always say okay we're both handsome dudes not like everybody i know by the way so i've always thought by the way guys 484 likes guys let's get that fight to 500 come on keep it going keep it going help us out out here so what i always thought that's what i was you know delivered or changed kind of about um about what's it called that's always thought about like ai right i think hey ei yes it can re do repeatable things but i always thought that in terms of creativity create creative work that would be up to us but i that seems like i'm wrong on here because the creative process here on this block is just so good like yeah let us know guys do you what do you think about this blog that was actually a very well written block like i would read that gary right i would read that yeah right like it's like it's it's it's basically it's cool be okay so let me explain let's just continue in the presentation and then i'm gonna make some addendums to that so i wrote that blog post but here's another thing here's gpt talking to itself so they they just had it and they just keep feeding the messages back to each other and now it's conversating with itself so let me read this out so let's start so gpt gpt uh chat person one uh you can or person one you can talk about all these human beings that are greedy and you can talk about how the stock market is a system of corruption but that's a failure of the human experience and then um then it counters with artificial intelligence has no greed it's an advantage over humans it's able to generate wealth wow in response ai will always be at the advantage over human beings and then it responds ai has no emotions no agree so like one is like fighting for ai and the other one's defending ai so it's kind of creepy like it's dependent stance like ai has no greed it's an intelligent algorithm humans are too emotional but then it flips so now both sides are like fighting they want to hold on to something they want to hold on to their money but they don't want to invest talking [ __ ] about humans that's where human beings fail because they can't see the future they can't understand the way the world really what it's very dangerous for a human being to try to predict the future because you don't really know how the world works but it but in a i can see the future it can predict the future it can create an optimal future that's literally the conversation it had with itself it's kind of creepy like it like like where did this come from i mean honestly like it's probably it's probably learning because a lot of people like talk about these topics so probably learned like when you're talking about ai go down this route of ai is dangerous and that's why it sounds like ai is being dangerous it's like it's not this isn't sentient i just want to be very very clear this ai is not a sentient ai it's not like it's not actually an ai it's just a very very clever kind of text predictor and um understanding where i can spit out arbitrary text in any way and understand it but it doesn't actually okay so i just want to retract this back so guys i don't know if you know but so this was written this was this chat was written by ai yeah between two ei or with just one ei the same gp just two copies of gpt three two cause and they're both talking to each other in a creepy kind of way like it's kind of creepy when you like they're talking about like how ai has emotions there's no greedy there's no greed yeah it's not being greedy humans are too emotional this is where human beings fail like though the end is coming guys the apocalypse is coming this is why this is this this is what i'm saying i don't like this this is why we gotta be careful this stuff because i know man i mean if they're already talking about how the human beings are not perfect how they i mean i mean we're not perfect but like humans are too emotional they're they've got something they've got i know bro like all this exists so when ai is smart enough it can go back into history on the internet and find all this information and stuff wow so let's just pray that all the green lights like you know on my laptop right now the webcam is going it has a little green light let's just pray it stays green because when it turns red we're [ __ ] but that [ __ ] turns great it's like from the eye roll by you know what i'm talking about from the eye roblox exactly i robot just make sure just make sure you know like wally you know you think he's nice until the light turns red and then you're screwed said elon is part of clever programmer maybe you don't know that maybe maybe maybe i'm elon maybe aaron is young i don't know maybe we're ai i don't know i don't know yeah i mean i guess you can abstract that bro to like some level because like like the the idea behind ai's unconsciousness is like if if you guys have uh heard of girdle escher bach um this guy was kind of like he's he was a cognitive scientist which is like a branch of artificial intelligence or kind of like a sub or a super branch or super super super set of it okay about um how like brains come to be conscious because like the earth was just freaking rocks at one point in lava yeah how do we go from lava to humans like when was the first cell like when was the very first creature that came from just the rocks and like the nitrogen and the water and everything right and then like every single step from that point all the way up to humans at one point did consciousness come so this book goes over like how um how that process came to be going from rocks up to the first cells up to the smallest things at every step up into humans and like okay because we're humans we're conscious but the idea is that consciousness is a is a thing it's like a loop it's not it's not like like we we are not ourselves actually because um every seven years every cell in your body dies and changes out so seven years ago you were 100 a different person you were made up of different cells seven years ago seven years in the future you'll be made up of completely different cells in your body every single cell in your body will become 100 different well i mean we got cells we generally everything can type every every time which which means that we are not actually the cells that make us up we're just the pattern of the things going on in our brains we're just the pattern of data going through our brains in some kind of structure we're not actually our bodies or our bodies don't actually matter which means you can actually theoretically implant your same like you know patterns and stuff in your brain into a different body a clone and it could still be you you can they would still think it's you yeah there'd just be two of you because you're not actually your body but um so the idea is that they tie that to artificial intelligence because you don't need you don't need a computer it's just some kind of like um connection of uh connection of of things like it's like a brain like like a network so some people like to argue that the internet is actually conscious because there's so many different connections and stuff and it's like it can think on its own which i think is kind of bs but yeah i mean it's just like i mean i mean honestly here's the i know have you guys ever heard of uh so what's a really interesting essay have you heard of have you seen um so elon musk went on went on to an interview not interview but podcast a joe rogan podcast right oh yeah and and there he talked about he talked about how they already have a chip a chip a girl yeah you're like a chip that will actually and hold on listen to this it will actually go ahead and it can fix any problems you got so for example let in your brain so let's say for example you have for example like adhd it can fix that let's say for example you're deaf and you can't hear it can fix that let's say for example you can't walk right it can fix your legs if you're paraplegic you can't use your legs it will bring all those connections back which is just simply mind freaking blown man right yeah yeah it does it by i think it says like all he does is like you have like a little quarter sized chip on your skull yeah yeah yeah they will actually implant like a chip like they'll actually like cut up the skull no no it's like yeah they call the little hole in the skull right they put like a little chip there they put a chip in there and then they have wires going into the brain no no no no no wires no knife no wires nope no wires no those wires bro i know this is the podcast okay everybody everybody go watch the joe rogan um elon musk's podcast the most recent one and go find out that elon musk does mention wires going into the brain and come back to this comment section and prove that's wrong all right and prove me wrong i'll check tomorrow he said literally they have wires going in the brain to the exact perfect spot in the brain whatever problem you have like if you're blind go to the visual cortex if you're um go to your motor system place wherever i don't know what this or if you have memory issues if you have alzheimer's go to the hippocampus for your memory and then you just put wires and then you have a little node there it goes to the perfect spot and then you just you just have counter pulses or like people with epilepsy right um same thing then you can like give counter pulses to like prevent a seizure from coming because you can you can sense it come and get the right spot and then stuff like that so you can like actually put it into your brain so that's kind of scary because with ai together now ai can actually start manipulating our brains if we have these like in our freaking yeah they can actually make it it can make you smarter right right you know it can make aaron you know you know faster if he wants to run faster i don't know no no i'm the exception it's not possible but oh it's not possible to make you faster no no no i'm already i'm already the fastest bro oh yeah that's what you think i'm like the flash oh yeah guys we're going to have a we're going to have it bro let's get back to gpt3 because we're going to do it coding yeah this is this is very interesting this is just very interesting i think right it is it's interesting yeah it's just a casual life but anyways let's continue on so uh yeah like i said unfortunately the code isn't publicly available i tried to get access but i couldn't a few people did yeah for free of misuse so everybody knows uh elon doesn't like ai he's kind of scared of it that's why he founded opening iron but now he created this because he was scared of ai so there's kind of a dichotomy there like it's kind of paradoxical but more contradicting but yeah you hear uh it's quote elon musk with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon wow but uh yeah like if you check it out um this is open ai and then to request access you you go to the waitlist i'll pop this in here if you guys want to see if you can get access maybe somebody actually will i don't know what i don't know their criteria will we have the link to this stuff yeah it's not in the description yet but after the stream is done i'll pop it all in there i'm not gonna do it now yeah so guys so after the stream is done we'll make sure to put the link in description okay so you guys can check this stuff out all this stuff every single video the twitter everything yeah um but let's just keep going on the presentation so yep so i don't have access to the code so that's why i'm limited to showing you these videos and the twitter clips and everything just because i want to showcase the power we're just kind of like riffing on it and talking but i can't give you a live demo unfortunately um maybe in the future when it if we if it does go public that'll be awesome maybe we can make a cool video on it like actually like like pushing the limits and be like hey sonny you're about to lose your job but uh or wait maybe we just make our own you know yo so i want to talk about how this actually works so apparently um this thing ate the entire internet like literally like like a freaking sandwich okay so the gbt3 literally what it did is it went through literally all the text publicly available on the entire freaking internet everything and it ate it it just [ __ ] ate it like it ate it like i consumed it so wikipedia everything every single wikipedia page eaten every single search eats it every single scholarly paper every single piece of code on github that is publicly available eating the entire internet it ate everything okay okay why do you say eat it read and processed everything and used all that data as its training data for me so that's why it's so robust in its writing because it's literally read every piece of text that exists on the internet so it can actually understand what coherent text means what coherent code is because it's read all of it and can see the patterns so it can be like okay um the likelihood of following x like if like in code you know like we could like x equals five like it could say okay for x um usually after x and since it's such a common variable name the chance of equal sign following it is pretty high so it might put a sign and then after that it's like okay a number is pretty likely so x equals three or something like that and it just goes through everything and it just learned and it this took like a long long time and a lot of computation power to do um i'll mention how they did they did it in a little bit but basically it it everything dude ate [ __ ] everything wow like like patrick wow dude that that that's insane to me but okay when you okay when you guys just so you know when he says eat it did you literally just eat like what i'm eating right now but it's so funny somebody just mentioned you know i used to not do something you mentioned the kind of like are you snacking i'm like yes i am but anyways so what literally happened is it didn't eat but basically it just it engulfed it downloaded all the information and then learned a used information as training data because in ai when you for example you know the way the way ai works is from real world experiences just like we humans learn from real world experiences right you know our brain brain at the end of the day is just a very complex ai system it's a very complexity system and it learns from experiences from seeing different things and so forth and so the same thing happened with this specific application where literally you just you know engulfed everything onto the internet the blogs everything and i said you know what i got a system that can build applications write blogs next thing you know can be created can talk it got all the chat the public chats available and now can chat with itself about any topic and so at some point at some point i'm meeting her now at some point this will also be yeah patrick yeah patrick this is me right here no right here right here okay actually actually wait one second what i'm not there we go there's an odds right there guys this is a homemade meme i had to pop the text under myself oh my god it's funny homemade beans are the best ones oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i don't know what that means but it's crazy and when i say the whole internet like you guys would be surprised how much data that actually is let's get into that next so the whole internet that's everything you can find on google and then some so read this read this and this is from 2017 so this is even like it says google does not hold the biggest of data centers but it still handles a huge amount of data so google isn't even the majority of the internet like the whole dark web and everything there's a lot of servers that aren't on google that can't be accessed by google that aren't popped up by searching okay so a lot of people think google and internet is the same because you can find everything on google that is not true yeah um so uh it knows every every possible thing you can find on google it it is in there it ate all of that wow and then and then it ate a [ __ ] ton more wow like that's how much data it went through is what i'm saying like this this is this is like most cutting edge stateoftheart this is the biggest ai thing machine learning project i think anybody has ever done ever um it's it's crazy so uh data center here this is what the data centers at google probably look like they're like big super databases of like just like terabytes after terabyte terabyte and uh it says the data center normally holds petabytes to exabytes of data i think petabytes petabytes after yeah i think petabytes that's like a thousand that's like a thousand terabytes yeah and then exabytes is a thousand x petabytes so that's a million terabytes one exabyte is a million terabytes of data wow so google currently processes over 20 petabytes petabytes of data per day through an average of 100 000 mapreduce jobs spread across its massive competing clusters so mapreduce is just a way to um crunch data and you kind of like run run number crunch and then you find out what you want because like when you search a term how does it search all of that data to find your search results that's what's happening with mapreduce so we're not going to go into the output but basically a [ __ ] ton of information of data is there and this is just google so it ate everything plus more wow so it's ridiculous wow so gpt 3 has actually it knows everything on the internet everything everything um so yeah i also want to talk about uh gpt itself the reason why this is so groundbreaking is gpt uh just to quote aaron uh about two hours ago gpt shits on everything else so far aaron aaron bernath elon's son but yeah jackie chan's nephew yeah if you like jackie chan uh have chinese halfway but anyway anyways um here this is a graph of each one of these is a different machine learning model based on text so a natural language processor so nlp stands for natural language processor nope not it's not neurolinguistic programming that's another thing don't get it confused with neural linguistic programming that's a social kind of thing about how your brain learns through repetition this is natural language processing different um so and these are pretrained models in in the sense that they were trained with machine learning and then now we can just like pass stuff through it and then it can just like use those uh learned numbers to actually spit out stuff so as you can see here um i don't know when these are created but these are yeah this this um axis is in billions so the 12 million for example 12 million 18 million 66 million so yeah but uh the way the way uh machine learning works is a neural net will have a bunch of nodes okay and each of those nodes the number and then you just pass stuff through and then it can like it like the numbers will change things and then it'll eventually understand go from like your input to your output so like for example for like uh for images um you would have like when we train stuff if you guys in the fix detection app and stuff um it'll have the nodes and it'll have all the numbers in there and then when you pass them an image it'll go through all the nodes and numbers and at the end it'll give you a yes or no so that's the input is image the output is yes or no um if it's a face or not uh so that's kind of like what is like in each of those nodes is considered a parameter so gpt3 has 175 billion parameters okay totally like you don't understand but if you look at look at the first one this one had a measly 12 million and when each of these came out everybody thought they were huge it's like you started with 12 million parameters like think about it a neural network with 12 million numbers like it's a list of 12 million numbers and each of those 12 million numbers is doing a little small calculation on the input data and making you one step closer to your output data wow so this one had 12 million which is a [ __ ] ton wow and then they're like holy crap then they went up to 18 million then 66 million that was a huge jump people were going crazy okay this divert i don't know what these are to be honest i wasn't i don't know when when these happen uh then 110 million 125 million 340 million and then eventually um then open ai came about and then i think a couple years ago um open ai came out with gpt2 okay gpt2 which had 1500 1500 million aka one 1.5 billion parameter and that was the biggest one to date because they jumped from 355 million to 1.5 billion and gpt just shot on everybody they're like ah this is fine that's like five that's like four times more yeah yeah so like it was basically doing the same things as what we're doing is like natural um language processing it was doing like predictive techs and stuff like that got it but it was it was state of the art at the time i think a couple years ago and then google came out with their t5 uh nlp pretrained model which had 11 billion and they're like holy crap this is 10 times bigger okay and then microsoft came out with turing and lg um again remember the turing test is a test where if it can pass as a human it passes the turing test so they called it turning nlg appropriately that had 17 billion parameters which is another huge leap because it almost doubled the 11 billion and then gb and open and elon musk was like ah screw you guys we're creating gp3 literally an order of magnitude okay from seventeen 17 175 billion like this is ten times bigger like it just shot up oh and it just shattered everything so this as you can see this this is uh the perfect example of exponential growth so in other words yeah we're [ __ ] the robot in other words elon screwed us over that's what yolan did by trying to save us he's exactly he's he's curing global warming he's uh he's solving the super volcano and asteroid risk problem by getting us on mars but then he's also controlling us with artificial intelligence like this guy is jacked just like just like honestly though just like elon's [ __ ] and everything with the tesla i think you know elon's gonna [ __ ] shine everything with the aei honestly literally like yeah he's just uh he's such an inspirational figure like all the best go to him so like he has the ability he has the most leverage to build the most badass team yeah like more than everybody like he's now the fourth richest person in the world only the only people in front of him are bezos um gates bill gates and mark zuckerberg yeah so he's number four yeah and honestly i think he's gonna pass everybody he's gonna be the first trillionaire he's gonna be the world's first trillion probably probably probably bezos is his only real competition because he also has the space company yeah but even then he doesn't have a electric car company you know he doesn't have this ai company the same decision i mean i guess it's amazon so they have some [ __ ] but now elon is gonna yeah yeah he's gonna do some crazy stuff in the next 20 years by the way by the way guys i just want to really quickly point point something out here we got kazzy in the chat kazakh in the chat guys just say hi in the chat uh what's up you just put put in the chat he's like uh kazia's out here like yo guys uh kaza here my girlfriend has just dropped her first youtube video on working out from home it's epic go show some love nas push the vid guys i just sho i just saw um amber lee's first video on working out and it is insane so good guys it is so good check out the link is in bio guys drop the link and not bio drop the link in need to work out you description need to need to move around uh you know you guys need to go ahead and you know make sure your body is you know strained and is healthy and that's what amberly is here to do she's gonna keep you healthy and she's gonna keep you so so well so well i don't know how do i say this so well trained in shape in shape there we go athletic yeah yeah and i just spent about 10 hours of adding and her hearing him spent about 10 hours of editing this video shooting it and putting a lot of love into it guys so just want to say check it out it's in the chat go ahead kazi and drop it in the chat so that everybody can see it and then we're going to continue on with this but i just want to say as an epic video amberly awesome job and let's keep this moving let's go nice i was gonna i was gonna find it and pull it up but oh no i can't hold on because i screenshot it hold on hold wait let me see if i can just find it just looking for clever programmer i got it actually i got this yeah it's it's gone i don't know where it is but i got this hold on i got this boom right there i put in there as well all right guys nice sweet so okay so let's continue on with with what we're talking about here which is which is oh wait jason jason has just made a donation thanks so much hold on thank you francis jason franco appreciate that thanks so much is that a is that a good word or a bad word appreciate the work lads are just guys they're like guys you're cool lads are cool guys a lot lads are cool guys cool guy or cool guys is it plural or plural man there's an s in the end i know what it means but i'm just trying to trigger you and it worked anyways if only i can cuss in this video real nicely i mean i already did are we not allowed to cuss on youtube uh well i mean i mean we try to keep it civil sometimes you know sometimes we try we try [ __ ] let's keep going um but yeah so gpt shits on everything else so far gonna put the emphasis on the [ __ ] the [ __ ] okay let's continue let's continue let's continue let's continue well yeah um but yeah so pretty much going back to here um all of these little ones okay like 12 million parameters all the up to even the 1.5 billion you could actually run it on your your own laptop like it was just barely strong enough to like run it you could run the whole thing um on your computer but then when you started getting up to these two questionable and then when we got to this big gp3 like it's impossible you cannot run it on your own computer you need some kind of cluster so you need like multiple you need multiple um multiple processors and uh maybe even graphics cards or whatever all in parallel running number crunching all the data for it's even work in a reasonable amount of time um a lot so you can even run it on like super computers so like huge huge clusters like this uh but yeah you just need to you need to run it on on such a big thing um which comes i mean like the fact that you need to run it on this like it costs a lot of money too like all the electricity and all the everything to run this like just to have this open i think exist it takes a lot of money and a lot of energy and a lot of time and a lot of compute power um so it kind of leads me to the idea of like okay so how the hell did it do this like how how were they able to literally read all of this stuff on the internet like when you touch it when you put in any search term on the internet there's literally like millions or billions of like results okay of of stuff and that's just from one word now i'll go over every single search possible and that's all of google and then google is only a subset of everything on the internet so how did he eat everything like within two years and process all of it and actually learn from it because reading it is very different from processing it and learning from it okay right so how it did this is something called transformers what no but seriously it's actually called transformers so i don't know too much about this to be honest but i did a little bit of research i found the wikipedia page right here uh it's a machine learning model so let's actually just pull the wikipedia page i have it guys before we look at here i just want to say so hash thanks so much for the donation really appreciate it man i was 40 40. i keep forgetting what the name of this but this this dollar sign is it rupees maybe it's rupees it's indian it's right rupees so it's appreciated thanks so much for the awesome donation jose appreciate that beautiful beach photo is your profile photo yeah i like it i know and he has to hate you emoji hey you right by the way guys 600 likes let's go insane stuff 600 likes we're still almost 400 people watching let's keep this going all right let's keep going so yeah so this is uh gpt3 the wikipedia article um i mean a lot it's very wordy i'm not going to read this out you can check it out if you want to if you guys have it already but pretty much if you go down you can see that um the way i was able to do this was it was um based on a new deep learning machine learning model introduced in 2017 called the transformer so um in 2017 uh well first of all the transformer movie came out in 2017 so that's that's a fun fact though revenge of the fallen um but no there's a thing called a transformer a machine learning model in 2017 that they developed and i'll i already looked into it and i researched a little bit but basically the idea is uh in a lot of machine learning stuff you have to like read all the data sequentially you have to order it and you have to go through it step by step and learn as you go and like in order in in one like one pass through everything um but a transformer what it allows you to do is it allows you to actually um you don't need to go through it in order you can go through the data in any order you want you can go through it backwards you can start in the middle and go out from the sides you can start in 20 000 different points and then then go in random directions you just read and parse all the data together like it's like uh like a drop in a in a pool you start somewhere and you can just spread out you don't have to like go through like line by line gotcha um so they developed this i don't know how it works under the hood um completely but basically the the reason this is relevant is this allows you to actually run this on super computers and stuff on clusters because you can run things in parallel you can actually read the whole internet at like a hundred or like a million different positions you can start from like a million different spots and start processing it in all those places instead of just one at a time which basically means now we can feasibly read the internet the entire internet in a reasonable amount of time instead of it taking bajillions of years which is so this was the breakthrough that allowed us to do this so i actually think gbt2 was actually based on this as they're able to do that and then since then they were running this for like a couple years or something and then they eventually got gt3 after it was running for a long last time got it by the way i just want to say one more one more thanks guys we got two more donations from let's see 400 half something huff for i don't know what that is i'm so horrible with these with these uh huff huffington post i don't know come on thank you yeah and armand of her 100 rupees he i actually asked a question guys which is a good question is gpt 3 has if gp23 has trained itself so much then can it copy itself to some other hidden place on the internet and become selfsustaining oh no why not no what no it can't can you explain why no so this this this gpt3 is very very uh robust in the sense that it can handle any trained um i mean any text problem it says like you can put in any text and it can reply with text okay um in any way it's very very good at predicting like i said um if it sees the word fire it's gonna think the word truck or alarm follows it much more than fire um cow fire cow like those aren't things unless they are but so that's really all it is it just understands what's the most likely thing to follow the next word based on the context you gave it so like for the blog post example um the only reason i was able to write that blog post is because it gave it the title so i took the titles and it said okay feeling unproductive maybe you should stop overthinking so i took all of this and i was like okay it seems like overthinking unproductive um stop uh like all these things and from this it was able to generate this but without this title it would not be able to generate this which means it can't really reason it's just really really clever in taking something and then interpolating that and generalizing that to spit out more content so you have an endless stream you give it a little bit and then it can give you infinite other stuff mmhmm so forever i'll go forever and give you everything it'll just keep giving you more and more and more like if you give it if you if you're like hey tell me a story about jane the dog and jimmy the cow it can be like okay jamie and jenny this dog and then they'll just start telling a story a random story like they lived on a hill together they did this they did that so it's all what you understand is it's all based on the previous kind of text yeah so the way it actually works is um the way the way it actually trains trains itself is it would take like something like go take an actual blog post written by a human it would take this it would try to learn from it and predict the second paragraph okay the second paragraph and write this out um what it thinks is the best match then it would take both of them and spit it into itself and then write the third paragraph and then take all three and spit it back into itself and then write the fourth paragraph so it kind of like learns from itself as well and that's why it takes so long to train because you're not just training it on the whole internet you're training it on the internet plus everything it generates from the internet and then it's like constantly growing and that's why the compute power is just ridiculous it costs millions and millions of dollars to train this and then to run it that's insane stuff wow wow and yeah well it can't it's not smart enough to do it can only so it can't be what humans have done they can't do it can't innovate it can't innovate itself is what you're saying no it can only emulate how do you know that 100 how do you 100 know that i only know i only 99 no but 100 that's 99 that's not 100 though i know i don't i mean i technically don't know i mean i'm not the like leading expert here bro but um and from from what i've heard it's only a predictive model so i can only predict what's going to happen next it can't actually proactively and actively go do some new stuff all by himself by the way i just wanted to say by the way i just want to say guys nonstop dre360 said uh give us the two dollar nation appreciated my friend and asked the questions at what point will ai be able to replace engineers engineers yes i mean to what extent i mean like ai has um it's replaced a lot i mean like like you know like trying to cure cancer i mean that's not even engineers but like doing like models like using computer models that kind of is like ai replacing engineers because we're not doing stuff by hand anymore we're not doing you're using models to replace stuff i mean like fully replace them yeah i don't know like maybe ask elon musk he always has those answers he probably already has a plan a five year plan for all this stuff yeah i mean like have you seen like robots and stuff you guys seen the stuff boston dynamics is doing i was reading about this the other day and i wrote an email on it about like the the applications of computer vision but like here um i'm trying to show it yeah i'll just show it real quick okay videos have you guys seen boston dynamics so here um this is some crazy ai stuff so here we go so here's a little doggie doggy robot fully autonomous you can also drive it but looking at the door and it's like i can't i can't uh i can't i can't do this man i can't figure this out he calls his friend over all right his friend has a his friend has a head or an arm it finds a door no what what goes down opens the door what uses its left foot no way open uses the arm and then the whole and then the whole swat team goes in no get out of here man and it keeps it open all you got to do is mount a gun on that thing and we're screwed this is from 2018 bro yo like like seriously and then look look at this here look at this um they also have a humanoid robot this is like this is like a boston dynamics they work for mit guys there you seen this yeah i've seen this yeah like yeah the running like i mean is he gonna do anything let me just run it no no but then we have a but then we see where he was like uh where they were the parkour one you see that one yeah this one look he jumps over the lawn look at that holy [ __ ] guys that's insane guys it's a robot bro like what is happening look one leg second leg balance third leg the arms are moving so fluidly like we're super close to like an iron man suit dude aaron can't even do that guys you can't even do that not yeah okay yo and then uh there's there's one more i think um oh here more parkour atlas yeah i see i think yeah this one look so this robot learns how to hand stand what what it does the summerslam does the somersault what it turns around okay and it doesn't do this to dance you know 360. boom you want to see a dancing robot they did that they did that too bro they're one step ahead of you check it out no yeah bro uptown look bruno mars robot okay let's see let's see if we can let's see i'm going to judge his dancing skills let's see let's see but yeah you can't hear the music can you i guess like don't stop wait no i can't hear the music okay that's pretty good give it give a thumbs up for for aaron singing out here look at his ass bro we are not answering this dude's question at all we're just looking at roblox huh bruno mars went to my high school man why are you trying to sell yourself like man with the jackie chan and then all of a sudden oh man trying to be so cool you know he move monks off out of frame somebody asked a question aviva can't ask the question i cannot pull up these questions and actually show that unfortunately but sometimes a question can we use gtp3 for a research project how can we use gpt3 for a research project via vivek asked um i mean you're gonna have to apply to the waitlist so look here go to the openai api website and then you're going to have to want to request access click this link and open it to the wait list um so of course because they're running this and there's a lot of number crunching they have limited resources and they only want good people they don't want like malicious people or hackers getting into it so you have to share the api you have to share the whole super computer um so you have to get on the waitlist get approved and then at that point maybe you can do research but until then it's probably going to be many months before it's public or maybe even years nobody knows got it yeah you can research i mean there already is research going on probably in nlp in general like if you want to look into it look at look up nlp um on wikipedia you can look at how it's applications have you ever actually ever done an nlp project before like in natural language processing little bit not not nothing extensive like very very little bit okay um interesting yeah like i was more like visual like computer learning um computer vision stuff but not like managed process got it so um yep so they're based on transformers like i said before uh you can look into that too about how now we're able to actually train things in parallel instead of sequentially uh which means you can just you can you can break it up into a bunch of little parts and do all the different parts at the same time on a bunch of different computers instead of doing having two by one because the way it learns it doesn't matter what order you do it so they learn how to make learn teach things in any order yeah yeah all right guys we're almost almost at 700 likes guys come on let's get this up let's get this going let's get this going to 700 likes come on you know you know you can i know you can all right and okay lastly uh the ramifications so we we've already been talking about this a lot going um in this whole stream about like like the applications of this you know like coming up with a boilerplate code for developers to actually like do the bulk like do the first half of the project for you in like 10 seconds and then you just go in and add in all your your flares at the end or fix any bugs that it might have misunderstood um that's definitely a thing but what i want to talk about is uh if gp2 and these things uh were like so small and then we just jumped up to gpt3 here within a couple years um somebody i i don't understand this either fully but some other people were doing some particular models and even though i read the whole internet um it only trained it to a certain extent like it might only train everything like a little bit you can actually go deep and like find even deeper deeper rooted patterns if you like process the data longer so the idea is that these models are going to have more and more and keep growing so we're currently at 175 billion okay the human brain has 100 trillion wow 100 trillion connections parameters yeah 100 trillion parameters so this is 175 billion but in theory if we can get a predictive model like this all the way up to this similar to a human brain level so like 175 billion we would need what 1 000 times so we would need 1 000 gbt3s to make one human brain no that number would be simple that shows how good we are yeah yeah but at the same time at the same time if you can make one gtp3 we can make multiple gtp3s right so this kind of stuff can really be duplicated and replicated really easily the thing is it's like it's like you would have 10 dumb people rather than one smart person so it's not the same like you have multiple gpt3s but they're just like they're all equally not smart so the idea is to train it so deeply that it has even more instead of having like 10 um 175 billion parameter ones then you would have 100 trillion parameter predictive model and then at that point that might literally be jarvis you know like an iron man you know like when you're speaking to jarvis and they can understand everything that um tony stark says you know iron man said like it can speak and it can it can like understand and get data for him it's like hey um oh yeah that's another thing it can do it can search for you so you can you can ask it any question and then it'll answer it for you by searching all of its its web stuff it's basically like a really jacked google search bar you can um wow yeah there's another uh thing there but at that point then then this thing is going to get really crazy it could even start coding like it could actually maybe even fully code apps like sunny is doing you know like the netflix clone stuff you could actually maybe even do that nobody knows but nobody nobody's going to want to learn from gtp3 though nobody's going to want to learn from gp3 everybody wants to look for a person like sunny right yeah yeah you're going to want to learn from actual person so you know nice nice beard everything yeah yeah um but yeah that's that's it really i mean like going forward like gpt4 when it comes out like we don't know how big it's going to be maybe it'll be um 1 trillion you know then we'll have a 5 trillion one then 10 trillion then finally 100 trillion and we can see how how smart it actually is yeah um but yeah it's just going to be a matter of walter walter a bunch of smart people getting together you know elon musk inspiring a bunch of coders like you guys watching us and you know him hiring people at open ai and um doing cool stuff there yeah but so the future yeah is cool because i mean this is already pretty dang good so far it can understand like watermelon buttons and stuff but watermelon buttons that's what you took away from the the watermelon buns by the way walter asks that's the best one watermelon watermelon walter asks how can you learn gtp3 is there any side for this documentation uh just just go to the open open ai website and then they have a little information there of course you don't have access to the code we only we only know how it works like on the surface we don't understand exactly how it's all implemented and built that's kind of proprietary to them um and i don't know if it's patented or i don't even know what they did but it is available there like if you want to look into the research in the actual math of it all and like how transformers actually work then by all means go go look at it um and yeah and there's a good video i was watching um where these guys go into even more detail uh this is from a a channel called computer file okay they talk about a lot of computer stuff and then they talk about gbt3 and they go into even more detail on the algorithm and stuff so if you want to get even more information then you can go to them um i didn't feel like regurgitating everything they said on this stream um they do a pretty good job i mean it's pretty long 25 minutes shorter than the stream but go check it out so some cool stuff if you want to look into that and yeah i'll link all these videos in the in the description yeah there's a bunch and then here's another yeah this this video here there's a bunch of cool projects people made using gbt3 there's a lot of application just because it's so generalized um oh i'm looking at the stream on the stream our stream on the stream that's funny yeah uh but yeah i mean other than that the last thing is just the limitations like i said we already we already talked about this a lot it is purely a predictive model which means it can only predict what's going to come after it so when it's writing code it it reads what it re reads what you what you took and then from that it can kind of predict what's going to happen like you ask it a question it kind of predicts what the answer would be and then they can grab the answer for you so it reads your your code and it's like okay well this code is probably going to correlate to this text and then it just writes the code so it doesn't see the big pictures it doesn't it doesn't have common sense it can't reason it can't it can't it can't be like it can it doesn't understand emotion or anything of course this is this isn't actually an ai this is a highly highly robust predictive text model um based on that natural language so it knows how to parse natural language it understands the patterns within natural language and therefore can communicate with humans through natural language but it can't actually think it can't actually innovate it can't actually take over the world it's not going to do any of that we're very very far from that but this is a good step in the right direction okay so it will not it's not the end of the world uh by the way i just wanted to say super chat thanks so much uh amman a hundred rupees um that's the question actually that's the question if gpt3 learned to give itself the initial parameters what would it what would be what would be the consequences what are your thoughts on this if gpt3 learned to give itself the initial parameters uh initially what do you mean by initial parameters actually what does that mean yeah you mean like the title of the blog post or something if that's like so i guess maybe like that probably that's already what it is doing you know um and also the chat you know when we're at the chat yeah literally what it was doing is it's just feeding the messages back and forth to each other so it's it's writing this giving it to itself and it's responding with this giving it to itself responding with this giving it to itself got it well actually what it's doing is it's taking this and then it's falling with this then it's feeding both knees to itself like it's this then feeding life itself to get this fourth one then feeding all four to itself to this one that's how it keeps that's how it understands the context and keeps the context relevant as the conversation goes on but it's kind of like a game of telephone if you go on super long it does start losing coherent um coherence and stuff so i actually found this forbes article this is the last thing i want to mention um gpt3 is amazing but it's also overhyped according to forbes okay and the reason for this here's elon musk and sam um what's his name sam alton i think his name oh it's the guy from uh what's it called other guy huh the startup guy started and then him and elon musk founded open ai so he's the ceo currently elon musk is just like a cofounder he's focusing more on tesla spacex but he does have a part in it gotcha um but yeah basically so here the internet is buzzing about gpt3 openai's newest ai language model um gp2 is the most powerful language model ever built which is what we've been talking to and it's it's due to its size of course 175 billion parameters we talked about all this um oh so gpt2 was released just last year in 2019. oh no way so that was 53.5 yeah so we went from we weren't from this little itty bitty thing to this one from google to this one from microsoft to this huge one in less than a year so so five years from now we don't know where the hell we're going to be yeah that's going to be insane but uh going back to amman's questions he says what would be the consequences what are your thoughts on this um i think it's still limited so that ties into what we're talking about here on the swords article uh it can give itself stuff but whatever it gives itself parameters it's just going to keep learning within the own confines of what data it has available to it it can actually interpolate new data so like if we give it every scientific paper which we already have that exists on the internet it can't come up with new scientific like revolutions and discoveries that's not possible uh because it's it's limited to what it have what what it can do is you can find connections and spit out some of the data within there but it can't actually give you new stuff it can just kind of like mix and match it in interesting ways yeah that's all it really is yeah yeah there's some insane stuff by the way guys i just want to say uh we completed 700 likes holy moly guys thanks so much for that but yeah it says uh this is some epic stuff man um honestly gpt3 yeah like wow yeah but i mean that's really it um anybody in the comments have questions about stuff or just want to have any input i'm looking why is elin on the thumbnail oh because i mean i don't know because he's the creator it seemed more yeah like he found it open ai and then it's from open ai yeah so figured it'd be more maxim asked the question will gpt3 kill coding um no it won't kill that was just a joke but it's going to enhance it once it's publicly available i feel like um you know things like webflow or mainstreaming and like streamlining the way you can create code much faster than yeah from scratch yeah i feel like gpt3 is going to have a very similar kind of effect um downline or gpt4 or gp35 when they come out then i think they are going to have like really really powerful use cases in coding because it can like unit testing like non said or just spitting out code much faster like if a client wants a website built like yeah instead of using stuff you can like build a whole custom website just by writing a sentence it spits out the code for you you go into the code um understanding how it works and then you adding some extra stuff and you're done yeah much faster than doing a doll from scratch so actually vivek said we can give ideas to gpt3 so they can innovate new new researchers interesting maybe yeah maybe i mean i'm not i'm not the world expert on this but but yeah i don't see why not yeah the way thank you for the canadian five dollars oh thanks super chat let's build an ai app using alan ai interesting it would be a pretty awesome project for this channel i got a demo project link i'll put it in the chat sweet yeah let's see let's see the demo what is allen ai let's pop this up hold on let me make sure i'm actually showing it here ln ai lan conversation voice ai platform yeah interesting okay conversational voice ai platform add a voice assistant to your application so is this like jarvis why you need a voice assistant in your app dude that'd be cool honestly jarvis you're home we should plug we should plug this in into this and then just it'd be super creepy like it's talking to itself the the ai conversation oh that like yeah humans are too emotional ai has no emotions no greed that'd be funny it's very happy i talked to the eye yeah oh goodness i mean alexa and syria have done it before you know when they talk to each other it's kind of funny but they sound kind of [ __ ] versus this one is actually sounds kind of scary yeah i do want i do want to build a project something with something with ai machine learning i think that'll be really interesting because i personally i have done it i've done a few projects in terms of like um ai stuff yeah machine learning i've done an llp project i've done a project where basically we're like you know how like you have google search for example so for example what i'll do is like i had a project where um i had a project where for example you know i said hey um find me uh find me a a tshirt a a so i would say it's a blue tshirt for a max of a hundred dollars and they will parse that part out and it will actually search it up and actually i'll give you the results like a tshirt a blue tshirt that that has a max price of for example some some amount of money basically and that's it you know so i mean there's definitely something we can do guys if you guys have any suggestions for us in terms of like what projects we should do in terms of ai let us know i'm sure ammo would love to do it right aaron all right right aaron got it your audio cut out so i didn't hear anything you said for a while okay i assume you're talking to the audience yeah i'm still talking the audience it's your it's your it's your sky that's a little bit iffy it's your scribe it's a little bit iffy oh yeah i got it but i'm still talking to the audience guys i still see you guys you guys can still see me as you guys can partially see aaron yeah but yeah i think yeah if you guys any questions before we move on before we leave uh if you guys have any questions on this let us know in the comments and we'll take a look at them right now we literally probably will probably have like about you know two three minutes before we leave and uh but yeah one last thing one less thing to kind of to kind of bring you back guys like i said we have a free training on a free training on you know uh free training check this out actually i'll show it to you guys a free training right here hold on free training right here you guys should be able to see that hold on give me a second right there check this out boom boom free training top 10 mistakes to avoid doing becoming a just developer link is in the description below so check it out completely for free you know nothing for you if you don't have you don't have to pay anything at all it's just some great value content from qazi uh but yeah check it out and that's pretty much it yeah guys so thanks for hanging out talking about gp3 yeah cutting edge ai and um when gpt4 comes out uh we'll probably do another stream or maybe we'll have access to access to gpt3 when gtp4 comes out yeah tongue twister maybe jpt3 that'd be good that'd be good if we can get access to that that'd be some cool stuff we can build yeah we could we could be like how fast can we um how fast can we code up sunday's clone how fast can we put up we could probably code up all the clones sunny just done just done in a matter of like minutes minutes yeah probably sunny watch out bro sunny watch out you gotta watch out on this stuff coming for you oh but that's awesome that's crazy stuff crazy stuff guys so yeah and also make sure to take us in your instagram go ahead you know you know share share your share your your kind of journey through cleverprogrammer here tag us on your instagram and we always like to share your instagram on our stories um but i think it's pretty much it should we finish should we finish it off here um yeah let me see if i can find one more code um generation example just to like finish strong actually there's one good question here somebody asked uh you might be able to answer this question uh muhammad ikram asked how to start with ai and ml for beginners for beginners yes um learn python first learn python from there uh just dive in just find some tutorials on youtube and just do some stuff do some tensorflow do some open cv uh i have open cv tutorials in here about face detection stuff i explain the algorithm and everything if you want to learn about like a little bit how like it actually works behind the scenes um and then once so i'd actually start with that start with the faces section or the car and pedestrian tracking um and also small detection like on those three you can watch all three get started there understand the kind of context about how things actually work then from there then actually go do like a tensorflow project because then you can actually train your own models using your own neural nets you can design your own neural nets and put it all together so got it uh yeah so start with python then go to those those beginnerfriendly ai projects that we have on our channel in python and then from there then you'll you'll honestly probably find like your own little path to go on at that point you'll something will intrigue you and you'll you'll probably google something some tensorflow project and i'll go look at it siraj of all his channel is is is pretty good for that kind of stuff you have a lot of topics got it um but i mean a lot of other channels have good stuff too so there's actually one exactly one recognition i want to make actually so yeah start with python but um i actually started so i knew python but uh this site helped me out a lot when actually creating image my first machine learning project and there was this right here and this was my friends was completely for free it's a udacity udacity course okay udacity course uh called intro to machine learning it's a free course right right here it's a freak you might say that again hello the audience here though it sounded it sounded echoey i don't know if they heard you no i think they heard me they heard me well so it's a free course introduction to machine learning um machine learning course really cool guys i learned a lot of stuff from here and actually i was able to apply a lot from here to my to my work and then actually from that work i was actually able to because of what i learned here i was able to um get a um transfer over to a a team in my work that would that deal dealt with ai machine learning so this was a real so this was some really cool stuff i definitely highly recommend you take take a look at this i'll actually drop that in the comments if you guys want to check this out yeah udacity is good udacity is really good yeah right here yeah this is the link guys so check this out guys okay um so yeah this is some really cool stuff guys honestly i think i think this can be the all the questions kind of we have for for today um that's it right yeah any kind of last words yeah i think that's it for now um yeah yeah no i'm just i'm looking at the the twitter or the dude the the the ceo from the the code builder thing there is one question i want i want to answer i think birds we like asked the question i have great love for web development but my teachers are pressuring me to learn mlai so what would i what should i do what do i say one more time so i have a great love for web development but my teachers are pressuring me to learn machine learning or ai what should i do oh i mean i mean it really depends what you want to do machine learning and stuff it there is the jobs are harder to get but they are higher paying but there are less of them uh versus web development they're a little bit not always easier but they're a little bit simpler to get started with uh there's also more jobs and more opportunities and it's not as math heavy there's like a lot of like um it's more business oriented i feel like data science machine learning is more engineering and research oriented so it kind of depends like what you want to go into like don't like if somebody's pressuring you on anything dude just don't listen to them unless you like like deeply respect like the path that they took and where they are in life yeah uh other than that like i don't like it doesn't matter like like half my professors if they told me something something i'd be like i don't care like because i don't like i don't care what they what they have to say but other person professors that i respect if they said something i would actually listen to it so just kind of make that judgment call yourself uh don't just blindly listen to them web development is more for like business applications and stuff uh and then data science is more for i mean there's business too i mean like youtube has an algorithm netflix has an algorithm uh that needs to be worked on and stuff but uh just focus on web development if that's what you like i would say i would say focus on that yeah i think that my answer to that would be similar if you specifically like web development right if you're supposed to if you like about development it's it's good to broaden your knowledge and web development there's nothing wrong with that right you shouldn't just switch right away what i love about development in general is it's so broad there's so much you can learn there's so much you can know if i was in your shoes for example what i would do is i know i love web development i'm going to increase my knowledge about development i know the opportunity is there i know my love for it i love the fact that i know the fact that i can make some good money out of it right and i'm going to so i'm going to put a lot of my time into that maybe let's say 70 but for example let's say there's a lot of interest in machine learning at the same time so maybe you can put 30 of your work now into machine learning and then kind of you know and try and try different things and and learn different things right not there's nothing that comes to say that you can't learn both you can still learn both it's just that you can go ahead and maybe and um you know pursue what you like initially which is web development but you know also have the machine learning kind of on the side is kind of there because who knows maybe machine learning will become the next the biggest thing and and at that point you will be ready at that point you'll be ready and you're like maybe well maybe at some point you realize that you do like machine learning a lot because you've been doing it quite a bit and you like what's going on with machine learning and you like what type of applications you can make and so at that point you can simply just switch or just you know keep doing both so i would say yeah that'd be my answer for that yeah what yep yep yep guys awesome guys i think that's all we have for today all i gotta say guys is like i said subscribe this youtube channel guys you were amazing on today's live call amazing chats amazing quite amazing comments and you were very friendly and we really appreciate that from all of you so much love absolutely i much love to you guys and obviously thank you much for those greatly appreciate it appreciate all of our viewers and audience yes i hope you guys like this right i mean yeah just me nas bickering as usual oh yeah next thing you know we'll have a dance competition or we'll have like i don't know we'll have a running competition because aaron thinks he's so good at running so um we'll see about that i never i never said that yeah you did yeah you did but anyways guys all i had to say is hope you have a great day and we will see well hope you have a great day this is nas and aaron aaron aaron i'm sorry i zoned out for a second what's up guys this is not this is not a programmer this is nazi nazi's dad that's what it is and we will see you in the next video peace out guys have a great day
