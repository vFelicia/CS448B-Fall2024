hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I wanted to talk about being dangerous and not in danger this concept is inspired by Grant Cardone who is somebody I follow and he's one of the top 10 most influential CEOs of all time unbelievable personality should follow him and I was reading his book be obsessed or be average which is another thing I want to talk about too many people in this world are just okay with being average and the part that sucks is that they have the potential to not to be average and I'm not just talking about from everything is perfect and the sky is amazing and everything is unbelievable I mean actually from like I know people genuinely who are very talented very skilled and undersell themselves and also people who will refuse to be more helpful to other people so today for example I went to my bank I have a few bank accounts some of them happen to be at Chase and then at Bank of America and I went to chase and I chases a great Bank unbelievable I've had great customer service with them but today in particular I talked with one of their people and I had a question and after I asked him this question this person this guy he would not even try to help me like after I asked the question he pretty much said sorry he pretty much said oh wow I really wish I could I could help you you know but it's just uh it's just kind of my hand out of my hands and I'm like hey hey look I'm just asking you for your advice if you could just think outside the box here for a second and just give me a tip here because that's why I really came I know I could have just done this online but I'm actually looking for a little bit of an opinion here and it would be really helpful he just says uh you know I would love to help you but you know maybe maybe go to Bank of America and you can talk with them I'm like how would that be any different then he says you know to be honest uh you could Google nowadays Google is unbelievable and it's always surprising the kind of stuff I can find up there so and I'm just looking at this guy in his eyes like are you actually serious right now like I I don't know Google and how that works and I didn't bought like do you know how condescending and patronizing you're being by talking like that to your customer but when I was sitting there I didn't say anything I said okay no problem um like how about even just point me in the right direction have me talk to a manager just say hey look man I don't have this information go to this person like a lot of this house what I find is people will do exactly what it says like in the bullet points of their job description and then just not do anything outside of it whereas they can provide so much value if you guys watched the route and a rejection challenged by this guy who did a TED talk on it he would do he would ask crazy things to people at customer service or any random people to do crazy things that he wanted them to say no so he could get rejected and recorded but he went to this one Dunkin Donuts and asked her hey once you're done making these Donuts for me can you put him in an Olympic shaped rings and she looked at him and she went in this deep deliberate thought for like 510 minutes and she actually was brainstorming ways these crazy ways how she can actually do this for him and ultimately she took 20 or 30 extra minutes and she gave him Olympic shaped Donuts do you think that's part of her job description do you think it actually says when did they're hiring her in the interviewing process like we're gonna hire you for X dollars an hour one of your job descriptions is to actually make Olympic shape donuts no that was not part of it but she still went and did it see I think people have the ability to do things that are beyond your scope but it always starts with I can't versus how can I and that's one of my videos I think that's actually going those launched recently so check it out I can't versus how can I too many people do that to them that guy he could have been more helpful like look if you don't have to answer right up in here and you can't give me an answer like this is fine how about you problem solved with me like a human being that's what I do with people like there are many times where I don't know the answer but I have never given up on the person I will spend like if the call ends and I couldn't help that person I will find a solution and then call you back a few days later when I'm working with clients and if I can't get their business and they said no I will spend days and weeks figuring out how can I provide a service for them that is so valuable for them like what's their perspective here and I would keep coming back with counter proposals and there have been some crazy times where these clients were just gone and I was able to work with them again it goes beyond like money or whatever for me I have to solve the problem and give my utmost best when I'm and when I'm at work or really doing anything so stop being average because of that right be obsessed with what you're doing and overcome being average you guys have the fortitude to do that by just trying to think outside of the box all right guys that was my thought for the day that was my rant of the day thank you guys for watching thank you guys for listening I appreciate you love you guys were about
