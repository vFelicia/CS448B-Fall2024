yo what's up fam it's been a minute since we've done a video on something like this but i wanted to talk to you about how to actually make money with coding and this is something i used to talk a lot about on the channel before but then after a while you know i kind of stopped talking about it because i just felt like people were like cause he's just talking too much about money and whatever and so we just need to code so then i just like shut up and i'm like whatever we're just gonna make videos on projects and tutorials and hopefully everybody's gonna stop complaining about me talking about money but today i'm going to bring that back and i will talk about how to actually make money with coding because like it or not it is the reason why a lot of people work yes you do want to do a job that really matters of course that makes sense but the primary reason for a lot of why we work so we can make money so then we get options and freedom to do whatever we want so in this video that's what we're going to talk about smash that like button before we get started by the way right before we get into this video i do want to give a huge shout out to crypto.com and thank you so much

understand there are a ton of youtubers out there that are talking about how to actually make money with coding online it's nothing new and everything almost everything under the sun that's been covered but i'm gonna try to provide it from my point of view as a developer who's went from making a thousand dollars a month to three thousand dollars a month eventually making five thousand dollars a month to ten thousand dollars a month and then eventually having a channel and scaling that up to a hundred thousand dollars a month and beyond so hopefully that'll give you some interesting insights mixed with tips on programming and software development along with tips on just business acumen and things of that nature so let's talk about the most obvious way to make money as a developer and let's start with that so the most obvious way to make money as a developer is you become good enough through a degree without a degree you go and apply and you get a job and you become a fulltime developer or whatever okay that's a great way that's the most obvious way then there are a lot of other ways right so you can just go get a fulltime job become a fulltime developer but i think that what are the nuances that you can have within that and that's what really matters and i want to talk about those things too so if you're applying as a developer think about it there's so many other people that are also applying as a developer and it there is a huge commodity and then you're competing against people in pakistan india sri lanka kenya ghana all these different places that i even hire a lot of my developers from because you can't compete with them they're better than you they work harder than you their work ethic is better they're not as entitled and they charge way less so it makes sense and a lot of people do that a lot of companies do that and i think that's why freelancing becomes really hard but in u.s if you're getting a fulltime job they are looking for people in the us and let's talk about why they're doing that a lot of the times primarily they're looking for developers who also have good communication skills because that's one of the problems that i run into when i'm hiring somebody that's the problem that i see communication is often lacking when we hire somebody overseas so thing number one that's really important for you to keep in mind is communication skills that skill alone can actually make you really stand out even against other better developers because while you might not be as good of a developer we won't have communication problems and therefore in the long run you'll actually be a better developer working on my team okay and that's how a lot of employers think as well so something to keep in mind second thing how do you stand out and not just be a commodity well think about doing something that's harder right so i'll give you an example if you're somebody who can offer cleaning services for somebody right that's really good but a lot of people could do that and so that's a commodity you have to compete at pricing oftentimes on that now think about people who make so that's why those people also make a lot less money now think about who is making a lot of money surgeons and people who are doctors because it's hard to replace what they do this is very difficult so there are very few people who can become doctor go through that rigorous training be that adapt at medical field understanding all the vocabulary in the medical field and then being able to diagnose each patient differently or perform a heart surgery and so when you become very rare you start making a lot more income simply because you're much more in demand one of the biggest areas right now you can crush it as a developer is if you started heading into the blockchain world right the web 3 world i wanted to tell you guys a story and maybe i'll do that in another video but even my friend nas he's doing a bunch of stuff you guys remember him from the channel before and now he's doing a bunch of stuff with nfts and things like that and just one client that he worked with paid 25 000 and that project took him maybe a month to do that is insane no regular developer would even think of that level of money unless they were working at netflix google big four and then they had a high level position too really high level position it's not that it doesn't exist there are opportunities but you have to spot them and then you have to like find a way to fall in love with them and then get good at them and that's what makes it difficult and so if you can find those opportunities and spot them and become good at them then you have a very amazing and lucrative career opportunity in front of you and so i highly recommend you think about i want to become a developer because i enjoy it so that's really important i am willing to work my ass off and work incredibly hard and that's really important but then also what's really important is the niche that you fall into so if you're a developer that can help develop on ethereum or solana or one of these chains you're going to be much more sought after than a regular developer and even developers with only one or two years of experience and ethereum land they're making over a hundred thousand dollars a year whereas in a regular frontend developer that'd be really hard because you can find so many people and i experienced a similar thing so we wanted a higher uh we wanted a higher smart contract developers and every time we hired them they were so hard to find and even when we found somebody even with months of experience they we we paid them like five times more than a developer that we found that was like a frontend developer because there's the competition is just so crazy and so they don't get paid as much because it's a commodity and so you just have to think about it right what do you pick what do you choose what do you stick with and what do you grow on a lot of the videos that we're making right now on the channel are blockchain related and that's the primary reason why we're making them because that will give you a much bigger opportunity if you tap into the blockchain space to grow your skill set to grow your income and to have a much more lucrative career as a developer because that's so sought after right now and there's such a huge demand for it and so much of the world is moving into the blockchain slash crypto space so that's one of the things to really keep in mind here's another crazy thing to think about in the blockchain space and this is a huge opportunity and this is something actually i wanted to chase with my team but i think it's something that maybe i would want to do in the future because right now i do want to focus on growing this channel and just providing a lot of free valuable content out there for you guys but here's a big opportunity and it has to do with the web 3 bounties so in the crypto world a lot of companies are offering what they call bounties right so harmony wallet or harmony one wallet had this notion page that i don't know if we could find it or not they're offering 20 million dollars for people to build different parts of what they're looking for their web app and their mobile app and for example they're giving away seven million dollars in just the front end and they go hey if you can make this front end for our web app and let's say you can make the web app look like coinbase or you could make the mobile app look like coinbase they're willing to give you two million dollars for that if you can help set the get them a solid back end they might pay three million dollars for that if you want to focus more on the security aspect and help them integrate security they're willing to pay three to five million for that and the money in this space is so nuts because every single investor is just pouring their money into this a16z andreessen horowitz and a ton of other investors and so they are okay with giving away disproportionate amounts of money to incentivize you to help them build something because if they can move faster they can essentially dominate the market because everybody is like gonna lead and dominate the market if they move fast on this opportunity if they don't move fast then somebody else is going to come and eat them up so they see the opportunity to go and raise massive amounts of capitalist startups and then they're willing to go and distribute it so you could take a month or two months hunting this bounty and you could get maybe if you don't get two million dollars you get a hundred thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars twenty five thousand dollars even if you get ten thousand dollars think about that's one month of work or two months of work and is that worth it and it could be really worth it and really significant so web 3 bounties is a massive opportunity i would highly recommend you look into them also obviously if that wasn't clear what i've been saying right now web 3 jobs are also a massive opportunity okay so those are some of the different ones that i think not a lot of people are talking about those are massive ones but i'll go over some other ones that are more kind of obvious than other people have talked about too freelancing is a big one for example if you freelance but if you do it in a different way kind of like i'm sharing with you i think you have much higher opportunities as a freelancer you can make money right and with coding another one that's interesting that not a lot of people talk about is tutoring so you could go on platforms like yzant or takelessons.com or some other ones people will people will pay you to teach them coding and i bet if you could teach people solidity or rust they will pay you twice or three times as much to teach them so let's say that with regular coding you could charge a hundred dollars an hour or fifty dollars an hour if you're teaching somebody solidity you could charge seventy five hundred two hundred three hundred dollars an hour and i bet there are a lot of people willing to pay that so they could learn solidity or rust any of the blockchain web 3 programming languages other ways you can do this and make money is of course you could start your own startup or you can launch your own sas business that's much much harder there's luck involved there's a ton of skill involved and there's a whole like you have to fully learn business and so not everybody's going to have a knack for that obviously that's one of the best places and one of the most lucrative places you know because then you can launch a company like phantom wallet or metamask or something like that and have millions of users and then the world is your oyster essentially that's really hard and rare and so i would say at least build some level of experience as a software developer because to be honest to start a sas company you're not gonna if you don't have background as a software developer you're just gonna throw your money away and not make anything successful and yeah it'll be terrible so i wouldn't start a startup and a sas company on if you don't know software development unless you have a ton of money and you can blow it and not worry about it and you're okay with losing that then you can take a try on it if you don't know software development and you don't have a lot of money i would never recommend starting a sas startup that would be really hard but of course you could try it i don't want to discourage anybody the other one is content creation as a developer which is what i do which is what a ton of other people do whether it's joma tech or programming with mosh or whoever is out there right all these content creators as developers it's very simple generally they make videos that help a ton of people think of us like glorified teachers we are essentially teachers we love teaching i love teaching and we're sharing this with people and then if you get a following big enough you could sell a course you can monetize it with youtube or you could do kind of a little bit of what we're doing which is we're going hey we'll keep a lot of stuff for you for free but then we'll go charge these companies to teach their technology or train you on them and then it's a winwin for everybody the companies win you win and you guys get a ton of free content so it's doesn't matter how you set up your business model you could even do it where you have your channel and then you just like tutor people because you're starting to get a ton of tutoring clients whatever the case may be so when you have your own channel when you ever when you have your own source the amount that what what you could do with it is infinite having a brand is really it's definitely one of the most valuable things you could do but again not everybody enjoys that and that's not everybody's cup of tea but obviously doing content creation is a huge opportunity for developers and a lot of developers have taken to that right traversing media fire ship coder coder and a lot of the coding community i mean forgetting their name that guy that made the stock trading video cal uh cali haldon yeah the list of developer coding channel goes on so those are some of the ways that i've listed out and just to kind of recap talked about freelancing tutoring web three bounties a fulltime job startups and content creation as a dev so we really talked about six different ways my main takeaway for you is don't be a commodity learn something that's more niche that'll make your life a lot easier focus on communication skills because that helps you stand out and that's how you can provide a ton more value in the market and that's how you could charge a ton of more money and then whether you go freelancing or full time those will all give you uh really good chances of being able to make significant amount of money as a developer while enjoying your career again i just want to make sure right you understand none of this is easy this all requires tremendous amount of hard work so understand that you should i'm not going to say must but i'm just going to say you should love it to a certain extent because if you don't i know too many people who are in nighty field that are absolutely miserable with their lives and hate them so i don't want you to be one of them i want you to love your life enjoy your life and make good money as a developer that's it for me i hope
