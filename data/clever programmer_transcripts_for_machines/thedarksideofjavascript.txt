look normally i'm always talking to you about the fun stuff with coding javascript what's possible for you how you can actually get those dream jobs and make all of those things happen today that's not what i'm here to talk to you about today i want to talk to you about some of the harsh realities and the real truths behind the world of coding and what it actually takes for you to succeed and why a lot of you will actually fail in your pursuit of becoming a developer or getting a job as a developer and why many of you will actually quit today i want to talk about the dark side of javascript the dark side of coding in general and give you the real tools you actually need because if you understand these hard truths things that seem so difficult right now and hard to hear but if you actually understand these these will help you succeed in the long run i promise all right so i'm gonna go through these and i hope that you get value out of this and learn so right before we jump into this video i want you to do me a favor just go ahead and smash that like button so this video just starts going on to more people so turn it into that blue thing okay and once that happens we're good to go can't subscribe to the channel because this is a channel where we talk about all things javascript react and full stack development cool all right so let's just chat about this right what is this dark side of javascript what are we talking about here so a few things i want to talk about why a lot of people fail is most people think that they can just go through tutorial after tutorial and once they do that once they just go in this like weird cycle of watching this tutorial right here then watching another one right here and then watching another one right here you'll feel like you're making progress and then actually what's happening is you're just going in these circles and you're not actually making the forward progress you want to make you're not going in the straight line that you want to be going in okay so we don't want this blob of mess what we actually want is that straight path where you're actually making progress okay and this happens for a lot of you and a lot of you are stuck in that and a lot of you don't know how to get out of that a lot of you have trouble writing actual code from scratch i know this because even when we were doing a the live boot camp that we recently did a lot of you came in and you know when we asked you these questions everybody's hands went up we had like 500 people live and we asked you do you feel stuck in coding do you have problems when you have to do things from scratch and literally everybody's hands went up right so when that happens that means it's a problem and we need to actually do something to resolve it so a couple of things i want to talk about okay you are not going to succeed in the world of coding if you're not putting in time okay so i like to always start off with this i will keep coming back to this because it's a skill skills don't necessarily have that much leverage like you can't have you can't hire another person and then have them just learn the skill and you get the benefit it doesn't work like that because if it did i'd have like i'd hire like 10 bodybuilders and then just have them work on their body and then mine would start growing you know but it doesn't work like that it's there's no leverage there for me which means i have to actually put in that time i have to put in those hours i have to wake up early i have to put in the work and acquire that skill so understand that um okay let's just say coding is a skill and it takes time slash hours okay of course some people are going to naturally be better at it than you are okay there were some there's some people who are genetically wired for this and you're not gonna beat them you're not going to beat those people they're people who do the google freaking if you go on youtube right now there are these kids who are 17 year olds and they're winning the first place in some crazy google competition they will beat everybody they were wired for scientific thinking mathematical concepts engineering software development there were wired for that okay so there are going to be always some people that are better than you at this but one thing that is in your control and the reason why i talk about look at coding as a skill or javascript as a skill because a lot of the results you're gonna get are based on the time and hours that you put in okay and um here's how i describe it right so for example if it's about time and hours this is why they even say you know if you put in 10 000 hours into something you can be a professional cool now just to put it in perspective what that really means is if you put in 10 hours per day into javascript okay and to learn in coding you put in 10 hours per day well uh generally you know you're not going to go for 30 days a month because there's always something that happens so you're not always going to go 30 days per month all right so instead what will likely happen is let's just say you do it for 20 days a month okay discounting for weekends some other time you know downtime family time blah blah okay so you do it 10 hours 20 days per month and if we multiply that by you know 12 12 12 times because there's 12 months the whole year what you actually get is let's write that down here this is going to be about 2400 hours okay so if you did 10 hours of coding 20 days a month for 12 months you would have 2 400 hours of coding under your belt when you have this hour this many hours of coding there there's certain things just to statistically work even if you're slower than other people even if your math isn't that strong you're going to get to a certain level of competence and this level of competence in the job world see i'm from the chess world so we have elo systems and we have ratings right for example you'll have people have a rating of 600 when you start like my girlfriend just started playing chess she just learned the rules she's probably a 600. i've never seen anybody that was under a 600 okay then you can go up to a thousand uh club players are about like 1200 rated then you have you know 2 000 as an expert i'm about two thousand and then you have these like freaks who are 24 25 hundreds they're called ims okay and then you have the gm's in chess and then past gm's so let's go here they're like 2700 um 2600 and then past gm's is like 2700 they're super gms and that's pretty much the highest you can ever achieve in chess you know 2830 whatever was the top rating carlson has ever had magnus carlsen is the number one player in the world so what i like about this elo system is it's very accurate so where i would put you on this elo system and and how it works is the first ratings are really easy to get going from 600 to 1000 might take you let's say two months of solid focus in chess but going from let's say 1600 to 2000 might take you four years okay and for me to go from 2000 to like 2500 might take me like 10 years or five years of just like focused fulltime work so it gets progressively harder for for a lot of you you know after you put in 24 2400 hours into coding i would i would say that you get to about 1200 rated or 1400 rated player okay and salary wise what this might equate to is a junior developer making about let's say 60 000 plus okay that's i think what that might equate to now um so just out of curiosity you know where would you place yourself on this scale i i know i put it in hours but as a junior developer generally no skills uh like apis you know skills like backend development frontend development you know how to deal with the database like firebase mysql you know how to deal with the frontend you know how to use react to build webbased components forms logins user authentication things of that nature okay now so yeah maybe comment below what rating you think you are because i would like to get a sense of where you guys are all at and be honest the people who are the worst usually i call them i have a term i call it the cafeteria champions okay these are the people that think they're the best in chess but they've never competed actually they've never actually been to real competitions so for example you know i love my dad but he falls under this category and they just beat the people that are nearby them or maybe they're your uh friendly school cafeteria beating everybody there okay so i call them cafeteria champions and they're generally rated about a thousand or under okay my dad is about a thousand or under that i you know not trying to knock on my dad i love my dad i learned chess from him and i actually started playing because of him and started competing because of him and one of my goals was to get as good as him one day so that's where a lot of so yeah so you know but cafeteria champions think they're like 2500s you know and that's how you can spot a cafeteria champion they'll often be like oh i'm the best you know nobody can beat me i'm so good so don't be a cafeteria champion be real okay be real the good players are often like oh i suck i'm 1200 and they're usually beasts you know they're a little beat most people they'll be like i'm um 1800 the more the better you get it the more you like even in jiu jitsu and fighting the better you get at fighting the more you realize how badass everybody else is because there's always somebody better than you at the jujutsu gym so people who are actual fighters they pick the least amount of fights because they know that there are levels to this so same thing so put a rating that you actually think you are genuinely and put a you know put your skill level and whatever okay so that's that's kind of what would happen if you put in 2 400 hours um i think if you put in 10 000 hours then you start to get to this this area between you know the 2000 and plus area and that's where things explode that's when you become disproportional right so for example yesterday in chess i broke 2100 which means in bullet chess and it said that i was better than 93 percent of the population um and there were 340 000 bullet players that just played last week so that means that i was better than 315 000. when you fall into that category that's when things explode because majority of the world is behind you now you actually have a very real competitive edge when you're playing a game of skill and you're not playing a game of leverage you're not trying to grow a business you're trying to grow your value as a developer to a company then you have that you can't you can't skip skill it doesn't matter how good your soft skills are it doesn't matter how great of a human being you are it doesn't matter how great your personality is how likable you are if you don't have your skill you're just there's nothing like if i'm building a team of chess and we're going to compete i'm not gonna take anybody that's under a thousand or two thousand that's not gonna happen it doesn't matter if a thousand comes up to me and they're like hey but i'm a nice person i don't care that's great but it doesn't matter you need a certain level of competency to hang around and and be with us otherwise you can't be there right so in the world of coding and software development you have to have a certain level of competency otherwise it's nothing it doesn't mean anything it's meaningless cool so but once you get into that 93 now you're into the top percentile of the world now beautiful things start happening now what happens is that your salaries are going to start being disproportional too okay so for example this is an average salary of an average developer which most of you will go on to become how do i know just because statistically speaking most of you are going to be average all right that's just that's what that's the definition of average okay and then there are going to be very few of you that are going to be disproportionately bad or disproportionately really great and my hope is that you fall in that disproportionately great category because when you join that category now beautiful things start to happen instead of a 60 000 average salary you start breaking into the 90k or the 100 k salaries okay and if you're really talking about 93 well in the world of development what that actually looks like is between 200 000 to 300 000 that's what happens when you become that's what happens when you get into this this this range the 2100 range the 93 range and it's not farfetched i'm not making random up netflix engineers friend developers make 300 000. snapchat software developers made 250. um so that's what's required but that's but the dark side is the amount of hours you're willing to put in the amount of hours you're willing to sacrifice away from friends away from sometimes even family members away from the people that you love but that's why you really have to have a passion for it where you have to enjoy it to the point where you're willing to actually do that you know because if you're not you're not going to get into that category and then just don't have those goals like don't have fake goals that's where unhappiness comes from when you have goals that you you think like when you think you're 2100 and you tell yourself you are but then you're like why am i not making 300k you start to go crazy that's where unhappiness comes from but if you know that your ambition is of a 1200 and you know currently you're at a thousand and you know when you get to 1200 you'll be happy with the 60 000 salary then just focus on being happy and then do that make sure your ambitions match where you want to get to okay because then you actually will have a happy life but the the truth is that the people who are winning and becoming great they're just spending ridiculous amount of time coding and i will tell this to all of you you know especially the ones of you that are older that are you know 30 and beyond you're not that old but i'm saying older right not not a 10 year old or a 14 year old because when you're 10 14 15 18 it's really easy to just go all in as you start to get older you have a lot of responsibilities in your life which makes it difficult but you still have to find ways okay and if you can do 10 hours find something that works i'm not saying you won't make it okay but what i am saying is that it'll take longer all right it'll just take longer and that's really uh that's really it but if you become really good if you become disproportionately good you will get disproportionately good results okay that's where that's where the level of skill matters and the skill is developed well you know just like uh for bodybuilding your muscles are developed based on the time under tension right you're doing the curls and it's just that the time under the tension that's what that's where the software development skill comes in the time under tension of your brain being flexed and you thinking in your problem solving okay so if i got rid of all of this right and we had something like this let's say okay let's just say this is somebody's career this is an average person's career this is a below average person's career and then this is a above average person's career okay really the biggest differentiation here this these gaps here okay and these gaps here for majority of the times majority of the times the one reproducible thing you can boil this down to is hours that's it yes there are other factors like intelligence there are other factors like what they did previously there are other factors that are part of this you know if somebody went to mit or freaking harvard and just had better education it'll help to have that as when they come into these things they'll have better design ways of thinking about this they'll have an advantage that's true 100 true for example if people who've done who were farmers their whole lives or who are construction workers or who are basketball players you know when they go in my one rep max of a deadlift after years and years and years and years and years of training is 305 but a basketball player who's been playing basketball and never lifted weights goes in they just start off with the 250 or 315 pound deadlift so why because they did things that that moved them forward in that direction right so they're more likely to be good at those things so here that little difference that i'm highlighting this here and this here just boils down to hours majority of the times take taking away a lot of the other advantages hours will help you overcome almost any of the problems if you're a lot dumber than somebody else if you just put in more hours you will become smarter than them and you will solve the things that they were having struggle that they they were struggling with okay um if somebody grasps something in an hour and it takes you three hours but if you spend now four hours now you'll have at the three hour mark you'll match their understanding and at the fourth hour mark you will surpass their understanding and you will be now in the next level of understanding so these are key differentiators now i'm not saying learning in an intelligent way isn't going to help you practicing being mindful having a good learning strategy all of those are of course going to help you but learning is just one of those things that it does take time and a lot of effort and hours whether you're trying to learn soccer or ping pong whatever it is okay if you can get coaching then great you get super charged if you get coaching then these hours that you put in are maximized which means the results you would get in four hours now you get in two okay and what this basically means is there's a difference of hours here okay in this lower category between you know let's say below average and me mediocre and average and then above average right excellent so in this in this category right here there is a difference of hours but there's also a difference of salaries for example uh this person here probably makes 30k a year this person here probably makes 60k a year and then this person here probably makes 180k a year okay it's it's crazy but once you get good you take over like look at the look at the job okay let me put it this way look at how businesses are structured the business that wins first place just eats every other business like eats all of them when somebody becomes the number one in the market think for example amazon in online ecommerce nobody comes to even close they're just wiped out like if amazon is doing a trillion then they're the second person is doing a billion okay it's it's just it's the magnitudes of orders of difference so with with becoming disproportionately good you get disproportionately great results okay and the key differentiator between those salaries between this salary this salary this salary one reproducible thing one thing that you we all have under our control is ours and the people that are putting in more time more effort more energy more hours are getting the bigger results so that's one key thing now you can have extraordinary results right you can have this curve here like a like a hockey thing this weird hockey thing right and this hockey thing can happen when you are putting in hours um i think about it like this when i was getting better at chess and learning chess there were other people uh like like for example let's take a wonder who i played and he was this kid that had to stand on top of this little sixyearold that beat me at the time when i was a 2000 rated player i was at my peak and i was crushing everybody and i was ferocious he would stand up on his chair play me because he was so chubby and cute and fat and short he couldn't like reach the pieces so he would stand up on his chair to reach across play the moves and he completely annihilated me and beat me i was like what the hell is happening at that point i had spent six years in practicing and learning chess and at that time he was six years old so he couldn't have spent six years he probably only spent two or three years but was he much smarter than i am or that i was i don't think so i think i was way smarter than him in a lot of things in life like i pretty sure he didn't know about taxes he couldn't do math to save his life he did not understand algebra or calculus like the way that i did you know i was working on differential equations at the time he had no idea about that there were just so many things i was absolutely crushing him in you know um and i just couldn't understand how he beat me so at that point i don't think it was ours at that point it was something else and then something else was he was getting coached by some of the best trainers on the planet and these trainers themselves were like 2600 rated plus you know there were grand masters his dad was coaching him in chess all the time and his dad was a strong player and then his dad had connections to all the best coaches in the world and they would train him and he was getting this incredible training combined with the hours of training so it was leveraged hours leveraged hours and he just got ridiculous results and he beat everybody and now he's on track to be you know maybe even possibly the world's strongest player but now he's a grand master he's a 2600 rated player and when he met me you know when he beat me was like 2100 200 something along those lines so that's the key when you're trying to win hours are going to be a huge leverage and then the other leverage is strategic planning strategic thinking okay that's going to put you way over the top and give you this huge advantage okay that's what happens with all the students that join our coding bootcamp you know for people who are watching from the outside it's like hey how are these students getting these results it doesn't make that much sense how is somebody getting you know a job for 40k 50k 70k 80k in less than seven months in less than eight months we just had our fourth student get a job from our boot camp full stack mastery keep in mind none of the cohorts are finished yet and we have students getting jobs and we just had josh his name is joshua he just landed a job with a company with a crypto company actually which is super interesting so we're providing like the most insane results of any boot camp and we're not funded and we don't have hundreds of millions of dollars behind us we don't have hundreds of hundreds of instructors running the boot camp so how is this happening well it's simple we make sure that a student put in the hours if they don't put in the hours we don't let them in the boot camp we don't let them in the program you can't even be in because you're bound to fail you're bound to be this thirty thousand dollar or twenty thousand dollar person we don't wanna work with you because we don't wanna get you below mediocre results we get you below mediocre results and it makes our program looks bad look bad so we want to be in the category where we're producing these like high achievers like oh wonders that kid's name was a wonder we want to we want to help produce these people here the the freaks of nature and to produce the freaks of natures you have to have people who are already committed and willing to put in ridiculous amount of hours and work and all of that but then you give them strategic planning and then they get what we call leveraged hours and when you get leveraged hours now your hours are not proportional compared to an average person your average your hours have this like weird hockey stick disproportional results that that they provide um and it's in this hockey stick growth where winners are formed and the tick over the market because they're the top 93 percent right so we don't want to produce club players that are eleven hundreds and that's it we want to produce players or like two thousand plus okay 2600 2800 that takes years and years of time so it's possible that these students can get to there too so that's why i just say 2000 plus okay because once they're done with us we get them to that like 93 percent best we get them to where they can beat over most of the people their first jobs are going to be around this much and the reason is because they're looking to get experience get their foot in the door but once they have their foot in the door they're well poised to be getting very high paying jobs afterwards and break those six figure marks right a lot of the students at clever programmer have broken that six figure mark a lot a lot of students i mean we had some students that landed a contract for 325 000 python contract uh this guy started working for a big corporation and doing automation for them with python he landed that contract 325 000. think about that 325 000 contract one contract right so those are the freaks and we're interested in producing freaks okay that's really our goal um yeah so those were the thoughts on my mind that's kind of the dark side of coding that's the dark side of javascript that's the dark side of the actual truth that not a lot of people talk about they want you to believe in like you can do this and it's so easy and you can just have this like remote perfect life and is all of those things while they're there there's amount of truth to them and coding is amazing don't get me wrong there's a lot of freedom in it and it's an amazing thing but if they're not telling you how hard it is and how many hours you actually have to put in they're just trying to sell you some and it's bull it's okay so just keep that in mind all right keep that in mind this is very important other than that i hope you enjoyed the video alright and if you want to get these leveraged hours and you want to get incredible results and you want to be the cream of the crop and you want to be the 2000 plus rated players click the button below and we'll have a way for you to book a call okay we have our coding bootcamps called full stack mastery we produce the best results for people out there hands down we're not funded and because we're smaller cohorts we can work with you so much more personally than any other bootcamp we can give you so much more handson training and guidance it's ridiculous and our instructors will out care any other program we have had it happen countless times where we have students or people who want to change careers that have found other coding bootcamps are going there and they quit those coding bootcamps and they come to ours they drop out of other even joshua was going to another coding boot camp and he stopped it continued hours and got results and he was going to a really famous big coding boot camp i'm not going to name names but he was going to a pretty big coding bootcamp okay so we work with you we get you incredible results we want to make sure that you're a good fit though because we don't want to take in people who are not going to be putting in the work and the time and the effort and the energy required to succeed okay but if you want to get those amazing results click the link below book a call with my team we're going to get on a call with you and we're gonna figure out exactly what your skill level is at exactly what your sticking points are what you need to actually succeed and um we're gonna see if you and we're a good fit for you and if we're not we'll give you a ton of value on the call we'll send you you know on your way but if it makes sense and we are a good fit for each other and the this program can work for you and you're going to be an amazing student then we'll let you know how we can go forward with that okay so if this is something that's interesting to you you want to join the best coding bootcamp on planet earth click the link below sign up for that call other than that that's it i hope you got value it's your boy qazi from cleverprogrammer and as always i'll see you in the next video
