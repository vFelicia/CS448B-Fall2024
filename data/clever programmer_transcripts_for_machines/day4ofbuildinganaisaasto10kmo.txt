day four of building an AI SAS to 10K a month so far we've made $ Z with this app the app that we're building takes YouTube videos and turns them into emails n spoke with an expert yesterday but that expert gave him a pretty complicated solution that involves chunking and Vector databases and I kind of disagree with that approach and I don't think it's going to work so let's call Nas and have a conversation with him about it bro the solution that you're coming up with I just feel like it's Overkill dude chunking and you guys are doing summarizing and like you're going to get back garbage dude bro I feel like you're not me I seriously you don't know what the talking about you think you know AI but you haven't learned we need to with these AI experts let just do this you do your way I do my my way and that's it so I got to work on trying to prove him wrong and started working on a model and Claw 3's Opus model gave me way better results than the GPT garbage that it was spewing so yeah suck it now if you want to be on this journey with us follow for day five
