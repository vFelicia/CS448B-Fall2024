and let's get things started all right loud and clear this cl stream is clear amazing awesome let's get it started so uh today we are as you guys remember yesterday i was live with qazi and we dropped down a airtable form down below in the description you guys can see it right now as well uh where you can request something whatever you want us to build for you and that's literally what's gonna happen today so i took a look so so i've taken a look at it and actually i picked one that i think would be an amazing thing uh for us to build here right now and that is actually going to be a redox um redux user authentication service or actually user authentication service with redux and we will just save the login data so basically a session management if we can say and there is something wrong with the uh stream because it's not streaming at the right place so okay now now we are getting there okay all right i'll wait a little bit because things are getting together finally um okay pranav says i really needed it amazing we have 20 people live i will wait a just a tad uh so everybody can get on we had some sort of technical stuff happening uh in the background with uh all this streaming fanciness so excuse me for that but we are live the clever programmer family never stops and we will get going in just a minute uh so this project this is not about the looks this is not about how it will turn out at the end honestly we will have two buttons and all the other stuff is going to be technical and seriously focused on redux and by the way uh if you guys want to we can do a q a session later on on clubhouse so actually feel free to join us on clubhouse every single day at 8 00 p.m no 8 a.m pacific time on clubhouse it is called coffee with developers by clever programmer we are going live there every single day answering your questions so make sure to ch uh check in there so we have ver uh we have a few viewers already amazing welcome everybody and i think we can soon get started are you guys excited let me know in the chat and punch that like button like like that so let me know if you guys are interested in today's session so we can get started all right uh what is this all but i don't know anything about redux i am a flutter developer so redox is actually a state management thing uh state management tool for um dang those went together okay like that so uh redux is actually a state management tool for react so this is more for uh web development purposes but you are welcome here and whenever you are uh developing the web feel free to use redux all right okay everybody is interested amazing i see all the comments coming in yes all right let's get this started is redux similar to context api so in the core level it is similar but uh it's so much easier to use especially with this uh library that i'm about to show how to use with so be sure to make get excited about that because this is super beginner friendly anybody can learn it but i'm here to teach you so you don't have to waste your time on it it kind of took me a good two hours to figure it out but yeah okay everybody is interested amazing i see the chat is blowing up so that's good and all right guys please make sure not to spam the chat because i will just ban you i don't like getting it cluttered all right so with that said i will go ahead share my screen and okay it should be live and we're good okay we got we got mozart in the house dope all right so you guys see this is the folder that i will be working in and i have a terminal open i hope this is actually easy to read for you guys and i don't know if you like the music in the background but anyways uh this is what we will be uh this is where we will start you uh start building this redux thing so one thing that i want to share with you is how easy a redux application is so you just want to go ahead type in just like if it was a create react app we will do the exact same thing so we will type in npx create react app space dot because i want this to be in that specific folder where i'm at right now and i would just hit dash dash template and redux and that's it it will go ahead and create a redux up for us so that's super easy let's wait for it just a little uh right now i am actually using yarn most people use npm for their package management it's there is not too much of a difference uh basically yarn is so much faster that i highly recommend everybody goes ahead and uses that instead of npm so that's just a little thing and amana please let me know if there is some sort of issues and by the way huge shout out to omanath he is in the background and making sure everything is working perfectly and we are on actually a call uh so he can let me know if something's up so give a huge applause for him all right amazing okay we got some positive vibes in the comments let's go that's amazing to see all right do you have to do anything like npmi g redux for begin nope not at all not at all uh this will know its thing you don't have to install anything beforehand um so that's all you have to do npx create react app uh dash dash template redux that's all you need to do all right amazing let me go ahead and quickly drink a bit all right yeah i'm on nothing day in the comments let's go all right amazing so what we will do like this is this is all we all we got like i think it's pretty uh like you guys know this this is how you build a reactor if you haven't worked with the react this might be a kind of like a next level for you but don't worry about that uh we have all the content for react on this uh channel and we will actually drop a react for beginners um type of sort of um content but and please please make sure that only communicate in english in the chat because yeah and we got this question is redux the same to react or what no it's not it's actually an extension to uh react so you know hooks right you know you state right you will start using redux once the uh once the use state is not good enough right so what i want you guys to understand is let me actually go ahead and do this and this all right so uh hold on a second what i will do is i i'll just start uh drawing some stuff here so you know we got this whole application going on over here actually let's go ahead and move everything away from this window so we got the whole application happening on uh on this side right and we have the app component on the top right so that's the app and down here we may we might have some sort of uh log in component i'm just throwing random stuff there we also have say uh cart if it was some sort of ecommerce application and we also have a product or something let's just stick with the uh components let's just stick with the ecommerce maybe here there is a checkout check out so you see like this is how a react app actually does work like we have all these levels and all these components and they uh they go like this but um so and the way you work with props is you can go from from here from app and go to login go to cart go to products go and actually go to checkout by going to cart and then check out right so you can drill these props down there this is something what we call prop drilling and you can do that right and with some hacks you can even go the other way so you can pass props up a level but there is no way that you can uh pass props on the same level and for that uh some people actually created the redux and that is actually a bubble around the application okay some sort of think of it like as a data layer right it's basically a data layer which contains all the global props pretty much global states right so that that's how you should be thinking about redux all right with that out of the way uh everything okay amanda okay hold on bro you got unmuted okay so is redox very important for react.js and react native developers it is not very very important but it is important so you need to be able to work with it and that's pretty much it all right so that said i'm going to go ahead and go back to the application so i already created the app and now i'm just going to open up a vs code in here so that's what we will be working with and i don't actually want to go crazy on the styling because it's more about just understanding the concept of redux um so that's that's something that happens okay all right i'm just gonna zoom in a little and nope we are not going to use any kind of map space or nothing like that we're just building a super simple how to get started with redux application and that's all okay all right it's clear amazing uh all right cool benefits of redux the benefit is that you can get a job mostly like there is so many more uh state management tool that is actually better than redux and even the creator of redux says you shouldn't always use it so right now it's on the on the top of the hype curve so the biggest benefit is that you can get a job in an easier way all right hey let's go so pytech solutions requested that today's video is brought to you by pytax solutions because he was the one who actually requested this topic so give a huge applause for him alright with that said with that said let's take a look at how this application looks like and i'm just going to say yarn start to open up a safari tab because if you're not using safari what are you doing right guys let me know who is a safari guy here it can be only me it can be only me let me know who is a safari guy right so opening up the wii is code here we go or what is it safari is not me okay so this is what we get this is pretty familiar this is kind of how the react app looks like it's just there is this uh incrementer stuff and add the amount and i could even add 20 and then that's how it works i'm an overall and chrome guy oh my god nobody uses safari how that's bad guys use safari uh okay so that's how the base redux app works i will just remove everything uh in here down below uh below this thing and we will just have one button uh at a time that we'll know if we are logging in or logging out that's all so we'll actually go hard on understanding how redux works because that's why we came here for all right with that said let's go into we as code and what i will do is so you see that inside of there we got all these new stuff so there is the app folder and features and counter folder all this stuff we don't need any of these so let's remove all the counter stuff this is actually the one that that increments these items so but we we're not gonna worry about that we're gonna build it from scratch and inside of the store we just remove these two and that's it so uh going back to the app.js what we have here is a bunch of stuff so what we will remove everything here these contour stuff and all that so we don't need any of those so let's remove that and everything down here like that oops i left this pan and we should be good to go yes let's take a look at the chat if there is something going on react redux app looks more interesting than the react up that's actually correct that that's so correct all right got 70 people in the house that's amazing and let's actually continue so step number one uh let's actually understand what we will do we will have two buttons based on if we have a user logged in or not the other one is going to be shown obviously um so that that's pretty much what we will do and one of them is going to sign in and then pass the uh logged in users data into redux and the other one is actually going to sign out the user so that's pretty much it we will have two functions that will take care of all these things did my camera freeze oh boy dang come on hold on a second all right okay and let's take let's see if i can bring it back somehow or maybe not all right camera builtin okay we got one camera that's not the one that i want to come on hold on a second that's a shame that's a huge shame all right let's see okay my camera is back tang okay that was crazy yeah okay all right we should be good to go okay so that said uh let's go ahead and continue carrying on where we left off hi everybody who's joining we are going to be building some sort of super simple redux app and the user authentication so that said uh let's actually understand what's gonna happen first let's go ahead and add the authentication and then we will go ahead and mess with all the uh stuff all the other stuff all right so uh going to firebase because obviously we will use firebase for this purpose uh okay and in here i'll just go into console on the top right corner and going in uh i already have this project all three docs because that's that's how i prepared for this one but i will just go ahead and say auth redux and say live so that's what i will do i'll create i'm creating a new project for this one i don't need any of the google authentication and stuff so let's not worry about hello can you guys hear me what the come on everything is coming together okay now you should be here hearing me okay done okay now come on where did you guys okay where uh where was it left off man up help me out okay so coming back into firebase uh so we will link a web application like i tried to say but didn't work so i will click this very button right over here so i'm gonna go ahead and go back to the name part all right going back to the name part add new project which was which you know what i'll just do the whole thing again i'll just do it again all right i will just give it a name uh i'm calling it off redox and live and now i'm just gonna add a two because it's the second one uh yeah all right and there is no need for google auth google analytics and any of that kind of stuff so we will just not worry about that all right dope okay are you guys following me everybody is okay yes i will be make a firebase tutorial for react.js developer that's something i was talking about probably when i was muted for some reason uh so yes i will make a firebase tutorial for react.js developers i think i will drop it as a separate video not a live session because there is just so much things that i i prefer to have that in one video and you guys can go ahead and watch that but i will be in the chat the whole time answering all your questions and then making a clubhouse session or some kind of q a session so you guys can actually ask your questions regarding that video so right now i'm gonna go ahead hit that button over there which will be a web application adding button and by the way guys it would mean the world to me if you could go ahead and just give that like button a smash so that it looks blue because then this video will go out there and it just helps out the uh helps us out and we know that it is a good content that we produce so if you could do that i would be super uh thankful for that all right let's continue plus by the way smashing the like button is the best way to become a developer just throwing it out there all right next up uh i'm gonna name it here again i need to name this uh the application that i will um that i will create yo what's up authoriba dope by the way i thought it was a student inside of our course profit with javascript so and we just had today a q a session call and he was there so by the way if you guys are interested in that make sure to check that course out all right so i will call this off redux and live and i also set up firebase hosting but we will not host it today if i could give a thousand i will that's amazing all right yes can we use mer can we use martin stack for firebase like fern replace mongodb to firebase i mean there is not too much point of being full stack if you're using some sort of serverless stuff so i wouldn't really recommend you can totally do that you can 100 do that all right so going down here once i added my application uh i have this config and that's what you need to copy going back to our vs code let's just create a firebase.js file and that's where we pretty much want to paste that now before we go any further uh i want to install the dependencies so the npm packages so what i will say is yarn add firebase and firebase tools for perfect compatibility so all right so this is something that you need to do and i got thirsty again right now making a typing speed multiplier game using mirn and socket io i will show you the complete amazing yes 100 show me amazing all right so this will do its stuff uh for a little but in that time i'll just reorganize my windows so you guys can already see that it is actually so you're why why yarn is so much better uh kai when you're editing this please clip this one out so why your why is yarn so much better yarn actually installs uh several packages at the same time that makes it so much faster so that's something that you want to keep in mind when you're debating between using yarn or using npm so that's something uh you guys want to keep it up hey let's go we got our first donation from yosam i'm not sure if i'm saying your name correctly thank you so much really appreciate it so yeah let's go ahead and now import firebase and let's continue working and we obviously imported from firebase a rsi awesome so and now uh we just want to set up all the authentication stuff so we we pretty much not do not do anything we will just go ahead and set everything up and don't be sorry about how much you donate anything you do for us that actually the fact that you're here with us is is such an amazing feeling for us so you don't have to we really appreciate every single penny you guys donate so whatever yeah don't worry about that at all all right next up let's create a firebase app instant instance we thank you for being here and helping us out all right so what we do is a we will create a firebase app right and that's going to be a firebase initialize app and we will just throw in all the config files right that we grab from here so once again go back to firebase grab the snippet of code create a new file called firebase.js import firebase add in the config snippet and then just go ahead and create a firebase app using the firebase.initialize app method or function or whatever it is and then throw in firebase config all right make sense let's go okay with that said we need two more things to be exported one of them being auth and provider these are actually going to be uh our google authentication backend right so what we will do is we're just gonna like the user the usual way const auth equals firebase.off and it's a function amazing once again and we will have the provider which is going to be a new firebase auth and it's a google auth provider okay so that's what we will make and guys if you are uh if you guys want to go dive uh go deep into this amana please drop the pwj link in the chat make sure to go ahead check that course out because we do it every day you can ask us questions we have coaching calls we have all this kind of stuff so make sure to check in all right are you going to use google auth or email password i'm going to use google all it's much better plus by the way email password is not secure anymore i mean nobody considers it secure anymore um so that's something you want to avoid all right and we will just go ahead and export both off and the provider okay that's sad we're pretty much good on the firebase side one thing we need to we still need to do is go back to firebase and then just turn on the back end that's that's all so what would you just go ahead click get started it will go ahead and show you this screen and once you're in google you just want to hit enable add your email address and save and you're good that's it you just turn on your back end simple as that all right so uh we are good on that side and now what we want to do is go into features and creating new files so what i want to do is add a user slice and this is where redux will come in okay so now make sure to pay close attention because we are getting into redux so far everything is something that we've already done on this channel so you guys can watch it several times uh even me explaining it or causing explaining it so we have this sort of content on this channel so now we are getting into the new stuff all right so in here before we actually get started uh whenever david is writing on vs code i'm not sure okay going back here so what now now it's time to pause because if you guys don't have the es7 snippets you will be lost okay now is the time to go ahead and install that thing i will have a separate video explaining all the best extensions uh for vs code in that you guys can go ahead and download in 2021 it will be dropping in a few days so make sure to check that out too because i'm going to talk about it in depth uh why is it important but you want to go ahead and search for es7 and then download this extension you need this you will get lost without this one all right so considering you've already done that uh i would just type in rx slice boom that's it that's how we are setting up redux once again if you don't have that extension you cannot do this you want to uh you want to have that extension so once again es7 react redux graphql snippets you need this one okay all right uh hola martello amazing okay so now i show i've shown you uh twice how to install that so make sure to have it and once again you want to type in rx slice and just hit return that's all that's how we set up a something called a slice a slice in actually redux is is a piece of state uh which handles several variables and makes them global so a slice is the most important part that you can have in redux you need this all right going back here let's actually understand what's going on and dope all right so once again so what we want to do here is just give it a name of user right over here just give it user because it is the user slice and it actually does this weird sort of indentation which theme am i using it's a good one make sure to watch the video when i'm talking about the uh extensions because that is where i am talking about this theme as well nope it's not the material it's by far not the material one i'm avoiding material all right i'm not gonna talk about which theme i'm using make sure to watch that video too all right so over here uh we would just add two pieces of state inside of the initial state one of them being user name which is going to be null for the first time as a initial state and the other one is going to be user email which again is going to be null okay all right let's nope not not dracula neither dracula okay that's a good one i thought about thanks i'll take a look at uh recoil okay so this might already be a little bit of a little bit confusing so i will just do this i will add a comment and just and i'll just go ahead and create a brand new uh use state just how we did the old days okay nope it's not the dracula theme by far not the dracula so this is how a normal state used to look like right so user name and set user name equals use state and something okay so notice the pattern okay notice the pattern what's happening here uh we are defining the initial state this is the initial state in a in a regular u state this is the this is the initial state that's what ha that's what goes there okay super easy nah this is a better one than andromeda okay so this is how uh this is what happens here okay i'll just i'll just show around which one is uh like which part of the redux slice is which part of a normal use stays considering like you guys already know uh the normal use state so i just want to give some sort of uh ease that out is the difference out all right so in the reducer we will actually create two functions that will handle all our user activity one of them is going to be set active user right and that will have the state and an action nope not even work done not even one dark pro nope not at all okay and in here uh what i will do is just state that user name is equal to action dot payload the username okay so what's happening here because now it's getting confusing and you know what i'll i'll make it a little bit more confusing so state the user email equals action dot payload the user email okay i gotta go sleep because it's too late see you in another stream yes see you see you soon see you soon byebye all right so what i will do now once i'm plugging back my headphones so now this one is actually going to go ahead and give the value in here okay so this is the set username and set email part of these states okay especially this line of code is this one okay i hope this is actually understandable how i'm um how i'm trying to explain it make sure let me know in the chat if if it is uh because actually uh this sort of analogical thinking helped me a ton understanding how redux works so i just want to help you guys with that and and once we are signing the user out we will have the set user logout state and it will have the it will just set everything to knock okay so let me know guys if it is a if it was a good explanation how how i explained it so uh so we have once again the initial state which is defined over here boom and we also have this line of code which is the set username the only difference is going to be global and again here is the set user logout state okay we got the like so that's good all right and so once again let me know uh if you guys understand it and if everything is cool so let's continue and now what you need to do okay so so we have these sort of actions this is actually an action okay and the action is going to contain that internal setting function okay so in order for uh to work with these setter functions we will need to uh actually export them and yeah so let's do that right now so i'll just go ahead copy this one paste it copy that one paste that here and we should be good to go which theme i will have another video explaining a ton of these extensions make sure to watch that and you will know which theme so now that i have those exported uh i can go ahead and use them in other components okay two more things we need to uh make happen in here is actually this part of the state okay so if you have used already use state you know what this part is this part is the one that returns the actual value of that specific state okay so that will be a super easy one as easy as exporting a exporting a const which is going to be select user name and that will go ahead and use the state and just grab the user's state and the username from that specific state okay so that's how this this one works and this select this this line of code will be responsible for that piece of uh that piece of the code so let's do the exact same thing with the user email yes i will explain user slice one time more okay so once again uh we have all this stuff and we have the normal use date okay so how does the normal use state how is the normal use state build up actually i'll add the other one as well so we have user email and set user email equals use state no so we have these two uh specific use states right this is how you would do in a normal way with the use state but because we are using redux we will do it the redux way that's why we have to have this user slice something that actually takes care of all these manipulations and all that kind of stuff so this has an access an access function that is actually peeking into the state and grabs out the value right and we also have a setter function that does the same but it actually manipulates the value and we have this initial value thing so it's like declaring the variable and just giving it a value right away so next up so that that's what happens in here okay so that's this part next up we will def uh define how we want this to happen it's just pretty much just defining that specific function so what we do is we have the set active user as a action okay and inside of there we would just mutate the username okay we will just give it a new value it's like saying uh set user name and give in the action.payload it's the exact same thing down here but when we call this function both of these lines run and all we need to do let all we have left to do is this piece which is actually going to be responsible for shooting in and grabbing the value back and just returning the value and that is going to be the select username guys uh at this point i want everybody to go ahead and just copy it and then just have this uh these this code with them and from now on we will use redux a ton more times so you will have plenty of time to understand it all right so we have user slice and now going back to app.js uh we will go ahead and import all the stuff that we have prepared for now so first we will have to import the auth and then the provider from firebase right because that's what will be responsible for um authenticating the user next up we will be importing something called use dispatch and use selector from the react relocks library and that's what we will that's what we'll take care of actually right giving a new value to the specific state and grabbing back that specific like reading that value that states value okay and now because we have exported all these stuff we definitely need to import them and that's how we will be able to access it over here and whichever component you want to go ahead and access that specific slice you will need to import those so let's import so we have a set active user we will set user logout state select username or user email first and we will import it from features and user slice all right dope so once again we have declared all this stuff this one is responsible for giving a new value to that specific state this one as well we're just defining some sort of how how we should be uh working with that we are giving an exact value over here which is going to be null because at this point the user has already logged out at this point we are uh reading the value of that specific state and in here we are passing in whatever we want to set it as a value and obviously at the point of declaration we need to uh give it an initial state so that's what happened there dope uh going back to the app.js file uh we will do a few different things so on the javascript part of the component we will just go ahead and say const dispatch equals use dispatch that's it that's a tool that we are going to be using to set a new value to that specific state that we will be manipulating all right and then now we will need to uh save in a variable uh of those we need to read out the state the current state of both states into a variable so that for that we will have a user username which is going to be you which is which we will use use selector for and we will just go ahead and select the name and we will do the same for the user email that will be use selector oops use selector and for that we will be saying select user email hey what's up muhammed so with that said now we will be handling the user authentication uh based on what's happening so for that we will have a conditional rendering going on over here so if there is a username right so the initial state remember it is a null so it's obviously false right now but at that point uh we want to have a button uh in two in the true part which is going to be sign out so if there is a username which there is not at this moment then we want to have a button which will click which will fire off a function on click which is going to be handle sign out next up we will also have a another button i mean button come on yeah so whenever we will have an other button which is going to be the sign in button and on click that will fire off the handle sign in function so those two we need to declare right now so we will have a const handle handle sign in that will do something let's just actually write out everything beforehand so we can go ahead and work with that after all all right and once that's done we will make a new one which is going to be handle sign out and that will do another stuff so notice we've already imported uh this stuff right here can you record the live for references yes we oh by the way this is actually being recorded at this moment and we have a we have an amazing video editor at our team who's a professional and he is going to chop up this whole thing so no worries we will upload this again in a shorter much shorter version without all the audience engagement so no worries we will have a structured super short version right now we're just hanging out having some fun having some good time i am ready to accept any kind of suggestion moving forward so yeah this is a feel good session we are uh building some stuff here but that's all yes we will have a stripped out version a shorter version uh for the youtube channel so back to the build we will let's actually handle the sign out first so it is actually going to be auth dot sign out and the then that then uh we will be just dispatching and we will say set user logout state right so this is what happens all right so what happens here first auth dot sign out this is firebase okay this is when we will terminate the user session uh of being logged in this at this point the user is not logged in anymore but we still need to handle it in our application right so for that we use something called dispatch which is a tool that we use to kind of like shoot in redux it's a weird way to say it but that's what it is it's more like dispatching into redux and just letting the global say no no hey the user is already out it would be good to set back everything to null right so we will run these two lines of code that's what will happen all right and that will empty out the active user state so that's good at that point and next up once we are cool with that uh we might as well want to go ahead and catch some sort of errors that might happen so we will say catch oh my god yeah microsoft visual studio by the way guys does anybody know any other kind of text editor that is better than vs code and has all these extensions because i want to i want to move away from using vs code honestly so whatever so catch we want to go ahead and catch any kind of errors that we might see so for that uh we will just add an elder alert yes and we will want to display the error message all right that's not okay down answer i want i want to leave vs code honestly all right so in case there is some sort of error uh then we will just display bro come on dang okay uh errors as comments oh you mean this one yeah uh so this is actually once again will be covered in my top 10 vs code extensions let's build the name top 10 vs code extensions in 2021 that will help you become a better developer i have a video coming up but this one is actually air lens so make sure go ahead check it out but i will have it i'll show around how is it working and all that stuff so stay tuned for that dope so we have the sign out already done and now we want to make sure that the user can actually log in as well so what we will do is just off dot sign in with sign in with popup because we like the popup come on notepad plus plus really dude okay provider so we what happens here is that the we are telling the firebase authentication service that pop up a new window and just use the specific provider that we just created which is in this case is going to be google okay that's all and then then uh we will obviously have a some sort of result right in case it is uh in case everything's working and next up now this is again a moment when we want to kind of like take a look into and peek into redux and just manipulate a specific state um that's when we will say once again dispatch set active user and we will just throw in name email and that's it actually uh i think we want to throw any user name and user email okay because that's what we are waiting for right over here so once again the username is going to be set the action payload username and that is and actually this is the action payload okay so whatever we are passing in is actually the payload uh sometimes these sort of props are being called payload especially at this point so amazing we have that done and now we should be actually able to have a working application which is uh not the best user experience but is something all right something's up not a problem uh yeah so the last thing before um before we can actually make it work is we need to go into store.js so store.js is the file that takes care of all the pro all these global states and just has them in a centralized place okay so for that uh to actually make sure that it is here let me just go ahead and say user reducer right that's going to be from imported from a folder above in features in user slides okay so that's going to be this snippet of code because actually redux is a pain in the ass to set up but with this specific library everything is so much easier but this one interacts with redux so we need to import everything in here and we will have a reducer which is going to be the user and we will just pass in the user reducer all right with that said let's take a peek how it is and there we go there we have our uh sign in button so that looks good so far if i go ahead and click that it actually pops up my new window which is going to be active right now and now if i can just go ahead and log in that's amazing we are good and right now it actually shows sign out so that is actually something that indicates that we already have uh the value saved now let's take a look at uh let's take a look at it using google chrome because guys even though i hate chrome chrome has so many battery extensions once again just like vs go so again uh let's go to localhost and we should be good and guys we have five minutes left uh sort of of this stream so now stick till the end and we should be done very very soon so i'm just gonna go hit inspect and if you have the redux developer extension for chrome then this is what will pop up if i go ahead and hit sign in wait a little and go ahead sign in with my uh user come on i'm not sure what my password is okay good and we'll just sign him with that one right so you see here that the set active user this is what happens the username is going to be rewritten from null to david rakozy okay don't use this email to email me i will be mad and if i go ahead and hit sign out then it sets the logout state and it goes back to sign in and everything is gonna be set back to naw now guys i will have this video chopped up by a professional video editor in our team and will be uploaded again as a normal video to this sp this very channel so make sure to stick around for that uh we will be dropping it tomorrow the day after tomorrow sometimes around that but we will have a summarize a so much faster version of it this specific video so and under that one i will have a github repository linking to this specific project and guys let me know now in the chat if you guys have any sort of questions regarding this project because now i will be waiting a little and answering any kind of questions you might have so make sure to drop them in the chat right now because i will be answering those questions all right and so make sure drop your questions drop anything that you drop any kind of questions that you might have frank smith says thank you thank you so much for sticking around for so long by the way if somebody watch the whole thing just drop a drop a snail emoji okay just let me know if if you watch the whole hour and everything happening here okay just let me know i can't wait for the recording because i came late all good bro olga actually you can watch this one as well uh yes i will explain use dispatch in just a second so you can watch this one as well right after i sign off and so you don't have to wait for the recording okay the recording is only going to be good if you want to use it as a later reference or later as a explanation or something okay so frank smith uh asked can you explain use dispatch a little bit so imagine this okay deepak say sendings two snails guys drop a snail emoji if you watch the whole thing so use this patch uh it's kind of like the communication tunnel between redux and your application okay so when you are giving a new value to that specific state you will use this patch to push that uh push that actual value in the state okay does it make sense let me know um it's kind of like tr uh passing in as a prop so there is two different way so there is two ways that you can look into the uh uh the state one of them has only read permission that's the use selector and the other one has write permission only so that doesn't that so use this patch you don't use it to read whatever the value of that state is but for use selector you only use it to read that specific value okay all right amazing thank you so much sam codes says love the love the work great great content amazing thank you so much for sticking around all right i only sewed two snails that means nobody was here at the beginning that's that's problem all right with that said guys thank you so much for sticking here and watching this thing i really hope you enjoyed please let me know in the comment now down below now no more i'm not going to read any more of the chat let me know in the comments down below how you liked it and uh what you guys want us to build next also there is a link an airtable link in the description where you can request us build something for you today's video was actually brought to you by somebody uh in the chat who already uh asked for this content so we made it you guys can see that we we build what you want and what you want to see so with that said thank you so much for joining this is david from cleverprogrammer and i'll see you in the next video peace out
