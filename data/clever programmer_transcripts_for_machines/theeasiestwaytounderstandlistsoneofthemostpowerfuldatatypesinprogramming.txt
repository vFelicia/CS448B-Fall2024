let me ask you guys some Python questions let's see if you have to put a bunch of things all right somewhere what data type would you use okay so let's say it's just like a bunch of student names and it's Bob and Billy and John and dadadadada the list of student goes on what data type would you use to store that information yes everybody who says list good job and the list look like those brackets okay so it's like how am i imagine list to be is like a bucket and you just throw a bunch of things in there I have this plastic bag here so you can just imagine a list to be like this plastic bag and I take my infamous mic you guys know this mic and I just take it and boom I take my kombucha and I throw it in there boom this paper bag in Python we call it a list all right we call it a list when I put this in a bag does the back care about the order of it like meaning if I put a lot of things in here and then I go back and look in this bag is it really easy for me to take out the things in the same order as I put them in okay so we're getting a lot of people saying we got somebody on Facebook saying no Matt Matt says not unless you remember the order on Instagram yeah so you guys are right there is no way to know the order maybe unless you remember it but it's too complicated like a plastic bag doesn't care about the order so a list though in Python remembers the order you put things in okay so imagine if this plastic bag had a way of telling you which thing was on position 1 which thing was on position 2 and which thing was on position 3 okay it remembers the order now can you guys think of where we would use something like lists in real life like let's say fate like on Facebook or Instagram or you know some some website that we all use where do you think you could give me an example of where a list is used in Python okay Justin says friends list on Facebook that's really good example Spotify to arrange the songs that's a really good example Sam friends list some people are saying storing names shopping listing and ecommerce storing contacts storing data keeping track of book index friends list on Facebook names phone numbers emails okay what you post on your timeline on Facebook very good student profile okay good good you guys are now getting the idea okay yes like images yes good good good so on on platforms okay again if you guys have something to write would you write this down this is exciting okay so you know exactly where a lot of these things are used so then when you're learning about it in Python it's not just boring it's like I'm just learning about list datatype structure it has more context and it's more fun so okay so let's take something like a list right and on Instagram you could use it to store images now if you put things in a list it's not like a paper bag right because in paper bag you don't remember what order you used but list remembers to order now the order is important because if I go on my Instagram I want to make sure that my recent pictures are at the top and my oldest pictures are all them at the bottom where else does order matter when I go on Facebook and I look at everything on somebody's Facebook wall I want to see the recent Facebook post at the top and everything else at the bottom right the oldest Facebook post where else is order important when I order when I was put things into my shop cart I want them to be in the right order or when I review my recent orders on Amazon and see everything that I bought I want to go down the list like boom boom boom boom boom and see which thing was purchased when you know what's the time of it so those are some examples in real life wirless reviews now how about Netflix okay we have all these movies we got to store them somewhere so maybe we could use a list for that okay so always be thinking about this however in somewhere like Netflix we don't necessarily care about the order that much
