yo what is going on guys welcome to another video on the channel today we are gonna be diving into react native and it's gonna be a bunch of fun we have our amazing students over at profit with javascript our community that we've built out with our love and soul um so yeah it's gonna be a fun fun build today and uh we're gonna pretty much be streaming one of our coaching calls that we have inside the course so every tuesday i ran a coaching course and then today the focus is primarily around react native so if you've been wanting to learn about react native then smash the thumbs up button watch this video and get excited now i'm gonna go ahead and share everyone inside our amazing course so let's go ahead and show all of your beautiful faces say what's up guys let me go ahead and unmute everyone go ahead and unmute yourself guys hey guys you guys are live right now there we go that's it i see so many cameras turn on here we go that's what i'm talking about everyone's like yeah i want to be on youtube you know that's there awesome guys amazing right so we were pretty much having a conversation beforehand and i can see the numbers are coming in now so we've got loads of people joining this call right now um so yeah if you guys are enjoying it drop some comments and i can pretty much go ahead and if i get a chance i will go ahead and reply to some of those as well um but yeah guys carry on from the conversation we were saying we had a few questions came in before um one of the questions from was from a member in our team uh i remember from a community called saddam and he asked even if i'm a beginner should i be in this kind of call should i be in this kind of uh situation right now and i was answering pretty much yes 100 and even frank agreed that like you should be 100 in these kind of calls even if it doesn't make sense okay so you want to make sure you situate yourself around people who are kind of ahead of you and there's a rule of 33 which i live by okay and this rule like i promise you i think everyone should go ahead and live by this for one and it's very simple right you have split your life up into into thirds right so i'm going to go ahead and share my screen quickly and we'll start drawing on the screen uh last time i don't know if you guys remember my screen wasn't working my um my setup was a bit broken but now i should yes i have it back last time i had to do all sorts of crazy stuff just to get around that um let me quickly make you guys visible on my screen okay there we go so you want to split your life up into threes like thirds okay so i call it the 33 rule and honestly this rule has been the thing which has progressed me deeper oh man goddammit every single time i never learned one thing okay let me do that again 33 raw 33 raw okay there we go yeah so this is a 33 rule and basically you want to go ahead and like imagine your day right so imagine like this is your this is your entire day now i want you to split your day up or i'll try and i'm going to go a bit extreme right here and say split your day up into into a third right so you're going to have three different things or instead what i'll do is i'll just break it up into you want to spend a third of your time right you spend a third of it with somebody who is like slightly lower than your current level in whatever skill you're building so remember this doesn't just apply to programming it applies to if you want to get better at content creation videos whatever it is go ahead and spend a third of your time with somebody who is who is not as good as as that skill as you but let's go ahead and start with one that makes sense so spend a third of your time with somebody who is better than you right and not better than you as a person i'm saying more skilled at you as in whatever you want to learn so more spend it with somebody who is more skilled than you in the current domain that you're looking at right so this could be like if you're looking at somebody who's coding then you pretty much spend a third of your time with like a mentor like like myself or find yourself someone who is pretty good with react pretty good as a full stack developer and then what you want to do is spend a third of your time on your own level right now why what do i mean by this i mean if you bought a course for example everyone inside the pwj right now we have a bunch of modules inside the course that is where you're going to spend it at your own pace okay so this is where you spend spend um time at your own pace building the skill right building the skill right so imagine we have coding then you're pretty much going to be spending a third of your time remember this you've got to spend a third of your time with someone more skilled than you in the current domain a third of your time spend it at your own pace building that skill so be doing modules be doing youtube tutorials be watching like reading media articles and things like that because they're that's a situation where nobody is behind you saying you need to do this or you know like this is what you need to understand instead what you're doing is you're pretty much just going through a tutorial at your own pace if it doesn't make sense you can pause it you can kind of wait go make cup of tea come back and then kind of start again you know write down some notes it's all at your own leisure right but that's good but but sometimes we need that kind of like we need that we need somebody to be behind us saying like you know this is like the next level this is kind of like i want to make you uncomfortable and we're going to talk about like react native and redux and stuff like that today right and you might be thinking oh my god i have no idea i've never done this stuff before but it doesn't matter all you need to do is make sure that you spend your time around with that around that kind of a group of people or find yourself a mentor and that's going to progress you the most uh so far fastest and then the third year and the last study of time most people don't do this one and this is to be honest this is probably the the most effective thing is teach someone else your skill right so this really and i used to say teach someone who is like lower than your level or anything like that but i kind of scrapped that because you should just teach someone else your skill even if they're like somewhat decent at coding and things like that teach someone and now you can see you've got like if we go back to the way i was explaining before you have somebody who's above your skill level your you have then you have your own skill level and then you have somebody who is relatively below your skill level or even if they're not it's completely fine and you want to go ahead and teach them now this does many things for you which is actually increasing insanely beneficial it's going to allow you to go ahead and if you can explain redux then you know redux okay like if you can explain react then you know react so it enforces the knowledge right to a whole new level right so this is going to allow you to really kind of like grasp a concept now i can guarantee you if you know about like react hooks or something like that if i went up to you and said to you right okay teach me about reactos right most of us kind of like even even i would have done this in the beginning before i started teaching i would have been like oh uh well i know how to i know how to code it and i'll be like okay show me and you see like you have a different kind of pressure now because it's not like the typical pressure of what we're used to and it's like kind of like somebody's somebody's kind of asking us a test or a challenge or a question now it's like they're asking you to prove that you actually know what you're talking about and think about how this relates to real life when you're in an interview what's the first thing that they're going to do they're going to come up to you and say to you right um can you like maybe prove can you prove to me like what would we do in this situation if we wanted to have a thousand customers and they want to do like uh they want to they want to buy a product and how would we structure everything in this now you have to show them right and you have to get their trust in and and trust in that so they can trust that you know what you're talking about right and that happens the same thing with a student how many times have you gone into a university or some kind of college or or school situation and the the lecturer is telling you something or they're explaining some kind of concept and you're like damn like like how like they're kind of way ahead than i am right like they know what they're talking about because you trust them right because and then what happens is i guarantee they also had a point in time where they had no idea what they were talking about and it's like nobody is born into the world being like a react god right nobody knows react when you when you're one years old right nobody like you don't just come out with this stuff you you have to like you have to learn it and you have to spend time like at your own level building that skill and then by teaching it to someone else you then go ahead and reinforce it and you get much much faster at actually understanding and using that skill right so these are the three fundamentals the reason why i want to start off with that is because honestly like there's a lot of overlooked points here like this one if you how many people in this call right now i'm going to go ahead and quickly bring back the the students how many of you guys in the core right now actually have a mentor that you are looking up to besides me besides me besides nars um besides kazi like do you have anyone else whether it be another student or anyone go ahead and just raise your hand if you have some other kind of mentor dang it sonny you took it away i was going to say nas are quasi oh yeah so the reason why i'm pushing is because i'm trying to make it like a bit of an uncomfortable jump right so in pwj it's given right so like i'm a mentor to you guys so we've got two shower we've got anand um let's go ahead and um we've got imran okay we've got danny sing okay nice so you guys all have mentors right huda so hada i'm sorry if i pronounced it wrong um but uh but remember like guys uh firstly i actually want to ask you so tushar you first how did you go ahead and find and thank you so much frank for dropping that a donation appreciate that dude thank you man um yeah so go ahead and tasha how did you get somebody to to sort of uh uh how did you find a mentor yeah actually it's uh like uh in my firm only where i'm working so there was uh there's a guy who used to parttime consult like he was not working in our company but he used to consult right so there was a time when i had a chance to work with him okay and we you know like we clicked and the way we were pairing up and doing stuff like we were awake till nine three a.m and working on stuff and it clipped around and the way he does uh stuff you know like designing uh architect structure or getting something done or getting some bug fixes right so that was the thing i look up to him like he used to create something new every month after every three months he will do some project on uh this small uh arm architecture like small chipsets some robotics right he will make some uh door locks or anything anything besides you know apart from coding and even in coding uh what he used to do is he used to learn something new and then he used to teach others also that new thing right so that was the main thing which i got you know uh like i was looking up to him like as a mentor and he really helps everybody yeah amazing dude and and and let me ask you a simple question of like since you started looking at him like a sort of mentoring uh getting mentorship by him how did you progress in sort of your level as a developer yeah it actually uh when i was working uh like we had a project and i had to work on the i was working on the old angular project angular one and then we have to suddenly move on to new angular like angular latest seven or eight version right and it was a move to type script and i was not much aware uh like i've not never worked on it and i was like feeling you know bit scared like it's difficult or something like that right uh then he was like you know i have done it i'll teach you know everybody yeah then he conducted a session like for three four guys he called uh him to his place and he was like i will teach him there is any daughter your short introduction and then the way he explained you know and then i caught up with things and i was uh like i grabbed it and i'm working on that you know my latest angular for new project so that's really amazing dude and that's it like all it takes is that initial sort of jumping and it can be scary like it can be somewhat of a thing like you know like you might be wondering like oh am i going to sound stupid or am i going to like say something dumb because i used to be in the same situation that would be a job and i'd be like i don't want to say the wrong thing i don't i you know in the beginning you have this perception that you're not allowed to kind of go to the seniors or for some reason that there's just kind of a war between you and the seniors and it's not like there's nothing that you can pretty much go ahead and just you know jump into it so that's amazing thank you for sharing that dude um we have another person who actually raised their hand so we actually had imran anand nice go ahead go go for it and how did you meet your mentor yeah so i i met him uh through a discord server actually there were a few groups of people who were looking to uh to work in a react project so yeah through uh through that uh i just joined it and i thought okay i'll see what all things are going on and as as soon as i went in there was one guy who was very active in the group so i just dm'd him and then i got reply after a few months and then eventually it started that was one of my mentors and then second one is in my organization where i work right so i work in dotnet sector so there was one guy who was looking for a person who can help him in building an internal project so it was internal open source project so i just volunteered from him volunteered for it and day before yesterday that side got live internally and um in his he's a team lead and he taught me about all those atomic design and how would we use it and all that stuff so amazing in the weekends uh we just get on a call and sometimes and then we just discuss it over it amazing dude that's exactly like that's the way to move forward um and and um i forgot what was the last point you mentioned you just mentioned something quite good uh just repeat that last point yeah so i wasn't able to join any of the live coaching calls last week yeah because i was in my free time from off office hours i was working on a react project that was an internal open source project for my organization right and it just went live day before yesterday okay and i got a lot of appreciation from my managers and all that nice i didn't do a very big thing it was just a very small contribution in the site but yeah we were people of four four people were there yeah and in that the person who was there the team lead he became my mentor nice dude that is amazing that is amazing and uh and what you want to do is position yourself in in like in situations that like are going to make you uncomfortable i can guarantee when you went into that position initially you were kind of like you were uncertain you must have been like a bit kind of nervous and and you know like and and i guarantee now like you probably made a good relationship with with that guy and uh and that's gonna definitely be something and the thing is you really do hold on to um those relationships because there's been situations where i've been stuck in really tight debugging situations where like you just wanna like scream at the computer right like like if nothing is going your way and it's kind of everything's breaking and um and that's when you i i have actually like reached out to a lot of the people i built a network with and kind of said like hey dude look i'm in a rut i have no idea how to get past this uh i have a client he's gonna he's paying x amount like can you help me out and i'll message a bunch of them i don't just message one this is the problem right we end up making like one friend in the coding world and we're like yeah yeah i'm networked up like no honestly guys you need to remember they're to be busy with your your someone who you usually reach out to you might just be completely busy and there's nothing wrong with that instead if i get super stuck i will message like 10 of my like my sort of developer friends who i'm like you know they might be able to help me out and i'll just literally send them the same message i'll be like yo what's up man like i'm kind of stuck i'm a bit over up like any chance you can help me out with this and i'll kind of like post a snippet on on i'll use something like rebel if it's simple and i'll share the code and what i'm kind of facing or if it's really intricate i'll share a github it depends on the sensitivity of what you're sharing as well but that's going to really progress you as a developer in my last job i was working with somebody who was a really seasoned frontend developer and i can promise you guys there is not a single tutorial in the entire planet that will teach me as much as i i sort of learned by just being with that guy who is so experienced in as a frontend developer the way they critique your work the way they kind of attack you with like this is you shouldn't do this like in the way that they say like you should do this and that the point is is why did why was it so effective it's because it's somebody who again we're going back to the onethird rule it's somebody who is above your skill level and you're pretty much just like you're just latching on to their sort of skill and and no matter what you surround yourself with that enough you'll get pulled up too right and then you get to a point where everyone always asks me the same question like saying how did you get so good at react and things like that guys i wasn't i wasn't like amazing at react like about a few years back i really wasn't i was kind of like uh that guy who was one of my friends said like hey have you ever coded him react i was like dude i've literally done jquery and that's about it and uh and now i'm like coding up these apps super quick and things like that and it's just repetition my practice but the main thing for me was mentors mentors right like finding a mentor finding somebody that you can work with and right now in this one room there are literally about 80 people inside this zoom core if you do not have somebody that you are like literally just use this as an opportunity to reach out to at least one person on this call right now and say hey you want to work on something or like hey do you want to let's talk about some some react stuff or like hey let's maybe like have an hour call you know if you're not doing that then you're literally cutting yourself short already because you might there might be a perfect mentor for you in here like i already know that we can mention a few people like priyanshu super young developer absolutely killing it he's made about he's making 330 dollars a month and and he's young and he's based in india so never let age location anything like that stand in your way and you have access to the people inside the course so you can who can go ahead and do that you have people like frank seasoned developers landed huge huge contracts which are which is like i've never touched a contract as big as what frank had done so again like if i wanted to go back into freelancing world who do you think i'm going to speak to i'm going to go and speak straight to frank you know like i'm going to talk to him and say like dude how did you you know what was the best thing that you did in that situation because there's no point reinventing the world it's like if you're going to code up a date picker in react right i'm not going to code that i'm going to go and find a date pick a module which has loads of stars on github and i'm going to pull that into my project and figure out how to use it i'm not going to reinvent the world and things like that unless i absolutely have to that's when i would do that right so um everyone on youtube everyone in this call make sure you're at least like inside anyone inside of pwj use the community use the slack channel and really dive in and make sure you're asking somebody else or finding somebody else to work with on a on a regular basis and and honestly cycle it up you'll make so many friends like it's crazy like especially in pwg we have like 2 000 students right now um and also yeah that's another thing you have like so many more friends because like a lot of coders can be tend to be naturally introverted right like we like coding we like doing our thing on the computer um so where's the best place to find someone likeminded to you on the course right like on this on this platform if you if you're not enrolled in the course then link in the description you can go ahead and check it out or you can pretty much go ahead and um literally in the comments you can pretty much go ahead and check it out right like you can go ahead and say somebody reach out to me on this my linkedin like and pretty much is that simple right you can watch you can completely watch a whole nother channel on youtube and things like that you can watch like traversing media or something like that i'm pretty much just writing like hey anyone else want to pair program with me i'm working on some cool stuff someone will reach out to you i guarantee it someone will reach out to you if you do it enough and and that's going to be your start to building your network and trust me when i say that network is your net worth like literally if you go ahead and build out a crazy linkedin profile and i don't know how many of you guys like go ahead and raise your hand if you're into gary vee and his content right awesome crushing it very decently and i want so much value from it yeah he's absolutely killing it he released a bunch of like keynote slides and things like that which i definitely recommend reading and also he's talking about how like garyvee's is one of those people he he's very good at picking up on the trends that are about to blow up he predicted ticktock he predicted like twitter when he was going up he did a lot of like sort of early predictions and now he's predicting linkedin is another one because on facebook on all those platforms they're very highly saturated where you would post a video and it's only going to go to your followers or like a small majority of other people on linkedin it's crazy you could post something right now include a couple of hashtags and that is going to get reached to so many people in that space right so imagine like the potential if you're dropping value after value after value after value every time you learn something write linkedin post share it boom shoot a little video saying like hey i just learned something new don't worry about looking stupid or looking shy like we all literally here's here's a trick everyone looks stupid in the beginning right like that's something that i will completely break down even the junior developer when you first propose like hey guys we should use this firebase like um database thing uh in the beginning i guarantee the first time you pitch it to your team you're going to kind of look a bit silly and they're going to look at you like you know how much you know because because i did that i did that exact thing and they were looking at me like what is this guy talking about but then you prove them wrong you just carry on doing it like yeah well you know like i'm gonna build it anyway and uh if it works we can go ahead and implement it so that's my advice the thing that you talked about linkedin that's so true about you know linkedin uh that's basically seo and i also i happen to have a good pdf book and it's it's not like an amazing book but it's makes it relatively good and i learned about linkedin quite a lot from that book so if anyone's interesting actually i'll just drop it in the live channel just like a pdf and uh yeah i think that everyone will find a lot of value from it exactly uh exactly yeah nice so adam i see like adam's doing it right i'm down to work on projects together i've never worked with anyone else but i have experience in react i'm learning right now that's it dude that's literally like that's all you have to do like you got you have to just shoot your shot right like uh if i hadn't done that me and kazi wouldn't be working right now i literally cause i said to kazzy i was like yo dude i'm pretty good with react kazi was shooting some stuff on javascript next thing you know we came together and now this this whole thing is blew up right so if you don't shoot that shot if you don't ask someone if you don't honestly even right now go ahead and share linkedin's on on the chat in the zoom chat and things like that um share your linkedin say like connect with me start talking to people start shooting messages back and forth i want you guys to build a network and trust me there's already 80 people in a room that all want to learn about the same thing that's a pretty powerful network right like if you can't get 80 people to debug a situation and one person to figure it out then there's i'm just trust me like one person will figure out your problem right so you see what i'm saying like it becomes a very quick tool to becoming a powerful and on linkedin honestly like you if you start building like enough and dropping enough value and things like that like your reach gets so stupidly big that that um when it comes to finding jobs when it comes to doing all that stuff people just swarm at you like a do you know how many like friend can vouch for this do you know how many recruiter messages you have to go through it's crazy yeah i started i started charging for them to talk to me yeah honestly i'm saying i sent them an invoice now yeah really yeah that's genius dude yeah because they're always asking about like oh we have a referral how about i invoice you first that's genius that's amazing dude i love that and you actually did so frank did a genius thing with it when it came to resumes as well so yeah uh you reviewed people's resumes right one second imran i'll come to you uh next for a question yeah you were you reviewed resumes right on linkedin yeah i put it up i put it up on on linkedin that like hey guys you know i'm a senior developer um i i have a lot of experience like hiring folks and kind of like the interview process like i can help you get less nervous if you're looking for a mobile role and now i guess i'm like react native guy again that's amazing dude and it's like and i did a mock interview with the person yeah and it was an hour long interview and they're like well but frank it's a long interview i was like most interviews are at least two hours you have to get the stamina for it so it was mock interviews real questions you know real projects and then also uh reviewed their uh their resume yeah and then it was it was very successful so it's it's linkedin is very powerful exactly really i think i'm gonna start i got i got the microphone coming you know nice to meet some quick little little snippets like yeah video on linkedin is powerful exactly i know and that goes to and before i'm definitely going to come to your mind in one sec um that actually goes to one point i want to mention and this was something i was very hesitant about before but like even small things like like upgrading a camera rig and things like that right upgrading camera upgrading mics and things like that like you might think of it as like oh they're just kind of fancy gadgets right they're kind of like you know it looks cool it kind of but the truth is it's an investment back into yourself just as much as like a book is just as much as much as a because the thing is like you buy a camera like if you i mean most people people could buy a camera they didn't never learn how to use it right but the goal is you want to buy stuff and and pretty much figure out like how it's going to benefit you don't buy random stuff by the way that was that didn't mean that in a generic way all right buy books that are going to help you if you're not reading right now pick up audible because i can't i personally am not a fan of reading i i prefer audio books i i'll go for a walk i'll go for a run and i'll have all the like audio just being read to me in my ear so it's pretty much it's very easy like way of consuming media now and you just have yeah preentry that's actually i'm going to highlight you one sec dude this book guys soft skills by john sonmez i've read like 14 chapters already and trust me i this is the best investment i've made yeah nice investment one hundred percent you know at least buy this book like you're never gonna regret a book like this because it's phenomenal like he talks about you know how to start with freelancing he even talks about you know how do you approach someone he talks about niches and he talks about all those kinds of stuff he talks about marketing yourself and so much more guys like just just buy this book or read it on audible as uh sunny said it's available it's amazing just just take the action of buying this at least exactly dude like a 100 percent soft skills by john thomas it completely changed the way i started building clients and building uh everyone and and it was when i took my sort of freelancing journey from somewhat of like a more of a hobby kind of ish thing to something that could support me financially completely just 100 yeah exactly and then guys it's more a case of like take it from from actual like you could always kind of read it in an article you can read it and it's not but when you see someone like even like priyanka when you see them without frank or shrika like they're kind of they're breaking the sort of like you know what is what the kind of normal what we're told to believe what we're kind of told to kind of think is is the reality like you know you have to work two years to earn this much money or you have to work x way to make certain kind of money like screw all of that stuff and just listen to the tips and tricks from people who have done it and and trust me you'll just skip all the riff raff and remember you don't want to following the same path everyone else is following isn't the right way right just because everyone else is going that way it just goes the other way like it's scary yeah sure like we've all taken that risk we've all taken that dive into even the first time i learnt re i took it i literally took a job where redux was a main requirement i blagged my way through the interview and i just picked it up on the train ride in to work i was literally watching youtube and i figured out redux on the first week by just watching video after video after video and i used some dodgy ios app to download the youtube videos before youtube premium was the thing so you see like you make it work right but imran you had a question uh i think he is oh what's up jesse hey welcome yo sonic and the question was what what are the aspects of you what are the difficult aspects of using functional components in reject what was the difference between functional sorry no no what are the most difficult aspects of using function component in react okay so what are the most difficult uh like uh sort of concepts or areas of using functional components inside of react effects aspects okay so what is the most difficult aspects of using um functional components inside of react what i would have said another component functional component right so so the question so is this for an interview this would they ask you this yeah okay so firstly it's a strange question in an interview um about but what i would say is is it the difficult uh what is it difficult for you guys or for me like what's yeah yeah that's what i would say i'd be like are you guys i'd be like can you clarify that one of those questions yeah i'd be like do you do you guys know how to use your functional components like this kind of you should also yeah also whenever when you're doing interviews also it's okay to like not know everything yeah just it's okay to say can you explain that a little bit better what what what aspect of what yes to write it to to use it inside of a nested function somewhere else like you know or you know what specifically like you know it's okay to ask questions to clarify because sometimes people have interview questions that are like very kind of like they're the ones that know it nobody else knows it yeah so you have to kind of get a little bit more information that's part of the skills yeah and guys never get disheartened like you know how many times i've been in an interview and they've made me feel really dumb because they've asked me like some crazy algorithm kind of question and the truth is is that i didn't know i just had no idea how to answer it i've answered some of them i've broken down others and this and that but like there are going to be situations where they'll catch you out and they kind of ask you some strange question and the truth is is that that again it's not actually down to what questions you're being asked it's about selling yourself as a as a developer as some value to the company so you can actually flip an entire interview which i've done before where they've kind of came in with the sort of technical we're going to ask you this this this and then before you know it you're now talking about some experiences where you got into a debugging situation for for a week straight and and how you overcame it and you're just talking about your story so you can flip that you can you can completely flip those situations and it's something you can do but to answer imran's question um what are the most difficult aspects of functional components inside of react what i would say is before what would have happened is functional components were amazing for many reasons but the reason why they were limited was because you couldn't have state inside of a functional component right and that was very limited and that meant that we couldn't have um we couldn't have a sensual functionality inside of a component so we had to kind of if we needed state we would have to kind of convert it to a classbased component use the constructor and things like that and have everything set up and then you'd be able to use state in the component now that's when react hooks came in and you see what they might have been doing here is testing that oh do they know what does he know about react hooks or you see like it could have been like an actual sort of like a side question to kind of check if you know about react hooks but it wasn't mentioned in that way and then what i'd say is yeah but that react hooks came in and now it's actually extremely easy using the use state hook to now have state inside of a functional component so if you asked me what i would build a class based or functional i would now go with a functional component for many reasons like it's easier to write it's easier to read and maintain the use effect hook actually replaces the life cycle methods inside of a classbased component if you start dropping that on them then they're just like holy okay like this person is up to date they know their stuff right okay that's cool like you see and then you can kind of then you can at that point you can be like oh actually um there's actually a really cool website called use hooks.com and and then they'll be like oh really like that's a cool website and uh and then but yeah i used one for firestore like and you see like take your skill that much further and uh you kind of flip the script on these kind of conversations and you just win their trust because they're like oh he answered my question and he went that extra step and he knows his stuff thank you thank you very much amazing don't worry dude thank you um but again that's a very open question yeah and yeah it's always good to kind of unpack things and say okay it's like okay i can talk to you like what they are well the definition is like what exactly are you looking for like are you looking for like you know why they got updated recently and like react you know 17 like what what what exactly are we looking for yeah it's okay to ask to expand stuff yeah and never feel like you're wrong by asking them because sometimes the person interview and i mean i've had it where like and it's only through actually carrying out the interviews i realized this like some people interviewing you are just kind of as nervous sometimes weirdly as you like they kind of don't actually hold the interview that great either and they can kind of come across it depends like a very um a very experienced like kind of senior developer might actually be able to carry an interview really well right they'll be able to know if like because the truth is that if i was interviewing anyone inside this core right now uh yeah sure i'd be looking at elements of tech and i'll be this now but i'd be looking at you sort of your approach to overcoming if you hear a debugging situation so if if i said to you right i would write like a little test sort of react app and i'd kind of have an intentional bug in there somewhere and i would pretty much go ahead and be like i'll just kind of watch you and be like yo like just go ahead and you can jump in ask me questions what and the truth is is that i would want i'd be more interested in the person was like um i have a question about this so this is where the state is getting set up right and it seems like that shouldn't be there um but i'm not 100 sure like that person is you know at least they're asking the question but you'll get somebody else who would kind of like sit there and kind of like tinker around with it make a mistake think around with it make a mistake a bit no no i know this don't worry take her out make a mistake and now that person is killing through time right they're coming through time they're burning through things and they're letting the ego their sort of ego stop them from asking that question and that's the kind of developer that you kind of want somebody who um who is very like open mindset to learning um also a really cool cool note i'm just going to highlight on the screen we've got mohit mo via who he says on youtube he says thank you very much sonia and kazi because of you i landed my first job on upwork thank you very much that's awesome hey awesome stuff dude um amazing and um yeah okay cool um so yeah i think that's pretty much concludes that sort of section of what we're talking about i think what we should do now is let's dive into um a react quickly a react but i want to kind of run over the difference between a class based and functional because that we talked about i think it'd be very quick really nice sort of quick sort of run through and i can explain an extension that you should all be using um called es6 redux snippets and things like that and then once we get we're going to kind of go through that at a quite a fast pace and then we're going to do uh we're going to go ahead and set up our first react native app okay so let's go ahead yeah sharika actually that's a good point so sharika built so the backstory behind sharika he was part of a hackathon um and shrika i mean you can tell the story dude go for it you're alive dude what story um so the hackathon uh app that you've built and and you want to share your um i won a few prizes last weekend nice one uh i won best use of google cloud at your hackathon yep oh best uix hack nice and uh oh second place startup yeah i've heard the app it's basically a wildfire app where it notifies people on like pollution and fires near them and they can also read up on news amazing and dude how old are you 13 13 guys that is killer yeah so that's amazing and you wanted to show us so uh shriek is using something called expo to sort of develop an app and what he what you can do in expo is it will only work for everyone who's downloaded it but it's very simple as long as you've got a qr scanner you can try what we're about to do um but i think what he's done is you can code up your app and then you can actually sort of get everyone else to sort of test the app on their phone on their computer by using a qr code so um srika do you want to go ahead and actually share that qr code uh yeah wait one second okay so once he shared that all you need is you're on ios you just pull out the camera app on android i think you have a qr code scanner you just pull that up and you'll be able to scan this if you don't have expo the app installed on your phone it should just go ahead and and take you to the app store i think but here we go awesome so go ahead open up and let's go ahead and i'm going to point my phone at that and it says open in expo so i'm going to show it on it asks for your location accept it because there's actually some pretty relevant location type things in there so right so we're going to trust shrieker on this one guys he's not gonna hack us nice um let's go ahead and see okay so mine's loading up right now it says oh is this it right welcome to dude i love the ui i thought this was like a a screen forum i'm going to go ahead and show this on the on the screen right now so my phone's cracked so you guys might not be able to see that but oh i haven't got auto focus on you can see the ui is uh it's actually pretty nice right so they can't they can't really see it fully damn it um i'll turn it off focus on next time but um okay so welcome to one let me go ahead and register an account and um it would be really cool if i could show this on the screen okay so i'm gonna register i'm gonna say sunny oh sonny there's a way to do it oh yeah oh you can do it right so you can actually do if you do like a usb connector or something just like charge your phone with your computer yeah but the thing is i think actually so you can do it through um let me go ahead and i don't have my wire here uh okay what i'll do is i'll go ahead and i share it on this so on youtube i think they can see it a little bit i mean i think you guys can see it a bit but it's not gonna work out properly um okay dude i'll run through it anyway so we've got i'm going to enter my email address anger at jim oh god i didn't realize i was actually murmuring now and then i'm going to put a password in okay and guys all you need to do if you want to interact with this now is scan that qr code and you guys can test it out so i'm going to hit register and then oh nice dude holy crap okay so guys this is the screen that is taking me to so it says dashboard right so you guys might not might be able to see that it says dashboard my phone is correct i know and what it says is it's got heat maps it's got air quality temperature so it's actually found my location it's got the air quality and temperature and it's got the heat maps i'll tell you what actually if this is running on your computer right now shrika do you mind hitting run in web browser yes yeah so if you go ahead and hit run in web browser this should spin it up on a web browser we should be able to actually show everyone this and you can go ahead and demo your app but this is cool dude you've got news feed we have nearby fires we have notifications um oh my god this is sick okay nice and uh shrika how long did this take sorry i am not able to do it i tried to scan it right you scan life but it is not working okay so when you scanned it did it say open in expo it says okay and there is a url in it it says okay and there's a url in it um okay so you need to have export yeah you need to install expo the app on your phone or export install yeah it's called expo client expo client yeah so ramy david was just asking yeah um oh i don't think it's working on my web browser i think it's because like there's like a billion people just like yeah right now it might be oh nice look you've got loads of people jumping on um okay in that case what i can say is i guys take my word i man i'm going to set that that auto focus properly um this camera is known for auto focus as well um but basically what i can do is actually on the coaching call what i can do is maybe oh i have an idea dude i know how we're gonna do this i'm gonna stop your share and i'm gonna make my screen spotlighted and i will show you guys this way so i'm gonna replace the spotlight there we go i was able to install it so you guys can see this right so you guys can see he's got an app here and you can see it underneath and we'll make this experience better guys so like i will share my phone next time but you can see we've got these tabs at the bottom and as i click them it takes me to new screens there's a news feed right there's a full news feed which is awesome and even the design review and share it with other content contacts that you know nice dude and if you see at the top it says london so that's where i am right now it shows me my air quality the temperature and it will actually show so what is this at the bottom right here so heat maps oh nice okay i've clicked it oh damn okay this is cool right so i've just hit i've just hit heat maps and check this out guys it's actually showing me a map and the temperature zones around london which is insane and this was built with watch rico react native yeah react native nice and apis okay and how much um how long did this take i say how much how much to buy this did and uh and um how long did this take to to to go ahead and build um 24 to 36 hours what oh my god that is that is insane dude nice 26 today okay that is awesome so 26 30 hours around that time frame dude well done that is awesome man even if you like open up the new screen yeah it opens up a model okay you can share it to people you know right so i've clicked on these videos articles and then you'll actually get it oh really oh nice oh man and then it will open up but is it just the url that it's gonna so it's a modal when i click it it pulled up a model oh and that's like in in a safari kind of style browser right yes i got it i got it up on my um i can share my screen and i have it on my phone oh go for it dude go it so everyone watching whether it's youtube or in the call right now make sure you go ahead and download expo because we're going to be doing some cool stuff for that later hey there we go that's awesome so this is the homepage amazing yeah this is cool man so you won't register and log in login so go ahead and register you can just make maybe make a dummy account or something um and um i mean shrika how are you doing authentication right now hey i love it okay awesome bro this app is killer i i wouldn't have been able to make it like if you if you did it in 24 hours and yeah that's that's huge trust me congratulations you did it and i i wouldn't have expected anyone else to win that too seriously this app is really good like it it's set for production if you want to yeah honestly it's awesome man you you might as well make some money what phone are you using right now frank um i i have my hold on one second i got my text size a little bit larger oh all right that's probably why yeah i was wondering okay there we go yeah don't worry yeah i do expo too sharika was like goddammit what is this i do this on purpose to break my own app so this is again something that we're saying like yeah that's clever i never even thought that that's cool yeah well it's like you have to because like some like okay guys i'm working on an app also it's it's music based and sometimes the the name of the songs are really long so i have to i have to check for that kind of stuff so i make the text big make it small still make it uh unbreakable exactly yeah this is amazing guys like i'm here in austin texas uh i guess we have good air quality i'm not sure oh dude you're in texas nice i don't know got heat maps i still not able to get into it i still install expo yeah so guys remember expo what's happening is shrika set up a tunnel where he basically tunnels the connection to download the app and things like that when a lot of people can connect it can be very slow to download the bundle so don't worry if you can't connect to it now um but just understand that that's what you can do in export think about all the use cases for it but overall dude this app is sick this is really really cool amazing this is very fast yeah really really nice sunny i would like to know how what tools we are using to do this because i have a scan life and i installed expo on my phone iphone so how to make it work how to i scanned it it is again showing me the same screen um you most likely are running into like a little edge case dude so i would say maybe um share what you're seeing in the zoom chat or we can debug it afterwards on on slack just try and share it okay yep news feed it's amazing can you share the qr code again um guys i would say at this point honestly like uh because his tunnel is probably getting overwhelmed right now so maybe just just go ahead and use what frank was showing to pretty much look at what was possible with the app but shrika let's let's quickly run through uh a quick thing of of what did you use to go ahead and uh to build that so i'm guessing you would need used firebase authentication right uh yeah react native yeah and then a few like uh air quality apis and stuff okay nice and was they were they free or paid apis free nice okay so free apis firebase authentication is free to get set up and use um did you have a uh so for the navigation aspect of the app what were you using navigation awesome right so we have an event navigation that's gonna handle all the sort of page routing at the bottom of the screen um and then what else did you use that you would find did you use any kind of form of redox or state management nope okay so nice there you go unless this is answering a lot of questions right now where you don't need to over complicate the build with redux all the time we'll react context api most of us even i did in the beginning i was kind of like as soon as i build an app i have to set up redux i have to set up this i have to sell that don't do that because it just over complicates the build just go ahead and add what you need as and when you need it right that's going to be the best way to progress forward um expo is actually this is this is amazing man this is from a senior developer over here like i'm i'm very impressed yeah dude that short amount of time like congrats this is like really good work no doubt dude 100 like if you showed that to an employer to anybody yeah you'll be very very impressed you will get so i would recommend you to just apply for freelancing jobs and then show this app and make some more apps if you want to and then actually you can start freelancing right now so don't even don't even care about whatever anyone else tells you just make some accounts and go for it bro exactly exactly also we haven't speaking of jobs adnan razak says hey proper reactor i recently got a job in dolby germany as a javascript developer thank you for your videos you're just awesome amazing so loads of people getting jobs now that's crazy man um shrika just to show you right honestly if you went into um somebody said baby yoda of coding it's so funny you said that because there's literally a baby yoda in like in the corner of my room right now so if you're watching on youtube you can see it over there um but that's uh that's funny but um yeah if you were if you were to go into an interview right it doesn't matter what your resume looked like doesn't matter what anything look like you pulled that out and said yeah i built this go ahead and play with it right or scan this qr code and they would launch it with expo they would be able to by playing through it like as a sort of seasoned kind of developer i was like okay he must have used some kind of authentication regardless of what it was it's authentication which is not always an easy problem to solve um and especially for those people who don't know about firebase authentication um and then you also have the the fact of getting the app set up in the first place then you also have setting up with expo you did that successfully then you had react native navigation that's showing us like a million words just in that little and then and it's a fun way of showing skills right the one thing i'm against is when you kind of go into somebody's portfolio and it's like uh react native and there's a there's a progress bar and it's like 75 what does that mean right like if i see if i see a react bar and it's like please don't do that yeah it looks good in the website it's really hard to read though too because you know some people have like slower browsers and don't put don't put how many like some some people put years of experience but that's only for the recruiters like when you actually sit down in front of someone they'll say did you do four years of advanced stuff or did you do four years of not advanced stuff there's a huge difference exactly exactly this is this is in 24 hours man like what the heck dude and entry how many people were in your team it was just one person oh man that is sick and were you coding uh this is actually another handy question for everyone watching so you were pair programming with him was it next to each other or was it using like a vs code live share or that kind of stuff oh no dude we didn't do ps4 or anything it's just we collabed over github oh so this entire thing was over github as well yeah oh man it's even more impressive like you could literally so now you can share the repo share the honestly if you push that to your github have the qr code i'm not sure if you can actually host the demo on expo online yeah you can you can like publish the project so then anybody can scan the qr code then dude that is insane you know what to do that as a step one and step two release the app like literally take it that extra step and kind of release the app and say like this is a fire tracker things that it like costs a bit to release it waiting on the product i could show you exactly how to release it for free they have it free for students nice oh okay so guys that is literally an example real time of networking right like that is literally it so like not a hundred dollars they don't do that exactly so sharika speak to frank after and and dude we want to see that app in the app store and i can and even i can help you out with like test flight and things like that i was really impressed like this was very impressive for me yeah that's insane like trust me like i've seen so many um so many new apps that are coming in and they're gonna have good ui but this one is like you know having those round borders and all that kind of stuff and i think react native might come in with that but the navigation is smooth you are pulling in data from apis and you're doing authentication so there's a lot of complexity involved too and um yeah bro like i would be the first one to install that app yeah that's it honestly it's amazing dude sharika guess what somebody on youtube what's your email i have a mobile project for you so you might have just landed a client yeah so you might just land the client so go ahead and check out youtube the live chat um but uh already what was that tell them i already hired him [Laughter] nathan's already grabbed him nice for anyone who's wondering whether it's for android or ios just don't even care because it's for both react native does it for both yep exactly so that's the benefit of using react native as well um oh this is another question so when you set up the firebase authentication did you use react native firebase um so the neat little react native firebase package um i always forget their name but there's uh frank what's the name of it we we talked about it last time it's called rn firebase.io or something like that yeah rn firebase.io is that the one you use trico or did you use the a different approach uh yeah so like my teammate he was working on the firebase integration and backend but like he used he didn't specifically use ironfirebase.io right he like used it for documentation to help him along but he didn't install that package okay okay interesting interesting so did he install any kind of native dependencies or uh no not so sure okay cool no problem dude the main thing is you got it working so that's that's insane uh really really awesome it does it does the geo stuff so like it has to be installing something cool yeah oh yes yeah it does it checks it out and all that stuff so you would have had to install something um that's that's really like amazing stuff go ahead and show uh shrika some love in the in in the zoom chat and then just scream it out if you wanna because he deserves that that's crazy man um right so uh for everyone also for everyone um you've got loads of people messaging on youtube as well uh kanye g says congrats um mustafa mahmood says this is gonna be recorded yeah everything is recorded and uh and also badan azam shrika just dropped his email so you know do your thing get a little client going amazing so guys look making making like little little deals happen on the stream that's cool all right if it's not legit we're going to hunt you down yeah exactly we there's 88 people in this school that are going to network together you know we're very protective of the community exactly don't be a bad don't be bad a bad client exactly all right so guys i believed it yeah i believe that we can also make it in a react itself instead of react nature yeah so i did this yeah so remember using the api and location you can easily figure it out so remember there are differences right so it depends on what your your approach is so remember this is also a good question for anyone who's kind of confused as to what react is against react native um so react is essentially going to allow you to build something called a progressive web app right so it's it's an app that runs on a browser so the the benefits of a pwa progressive web app is that you can pretty much one the the the development time is extremely fast right so so developing a a pwa is a lot faster than developing a native app um that's from experience i think like people might argue otherwise but in my experience it's just a lot faster than developing it and now if you want to release the app it's also a click pretty much a case of like if you're using firebase anyway it's going to be firebase deploy in the cli and boom like your app is your up is pretty much you do npm run build first don't forget that guys uh and then you do then you do firebase deploy because i know how many times that caught everyone out um so that's going to be pretty much done but if you go ahead and create a say like you make some changes to an app version now you're going to have to go ahead and create and bump the version create another bundle uh deploy it so you on ios you do something called test flight and things like that you can do a bunch of different things i can't actually remember what test flight how we use it but but i used test flight in the past and then you basically go ahead and you have to get approval in the app store and the play store play store is generally more easy going the app store is a little bit more hard going and then you get to release your app right so there's a whole process kind of involved sure you can make it quicker um and you can actually get quite quick with that but use a lot of setup and things like that involved whereas on react is extremely fast and now react the benefit of a pwa is um if you develop a pwa if you can actually on on safari you can click on the little bottom button one with the little sort of arrow pointing up and you can actually click add to home screen on ios and i think you do the same for android and guys that actually kind of pretty much installs the app on your phone and when you open it that way it doesn't have now no longer the sort of um browser looking for it's like it's pretty much a native app at that point right so not many people know that but if you go ahead and do add to home screen you get a native app experience and if you deploy you're now getting the realtime sort of sort of uh deployment uh iteration uh benefit of using a pwg um pwa right so it's going to help you out in that sense but but obviously with that said it's not a native app native apps have a lot of uh sort of pros to using them as well you can tap into the sort of graphics card a lot more you can do a lot more sort of power intensive things you can sort of get to be fair you get the pwas are getting a lot more powerful but um there are pros and cons in our times for example push notifications on ios on a pwa you don't have that right which is why you usually opt for text messaging like twilio or something like that whereas when you're using um a react native you can push notifications and you can do something like firebase cloud messaging to make it work right so that's going to be um so that's going to be something to remember okay now with that said uh what we what we're going to do now is we're actually going to go ahead and build a react native app together with expo and sort of see how that goes and we can go through and run through the teething issues and this and that right um so now let's go ahead and do this so i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen and boom there we go so we got my screen going so i'm gonna move you guys a little bit out of the way for a sec and then i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna assume imagine like you're fresh you don't have a single idea about where to begin with this stuff so we're going to go ahead and do it together right so i'm going to go here i'm just going to type in react native right and i'm going to click on this right it's react native and we're going to pretty much it's very it's actually pretty simple to get up and running with this you could get started prerequisites blah blah blah interactive examples you can go ahead and this is expo they have these really nice things i think this is called snack uh is this the snacks that they talk about um i'm kind of still like yeah so that's an embedded snack okay so embedded snack nice one that looks a little bit more like i think if you click the edit or something it brings up kind of like um some kind of like uh yeah i think there like kind of like a small nice awesome so you get like a little vs code trainer cool man so this is this is awesome and what you can actually do is if you click on ios and you click tap to play i think they actually they actually have cloud devices that run so right now i'm queued up in a position so you can actually run this on a um a sort of a free web source thing so look it's actually running on an ios app right now um or on some sort of like cloud phone or something it says device connected and this is a great this is a great way if you put put this up on github or part of your portfolio it's good to have this because someone can just click on it and they can actually run your real app and so it's like you don't you don't necessarily need to have all the stuff approved on apple or anything like that you can just have um like a project that anybody could look at it's very it's very powerful when someone can click and start playing with your app exactly yeah and guys think about it like imagine if you if you could demo your app like this right it's really powerful right so you can go ahead and um let me just move my face because right now on uh youtube i think they can't see it so if i go ahead and hide my face so you guys can see this you say try edit um try editing me one two three if i go ahead and say try enemy someone say yo it's your boy papa react right and then it's i don't even have to hit save and it just kind of dynamically works right and now that's actually running on on a on an ios device right now you see like we didn't have to do any sort of setup right snacks are pretty much a cloud environment everything works out of the box and you can also test it on the web and android and this is another thing if you're doing development or you've never done any kind of native development you will know that setting up the development environments naturally without expo can be quite painful so you're gonna have to set up a bunch of prerequisites and bunch of sort of prework to go ahead and get that working and um this saves you a lot of headache when it comes to sort of as uh so what's the advantage of using react native cli over expo so why why do people even use it in production environment and why don't we use just uh expo every single web i don't see people using xp everywhere so yeah could you just mention that good question so firstly expo was relatively newer so well i mean it didn't really catch on as much until like now because when i was using it dude that's exactly what the case was right so i wasn't actually using expo i was using um the react native cli to be honest i had no mention of expo on the site and plus it depends on where you're going into so imagine you go into a company and bedan has um actually just emailed you shrika so i think you have you have a client going on right now so go ahead and check your inbox but imagine you're going to a company and they've been around for a while they've got everything working you want to actually go ahead and and sort of just fit into their sort of current workflow you know you don't want to be like yeah let's revamp everything to use export they'll be like no we've got everything working with android studio and and xcode and the simulator and also it may be more painful to set up but once you have everything set up with xcode and android studio it's still actually pretty good as as an environment but expo is actually export is is really good um but i've actually had quite a lot of success even with using um x uh x x code and android studio um but i was talking about expo yeah good question with the expo do you get like live reloads when you're like coding on on vs codes yes you do yeah and i'll show you i'll show you um because we're going to set everything up now so so we can go ahead and show you but you get everything you still get live reloading hot reloading all that stuff um you get all of this so everything you saw in this little demo that we showed right here you're going to be getting that same functionality um in expo yeah so you don't really need you don't really need android studio though yeah so this is the benefit so anyone who's worked with xcode or android studio before you will know that it it can be clunky there can be sort of like an update and that one update can it's like a couple of gigs sometime and it can kind of stop you from working and it just puts you in a really annoying middle ground whereas with expo what you can do is you can pretty much use their sort of i think it i don't know i mean like i think it's a simulator or something i can't really remember how i haven't used it enough to sort of give you a solid answer on it but the point is it's a lot easier to get up and running with expo than it is with the react native cli um and also once also yeah and also on expo remember you can also always use the expo app on your current uh device and then as you're updating it it'll live reload on your actual app yeah okay on your actual phone yeah oh that's awesome oh yeah yeah yeah yes it will work on cli but it's actually it's very quick to set up with expo yeah i could technically have an apple phone and an android phone like side by side and have it live reload on both and just mess it up yeah they even actually show this in one of their videos they're like hey check this out and they have like an ipad and iphones and it's like yeah it goes across the street yeah that's awesome and i guarantee if i said to you like right i'm going to start a timer and i want you to do it why won't one person do it with this here and then uh let me go ahead and mute whoever that is i can't see my thing frank i think uh yes if i gave two people a timer and i said right go ahead and set up um on and like if i said like an ipad an ios and a different phone and then go ahead and set up that with the cli and then go ahead and stay up with expo the person using export will win by a long shot trust me like it will be so much quicker and then the benefit of this also is like imagine like pedro was building an app right imagine he has a client he's building an app they want a react native app and then imagine like that client said hey like where are we at by the way like work is any any update on the app right now typically what you would do is you could share your screen and do it that way so that's going to be that's going to be cool right i guess it will it will show up running and things like that and as but what if you want to give them that actual kind of you know that that look and feel and they want to play with it themselves and break things and mess around with it so you could be like yeah scan the qr code and imagine that like then they scan it on their phone or you send the qr code to them they scan it on their phone now they get to actually go ahead and play and fill the app which is a whole different experience so obviously like just seeing somebody sharing an app on the on on a website or on a phone is one thing but once you get your phone and you're actually going there going ahead and scrolling through it that's going to be a whole different experience right and then that actually sort of wins that trust a lot easier so cool yeah yeah so that's going to be really powerful so now you can see here's pretty cool as well so we had a question earlier about functional components first classbased components they show you both example here in in so this is how you'd write a classbased component and this cellular function component um functional component so for those of you who don't know about the differences we have if i would recommend we rewatching a lot of the old coaching calls as well because we talk about we talk about this lot like a huge amount throughout some of the coaching calls the difference is how to write one to the other and things like that and go back um so they've been recorded and um but remember most people will say yeah i mean class components are old you don't need to know that only learn functional components i will say to you do not go with that approach i know it's the way that we all want to go because functional components is the best and they're nice and they're fresh and clean and yes if you're writing a new component 100 right in a functional component if you wrote in a classbased component i would kind of like jump through my computer and slap you i'm joking i'm kidding i'm not going to do that but the point is the point is is that you want to go ahead and write in function component but if you go into a company i can guarantee you they're going to have a bunch of like a lot of code which is going to be classbased okay and and you're going to need to work with classbased components so you're going to need to to make sure that works so we're going to go down to getting started where is it um uh we did this before i i couldn't even find against either so we've got core components um i'm gonna click where the heck is the getting started but environment setups out of the development environment okay here we go so expo cli so npm install dash g so i'm gonna open up a terminal make it super big for you guys see let's go ahead and also if you're not using spectacle make sure you download it it's really really handy tool so you can go ahead and just do like a lot of this stuff like rearranging your screen very quick um so it's really handy so i'm gonna do mpm install dash g expo cli which npm dash g install dash g music install that globally so it's going to install across your computer so you don't have to pretty much worry about if you want to use expo commands you can then use things like expo and knit and that will go ahead and allow you to set up an app um brian reading says i've got a question shoot dude on youtube if i see them on youtube i'll try and answer as many as i can um okay so and this is also another question so this is a really good one actually so debasis gracias says is mac required to develop and publish an ios app built using react native so this typically was the breaking point for ios developers so before you kind of needed to have a mac to to write an ios app right you kind of you did you needed like a mic because you needed xcode and if you didn't have xcode like tough you can really do it so you you might get this also guys you might get this error you need to do sudo whenever you do a global install so i'm going to write sudo then i'm going to go ahead and pop in the password there we go um so yeah and another another thing here that people always kind of get confused here sudo what it does is it gives you administrator access to your computer and then when it says password uh this is old school like unix so it doesn't like move forward as you're typing it stays in place so type in your normal password for your computer and it will stay in place and then press enter yeah a lot of people get stuck here like oh how does this work like that's one of the top stack overflow questions for react native exactly it really is actually the top one well one of the top ones one top 10 for sure damn yeah because because that's actually one of those things that i remember when i was first learning in terminal i was like why is nothing coming like nothing's coming on there and then the more i got familiar with linux and unix or stuff you kind of get familiar with that but yeah and this was a password if you don't mind [Laughter] see that's what you gotta watch out for guys that's what we call fishing it's like it's i love maravan yeah yeah i love mm365 that's it um right so what motherboard and an intel i7 cpu yeah 700k and what i did was i installed hack and toss on it yeah so like from past one year i it was on mac uh mac os mohawk and like last week i just updated it to catalina nice for ios 14.1 development yeah yes you can smooth we have no problem so it's also very cheap like indian 35 000 rupees you know i was able to create a cpu like with the full pledge nice awesome dude yes you can go the macintosh route um one thing i did want to mention which was the question that was asked before by that uh debauches gracias was that if you don't have a mac right the journey doesn't end there anymore because you have expo all right so expo now unlocks that development so you can then actually carry on with the development you can still build ios app you still got android app you still build a web app all through expo which is really game changer from before a lot of people didn't need um so kgf leak here says yes you need a mac no you don't you don't actually need a mac anymore you can actually still write the code and what you might be able to do is test with an android phone and then publish it to a snack test on one of their cloud sort of ios devices and that would work perfectly and it would work in sort of the way you expect it so you can go around that now uh which is here you still need a mac yes exactly so that's for react native cli you're going to need a mac yeah so that's going to be it it gets even better than this so so like what we do is um i set up a ci environment continuous integration nice so what that allows me to do is as i'm i'm doing everything to do with the code i'm able to push it up on github and then it automatically creates all of this stuff and then pushes it all the way to the test flight the thing that we were talking about before that's a way that you can use uh to test apps on on ios so not only do you not even need a mac like you don't even need any of it so amazing yeah you can do it automatically so um just you know this is the new way of doing it this is why it's very powerful this is why we're talking about it so javascript everywhere literally yeah up and down the whole stack so literally you guys know like you don't need a mac anymore that's a myth if you need uh publishing rights it's not 99 anymore i'll show you exactly how to do it um so that's good exactly you can also use a virtual virtual machine not not actually because it's like apple has a like one part of apple that's a little bit tricky is you have to create a certificate it's called a certificate yeah that certificate um it does require certain things it's it's a little bit harder to do there are services that will produce a certificate for you now so you don't even need a mac like that was the last thing holding it out certificate is something that you must use from apple to sign an app to put it up on the app store yeah and also virtual virtual environments get a bit clunky guys like i know they sound ideal but they like i've used them before and i've had to um but if now that i know about this other stuff that's out there i really would stay away from a virtual environment to be honest um there's a lot more other better solutions out there and like frank said if you if you want to go in the route of like devops and things like that or just as a hobby i would really recommend it because i i am pro that with frank because i did the same i set up a bunch of ci and it's so cool when it get when you get it working like you literally push your code and it just does this it does that it does everything else and then at the end of it you've just got all of your stuff that you would have done manually done for you so you can pretty much make it and that kind of goes into the automation world and sort of that sort of side of things but um really valuable by the way as a developer to know that um stuff it's really really like a selling point you can actually market yourself really well as a devops kind of slash full stack um so it helps it helps with your freelance freight also yeah because if you're able to do more things it's like yeah of course i wouldn't want anyone to want to learn that just off the bat if that's not what you want to do but you know you're you're a javascript developer and react developer then you start doing some mobile stuff and then you keep progressing and then one of the final things is being able to have a selfdeploying app so that's that's how you kind of level up this whole this whole thing exactly yeah exactly i just have a quick question go for it so here and i want to become a very good uh react and react native developer right yeah and i'm pretty sure that even frank could relate to this so what would be the ideal roadmap for someone like me who is just starting off with react and you know what would be my approach so should i start with classes should i start with functional components and how should i pretty uh you know progress up in that so that you know one day i can uh like even today i can of course go for a cl to a client for all that kind of stuff but right now i want to master react and react native right so what what could be the ideal roadmap for someone like me yeah there's this awesome youtube channel called clever programmer um love it carry on dude go for it i've heard of it um i think it's a really nice prank no i think i think part of it i think part of it is you know some of what sunny was talking about before right like the way that a lot of us got introduced to you know how sunny was doing it was by clones so there is an equivalent in the react native world for the clones so like start checking out some of the the stuff that they're doing try to see like the kind of newer ones uh the ones that are using expo actually the folks from expo they make clones too on expo there's a instagram expo it's like a very full featured uh clone of instagram all built in expo so it's almost like well you want to level up try to try to think about you know that same mentality like projects that are kind of already done um and then take little bits and pieces right deconstruct it try to do it yourself like follow along um so that's a react native route and you know what what sunny is doing you know with with the cone apps on um in in react it's it's the same thing it's like the more projects you do you'll see like you know like doing this this project with you know with the with the fires around me and like all that stuff like building that stuff in expos it's very powerful and if you have access to a device you can see it happening so you can see that red thing that it gives you react native it's like this terrible like this terrible screen that shows you like it just crashes right yeah it shows you how to deal it's it's way worse than just regular react yeah um it's just it's seeing kind of what projects are out there um following along some tutorials like little small stuff but that's that's how you level this part up right because i know that you you're looking at some some stuff like look at like the big projects and then kind of work backwards from there exactly like it literally take on more for everything that frank had pretty much said right now and uh while i'd add to it it's pretty much a case of like in terms of actionable points it there's there's literally like 20 i think 20 25 clones on clever programmer each one targets a different challenge in a different way um so i would recommend that like if you if you kind of feel that like you're hitting a lot of similarities um then go ahead and type check out like a completely different so for example the amazon fiveday challenge right that one we did uh stripe payment processing we used cloud functions on the backend we did loads of react front end we done firebase we did authentication everything was inside that build even um estate management with the react context api so we had loads of stuff that was involved in that build what i would recommend for you to do is go ahead and and one build up your pattern recognition by doing the builds right that's going to be the number one best way of just like dialing in on what is needed when do i how do i navigate between pages because you're always going to have these questions but when you actually put them into use cases that's when you're going to be dialing it in and sort of nailing you'll answer a ton of your own questions through them builds um you also run into like frank said you run into a lot of the bugs yourself like where uh react react js itself is very friendly with bugs right it's very quite like it's quite like easy to quickly spot a bug kind of fix it wouldn't say easy but you're going to get into situations where it's kind of like a bit more straightforward react native on the other hand is a lot more painful so what i would recommend is build your stamina with react and then kind of get very comfortable about debugging situations for a lot longer periods of time with react and then go towards react native because react native i definitely feel like you need a lot more patience and sort of um and um yeah patience is the word that would go with the full react native i've been into debugging situations where it's a lot more painful debugging and react native and react native also the dependencies for react when you let's say you install firebase in react you would just do npmi firebase right then you now have firebase inside your app uh if you're doing it with a react native you're gonna need to install the ios dependencies the android dependencies and then you're gonna have some additional kind of steps now there are there is documentation to do that but remember it might work perfectly fine on ios and then android will present its own weird bug so there are things like that that's why i kind of say build your stamina with with react which is a lot more easier to handle this stuff and then go forward and and dive into react native um but what you're doing right now preentry is you're being practical so you're actually going ahead landing clients you're not letting that become a block because i guarantee most people on the call right now don't get disheartened that like i don't know enough so i'm not going to put myself out there i would i would flip the script and put yourself out there and figure it out on the job honestly because it's yeah right now i wouldn't say that i'm i'm like i'm good i'm just a beginner that reacts but what do you see quite a lot of times happening is that you know there are going to be clients who want to learn html css javascript right so if you know even if you know html today like standing in one of his calls told us that you know if you know how to make a web page and if you know how to put up a landing page if you can teach that to someone else they can tell you yeah and yeah it's it does seem over exaggerated uh to a certain level but it's not trust me it's not because i i was able to land lines for web development and i wouldn't say that i'm a master web development so i think that anyone else could do it too so if you can you know like make some basic web pages and if you can learn javascript it trust me it hardly takes like a week to learn about html css and maybe a month at max to get good with javascript yeah and yeah i highly agree on the point that you mentioned about you know teaching and taking action and right now i'm gonna try to do that myself so i'm gonna pull up some you know react stuff up and uh i'll check it out sure amazing yeah 100 and just action it move forward with it and every day just make sure that you're either like contributing to it like some kind of build or something practical um because remember theory is like something that we kind of and that's the traditional education system teaches through theory and very little practical flip it just do practical and kind of pick up the theory when and as you need it right and that's gonna really kind of be a lot more beneficial to you and it means that your time is spent a lot better and and you're going to get a lot more return quicker i like to call it the applied computer science yeah like that's so theoretical it's like shut up i just yeah applied yes funny thing is you find out most professors who teach cannot even code to save their lives yes yes they can yeah yeah they can't and my school i found out my professor he had the tas teaching assistants who are you know know what they're doing they would rather uh be the ones to do the recitation so he just has the slices used for decades and just shows them and explains the same stuff and then you go to the recitation and then the tears are the one that will actually help you fix stuff yeah yeah exactly exactly it's like another really good thing about expo is that what we were just showing you with these snacks uh the snacks can be public so there are there's people that publish the snacks and then you can kind of see like okay that's how they did this this is how they did the header part and some people always underestimate the power of going to github and just reading some food up and you know you should do that quite a lot of times like just look at some files and then with pattern recognition again it comes along the way and i think that helped me yeah yeah like like look up like for instance like uh like a firebase expo snack yeah and look that up and if it's not updated i'll update one i'll create one myself i've had expo forever so um it's a good starting place and i think a lot of people will get value from it because then you'll start seeing like what's similar what's different some of the complexities and then run the code on your on your device you're like oh wow i can log in i can do this and that so it it's like we can technically most of what sunny was creating with um what's with some of these cones like maybe not the stripe one because that one has like a little bit different way of doing it but most of the other ones like the twitter clone and you know all of the clones you're able to turn that into like a react native expo experience yes so those kind of things are very very interesting and the the expo snacks are most of them are open most of them have people some of them aren't that good but some of them are really good they have different stars you know they have stars like just like github and check some of them out even though the guys from expo like i said their blog creates a lot of really interesting stuff like the push notifications they they did one with like the guys from pusher that's like another service that's not um that's not uh that that's not firebase that you can get exposed to that all kinds of different things and a lot of the stuff is like there for you for you to check out yeah so right now i'm actually focusing a lot on react so i i what i want to do is get my foot dirty and react first and once i'm quite comfortable with react i started looking to uh react native and try to build my own mobile app one day and uh yeah i definitely take that piece of advice that you just said frank and yeah i highly appreciate it thanks guys nice um one more question where we can use utilize this uh snack dot expo dot io where uh for from uh for building from scratch or uh we can um we can put the code and test it over there building a complete app there or how we can use it you can build you can build a complete act app except for a couple there's a couple small things you can't do so anything that's kind of like ui base is pretty pretty good but some of the stuff and expo snacks they don't have quite all the firebase stuff from the last time i checked all the firebase stuff that's like native um that's not like fully fully solved but they're getting they're getting pretty close um but you can do a lot of stuff there and then and then you run it on your own device like what we were saying before yeah yes we test it okay thank you very much exactly hey sonny hey you did just one more question yep uh like uh uh while we were discussing all these stuffs i just went to slag snack dot expo and i just played with the code and i felt like wow this is react native i mean you just replace a div with the view and then the text and all those things so exactly yeah that's right so what i wanted to ask is uh so if i say that i know uh react uh basics and intermediate stuff like redux and redux sagas and all those stuffs along with all my html and css and all those css and gs skills so what else do i need to transition from that react mindset to react native mindset um so this actually is a good question what i would say is simplify it right so you've already you already know react um think of what um what what frank was just talking about now like the practicality overrides everything so literally go ahead just kind of dive in and look at some of the snacks that are released because like you said like just by looking at a snack you just quickly realized like you quickly defeated that fear right you were like oh my god they're just replacing a div with a view and honestly that's kind of how it goes right like it's it's very small differences um and then you kind of build up from that um and then like rather than using react ruler you use react and native navigation and there's there's small differences like that but the main thing is is that like i would say just go ahead and and and look at the project and maybe set yourself like a little startup project right so maybe i'll start a project where you're going to need some kind of authentication some kind of navigation and and those kind of things and then just dive into it because honestly like again what you kind of asked there was what theory do i need to know flip it and instead just run head first and do practical and you will answer those questions you'll build up the theory that you need to know um through the actual practical application and thank you so much rika he says hey guys i'm back after reading some lunch oh damn i thought he was leaving um no just a lot of practical talk pretty much um about what you need to like how practical approaches to to um uh to sort of your learning is going to be a lot more uh a lot more beneficial um debashis says thanks only for answering my question i always thought that mac is required to build and publish an ios app but as you said it's no longer needed now this m this makes react me a very powerful yes that makes rea expo in react native very powerful to be a to be super clear uh yeah but you're welcome dude i'm gonna i'm gonna drop a link here for the uh this this guy's name is evan bacon he works for the the guys at expo and he did he did this like massive instagram clone it also includes like crazy stuff like he has like filters in it like you could do a lot of crazy stuff with with expo yeah that's crazy like i've tried it myself and i was like oh my goodness it's gonna take a lot of time yeah check out check out this um check out this this website uh sorry this uh there's also there's also a stepbystep kind of um guide on on their blog it's a little bit outdated so i'm not sure you know i think it was from last year or something like that but there might have been newer things but check out that project it's like you want to know what you could do with with expo you can do a lot exactly yeah you can and then duke is excellent it was only two you said it does look like instagram it was only until you said that frank oh wait have you uh let me go ahead and check this out one second i was just looking at something um okay they've got a demo let me go ahead and try to share my screen i'll share with you guys also publish some blogs about uh react native on clever programmer you know like we all also guys if you're not already reading those vlogs and please check them out we really put a lot of time into it and now i'm thinking of making some content about uh you know blogs about react native i'm gonna do that very soon nice dude is this frank is this using um uh react native or is this yeah this is the it's actually really interesting this is uh the the exfol web version right so they actually have it on if you look at the repo it has like the ios and all that stuff so you could run it um this is kind of like if you if you have it on your um on your if you if you clone it and then put it on your like your own device on expo right it does it does like a bunch of stuff it's it's actually pretty nuts nice yeah oh dope dude so this is actually going to the the web sort of one yeah so they broke it out into three pieces web uh android ios um yeah see look you see like the that's the right components navigation screen and you guys check you can just pretty much look at how they like you might be wondering how do they handle permissions dive into their code you can see look there's some kind of permissions here yeah exactly so it's like you know it allows you to to say hey yes um camera permissions audio recording so then you could like record a little video like this app does quite a bit of stuff exactly yeah so you can pretty much see it here and this is to be honest like uh and you might look at this and be like oh my god it's class based but to be honest like the main thing the main thing is is that there it's showing you how to use it right it's showing you how to go ahead and and you can see they've got a bunch of things they've got some kind of gate action sheet provider audio mode connector and like all of this stuff you can then go ahead and dive into that code and check out so this is actually a really good way of um sort of like widening your breadth and knowledge when it comes to react native um but yeah i would definitely say go ahead check and check that out that looks pretty cool though dude i have a question for frank can we do some programming uh in uh for example if i'm making a video i want to program it you know you know one scene is there then i can click and i will do something but i click here i will do something there is it possible uh in a video using our react or react native or any tool well i'm not sure of your question so you like like to create like i'm i'm streaming we i'm making a streaming video right moving any more short movie okay okay when i click at a particular point during a movie so it will create it will give me an open my app something like that um something you know i think i'm sorry are you saying to record like uh like a video for that of your app working or what what am i no no no i created a movie like we are recording right now right we made this movie after completion of this movie i want to add cc into it and say here what we are talking i want to translate and script in the bottom okay how do i do that so you could you you could make programming so you could make an app right which takes some kind of video source so you can upload some kind of video file to it you could then look at um some kind of library which which could be like i would recommend searching for a library what was that i know a really good way to do this okay go for it dude yeah what you would first want to do is uh okay so create the app okay and then it maybe would ask for like um a video file or maybe a youtube link if you uploaded it to youtube then i i mean it includes like google cloud and stuff like uh if you feed it once you do it in the back end it will send that to um google cloud and then google cloud can do a transcript and then you can also use their nlp api so you can like cross check and see if it's generating the right words and then you can use like cloud translate to translate the different to get different languages and stuff yeah dude that's clever that's smart actually another thing is because my purpose is little bit different for example while um he's talking about sun is talking about react so when he's talking about react there will be a logo of react on the backhand side of it and when i click react logo it will launch uh you know something on react right so what happened what i would recommend here is is to be honest i would i would like to completely honest i would say you want to just it's more of a different approach here i would recommend rather than doing anything like that i would simplify everything and and and build up your skill set in a video editing software uh because because the truth is and then there's host it on youtube and have uh react like icons kind of moving at that point and then you can on youtube you can actually have an overlay at that timestamp where it's clickable that would be my approach if you want to do something like that um you can go ahead and custom build this stuff um so that you can have it but it's it's going to be a bigger app like you're kind of building now like a video editing kind of app which which there's no straightforward answer to you're gonna have to like break down each feature of the app build it out it's not a case of like answering if i want this to kind of like you know kind of move around here how do i do that you're gonna have to kind of work out how do you get this element on the screen how do you interact with the element do you want drag and drop features you see like there's a lot more to break down from that sort of a use case um but guys while we're all sort of like still uh we've still got some energy let's dive into expo right so we spoke a lot about expo today um so we installed expo cli so what i'm going to do is i've just cd into a directory so i'm going to go ahead and say expo init and then i'm going to say exponent i'm just going to say demo app right i'm going to do enter and this is going to go ahead and it says okay we got blank a minimal app is clean as an empty canvas we've got typescript so a bunch of typescript cool stuff happening um i think it was my last coaching call yeah my last coaching call everyone who's interested in typescript go ahead and watch that last one because we delve into a bit of typescript stuff which is pretty cool um yeah i love that yeah make sure you do then go ahead and check it out it should be uploaded um and uh it's gonna be it was pretty cool we ran through some typescript stuff so make sure you do that and then here we're going to go ahead and do um i'm going to do manage workflow blank so i'm going to click on enter and then it's going to download uh using npm to install packages and it will install some dependencies and stuff hopefully at this point everything doesn't break and it kind of goes well um but i'm going to pull up the chat while this is happening so i can see what's going on i also like uh figuring out like how my partner used firebase actually so yeah how you did like uh npmi firebase tools for react and like npm i firebase yep that that's literally what he used oh he used okay so this is a question this is the reason why i was asking this right is you can use that um there are some pros and cons to use like the rn firebase audio to help them out a bit with like some firebase functions okay right okay yeah because you can definitely yeah you can use the the remember react native is still javascript so you can actually use the javascript um sort of libraries with it but react native firebase.io whatever that url is i'm just typing react native firebase library and it'll come up on google that stuff is going to be um uh it's built they've considered other things for example when you log in wait like if you notice whenever we built a clone when you log in and you refresh the app or you kind of come back to the page it will have a sort of initial split second and then it will log you in because it has to kind of cache or check the server and it'll kind of like grab your login details and they'll kind of log you in or like you'll check if there's a cookie store and if if that cookie is signed and and not expired and then i'll log you in right now on the react native library packages there's most likely going to be a frank just dropped it in the chat as well so make sure you go check that um but in the react native one most likely it does a lot more sort of deeper level of caching or another layer of caching so you don't get that like glitchiness and it kind of works seamlessly like you would expect to do so there are reasons to use it but as um shrika showed us like you can use the the sort of regular javascript packages there's nothing wrong with that but just know that there are some differences and there are reasons why you would want to use the um the the sort of packages or libraries like the react native firebase one for example firebase only offer some stuff for example cloud messaging to native platforms which means that you're gonna have to install that kind of library anyway um otherwise you won't be able to access that a b testing remote config all that cool firebase stuff um you need to go ahead and do that so yeah also like another thing is because like uh the react native firebase that kind of like gave him a little bit more issues that's why he kind of used the yeah instead so so this is a that's actually a really good topic um and to quickly touch base on so um yeah so as freaky said like you're going to run into more of more kind of resistance when you're using the react native libraries because there's it's no longer just a simple install command you now have to do ios dependencies and something like pod in store so you have to install ios pods and stuff like that then you have to install um android and you have to mess with i think it's gradle i remember i'm quite it's been a while since i touched that yeah yeah it's like is that great or stuff yeah you're gonna have some kind of dependencies for android but you have to like cd into each one and do an install ios is definitely pod in store and things like that but then the thing is right install might work and then you go to android install and it breaks so you're gonna have to like debug the two separate things and then it comes together and then it works so it's not as quick setting it up but remember a lot of people have put like a lot of love and soul into into these libraries and uh and they work and and huge teams have come together to make it work and they've ironed out a lot of the problems so i would recommend using it but if you run into a situation where you can't use it for whatever reason you can't you've been debugging for ages the first thing i'll say is find a mentor that you can kind of jump to don't quit but the second thing is don't let that be a blocker like like for example shriek is a perfect example he didn't let it block him he had a time frame imagine if you have a client and they they're willing to pay you money or and it's a case of you're going to lose that client if you don't learn that job i would pretty much say just use whatever you can use and slowly slowly you will get better with that step with that tech stack but you're going to lose the opportunity if you don't do anything all right so i would say make it work and then yes like i guarantee like i look back at old code now and i'm like god damn it why did i do that why did i like that's a terrible way of doing it um but you're the only way you're gonna learn it's the only way that you're actually gonna progress is the only way that you're actually gonna go ahead and um and and do that right um oh frank i sent you a dm on slack you said frankie diem on slack yeah yeah uh quick question about the architecture of the reg native do we use um do you use recruiter for on rec native or does it have a different way of like changing from page to page um so you don't use react router on on react native use react native navigation and there's also there's like a battle of which best navigation library to use but i remember we switched our previous workplace from one of the popular ones to react native navigation and then that picked up quite a lot so a lot of people use react native navigation um there are a few it's good to know those good question there are a few different uh navigation libraries whereas with the react uh js so react.js meaning uh the sort of web stuff that's going to be pretty much react each time so recruiter is a lot more sort of in the lead on that front but um or you'll have something like next js um and that's going to be a bit different you know yeah sunny sunday we should cover next year's yeah we should we should definitely do maybe like some server side sort of stuff because that's a whole other way of thinking server side rendering it it can really it can throw you off a bit like it can be a bit kind of confusing and i was like oh my what all do i have to do i was like okay let's just get back to basics of react yeah exactly when we go and uh for any work like that you know they need a lot of things together and it is very difficult to remember each and everything expect in in an interviews so how do you prepare your preparings only based on the questions or you do do you prepare yourself you know one at a time like if you are going it means i have a two skills like react and angular both right then it is very difficult for me to grasp both so remember firstly the chances are yeah the chance i wouldn't want i wouldn't try and master react in angular because you're kind of conflicting two different libraries like as in i would i would focus on like because you're okay put it this way if even if you did do really good with both imagine what you would do if putting all your effort to one right and and i'd recommend react because of the market demand and things like that now what you want to do is you want to change your mindset and approach to the situation as opposed to the way you're looking at it right now which is um you know like there's so much to learn like isn't there so much what do i go into the interview with and things like that like remember we we want to move away from this theory mindset right of like you know like i need to know this i need to know this i need to know that move away from that and instead get practical handson experience right get practical handson yeah and and sort of run into the debugging situations yourself realize okay i needed react router to to overcome pagering and things like that i needed i ran into a state management problem at which point redux was the answer and redux allowed me to solve this problem now what happens is you have a wide breadth of knowledge which is which has been ingrained so deep because that debugging session lasted six hours when you had to figure it out right and then whereas if you read it simply in a medium article yeah sure you might have understood it in that one hour but i can guarantee debugging it for six to eight hours or something like that or a week sometimes it's taken me a week to sort of overcome some problems before um and i tell you i never forget that that week and what i learned because the pain and the sort of you know doubting yourself and all the sort of trauma that it gives you um that stuff is what really like that you really learn right like it's just like if you're riding a bike and you trip up on the bike and you really like break your leg i can guarantee you're going to ride your bike a little bit better from that moment on so you don't do the same thing right and you're never going to forget that so it's the same with coding like you really just and i would say take it with that approach and you'll be very much more susceptible to answering questions um that get thrown at you and remember like frank said if you don't know the answer to a question it's only honestly better to say like look i don't know the answer to that but show that you're openminded so that you can kind of approach it differently or try and like readjust the question and be like okay but maybe were you talking about like state management so say somebody asked a question about redux and you had no idea about what redux is then you could be like okay i haven't actually used redux but um but but you're talking about state management within an app right and then they can then you can kind of like direct the conversation around that and then you can be like okay so yeah and then you might have used something else so i actually had this question from me and i had i hadn't used redux but i had used something called flux uh and i redirected the question to flux instead and i was like yeah so i would actually do that um and i would and and i'm happy to learn redux and pick it up if it's what is used in this situation yeah play play to your strengths especially like if you're kind of just getting started it's this is what everybody and this call needs to understand it is a rare day that that someone asks you something extremely advanced for a position that's you know getting started right react is kind of new it's like it's been around it's been battle tested but it's still kind of new so don't don't like worry about like what the recruiters are telling you or like the hr people are telling you like oh you need to have 20 years of react it's like what are you talking about it doesn't exist right so try to get past the people that are the gatekeepers that are saying like you need 20 years of react and say hey i'm really really strong here's my beautiful portfolio here's my amazing like you know my my amazing uh resume that frank helped me with like this is this is gonna look amazing and then it you start getting past the people that are like the gatekeepers and then you get to the person who who was like interviewing and then when you're there with the interviewer and say hey like are you gonna make me invert a binary tree to change like the color of a button like this just be real this is like this is this can't you know it has to match like if you're if you're only offering like you know like a more entrylevel kind of like salary it's like don't expect me to invert binary trees and no you know be like one of the core contributors of you know redux because that doesn't match up because i understand that like in the beginning um it's more forgiving but always be really persistent because like sometimes the gatekeepers which is like the human resource folks or the recruiters and stuff like that they don't know anything about programming yeah they 100 don't so they're looking for all these like keywords inside your resume i know how to mess with those algorithms to put the keywords in who cares if you know it or not right get to the person who is the person that you want to talk to and have a strong portfolio strong resume and that'll get you to to to that that place that you're talking you guys are talking about exactly that's right that's golden man because honestly then this is a real truthful point is if you imagine you're not surrounded by anyone or any developer community or any sort of mentor right now imagine if a recruiter's job is to land you in a position because they get commission on a perm every time someone lands a job right so if angular is hot right now even if react is what you should be learning if angular is hot they're going to push you to angular they're going to be like um they're like you need to know angler you need to know this this this you need to know uh sas sas is really important to know sas um and they're just kind of they're like frank says it's all buzz words they just they have no idea how to use this stuff they kind of just like yeah this is this this and then i'm telling you they literally list out things and it's quite funny now like if i jump on a call with a recruiter and hearing them trying to sell me on a react job because they were they're telling me like you need to know this you know you need to know this you need to know this and i'm like oh yeah okay cool cool like i'm just really busy right now i kind of need to go um but the point is is that this is so true like i've seen i've seen up work like um client proposals and all they actually need is just like in a basic html css website and some people are so stubborn about react they'll be like you need to implement react you just need to implement read without any reason at all yeah i haven't played any beginner programming but also do the same project but they will also always make him you know like you need to learn yet and those things i i i don't i never liked those kinds trust me yeah and then the thing you want to be careful about with that is is that you don't want the recruiter to to be the one directing you about what you need to learn or not right because remember they might be telling like as in a recruiter might literally come up to you and say um yeah like uh um like you you'll be you're using react and and yeah you don't want to be like this is a hypothetical for example but they might be like yeah don't touch firebase yeah five nobody uses firebase everyone's using sql server yeah you know don't do that and because you you're not surrounded by a developer community you're not surrounded by anyone you wouldn't know otherwise you'd be like well they're the ones that are landing the jobs they they know right so now you've just lost out on learning about an amazing tour like firebase which will actually be booming trust me in the future like that it has a future ahead of it um and also like firebase it would have sort of talked you towards the nosql route and so you would have picked up no sequel on that journey and it's a fun way to learn it so you would have gone in really easy with little resistance but if you listen to the recruiter then you would have been kind of tempted to go the other way and now your time isn't as well spent and it's also a case of but the ques the main thing is right is that how do you avoid this one surround yourself with the community because then you can quickly validate if it's true or not right you can come to the community and say hey guys like where is it did anyone land a job okay okay what what what like what have you found that you need in that job pretty much and you can kind of you know validate the answer and kind of find out the truth and right now in this if you could ask us right now like what do you think i should learn and i would tell you like like we said build out the clones build out the sort of breakdown the clones what did they consist of you'll start to see the patterns yourself that's going to be the real interesting sort of like that's going to be the sort of golden nugget i'd like to refer to them as and that's going to be the one that's going to land you that position and then forget all the other buzzwords because web development is so trendy that like honestly one thing could come into come into trend tomorrow and then and and everyone's on it and then something else will change and everyone's on that and but the one thing i'll tell you is react is here to stay like as in reactors definitely here to stay it will last here for for a substantial number of years and by that point whatever's next it will be pretty easy to probably transition into it based on the things you pick up with react so that would be my advice towards towards handling all that stuff one thing has happened with me when i was you know verizon was interviewing me uh for a position where this is the major skill set is uh um react and javascript and css these are the you know required screen set but angular was there too and they spent an hour with me in uh javascript yep and um react okay but now they came you know there was a third person who was in good in angular now when he comes to the angular then means i started but i was blank out because it's it's just too much for me to uh give each and every aspect of the questions so even if i tell a little bit tell me more about it but my my brain freezes after some time you know it is very difficult to go back into the programming of angular and then give them a practical usage of angular to be honest what what you've probably experienced there is more of an edge case like if you've gone for a job bro and the job is react um it would either yeah if it would be react then i would if they're using react for one thing angler for another thing i mean in most cases it would typically just stay as react you wouldn't get react and angular in that job right and if and if you do i'd kind of asked him i'd be like well what are you guys doing here like it's like how it's like are you guys attempting to migrate an old angular app and to react that's that's a common thing yeah that's right it's like it's like they're they're the people who know react really well and know angular really well are like i couple dozen people that i know personally and so it's like and those people charge so much for it that it's almost like that's a very specialized kind of use case again like this is all about asking questions like hey guys why in the hell do you have angular and react in one in one interview and also are you going to ask them to invert binary trees to change your your your button colors yeah right so you have to you have to ask them like oh what what would what's the purpose of this is this like an internal tool are you guys migrating from angular to react right like try to because then it's like then they're like okay this person is asking questions that are relevant to what we do it's like ah yeah we have like this old angular app we're trying to get to react because every other part of the enterprise is upgrading it you know we our back end is is this but you know we need some help doing that it's like okay now i know that it's not an angular interview it's like a migration interview it's like well this is kind of how i would approach it i would start encapsulating these functions right this function and then and then to convert that to a functional component and react right it changes the conversation but it makes you it puts you into their mindset of like why they would have such different such different like things inside of one inside of one um they said they acquired couple of the companies that's exactly the number yeah and they want to maintain rising and they buy exactly they buy a lot of crap so it's like yes that's exactly it's migration they said it is a not a migration they said initially you have to add bustle and this is here and there so one time you are in this project okay so it's it's basically what they call it's like it's called the scoop out like this happens a lot of startups they'll buy it whatever technology is currently there they support it for a little bit longer until they know what it does and then they scoop it out yep they take the best parts of it and they scoop it out and it's okay again like that conversation you have with the verizon people if you know this kind of stuff and you talk to people like me that are more senior we kind of know what's going on then then it becomes like you become a better like you become more valuable to them and it's like maybe right now you weren't able to do the angular and the react stuff but maybe you could you know pick up some books or something on or some some some ideas of how to migrate an angular app right so you become better and better and it's okay to go back there in six months and say hey guys you know i know that this position was still there i was thinking about it like here's here just a little quick email and i guarantee you they will probably still have that piece of software there yeah and it was amazing they said can we club the two applications together banana angler and another i'd say absolutely it's uh 200 us dollars per hour yeah exactly we could do anything yeah that means it's uh too much what they ask me of course a tool because again because they don't they don't know it well like yeah they're trying to get they're trying to do the best they can like we have this legacy app that is kind of not fitting into our thing we want to make it we want to make it better i said i told them that there is another tool which is essential which is an extgs then i have to learn that too much is together but without that i can't but i have to learn it what i would say at all is is for the sort of in terms of what you're going to get back in terms of like what you can do now as an actionable point i would say in this case i would say like like frank said there's a there's a small number of people who are really really uh sort of specialized with react and angular right and if they are the chances are that of them being up to date with both is going to be even lower right so they're going to they will either be like they'll know how to transfer one from another now what i would say is if in the case of going ahead and and in that job situation even even i even if they came to me and said like hey something like would you would you mind like migrating this angler app to this reactor to be honest i probably wouldn't take the job like i'd kind of like look elsewhere but there's plenty of jobs out there i'll probably go ahead and i'm i'm more focused on being react specialized as opposed to react and angular and the jackofalltrades right because i know that if i'm really good with react i can charge a premium for that right like i can i can go ahead and i can be like you can charge quite a good uh rate for that as well but like frank said the more there's like a niche specialized area you can charge an immense amount because there's less people but that means there's less opportunity because it's also a niche right which means that like so in terms of what you want to do now i would say spend your time investing into sort of react front and development uh fight find your feet with that stuff first and then kind of move into building a back end um so a lot of the clones we do back in builds then you'll kind of cover a full stack ground have loads of stuff on your portfolio and then push for the react jobs i'd say all full stack jobs i'd say go that route um it's going to benefit you long term it's going to mean that you're you you're going to build some kind of security for the long term as well because imagine angular suddenly dies tomorrow and you've spent all these months um going ahead and learning both and react took over now you've just suddenly wasted not wasted but you pretty much you've lost a lot of time where if you had just drove through one route it's like trying to say i'm going to be the best basketball player the best football player the best tennis player the best cricketer yeah you're never going to be the best on one of them and you're probably not going to be hired by the best team whereas if you're just like i'm going to be the best football i'm going to put every ounce of my effort into that you're probably going to get picked up by a premier league team and you're going to get paid big bucks right and that's going to be the difference between that kind of lifestyle and the guy who's trying to like accomplish everything is immensely different right so you can have immense differences with that yeah and also and also remember the the prime focus for companies is to get as much value as they can from productivity of a developer right so it's like sometimes they'll say really weird stuff just to try to push you in one direction or another direction and it's it might not you have to decide what's good for you not not what's best for the company right because like like you know what sunny was saying is that you could be the best angular person in the world and then angular is not as useful anywhere there's far less jobs so it's like you kind of like limiting yourself versus like focusing on like a more junior kind of react developer position that has more more upside to grow like we've just showed you examples of just all in react you could do uh an amazing web app which i you know i've showed sony this i i made a dashboard for for sonos and then i also i'm building the app for them all this is all together it's all the same code base it's all react so it's like imagine how imagine as a developer how infinitely more productive i am to to them by being able to do those kinds of things versus like if you know if they needed a angular front end and they had to switch to the react native and it's it's all over the place and it's like it's not good to it's hard to switch that context when you're in the middle of like coding yeah it's it's a real pain and it's very hard to do so you're less productive so yeah try to see like try to try to get hired by someone who wants to grow you grow with you in a certain direction don't like whatever they're saying it's like you have to be yet because you have to do the hard work yourself right so you have to be motivated and if you're just if you're just updating an old angular app and trying to do pieces together with sencha and all that stuff you're saying like that's a nightmare it's not fun exactly and the point for a while having that that back and forth decision and usually what they'll try and do is that they'll kind of like either a they'll give up or or b they'll they'll throw a salary up and they'll be like all right yeah we'll pay you x amount don't let that salary determine your decision right because trust me it might seem like oh like this is paying me so much more than than all the other sort of react jobs i'm being offered to at the level i'm at right now but remember it's about like frank said like you're you're going to be infinitely productive if you choose to react real and it's and it's here to stay it's got like a future ahead of it now you've also got the freelancing the coaching that the fulltime jobs you can make a ton of money going in that route whereas this other that you might do yeah sure you're going to get like an extra 10k maybe in salary or something like that but you're going to be limited you're also going to be niched so you're kind of like you're literally putting a box around your skill set as opposed to what you can offer at that point in time whereas if you put the time into dedicated to building out your react skills you're going to be a lot more valuable to a lot more people and that book in its in return will like remember value is what you want to focus on money is the lagging indicator it will come you just focus on your money uh your your value and and everything else kind of follows with it yeah and also imagine the kind of teams that they would have right like you're going to look to your left and to your right and they're not going to teach you react because maybe they're just in you know in in you know some other kind of like more enterprise role which is okay if you want to do enterprise development stuff but it's you might not like i learned the most from other people i work with like i'm working with the team at sonos and they're doing some incredible just crazy just you know top secret ai music stuff like it's incredible but i'm learning from them right and it's like just when you think you can't learn enough or more stuff it's like i'm i'm making a react native app for something that i've been doing for years at this point i've made a lot of apps for movie studios and all this kind of video heavy stuff but i've never done a music thing and i was like okay i guess this is my music thing and okay they let me do it react native somehow i convinced them after showing them sonny's thing right it's like and but i'm but i'm growing as a developer right like i'm not i'm not i'm not stuck in like oh this has to be kind of coded in you know jquery html page right like that's not where you want to be it's like oh like you know i'm i'm growing this way i want to take the company on that journey with me so that more people can help contribute to this code because like once once this is completed all of the other people that are there can learn a lot from this like this app exactly it's like you know once you start seeing how it works and everything like that that's that's what you want to do you want to think about your your future not like their future yeah they don't care because they don't care about you anyways so it's like it's true yeah i haven't focused on react now because it is very hard for me to one in two comes in a react another comes into a uh angler it was very hard for me yeah because i prepared they give only two three days another because i am struggling for the job if we take if we take that if we take that mindset then someone else is going to come with c plus plus and you'll be like ah now i'm going to study c plus plus some somebody comes to java now i'm going to take java i'm going to be uh the best copo programmer in the world yeah the most important things when you're doing freelancing and all that kind of stuff is also it's always going to be saying no right if you're not good at something and if you if you think that you know it's not right for you like trust me i won't i won't ever you know if a client approaches me for a very good sum of money say that a hundred thousand dollars your job for c plus plus right well i wouldn't do it because that's not where i want to go right so saying no is quite quite important and learning to say you know and taking no for an answer is also very important right yeah sometimes it happens that you try your best and you you're not able to you know land that job it's okay like you can just try it again but and also sometimes you have to say no to a client that's approaching you and yeah it has happened with me too like one of one of my clients was about machine learning right it was happening really really recently and i told him frankly that you know i'm not into machine learning and all that kind of stuff so i don't mean that i'll be ideal for you yeah i agree that's another thing everybody wants machine learning yeah everybody wants machine learning you'll see ai it's like wait wait you want machine learning for what oh so you can change this one button and make it blue yeah you guys don't understand like how crazy it is out there because there's such a huge disconnect between the people that build the stuff and the people that are kind of on the business side yeah like the business guys are like hey we gotta make this thing machine learning we gotta do this and that's like for whatever you don't want to complicate it ever like you don't even need to overcomplicate it like machine learning all in terms of yes yes it does apply sometimes but you know it's it's not at all necessary for you to you know like always include machine learning and whatever you're doing i include it in everything now because i just like firebase machine exactly yeah and yeah most of the time the the the use case remember like like there is a disconnect with the two things and you're going to find a situation where somebody might say yeah we want to know machine learning to figure out how many users prefer the red button against the blue button you're like no dude that's called a b testing and and you see like and then it kind of comes down to that and then and then they'll be like oh oh well yeah yeah i want that and then you'll be like yeah i know how to do that and then they'll be like oh okay like that that kind of thing quickly builds the trust in the conversation like that's because firebase does it it's like look it up on facebook yeah whatever firebase supports i am an expert yeah google optimize is good yeah you know like uh suggest some technologies or something to the client and say that yes this might be the better way to do it you know if they're if they're going in the romney and if you show them that you care uh that actually brings up a lot about you talk it does a lot about you and it it makes an entire professional kind of thing right so this is again something that i learned from soft skills so if you're if you get an opportunity to you know improve on some technology or you know if you think that this technology might not be the correct one for the entire job then you can suggest that the client and sometimes the client accepts it sometimes they they don't but at least you try it right so it shows that you're professionally cared exactly exactly guys i did make a machine learning app that does optical recognition so i was like machine learning on the resume nice dude we're actually going to touch on a lot of machine learning stuff once we get into um react native builds and things like that so yeah like there's a lot of like libraries that we can use are going to be really really really handy um so we're going to talk about it does come with a lot of machine learning libraries many people underrate the power of javascript and machine learning some people are always like python but javascript also has tensorflow.js so it's quite it's quite powerful over there too yeah like tensorflow is very powerful um and what you can do with it is actually quite simple like i looked into tensorflow and python once and i i wasn't able to you know find some kind of like big problem in it it's quite simple to learn too yeah exactly it's quite simple to learn and it's going to be super super helpful yeah you know um you could build applications where like say you can build something in react native and then you can have like a powerful machine learning ai in python and just create endpoints and api calls and then connect it into your own application yeah i really would use javascript in that case like personally like javascript and python are quite similar if you're if you think about the syntax like uh deep down of course python is integrated in javascript it's compiled but the thing is that uh you know i don't really think that it's it's quite useful to include two languages when you can easily do the same thing with just one language so why include why like you know boost the complexity and why not just stick to one language exactly and uh to add on to what nathan was saying like yeah like a lot of the time like guys there's services out there that do this sort of like the heavy lifting for us and we just tap in right like we tap into it and we kind of get the benefit of machine learning without doing it it's like the same thing like it's it's just at different levels right like if again it goes back and go going back to date picker example if you have um like you wouldn't rewrite the library to have a date picker right like i wouldn't spend all that time to go ahead and do that i would just go ahead and it's it's crazy hard to make a date yeah it is i had to do one dude it's crazy very tough and yeah it requires a lot of uh you know knowledge how it will navigate yeah there's a lot of headache with it a lot of headache with her um guys how you can handle uh notification via email in um and react we will touch that we'll we'll touch base on it and in another session but you can use plenty of things like sendgrid uh twilio there's a lot of different services you can use expo has that feature also oh nice oh we could yeah i didn't know that oh nice yeah can you send a link for that oh like if you go to expo look at like the it has it has um like the gyroscope all the other functionalities i come with typical app development they're all available yeah all right all right let's npm run ios yeah let's do it all right so now you want to go ahead and do mpm start all right that was suspense guys it's the holy now mpm start and then you get this you get a metro bundler right so this is the first thing you want to kind of get familiar with and wow that's a big qr code and terminal um so what you want to do is once you get this thank you so much oliver says you are the freaking best sunny on youtube appreciate that dude and um what we want to do now is we have um this this terminal come up and this is a good starting point so you can hit i for ios simulator w for run on web i'm going to hit w to run it on the web just to quickly sort of test this it says attempting to open the project in a web browser so we can now go ahead and watch this pop up so it will go ahead and it it'll do a bunch of bundling browser what was that you could also just click run in web browser like yeah so on here you can do it here as well so you can take one web browser run an ios one on android or you it depends like because the reason why i like to show that one is because sometimes you have it open in vs code and you want to control it in vs code um without going back so this is a handy way but yeah you can definitely do that um so now what you want to do is go ahead and i'm just going to do command d to split my oh god damn i hate doing oh man what have i done how do i get rid of the split is it there we go yeah so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to open up a second tab i'm going to go into the same directory so i'm in here right now i'm going to do code insiders because i've got the inside this edition i'm going to open up vs code right so give it a sec and this will pop up okay now we're we're all familiar with vs code we uh if you're not then just go ahead and check out some of the clones but the first thing i want to do is go to extensions over here type in es and then i want to type in this one here so es7 react redux graphql react native snippets right so go make sure you download this one because it's really really handy it's kind of very very understood this one right yeah do you want to show them how to add the code thing to pass yeah yeah so let's show them that as well yeah so that's good so here you want to go to um so let's just close this for a sec so to get that little trick that i just showed you right so this one here so for you guys it would just be code spaced um and then and dot unless you do the code insiders which is like the beta sort of vs code um we're going to do command shift p and this will open this like a kind of selection thing right command shift p and then you want to type in um shell right and then you see install code command in path uh mine says code insiders if you do the code insiders you can get this and then there is a way of aliasing code insiders to code which i usually do i've just been lazy on this computer and i haven't done it um so you can pretty much go ahead and do that and then what that will allow you to do is when you've got a uh when you're inside a directory you can just do code insiders or code and then space dot which means the current directory and it will open up your entire workspace so if you notice if i do ls to list all the files if i do ls to list all the files you can see app.js app.json uh what was that sorry um don't forget the door time i i said so that yeah it's quite important yeah you don't want to forget that doc because this guy exactly it's going to be an important step and now what you want to do is you can have this open so i like to again download a few things oh my zsh is one thing for the sort of nice looking terminals which tells you you'll get branch and things like that it's really nice uh i always do that on a fresh computer then the second one i would say download is spectacle um the reason why i love spectacles so much and i kind of talk about it load this honestly it's just it has like i remember when kazi first told me about it i kind of overlooked it but when you have things like this you do i do command option f boom uh do this and i kind of and even if i want to do like a threequarter split um i can do that so you see it's very quick to go ahead and resize my screens and then i can have multiple desktops for if i want like sometimes if i'm coding um i this is so in case you're curious as to how my flow is right i have a big screen above me right now so you don't need to have a second screen but i have a laptop here and then i have a second big monitor in front of me so i have an ultra wide and then but what i would say is even if you don't i didn't have an ultrawide when i started i just had a second screen you can pretty much go ahead and if you don't have a second screen so i'm going to start with one screen then what i recommend is make get really good at using um multiple desktops like this so you see i'm just literally swiping between them or mac um windows has a similar functionality and what i would do is the arrow key for windows with control windows exactly yeah so control win and then the arrow key and then you'll be able to go through them so what i would do is i'll typically have some kind of like a browser over on this side and then i'll have my code editor on this side little and a little sort of um viewpoint over on this side okay so this is going to be um a really quick way to sort of code and or you can kind of mix and match so i've had it where i've had the full code thing and then i would have the sort of app running here um but again it comes down to preference right so now we're going to click on app.js and you can see here i can see my app so i can see open up app.js to start working on your app so now if i go ahead and type in like one two three one two three popup react all right and then save you can see there you go hot reloading so we get the hot reloading and this is the app working and and everything's good so now quick few things to notice again very similar outcome right so very similar to our react apps we just have a functional component so if we was going to make this i'm going to create a new component and show you how just how similar it is to a react app right so let's go ahead and create a sort of let's call it um what should we call it what should we call like a new component should we just call it maybe a uh a profile right so a profile dot um um let's just call it a row right we have a row oh god this is the thing when coding you kind of get blank i'm going to go for profile profile.js right and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to use the snippets but i'm going to so typically what we were doing before was we didn't we're saying rfce and that was a react functional component exported right which which does this now this does a react functional component but in in the react js which is the web one right and the reason why we know it's web is because it says div and and so forth we don't want this one instead we want the rn for react native and then you do f and then you can actually go ahead and do i think it's just e r and f e right and then i'm not sure what s is s oh yeah s is with the style sheet yeah so with e by itself is the default profile and it will go ahead and stay up for you and uh e s is with a style sheet so i'll do it with the style sheet if i was you because it sets up everything that you kind of need and you see it does all the imports and it goes ahead and sets up your first little section here so let's make this take props and i'm going to destructure the props and say okay it has some some text for the profile so let's go ahead and just render that text here and what i'm going to do is know about this extension called kite i think it's available and it's quite powerful it's an ai extension it's not just for it's actually you need to install it and set it up don't do it right now but uh yeah it's it's very very handy like i use it all the time and trust me i find it so valuable oh yeah oh nice dude yeah like it's so it's like an entirely auto complete engine so the autocomplete of vs code isn't that good and once you start with kite right you just have to type dot and it um shows up not from the popularity but from the recommendation from the ai itself so it's very very handy and yeah actually they actually imported like millions of lines of code from github and then based it on like how many stars that github thing had and so you're basically pulling code in from like someone's amazing library oh really nice there is actually one more thing to it and that surprised me a lot so you you always find yourself you know looking up for documentation right guess what this comes with inbuilt copilot mode so you can actually have your documentation on the side and then whenever you you can just search for a term and it can act as a search engine it's quite powerful yeah that's dope dude so i've installed it now uh let's go ahead and use it so what's the simplest way you gotta install on your computer oh hi oh damn okay so there's actually an engine let's do it right now let's just go ahead and let's do it um let's do it so kite is downloading so it's got two minutes it's downloading so hopefully it doesn't jit up the screen a stream um but what we can do now is uh that's cool because i actually i read this in the newsletter ages ago um because i recognized this uh sort of logo but they advertise a lot in the newsletters yeah i saw ages going i kind of just you know when you read something and videos are sponsored by kite and like literally all of them are sponsored by kite yeah oh man i mean they have ai they have real ai really yeah yeah exactly yeah so that's going to be pretty good for them um so now github.com exactly and so now it's downloading it's got 29 seconds left okay so we should be able to see this in a sec um so i need to go ahead and just install that and then start okay cool we'll give that a go and then what happens is what as i'm typing it's going to just prompt me with auto completes yeah when you're very dot uh then you will find a lot of auto complete so if you ever need something like autocomplete then of course it's gonna be there and it's quite powerful again but does it break my emmett no i don't i don't i don't think so it doesn't break your emit when you're using html it doesn't break your limit but i use python heavily and in python you know there is a library called the os library you deal with a lot of operating system stuff yeah and over there like you can write the entire for loop it will write everything for you and the entire follow will be written to you just by just using a few dot and stuff like that it's very powerful nice okay let's do it so i've installed it i'm gonna run kite um so again if you guys aren't using alfred you should be using alfred as well because alfred is a game changer yeah alfred is a game changer and you want to make sure you enable so if you go to alfred um i'm going to go ahead we're talking about a lot of extensions over here yeah i know i got quite a few so here request permission blah blah blah okay yep um oh god this is anything requires so many okay so uh let me go ahead and quickly sign up to this and because we can if this is a tool that will help everyone out for sure dude let's go ahead and show this i'm going to quickly can you go live streams too like sometimes you know you have to die yeah with it you don't really need to do all that so again it's a very handy tool sponsor what's up exactly yeah sponsored by kai that sounded legit dude for the very very best ml completion very smooth code that's it so this is gonna okay so kite copilot is installed it's installing of them okay i'm definitely not using them right now um and then it's very very hectic i i used it once i regret it yeah i've used vim before yeah i only use it when i have to use it in a server situation navigation is quite useful with them the key wirings are epic yeah of course you won't find them anywhere else but vs code is just 7d so i use anything else nice okay so now i've got it installed um what's how's what's the next step now um i think that in your vs code you should get a symbol of kite uh below in the in the um okay so oh okay see uh i think it said you need to restart vs code as well somewhere so i think you do okay so now we've we've done that and then we can see welcome to kai hey there we go let's go let's check this out some developer has taken years to add this um uh this little design in so let's see what they've done what they've done here mike's now my spectacle's not working good now okay something is glitching up okay there we go okay uh lintel. okay so now so not writing python do i need to do i need to do that or do not put it open to the respondent javascript okay that's a tutorial cool code completions right so if you ever edit a configure to show the kite will show your computer's automatically as you type okay which we already have on and then import j things like that control space if all completions aren't on yes i already have all completions on so if we do like one oh sick okay so it's already starting to pop up and then if i do control space oh no oops you get this report types from but it would learn right as i'm as i uh yeah yeah as you as you commit stuff locally it looks through like your local kind of github right so there is one concern regarding kite it does send some of your code up into the cloud for analysis like you said no right now they mention it yeah so this was a thing i used it like eight or nine months ago they might have updated it but this was the main concern why kite was not used because on a professional level you are not allowed to send the code yeah if they have fixed it i don't think so there is a better solution yeah so now it says does not send your code or any byproducts uh to the cloud i i read the entire thing that's why i even talked about it and i wouldn't have talked about it because i was reading through it and i found it very useful personally nice dude yeah i mean let's give it a go now so i guess like we'll just see it pop up more um as it comes up and then i guess if you do and you can actually you see the coupe and the coop is quite useful okay so copilot is here so this thing and now whenever you're stuck anywhere you can just search for the term and yeah it will just bring you bring it to you it's amazing which means if i do like import right yeah i mean i mean i think the auto completion will be the main sort of um benefit yeah of course you're gonna use auto completion here yeah and it's gonna make life so much easier at least it made it easier for me because i use a lot of python yeah and um it picked up the bam convention stuff for me oh really yeah it was like i was like i didn't add that so there's not really auto completion for bam stuff so oh i love that dude yeah yeah okay like if there's like linting on your ben stuff like it's it it kind of learns stuff it's pretty cool nice okay so if say if we go ahead and install profile um import profile sorry so import profile from profile and then let's go ahead and add text and then say like a profile is where the text will say like hello world oh well let's just say ssssanga profile okay now we should see this pop up okay so we have one profile two profile three profile and then let's just say we have clever karsi let's just say test one two three okay save and now you can see like okay so we've got this is literally react uh react native still guys like as in just to show you it really doesn't change like so we're actually coding in in react here so it's just very simple same thing principles the same uh notice how the styling is a little bit different so you have this style stop container and then you apply these kind of styles right so it's no longer the typical sort of css styles are getting applied instead what we can do is you can have it like this so imagine like the styles for this container right now the background color is white right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to change the background color to let's just go ahead and say like red for example and then you should see everything goes red in the background right and then if you want to change the color of the text i can go ahead and say color and i can say white and then i can do boom and that oh oops um this is the container so um color text swipe what we might have to do here is say instead i might have to actually give this a style and say let's go ahead and say styles dot uh just this is a very generic say text and here i can say text like i say color oh damn look at that dude oh nice okay this is going to make me jack man okay good times yeah you're probably the best the best from kid oh my god dude let you guys watch me build clones off the clones and you didn't want one nobody mentioned the kind of twitter i know right i need to upload like all of those clones to kai and it will pick up my kind of staho now priyanji i really thank you for for shouting that one because um that's that would be pretty cool i think it would definitely like even there the use case there was very like pretty quick yeah i just found a lot of value from it and i just wanted to share it with you guys and if you if you also use it in the live stream that would be very happy because personally it brought a lot of value to me as a python developer at least and um yeah i think that it supports like 16 to 18 languages right and uh so if you're in c sharp c plus plus all of that kind of stuff even in java i think sunny has already programmed in java so uh yeah it it does support all that you think about it you're typing in print hello world in javascript and no longer you have to type in the entire thing yeah and that will be so phenomenal that's cool that's cool like there's there's a few snippets i i've kind of come to i never write console.log every like i i always let you clg like that's just the kind of like small little tricks and stuff like that but i know in in this case now you're gonna have this kind of jacked console logo i guess like with which is going to come like all complete i mean it's cool man i think anything that can speed up your workflow i know a lot of people are a fan of the brackets uh bro i think it's what is it called color bracket bracketizer or something i personally don't like it i just like to do this i think it's a bit too much on the screen um but again like it's all down to preference but kite seems like it's it would be cool so that would be pretty we'll see how that goes um but yeah so we have this right here right now i'm going to quickly go ahead and add on something like react navigation to this and i can show you guys all right uh sunny i have a quick question for you yeah uh maybe a friend can answer um this style part okay uh the css art yep do we have to have the same file for the react native or are good can we do the same way as we were doing for the react yeah good question so what what we tend to do with this so you don't want to actually have it always in the same you can have it in the same there's nothing wrong with that um and it would sort of reduce the complexity if it's a small component you could have it in the same but a lot of people do have a convention for this and it's like app.style.js or app.styles is it styles no is it um there's a convention for this it's um i'm sure it's app.styles.js app.styles.js unless there's a different one let me quickly just double check app.styles.js there is a there is a convention for it that i've typically followed um styles dot app no it's not style style does anyone know um they're sort of i've used it before but in this case but say we had this right app.style.js or something what we could do is we can go ahead and do this and paste it here oops paste it here and now what i could do is i could just go ahead and and you can either you can do it a few ways right you can even do export default right here export default um styles like this and that can be very clean and simple and then you can go ahead and say import styles from import styles from app.styles.js then you can go ahead and get rid of this and now you've got the same sort of structure that we were used to before and you can see here it's freaking out so stylesheet.create is not a function oh yeah because we need the it should be stylesheet yeah with css um did i do no that's good good so here we go to we need we just need to import stylesheet from react native oh yeah and then we should come back and it says stars is not defined okay so let's go ahead and check out why so that is in app.js9 um styles oh yeah because we've got cap os so we're going to do lowercase s uh to be honest i mean it's all down to your standards but we it says we keep it located just for a demo you can see that works right so in that case now we've got the same similar layout with some kind of styles file and a simple import so you can do this as well right um what is the best practices for using a style sheet here uh in a module itself in a component or outside um so it depends really um remember like this is a very simple app if you add a folder structure so i've seen loads of different photo structures i've had components very simple that ones where you have a folder with just components and you have another photo with pages and you can split your app up into that i've also seen in tesco they had molecules and atoms um so molecules are like atoms are the absolute smallest components so imagine you had a component called like a profile picture yeah imagine like you had profile picture.js right and then a molecule could have been the profile.js which was the entire profile which consisted of multiple atoms you see and then you see why it kind of makes sense when you call atoms versus molecule um and then like to you so there's loads of different like standards that people use the main thing i would say is kind of have it as as a very standard base have a component a components folder have a pages folder now pages is for going to be a navigation different pages in your app have a components for the for the reusable components inside of your app right so you can have like the login page inside of the pages com inside the pages folder and so forth i'm not going to do that today because it's going to get a bit nested but the point is is anything which keeps it very like neat and to be honest what i would recommend is like frank said before go ahead and check out other people's code see how they've done it see if you can notice remember pattern recognition if you start seeing a few patterns remember this stuff evolves it's never just like this one size fits all uh and it's also very opinionated um it can change like uh app.styles.js might be the way now but it could completely change and there could be a much better way of doing it tomorrow and i think like for example if i have a team of 10 people right now i'm gonna go to sleep then which approach will be good quite late over here yeah sonny i gotta i gotta head to a meeting but anybody can hit me up anytime on slack and i i got a couple messages and happy to help anybody in the community so amazing thank you frank and thank you both of you guys were awesome in this call and and again everyone connected yeah right um okay let me quickly pull up my chat as well because i can't really see my chat as well now okay so there we go so okay so what we're going to do now is we've pretty much talked about that we've got the our first sort of react native app up and running right so we saw the differences between um like you see still functional component if i wanted to stay in this app i would pretty much go ahead and do this i would say const or i would actually just use my snippet so i'll say use state and boom i'll get this and it'll kind of give me the template for it and i'll say the name of the state so let's imagine if i had like a name piece of state and then this set name is the convention and then use state and i'd say the the name here would be like for example just to say sunny was my the default name right and then if i had the text for the first one was that piece of state so imagine we had name okay now uh imagine we sort of have this um okay so it's freaking out because use state isn't imported so we need to go ahead and import that from react so you see them the kind of hooks and things like that are the exact same nothing changes right everything works in the exact same fashion in the exact same way now what we want to do next is we have um if i if i had an input field right so i'm going to give you guys a quick example of the differences so in this case you would have um text input right it's a text input and text input has a value called text so it has a value called text and yeah so text is i think it's text actually um i think it's maybe value or is it text value yeah says value i think value and then value would be name right so if i go ahead and and do this now you can see like i said by default it says there's a text input field and the value is set to name right in this case what we'll do is we'll set this to blank right and i'm going to make this the name but i need there's also a change event right so just like we had input fields they get changed and updated in react react native we have a change event so i think it's on change and um this so typically we had e and remember e.target.value is how we got the text from the input field and in uh in rec native it's very simple they just give you the text straight away and then you can pretty much go ahead and say set name to that text so it's a little bit simpler and react native when the way they do that and i think this will be enough to work so if i type in a oh okay so it's not on change i think it's on change text on change text that one so now if i go back and we go it should be underneath here there we go and if i go ahead and zoom in i'm going to say abc okay perfect so you see now i'm updating the state so you can see like i've got the text input field so i'm going to go ahead and hide that so you've got text input the value is the name piece of state and then we've got on change of text so unchange text and it just shoots off text every time i sort of type something in so abc123 and then you can see that updates this piece of state and then what we have is the profile component that we wrote before is taking that piece of state so that name piece of state is passing in as a prop for here inside the profile component and then we just rendered that out underneath right so here if i was gonna just dramatize i could say profile is boom this guy and now you can see if i do this it says profile is sunny yeah so that makes a lot more a little bit more sense and what i would say is to make it super visual what we can see is now you've got the app at the top and then you've got this profile section and this is honestly like it depends right so again figure out the workflow that works for you in what you're doing at that point in time so i always find myself kind of like uh switching between things so imagine if i if i'm working on my styling of my app right now right so i can't sometimes have the app.styles underneath and i'll be like okay this makes sense because now i can kind of start my app i can see it getting updated and it's super quick right so if i want to change the background to green i can go ahead and do that and i can be like oh yeah actually i want to have two profiles i want the name to pop up twice and now i can say sunny okay cool and i can go here and i can change this to blue action i really like that and then you see it just makes sense like i can kind of do all this stuff very quick i don't have to kind of mess around between different screens and different windows and then and and a very handy shortcut is command p so command p is like this very quick way to run through your app so i never you'll never typically see me opening the file tree and kind of running through it like this and that's like i'm really searching for something but what i tend to do is command p and i'll type in profile and just enter and it opens the file for me right and if i do command pp it goes back to the previous file i was in so these are very quick tricks that make you a lot quicker as a developer right so command pp and you pretty much go back and forth between the previous files so now if you're if you're coding in this one um you can go back to command pp and if you want to go two files back you just do ppe and you kind of cycle through it you see that so you kind of just run through it right so that's going to be very very handy in sort of like uh and speeding up your your development time and getting quicker with that sort of stuff so that's going to be awesome what i would say is as well guys is in a previous video i talked about um implementing so i would recommend at this point everyone going ahead and building out a react native app up to this point and also go into that terminal and type in like i so you see it says opening in ios right opening the ios simulator and what this does is i mean hopefully it doesn't kill the computer when i'm live but um what this will do is it will pull up ios simulator and it will just go ahead and boot up an iphone so you would have to probably most likely install your your xcode and things like that for for the ios simulator um otherwise android again you need to do that for android i'm not sure actually if you need to have xcode for this i think you might be able to do it without it but with that said you might be able to go ahead and um and make it work otherwise but yeah so the simulators are typically slower but once they sort of work it it should speed up pretty quick so i'm gonna i'm gonna close that for now and the point is is that again i would kind of go quite far with doing it on the web because you can see webs super quick you're gonna get a really nice experience um and then it's gonna be pretty close to the app and then i would kind of go ahead and test it on the app once i get so far so i'd kind of use this kind of view or this kind of setup to build up react navigation uh to set up redux on the sort of store and everything like that to get everything on that sort of things up and and um then i would go on to uh the sort of simulator because it works out a bit quicker doing it that way right so it'll be a bit quicker doing it in that fashion um so any one question for this if i have to build an application like a amazon clone so i have to use a firebase and redux to manage the state right so the same way we did it in react um so it products firebase authentication and then so remember just kind of kind of break it down into features right so if you need login then well firebase authentication will help you do that now if you need um if you need a database and you need sort of tracking of orders and you need to have like carts and things like that then firebase storage is going to be the uh the way to go with yeah so firebase firestore that would be really good for you um and what about mongodb so again mongodb now remember firestore is a nosql database which is the same structure as mongodb but you get the realtime benefits using firestore mongodb i would say to learn about mongodb go ahead and check out the make sure you go ahead and check out the man stack builds because the man stack builds we cover a lot of all that stuff mongodbe um so what i would say is do the clones right so i just want to ask like so everyone here right now how many of you just raise your hand with people who've got cameras on or type it down how many of you have done a a certain degree of clones so i'm raising my hand i've done that pretty much right there yeah so you've done them right yeah one column okay so one clone uh at two you how many were you saying one or one okay so i can see a few people have one up so pedro's got three up um anisha's got two up um okay so now patrice has got a seven up okay awesome nice patrice nice dude that's awesome man yeah um what i was gonna say is i see loads of twos threes right and things like that level up guys and i see i tell her it was like i got five i got five on my belt okay um so you want to make sure you like like do more builds right so i can see in the in the chat as well we've got uh sahana two brian four antonio six okay cool i highly five more than five nice right so what i was saying d has got half damn it go on you know like yeah will it be good that if i uh create a design so we can collaborately work together all of us you know one component for this person one component so they can learn it also so i build a crm application full from scratch to the production so i would say honestly in my opinion for you all to benefit the most right what i would say is for the clones right so to try and do as many clones as you possibly can there are literally about um oh nice jessie's i joined nine days ago what's up clone finish awesome nice um what i would say is guys there are literally 20 to 25 clones right um so so and i know that someone e5 will be exact 25 to be exact damn man literally the guy will start doing that too yeah there's literally there's 25 clones right so i mean i don't even remember building 25 clones [Laughter] but the point is that like so many i i built so many in my previous company so many things new stuff yeah you're gonna build out a bunch of stuff but what i would recommend now to progress for you guys is build out the uh build out the clones and and and you might be thinking yeah but i've done like a few clones i think that's enough the but the benefit is guys each one posed a different like sort of challenge in different areas for example the google clone presented a different challenge and we had to set up a google api and use it in a very different way um the hulu clone had some ui design elements that were challenging the amazon clone the five day challenge one hundred percent if you guys haven't built that do the amazon five day challenge that is a full build full stack it's gonna have front end back end it's gonna have loads of uh everything is covered in that build and strike payment processing so it's a really good yeah very very powerful powerful system uh way to do it now the way i would say is when you saw how deep is working on google cloud now awesome um so i would say make sure you go ahead and i just registered messages as well that's that's awesome stuff um and yeah like all of like a flexbox is going to come leveling up all those things it's all going to be pretty much a case of and so she says thanks so much for because the rule of 0.65 and 0.35 with the sidebar and chat or whatsapp clown yeah so most people don't actually know how to use the flex rules properly is in like you might have used flex and sort of like flex wrap is the furthest you went right but when you actually figure out that flex can do sort of screen separation in terms of like 30 of the screen is this 65 screen or the 60 70 of screens is this and then you kind of containerize things and start thinking in a containerized approach design becomes quite easy actually and you start to kind of like break down and and then what i would say is go to websites like dribble so that's i'm gonna just drop it in the chat right now so it's uh dribb or with two or three e's dribble.com right this is a game changer of a design sort of thing so if i'm going to build an app now i go to dribble i just literally type in the kind of app i'm building and there's like remember ui is a skill in itself right building clever ui systems and things like that and ux systems it's it's like we spend a lot of time to become good developers same with ui and ux right they spend a very long time there's a lot of things which make design good now you take inspiration from those kind of places like dribble.com and then kind of like strip down the sort of things that you see like the patterns you're seeing and again you see it's just pattern recognition everything comes down to like recognizing patterns and what sort of trending what are people into right now flat design is quite in fashion right now um and you see that combine that with the clones and you're literally combining that on the clothes and i would be shocked if you if everyone in this car hasn't landed a job in in the next um three to six months like as in it's literally that simple like don't over complicate it like build the clones um uh look on dribbles start putting in your so clones are one thing but also always have a side project of your own if you don't have a side project of your own you're definitely losing out there because that's where you basically take the knowledge and you're not listening to like oh sunny said do this so that's what i'm going to do to make my app work instead now you're like right no i've got a whole different use case which nobody else has done because this is my app um if you're if you were into hair styling and things like that right like you can make a barber app or something like that right like yeah and sort of like everything is around the booking system for barber shops or something like that i mean you could go into that kind of detail if you like patch was a student um he is a student sorry and he was about he was a bartender before so what he did is he actually went ahead and built a bartendering app right so i worked closely here coach patch 101 and he basically went ahead and built bartendering out and that was awesome because then he ran into problems which only he was running into that weren't available in a clone and he had to use the skills that he picked up in the clones to overcome that and that's essentially exactly what happens in a job right you're going to use the skills that you've picked up on all these other things and then you're going to apply it um so that's why i would say make sure you're doing that apply the code the rule of three so the the rule of thirds so you're always spending a third of your time in and or everyone here right now well done because you've literally satisfied a third of that time requirement because you've been in a position where you've learned from somebody who is more experienced more sort of like has got more like kind of skill in that domain so you can pretty much pick up a lot of tricks and tips and sort of shortcut right so for example like i bought a fancy camera right now i'm not gonna go through and pretty much spend ages on google right i'm gonna find someone who is an absolute badass in videography and i'm gonna literally just be like i'm gonna just show me everything and and do it that way so the guy i bought the camera from i pretty much made friends with him and now i'm shooting tips back and forth with him and he's got a lot of videography jobs and i'm pretty much just going to tally along with him and just kind of film with him and that's how i'm going to become really quick really quick really fast because literally like somebody has spent years and years and years acquiring that skill and you can just come along and this is this is the fun fact you can come along and kind of pick up all the gems um very quickly right because it's like reading a book when you read a book the chances are there's only like a few key takeaways from the book but the book itself takes ages to read like or for i don't know for you it takes me ages to read a book sometimes honestly like and even with audible even on times two i'm just like i'm constantly going back because i phase out um so i mean but the thing is you're going to get a key takeaway now if somebody had read 50 books and came to you and said this is what i learned from 50 books you've not only saved a bunch of time now of course reading the 50 books yourself is going to be super more valuable than actually just taking someone's word but the point is that when it comes to skill you can literally kind of shortcut that that sort of that that succession right and you can kind of like take that shortcut and you can just like crazily jump past senior even senior developers you can just kind of like overtake them right now like it's crazy because i have i've literally still had i'm in contact with a lot of senior developers that i was working with in when i was a junior developer and they're like hey dude like where are you at right now and this and that and if they saw what we were doing on youtube and stuff like that like holy like oh my god like you're doing this this this and it's because like you you don't have to just because it took a typical like senior developers a couple years to get to that point you could be at that point in the year there is nothing stopping you but the only thing is is that there are some things for example debugging experience that stuff does take time which which you can't skip past and remember there's a balance that you can't expect to be really good at something and not be willing to put the time in and just always looking for that shortcut because it doesn't work that way and remember like i think i can't remember which quote is a quote it is but it's somebody said it takes ten thousand hours to can even consider yourself as an expert of something right so if you if you've done like a hundred hours and something you'd be like yeah i've really put in the work and stuff like that is it's 100 hours 10 000 hours nope so carrie i'm working right and now suddenly those eight hours that you were you put in you like i was debugging for eight hours oh my god like uh i'm just you know like i should be a fullblown developer now is that 10 10 000 hours nope so keep on working right like you see keeps literally put set your ceiling so high that you just have to keep working to kind of reach your own sort of like limitation otherwise the the sort of person in your room your colleague this and that if you're not surrounded by the right people who are pushing you it's very easy to kind of limit your growth right you kind of want somebody you want to be in a room full of people who are just like absolutely push yourself to your limit and uh and that's going to be your best way to push as a developer um and another thing which we are seeing in in us the trend has been changed like an interview they gave us you know uh 20 to 30 questions and asked us to complete in 13 minutes right before you go to the next step but this has a questions which you have to do it in a paper or somewhere so i i would say honestly from from the the experiences from from firstly where are you getting these interviews from i'm very curious because they're they're very yeah because i definitely mean yeah these are nuts i can say i bought so long in industry but i never did this kind of uh i never faced this kind of interviews yeah if somebody put a a a piece of paper in front of me and said 30 questions you have you have 30 minutes i would literally be like oh i don't want this job anymore like you can take the pen and paper and you can give it someone else okay i'm literally i'm not working in a company like this right like you and i i just got a un interview uh not interview it is a screening text written a test thought they said one hour no 45 minutes uh and i believe it is a 30 questions in it right so what i would say is honestly at this point don't focus on those too much because the reality is is if you if you're hearing like me frank um anyone else who's landing clients or anything like that um who are telling you otherwise that the majority because even in my experience i've yet to come across that extreme of like of even like a react versus angular i have had companies come to me with migration requirements we have an angular app or we bought an angular app and we want to migrate it to react are you interested and i said no and this is again it comes down to what priyanshu said be comfortable with saying no and declining jobs so like the fact that he knows that at 13 years old and he's getting primed with that is really something that we should we should all look up to because you being comfortable with saying no might sound easy but you really do have to build that skill to be able to do that because um you could be in a room where somebody's willing to offer you 70 grand 80 grand for a job but it's going to it's going to have like a negative impact on your growth or your future success right but you might not see that because you're kind of blinded by the the 80 grand right and we call this like uh we call this a golden golden handcuffs right and the reason why they call golden handcuffs is because like it's like you think you're in the golden situation right like you're getting paid money like everything's good but they've literally got you and they're kind of like they're kind of like they're limiting you because they they kind of like they've used the salary to pretty much go ahead and like cuff you up and sort of limit your growth right and a lot of companies will do that which is why i would even say i'm quite extreme when it comes to salaries and and some of the students who might know this like i push like i wouldn't push for like a a a two grand raise or a three grand raise i'll push for like a ten grand raise or like oh oh like 10 to 20 gram raisin and and that might sound like wow like how what the hell is he talking about right but there's ways to situate yourself for example if any of you know what devops is devops is a very highly paid sector inside of software development right devops if you're a full stack developer and you you're you pick up devops skills on the side and you build up your own projects you get very comfortable with ci and all this other stuff and then you kind of get you move into a company let's say you move into a company at 50k right so they're paying you 50k as a base salary unless they they're devops guy they're paying um 80k right because devops get paid very well right now imagine the devops guy what i would do is i would move into that company i would shadow the devops guy which is exactly what i did in my first company and then i basically went ahead and i was watching him and i was like dude like this is amazing man like you're and do it in a fashion where you you make them feel good right like if you go up someone say oh that's easy man yeah i can do that no one's gonna want to work with you right but if you go up to him say like that's awesome stuff can i please like learn from you would you mind sharing some tips i'm guarantee no one will say no to you like and if they do you just like you know be nice about it and and and move on like but the point is i pretty much said to him like i was like yeah like can i just pretty much shadow you next time you do a deployment next time you do any sort of ci work just give me a shout and and we started doing that now i picked up the skills required to take over the the devops position in the company and then he had to leave right so about seven months later he left right now think about it they were paying somebody 80 grand right to to fulfill this role and then they're paying me 50 grand so imagine like as in this is a hypothetical um situation but but um but i did use this in a different sort of the numbers were different but i did exactly this principle and i boosted my salary uh about 20k right and and the point is that like my he left the company and i said to him i was like i am now doing devops plus i'm the full stack developer who has got my feet into loads of different parts of the software right there like i've done a lot of different and part of the app build and part of the web app that we've built and things like that and i also picked up react native on that job now justifying 20k as a pay rise when they were previously paying someone 80k is like you know like this is kind of a still right like now they don't have to pay someone 80k they're just paying you an extra 20k and you're doing the devops as well as the some development work right and do you see like it and now you've done them a favor so they actually like you a lot more and two you've got a lot more a whole lot more respect and authority in the company and you're also picking up skills which which remember uh you wanna and you wanna say yes to the opportunities which are gonna be uh like sort of um exponential in terms of your growth in the future right so picking up devops is gonna boost you big time in the future right learning redux is going to boost you big time learning react native is going to boost your big time but doing things like angular vs react that to me compared to like picking up devops is like a downward trajectory there's in this it's not a downward but it's kind of a much less it's not it's basically it's going to just like imagine if that's going to increase my development at this rate right it's only very very small amount but if i start learning devops my salary is going to quickly go up and it's going to really start to peak quite high um you know it is it it is worth to tell you these things what i am getting uh in return from you it is highly valuable for me at this time because i was i was preparing for you know my intro is getting screwed up because on the both the technologies which i am working on and it takes a lot of time to prepare for interviews it takes from ground zero to the complete you know yeah and it was very hard for me to remember each and every point in technology so so think of it this way it's only on one yeah yeah so think of it this way so remember if you ask me tomorrow to sonny do you remember how to do like uh do you remember how to how you used react navigation and had like customized headers and things like that and react native i'll tell you straight up no i was like i will tell you i did it at one point but uh if you said to me that you remember off the top of your head i'd be like no i don't remember the top of my head like i know it's possible i've done it in the past and even if i didn't do it in the past i know it's possible so it can be done right and then from that like you know that something can be done so it's just about figuring out how to get there right and so the first thing is is that if any of you get an opportunity take the opportunity right as in like if if there's a freelancing gig for a for react job yeah take it and it's like you tried that yeah yeah they literally go on up work sign up an account uh and then if you have an opportunity go ahead and take the opportunity right like if somebody offers you a job and even if it scares the crap out of you take the job right and it's literally a case of like imagine you're in a plane jump out the damn plane right and you will figure out how to survive on the way down right that's the kind of way i put it right like and you will figure out ways to survive right like you will definitely yeah yeah exactly you'll figure out some kind of crazy way to figure out like indonesia hope we have a parachute like you you'll make a parachute on the way down right that's what i found because unless you put yourself in that situation where you have that extreme pressure to perform right you're never going to be put in that situation like when our bodies are very like acclimatized to like never push ourselves further than we need to like if you're in a comfortable position and you're getting paid you're eating good everything's kind of like you know like your body's like i don't need to work harder than i am right now like it's all good right if you anyone who goes to the gym knows this right like you have days where you wake up and you're like uh i don't really need to like you know i don't need to go to the gym like i'm good right but there's going to be days where like but if you if you have if you signed up for like let's say like a a boxing fight right you know that fight is coming right like you know that if you don't fight your ass is going to get whooped right like if you so you're going to train like because you have that immense pressure now it's the same as in the development world right if you have a job and somebody's like right the deadline is in three weeks do whatever it takes to get that done now you're going to be networking if you need to network to find someone who will help you yeah you're going to be you're going to be learning react if you need to learn react you're going to be doing redux if you need to learn to relax but you're going to do crazy amount of in three weeks that you never would have done unless somebody had stuck it in front of you it's like kind of like a soft gun being pointed at your head right like is somebody saying right now now perform and then you're like oh okay i have to do it now right and and this is the case for a lot of things that we just as humans that we need some kind of stimulus to kind of like push us and what i would say is the best stimulus and the best part is is like you get paid right like you get paid for it so take the opportunity but if you don't take the opportunity you're not going to get paid and two you're not going to push yourself out of that comfort zone to the point where you would actually be really benefiting yourself if anything when you don't take that job most people see it as yeah i'm not gonna get paid two grand from that job but what i see as no you just lost two grand and you lost all of the opportunity cost of the learning that you would have got as well right so like yeah think of it that way yeah i committed that mistake yeah so think of it that way and then and then suddenly a 2000 job is no longer a 2000 job it's 2000 plus the opportunity to learn a hell of a lot which is infinitely valuable because you can coach with that information freelance with it and then another job with it so you see it i see yeah no i will take your advice here yeah yeah i will note it down here exactly um i'm glad you say that sunny by the way no awesome yeah because um i'm kind of finding myself in the middle of i have to you know uh where i'm working on a minimal viable chatbot or thing and then i'm like okay the chatbot is done yeah away the youtube dashboard oh wait the styling will wait the data oh why the hell is the firebase not working wait no notifications in firebase oh i'm working in react and sometimes i feel like having a lack of experience yeah um you know makes me not being able to over to always estimate how much things still need to be done yep so i'm trying to think of it and just be like okay no don't worry about that just what's minimal cut your losses you know almost got the parachute sometimes by accident i guess but um yeah so that's what i find hard yeah but i have to say um you know with the builds you guys uh have i i think i'm i'm i had enough experience to see the patterns yeah so with the whatsapp clone for example i had a very unstylish chatbot but now i may you know i used your tricks from the chat room and now i made it use your dashboard and i was never able to put the elements in one container and see it like okay this is a column direction display now i was just able to do it and that was just so amazing so i can definitely recommend everybody percent pay the bills and then take from it and then also uh save the builds on your computer yeah it's actually sort of a database and then be like um like oh where did i find this because actually building a chat but i have the whatsapp clone next to it yeah take it one step further push it to github so push it onto your own personal github and then you would like to see yeah yeah because because i even had this problem yesterday where we have an internal tool that me and qazi built and uh and then i was like i can't find the code and then uh i couldn't get through to kazi because kazi was doing something at a time and then i was um i was kind of scrambling around on like old an old external ssd and i was kind of like trying to find this code and i was like god damn it why didn't i just push this thing to github and uh and like it we all make the mistake but the one thing is if you just push that code get up now it's it's it's gonna make your profile stand out a bit more i mean even if it's private it's still another repo on your account um and it's always like the amount of stuff that you're going to look back at as reference is it like your reference material is literally like golden because you wrote it right like as in if you wrote the material it's going to be golden it's going to be literally catered to you and how you work and how your brain works um and it's going to be something that you can always look back to and i always look back at old stuff and repurpose things and really like come back and i'll improve it and i'll kind of like uh i'll grab i'll be like i remember i did something in that project and i would kind of be like i just need to do that again so i'll go back and i'll grab that snippet accordingly okay done now now i don't need to spend hours on trying to figure it out and i can go ahead and grab it now something i want to go ahead and say um is nice because whenever you were saying niche you felt like you were calling my name out um jesse i want to add to what you were saying before so you you mentioned about the um uh sort of like uh some kind of like pressure to kind of like keep pushing you to do like the dashboard or another feature or something like that right like and i was kind of talking about um like the pressure of like a job or something like that is is like or a deadline for an app is is a really good motivator right but if you what happens if you don't have like most of us don't just start off with clients like we don't have clients right like what if you don't have a client how do you set yourself a goal to to push yourself and pressurize yourself into that position how do you get into that position without clients without deadlines and stuff like that because it's very difficult you might be thinking i can't because i i don't have a client so i'm not going to get that yeah i guess it depends on who you are as a person yeah what you want to achieve with programming to be honest um like i of course the client well the client or the business coach i told you about the you know that was really for me an incentive you know because i want to do good i want i want to make this a cool app you know so i said okay build the habit so first of all some people when they start out their energy is very high yeah and then when you start out their energy burns a little bit up you know they in one week they build a creative project they start out they work 50 hours on it you know let's say they're motivated and then they start burning up and then it slows down motivation goes down um and it burns up basically so what i've been trying to do i've been testing since summer a little bit how my energy management in because that's a very important thing when you're developing your energy management i have the tendency also sometimes especially when i just um solved a bug i tend to be like i have to sleep at 11 but i tend to start you know be coding at one yeah every 1am i have to stop myself because i want also to be able to code the next day with a fresh mind so to keep to to not do this to not spike you have to do like one percent two percent one percent and then you build it up so that's the first you got to build the habit you got to have the discipline then yeah of course working towards the goal yep so you got to know yourself some people are extremely stressed when they start coming closer to the goal yeah so they're like paralyzed some people have that um i don't have that like i have a lot of ideas a lot of things and then just before the deadline i'm like it that was way too much like yeah like strip it make it minimal just do this and i wouldn't i have not been able to deliver a project like 100 100 100 where i'm like okay i'm so incredibly um i you know because i always felt like okay this should have been in it this but if the client is happy and you did the communication well about the features the minimal features for that session uh then it's okay so i always have if i for my projects if i have a let's say 10 features the client has and i'm i'm aiming for 12 but actually in my mind i have 15 lined up in the case of like i have that place of over delivery you know so that sort of stuff if you plan that on 15 in your schedule but you know you you come out on 10 in the end you're still being able to get that deadline and have really good results so yeah it keeps me going two things you you touched on without realizing that which i really kind of live by now one is the the way of building habits right habits are a way of like like uh jesse said like and it's very true motivation dies uh motivation in the beginning is skyrocketed right like you are so pumped you're like i'm gonna be the best damn developer in the entire planet i'm with bill gates right like and then uh like as you code as you hit more debugging as you hit sort of like more pain points you're like that comes down and then your discipline has to kick in right now discipline by itself is very up and down like it's very like a roller coaster ride one day you're super disciplined and you do really well another day you're super lazy you don't do much so one thing that i found that really works is habits right habits is amazing um start with very simple habits right so literally like every single day uh read a book called atomic habits very very good book um yeah yeah exactly like it so atomic habits yeah atomic house very good book and uh i just bought that as well um so what i would say is is literally building a very like just imagine like if every single day you did and uh and like this is say two hours of work right in 10 hours a week that's 10 hours in a month that's 40 hours of development right but imagine the consistency of that the consistency of that is going to is going to be to a point imagine if every single day you put in two hours towards react right and then imagine on the seventh day if you're really tired and you're kind of like you know like i don't really want to do this i'm like oh i hear debugging or you've done that for six days now so breaking that streak or breaking that habit would is is a lot harder than kind of because now you're like oh like it will kind of eat you underneath and you've you've created your own internal pressure right which which pressures yourself so that is my first tip for and and i do that with kazi a lot and we we sort of go back and forth with streaks and things like that so like we have workout streaks we have different kind of work habits that was the first thing i would say and the second thing that you touched on what was it what did you say after that because it was a really good point um yes that exactly so there's a really another good book that everyone should read called the 10x rule by grant cardone right and 10x rule is one it's amazing for for money investment and things like that it's really good book to read but the the whole point of tax rule is if you want to get any form of success you need to do like like crazy amounts of work that other people just won't do right and what i mean by this and because like imagine if you go ahead and set yourself a goal like of of i'm gonna code um i'm gonna code um let's just say i'm gonna code an hour a day every single day for the next week right now what grant cardone says is he says no like all right so 10x that right is it like and i'm just giving you an extreme example right like it's in like this is like a very extreme example but let's say okay let's say you said you're going to call 30 minutes a day but then grand cardone would say like 10x it so so but but he but he tends to talking goals right so it would be your goal let's say if you want to make a um your goal was to make 20 000 by the end of the year he was a 10x sat to become 200 grand right now the point is is that even if you fall short of your goal chances are you're going to smash 20 000 right because your goal was so high that like even if you've came short of it you would still surpass your original goal right yeah it's also what elon musk says right the goals that you have for 10 years why don't you set that for the next six months exactly exactly it's really impossible it's like well but you got a lot faster than if you would remind mind just 10 years exactly elon musk one of my best uh he's definitely something i look up to as well and that was a really good part yeah though he said to carry onto yeah no no it's okay i just wanted to pick on what you said about habits i think one really good book for everybody is the four tendencies from gretchen brewing okay uh which one is this four tendencies oh four tendency or two it's more like uh it is about the their your inner expectations and you're out the outer expectations so the inner expectation are you the kind of person that says if i have to run every day five kilometers will you do that yes people will do that you know once they set that bar for themselves the goal they do that no they don't want that street to be broken some people when you talk about our expectations is expectation from the client from your boss from your then some people say if somebody asks me something i will always do it so you have four four different personality types everybody is in some way some of the personality types but let's say you're a rebel you're below that it means like you don't really give a about inner expectations but you don't even about our expectations it means you're only motivated by what you do yourself you choose what you do for example you also have the questioner the questioner will only do the inner expectations right that person thinks is good for them but when he gets our expectations he will ask questions right and then you have other types of persons but it's really important to know that about yourself because when it comes to deadlines it's really um yeah good to see how do you behave around external expectations yeah for me i'm i'm sort of like between questioner but definitely a rebel so even if my boss would say it should be done by data then i would say okay great but i have to do this this and this you want me to do this or you want me to do that if that's possible we can switch this i can move this faster for you what do you like and then i just do my own stuff that's a typical question rebel kind of person an obliger for example an obliger is the kind of person that says boss says needs to be done by monday obliges okay no questions asked gets to work you know up holder will also uh but it's really interesting because the upholder is the kind of person that says i'm gonna run every day five kilometers he's gonna do it no doubt if the upholder says i'm gonna make 100k next year he will do it no questions asked and then it's really good to see if you're with teammates who's more of an obliger and who's more of a rebel yeah how the communication is so that's really a good point to know about yourself when it comes to deadlines that's just what i wanted amazing no amazing i think everyone go ahead and check out that sonny i have one technical question now yeah i want to design something which has uh you know uh unlike a view a list of items i get it from apis and i have to provide a links on it it is a single page application and i want when i will open one document or one record it will have a further you know tabs in it for for this sort of question for these sort of questions i'll tell you slack slack me uh because because it can get very granular um and it's kind of hard for me to send you those yeah um send this like yeah how i want to build it yeah yeah uh so it will help all of our community people too yeah no definitely go ahead and do that and that'll be that'll be awesome uh so guys takeaways from that read four tendencies right it's really really good book it's gonna help you guys a lot it's going to is any any kind of and also thank you calvin kabande says dude these calls are awesome keep it up and kudos to everyone chiming it amazing stuff thank you brother uh he's always charming in the course amazing guy and um what i would say is as well is um so a final sort of takeaway point is um oh damn it it was on the you know it's on the tip of your tongue was it i was gonna say it'll come back to me but the point is oh yeah so something really hit me recently and i was kind of reading a book as i was driving to melbourne's house and it was kind of like it's again it was part of 10x rule and it was make success your obligation right like we all look at success as a choice right everyone in this call right now we all look at successes like yeah uh it's a choice like i i ca i choose i can choose like some people just get it like you know but like or some people are born into it or something like that but no like change your relationship to success and make it like you are obliged to be successful if you don't do what it takes today like everyone's still on this call you're doing the exact thing right you're showing up you're still like here you're still like improving even if you get tired even if you feel like you know oh my god i've done too much whatever like keep on showing up because like if you don't do that you're literally being unfair to yourself because you're literally taking it away from you right so if you start thinking of it in that sense it becomes an entire different lifestyle and and decision making completely changes right even if your friends want to go out and things like that no but you are obliged to your success and if your success was to sit at home and and write code for three hours then you better stay at home and write code for three hours right like is in obviously there's always going to be a balance but the point is is that like if you want to achieve success you need to do like crazy things that people and the truth is that people who are successful if you look at everyone who's successful to like crazy amounts um jeff bezos elon musk um bill gates all these people they were at points in their lives they literally sat in a room and grinded so damn hard to the point where like nobody was sitting behind him saying like giving him a pat on the back saying you're going to be a millionaire you're going to be a billionaire like everyone's going to know your name and things like that you just absolutely have to like put in like ridiculous amounts of work to to scale up and it was only until i started doing that i saw my life actually start to transform and completely take a different direction ever and before that it was very much a case of you know like a kind of a small like a slower kind of progression um anish kara says just one question can hard work ever go to your waist okay so very good question actually so can hard work ever go to waste put it this way if you put in work no matter what it is right if you put in work in the gym right and you and you don't see a result if you put work in in sort of your in encoding and you fail and then you didn't whatever don't look at that as a failure look at it as no i tried something right like i said i tried something for example say you're coding react right you're coding and you're trying to do redux and it didn't work and everything failed right you must have taken a bunch of different approaches to solving that problem right now you you know that those different approaches don't work right so try a different approach and then and and that's all people do it doesn't matter how senior you are people have just ironed out more approaches than you that's all it is and you keep doing that and you start looking at and things like that and honestly that i forgot who said it but it's so damn true everyone has no idea what they're doing just at a different level right so like a ceo of a company literally is thinking in their head how the do i manage thousands of these like employees how the heck am i going to get everyone paid today like uh the the economy is crashing how do we how do we get everyone still getting paid like there's families on the line things like that right all of that stuff is that there's this sort of like the struggle of a ceo and then imagine it like a developer right how the hell do i get redux so i can i don't know how to get this thing working you know i don't know how to do it everyone has no i like as in and trust me when you go into a senior like now i i would be considered as a senior in in a development team and in and react anyway and if somebody says to me um yeah so this is true like he says thomas edison found 99 different ways of not inventing the light exactly so you see he just ruled out 99 ways and then he got one and it all it takes is and but then that would be seen as and and you would typically see as overnight success or just natural genius and people would kind of tend to tend to put a label on it and because the truth is is that like naturally our bodies aren't inclined to to put ourselves in that much pressure right it's not much sort of like a pressure to perform to that extent and you don't want to kind of go and fail 99 times you know like you don't really want to do that right but i'm telling you that's the truth and there's and a lot of people here exactly and and i went out albert einstein says something else i'm not smart i'm just willing to make more mistakes than the average person and that's the truth it was only until i started to kind of like dive out of my comfort zone and be comfortable with failing right if you're not failing then you're not pushing hard enough that's what i always say like keep it very simple right get on get comfortable with being uncomfortable that's my number one thing uh and literally like and if you're not failing like just push harder pretty much like when you start failing and you start like hitting actual failure points that's when you're like even like think of it in the gym if you put on a weight that's too heavy yeah they usually say like you fail like like or keep doing a bunch of reps until you hit failure right until you can't push that weight off now what do you do you don't just quit right if you quit what's the point of like training in the first place right you come back to the gym the next day you keep doing it like you you eat better you do other things like just like in coding if you don't get you you code every day but if you don't get your sleep right your brain is just like it's like a it's going to be fried right and i see loads of people like yeah i've been i've been up for for six days straight and then i'm you know i'm gonna be the best damn developer i've got like three hours sleep average this week that's not good right like you need to take care of your but your body is a vessel like you need to kind of like eat some eat right sleep right all of those things why we sleep is a really good book um i'd recommend everyone reads that it's really really good book um i didn't realize how much sleep did for you until i read that book um but i would say yeah so with the on that note guys uh amazing session so many people are still here and like and it's crazy even on youtube we still have a bunch of people
