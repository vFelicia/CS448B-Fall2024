hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer comm we're going live today so it's my birthday today and I thought hey what more exciting way to celebrate it and to start off my day then spend some time with you guys and also do something that I love a lot which is play chess so today is gonna be not so serious day and check it out I'm wearing the all right this way clever programmer shirt but yeah so today it's not gonna be such a serious day we're just gonna be having fun so before this video even starts if you're here for programming there's not gonna be too much programming I'm just gonna be hanging out and also I'll answer some questions for fun so you know any any question you want to ask me could be anything or if you want to keep you know ask me some technical program in question I'll answer that as well but other than that I'll play some chess and teach you some chests and you can just watch it over my shoulder and see my crazy reactions as I'm playing and my thought process and maybe pick up secret or two that you can use as well yep so we'll see how it goes okay let's see if there are people here so far hi oh nice there are other people whose birthday happy birthday George thank you guys thank you I appreciate it thank you thank you thank you doctor says it was his birthday yesterday happy birthday doc you guys are way too nice way too nice alright so I'm gonna start playing and just watch along and let me know how you guys like it okay cool so let's see hopefully I have my stuff set up right um you do this I think that should be good we'll doublecheck in a little bit but um I'm gonna play like a three minute game and I'll try to talk my way through it hopefully and we'll see how I do I'm probably gonna lose cuz it takes a lot of attention to play a quick game but let's see so my rating is almost 2000 which puts me around the top 1% in chess but when you play online they put you against people of your own ratings and chests the goal is to get this guy the king if you guys don't know so that's really what I'm gonna be focusing on and I have a little bit of experience playing chess okay so I want to put my rook here so I can attack his King and he blocks it which is a good move and I'll move back cuz he was gonna take my bishop okay I will do this so now I'm gonna take his knight if he doesn't do anything so he does do something let's see why can't I just win a pawn here so I'm thinking I can take the knight he takes back with the rook I take what the rook he takes with the Queen and then I take here because now the Queen isn't guarding the pawn anymore so I'm oh wait maybe I can just take here right now takes Bishop to Bishop tags I'm actually let's do it this way okay so now I have an extra pawn he's probably gonna play here and I have to see what I can do you know with that pawn and try to win off of that pawn he's playing a little bit aggressively but I'm gonna like strike back I don't want him to put the pond in front of my face okay let's see okay I'm gonna go here open that up a little bit and then play here so now I'm attacking that pawn and also I can put my bishop or I'm an attack his rook and now what about Knight g5 doesn't that yeah that move is really annoying cuz I'm attacking this guy there's no good way for him to defend it except move his rook here to protect that pawn because I have one two attackers on this guy and he has one two defenders but he doesn't want to give up his queen to defend I'm also preparing for a tournament that's coming up this weekend it's gonna be a pretty tough tournament it's called Chicago class so I'm gonna be playing there Knight takes rook takes Queen a4 no I don't like that actually I just feel like I have a lot of pressure on his position here and now oh did I just drop this pawn oh I'm an idiot oh oh wait is there a knight takes f7 no ship takes rook yeah I kind of messed this one up guys okay well it is what it is dropped a pawn here Oh what if I take his Bishop and then play rook here oh he attacks my knight and then I move here keeping threat on his rope night and then bishop and also fork yeah so it looks like I should be okay here with after Knight here yeah I think so well he has rook here dang this lucky guy huh it's very close oh I have Knight here there's crazy stuff going on all over the place okay so now he wants to play a rook here to attack my knight and then if I move my knight he wants to play rook here I even tried to checkmate me but that's not gonna be happening right now because I have a lot of pressure on this pawn and he can't move this pawn this bishop is attacking it rook and Knight I have 37 seconds he has one minute 28 seconds he can win on time so if I go 20 minutes 0 seconds he wins and after this round is over I'll take a break and then I'll come back and I'll answer some of your guys's burning questions why did he do that I just went his bishop okay so now it's yeah he resigned here because I have so Bishop is worth three points rook is five points and pawns are one point so basically if you add all of this up I'm ahead by a eight points and you know I'm gonna basically take his pawns then move this pawn up and get a queen and then I would use this this piece and my new queen to then checkmate the King he doesn't want to play that and he resigned okay so I'm gonna switch over and try to answer some of your guys's questions now hopefully you guys saw that fine ooh lots of happy birthday's coming through nice thank you guys thank you thank you thank you yeah Katie you you should come here you guys are welcome to come here and celebrate my birthday with me if you guys are in United States I would love to catch up with you guys and just hang out yeah I should really be coding today but I decided to take a day off from coding I'm trying I'm playing some chess recently so you know kind of felt like doing that for a little bit but okay guys go ahead if you guys have questions I'll ask them now before I start my next chess game and then I won't be able to answer them and I'm playing the game because I can't see your questions alright let's see okay good oh we have lots of people live that's actually really cool we got a bunch of you guys online ask me your questions ask me your questions I'll answer them you guys are way too nice yeah well okay so subscribers are going up which is great the channel really was add you know zero subscribers and are very few subscribers until September last year and one of my goals by December was to get 100 subscribers but instead of getting 100 subscribers by December I ended up getting 5,000 subscribers by December which was phenomenal and yeah according to my calculations back in the day 60,000 subscribers should have taken like three or four years but that ended up happening a lot quicker than that meaning it ended up happening in July which is again fantastic thank you guys so much for supporting the channel if you haven't subscribed please do subscribe but I have a feeling that you must have subscribed because you got the notification for the livestream and I'm from like right now did you just get a notification from YouTube or did you get an email from me and that's what brought you here oh wow Katie knows chess openings nice well let's see okay so mukha says feed aerating my feed eeeh trading is probably around 1900 1800 my USCF rating is about 2002 it was 2000 66 in peak time but then I stopped playing chess I focused more in software development I focused more on making pointing getting clients and my chess rating dropped and so now that I have more time I mean I'm trying to play chess again because I just loved it um yeah my favorite chess opening is Joko piano I love it I understand it really well it's spelled really weirdly and most of you guys won't know what the heck I'm talking about but it's probably one of the most basic openings you ever learn in chess and I love it and I play it to this day and I can maybe maybe show it to you really quickly so here's how Joko piano looks I want to close the chess engine so basically I bring my night out so one of the things that you guys should know if you're playing chess so these are some top secrets is that don't move your pawns a lot and every move you make should control one of these four squares just this secret alone will help you beat almost like anybody that you play against I don't mean competitive players but like if you're playing as your dad your brother your friend you know your cousin and you've been getting beat by them all the time just a secret alone will help you a lot so in the opening only make moves that control the center so okay here's a opening move I bring my knight out and it controls two Center squares because Knight can attack like this and this and then black brings his Knight out and then I play Bishop c4 which again you know controlling these four squares and oh yeah this is joke Oh piano you know I don't want to go any deeper than this because they're like 10 more moves down the line and all kinds of different variations and stuff but to keep it very simple this is what it looks like you know and these are moves that when you start out in chess these are some of the moves that you know get taught by your coach or really anybody who knows how to play chess a little bit they can show you but basically you know whites controlling the center really well blacks controlling the center really well and then you play on from here so I really love this opening and then I also like the Grand Prix against the Sicilian but you know I don't want to step into the esoteric category too much and I still want to keep you guys with me so let me switch again all right here we go so hopefully I kind of answered that question if SIL says hey Kazi your videos are awesome I need career advice regarding software web development such as technologies to go for and then what is the industry standard again you know it's not about how many technologies it's about really picking one and getting good at it and getting people results with it so you don't have to worry about too many different technology but you know focus on becoming good at one technology or language so for example I always talk about programming and let's say you're good at Java focus on becoming better at Java and then you'll be able to you know like get your foot in the door so you can start working with the company maybe as a junior developer or maybe as an intern and then you can all still teach you some other stacks meaning for example if they need you to do some web development they'll teach you sequel or they'll teach you I don't know HTML or CSS you know things like that and then you'll end up picking it up so get good at one thing and then you can add more things on top of that and you know another simple stack is Python Python HTML CSS may be a little bit of JavaScript but once you get good at one thing it's easy to pick up these other languages all right let's see okay ah let's see what are the questions I'm trying to yeah let's see Zara's says happy birthday thank you Sara and she says enjoy your date how do you stay active and physically fit while programming full time so if you just go with the natural momentum of things like just natural flow and go by how you feel like every day you will be in very bad shape which is where like most of the programmers get a bad rep and rightfully so most of them are like fat or don't take care of themselves or smell like crap and it's not it's kind of their fault but it's also not so much their fault because it's the field and the field itself it just kind of like you sit and you're creating awesome stuff but you're sitting most of the time you know and and you're not really moving around so you really have to make it a part of your day to go and put in some physical work and a lot of the times when you think of work you don't want to do it so how I like to make myself work is I like soccer so I'll join an intraoral intramural soccer team which is it's not competitive but it's a soccer team and so by playing a soccer game and being there for my team it's fun there's a lot of fun and it pretty much forces me to keep myself physically fit or I'll play tennis with my friends Reese you know I also lift but you know if lifting is difficult for you try one of these other strategies because you want it to be fun too to work out and then it'll become a habit after that so if it's just work you're not gonna do it you're gonna do it for a week and then you're gonna quit and now I'm doing like martial arts I'm doing jujitsu I'm doing boxing and those things give more purpose to you know just me improving my strength because strength like sure I can you know pick up more groceries and and obviously feel really fit strength is my favorite thing because I don't have to run but you know then adding in some fighting or like mixed martial arts gives it more of a purpose so you know create systems that force you to be there and force you to work just like when I started the clever programmer channel I was working with lots of clients around that time and I was going to college I had like multiple different jobs so I was putting it I mean I was working like 16 hours a day working or studying and then what I did was I gave up all my clients and I cut all my sources of income and and then I also got this office and that was an additional overhead expense and what that forced me to do was like that was great that I had motivation to keep this channel going but I made it so I literally had to survive off of this channel and live off of this channel and really turn it into a business and that was the best decision I've ever made because motivation keeps you going but then it can run out you know it's like willpower it can run out but then if it's necessity that doesn't run out because otherwise you just can't live you know you can't keep up your standard of lifestyle and the pain there is too much so may I make these systems for myself and you can do the same thing hopefully that answers your questions our jimothy that's an interesting name I've never heard jimothy of her Timothy and Jimmy but not jimothy so now in my new programming videos maybe you'll be hearing a lot of jimothy because I'm sick of Bob and banana those are the only two thin damn things that come to my mind and you you probably see that in all my tutorials but yeah jimothy films it's a great epic name he asks can you do C++ series like you did the Python series not right now I'm pretty focused on Python and the stack that goes behind Python so I'm gonna be really doing that not not too much C++ or anything right now aha let's see what are those numbers 80 77 78 I have no idea what numbers use it yeah it's always tough because you know um I will yeah I can start a blog on web development and all of that but the one thing that's tough is a lot of you guys are just starting out so most of the things aren't gonna make too much sense and I don't want to do stuff that you know just like you know just you just go and figure it out I'll just post random stuff so I'm really trying to cater and make stuff that everybody can understand and follow along and then you know we move and then you know more I'll add in more advanced stuff but there's a lot of missing pieces right now that I think are vital and are just not taught by so many other channels and programs so I want to make sure that I fill in those gaps for you guys vivix vivix says hey Kazi happy birthday I want to learn to develop iOS apps I'm reading a book by Apple on iBooks is it good question mark what do you recommend and I want to implement AI for an app idea um a book by Apple I don't know that sounds like a really technical jargon eBook that doesn't really teach how to create stuff but just kind of shows you some tutorials or something I haven't seen that book but I would recommend like you know just go on Amazon and look up some iOS book I personally don't have too much experience developing in iOS but I am familiar with the language that you use it's called Swift and if you want to develop AI stuff one of the best channels to follow a Siraj Raval it's s ir aj space are IV al somebody write that in chat please so people can see what channel I'm talking about and it's a channel on YouTube and this guy is phenomenal and he goes over a lot of machine learning concepts though they are advanced and if you don't know programming it wouldn't really make that much sense like you'll just be copying and pasting stuff which if you're ok with it then go definitely try it out but you know I would say go check them out and you learn a lot of like he'll show you how you can create a game of ping pong where the computer beat you know learns by losing and then gets better and better and like basically teach it teaches itself so that's AI and you can then you know use your iOS book and then learn what you learn from Sir Roger of all even though he teaches in Python but language doesn't matter concepts do and you can take what you learn from Suraj traval and then apply it to your iOS app by learning those applying those same concepts and Swift okay so yeah hmm ah nice Bassam console dot write line happy birthday nice one I love it Josie jo jo's Oh Ramos I'm butchering your name I'm sorry it's Jo su e space Ramos I says happy birthday I want to learn programming but I type too slow due to only being able to use one hand do you think this could be an impediment to learn it's actually really funny you say that not the funny part the funny part is not that you have one hand but the funny part that you type to slope because I am making I made a video about typing and how that it can actually help you learn much faster and get better results and why it's so important that video is gonna come out probably in a week or two but here's what I will say I don't think it's an impediment to do coding that's one great thing about coding that even if you don't have an arm you could still be a fantastic coder and code well because it's really about thoughts there isn't much typing mmm it's not like writing you know like for example a good code or can write something in two lines which you know an amateur might write in 20 or 50 lines so that just goes to show there's a lot of thought process that takes place and creativity that takes place when I'm coding on a project or doing a problem 90% plus of my time is spent thinking so it's either I'm sitting here thinking like this or I'm going out for a walk and I just close my eyes and I'm thinking of possible solutions and you know different ideas that I could come up with and that I could implement so when I come to write the code after like two hours of thinking I might write three lines of code so you know there isn't a lot crazy amount of typing now of course it's going to be an impediment but I also watch this video that you should look at I forgot what it was called but basically this guy is writing code in Emacs which is a writing editor and he's writing it he's using dictation and this guy has developed some insane system to write code by just speaking and he he's paralyzed I don't even think and any of his hands work and he's literally just and he does alive on in a live event he shows how he's writing code and so he's saying some crazy stuff like LARP sharp chook and his code is being refactored their arguments that are being added in the parenthesis they're squigglies getting added their semicolons being added in the right place the code is getting indented correctly and I'm sitting there like holy even with two arms and a typing speed of 100 words per minute which is about my typing speed I cannot write how quickly he just wrote that so there are better systems there you know it's only as much of an impediment as you let it be their workarounds and I suggest you look into those workarounds and yeah that's that mmhmm house I actually thought about making computer programming tutorials in or do or Hindi but maybe on our another channel clever or do.com or something tips and tricks thank you for wishing me happy birthday and yes I am replying to you as well let's see Manish I don't know what time will I tell up will I be online I'm just doing this for fun so if I feel like staying here for a little bit longer I'll stay here if I feel like leaving I'll leave but you know I'm having fun here answering your guys's questions so you know I'm probably gonna be here for a little while longer but you know not the whole day or anything like that thank you so me uh Thank You Luca tax Thank You fourth planet yep programming is thinking and not that much typing 100 percent agreed let's see any more questions questions questions cocka cocka questions let's see yeah I'm gonna do I'm gonna do like life coding for you guys doing live streams we just had a launch and the launch was absolutely insane it was basically the create Python Opie course and you know usually I'll open it up only for a five day period and then I announce it and then it's like everybody goes crazy and you know including everybody a clever programmer and team and all the students and so we got hundreds of new students that joined this time and then the program shut down so now things are calming down a little bit and I was thinking to do some live stream for you guys where I'm coding and you guys just kind of get to watch over my shoulder and see my thought process and everything yeah I just completed all your Python courses do you think it's time to move on to another programming language like JavaScript PS I'm passionate about web development Yussef this is exactly the time my friend where you as garyvee would say you grab Python by the throat this is exactly the time where you use Python and create actual things so now that you are trained I want you to create stuff and you can do web development with Python look into a framework called flask don't start with Django it's too little too complicated and magical especially when you're starting out look into flask and then with flask HTML CSS you'll you can build pretty much anything so you you know full web development stuff and flask is you know not some esoteric framework it's just as popular you know you have Python web developers using flask making hundred over a hundred thousand dollars or averaging around ninety thousand dollars Python has backend of backend developers full stack developers frontend developers you know using Python so it's hot and it's trending it's not a risky thing to learn and invest your time in not now and not you know for the next 10 20 years well let's just say five years because things change quickly in the programming world however once you know the concepts you can quickly switch over and print happy birthday let's see what else okay let me answer some more stuff for you guys guys have some juicy questions um okay yeah sure well I can provide some automation Python tutorials thank you Kishore hey bro I'm learning Python but my math is not good so please tell in programming need math Satya asks and basically what he's trying to ask is do you need math in programming and my answer to this question is math helps but you don't need it not at all absolutely not there are too many programmers I know that our terrible math I'm pretty bad at math I can think logically but I'm not very good at math so yeah you don't you don't really need that much math you can be really good in programming it's it's it's like I say it's language almost as a reallife language so you know for learning French or German or doing something creative or learning how to write a bike or learning how to swim you just need to learn that thing and it's not really associated with a bunch of other things it's it's kind of asking do I need to be good at math to swim you don't need to be good at math to swim chase asked when does your program go up chase my program goes up probably in four five five months again maybe longer I'm not sure but what I do is I close the program down and improve it and then I launch it again how old am i well let's just say that 23 sounds way better than 22 thank you gun going Kahlo all of us I've just butchered your name but thank you so much I didn't delete my recent live feeds I just private at them because they're irrelevant now that the course is closed and I might make them live again later but those are generally I only go live during those times and you have to catch it during those times you know that's why it's special yeah so they're gonna be yeah once once it goes off it's it's gone important modules like you are a Lib okay that's a good that's a good question your ellipse sucks that Aditya but I understand what you're saying and I'll definitely make on I'll definitely make videos on programming modules the better one then you are a Lib is requests for Python okay I'm gonna go and play another game of chess and then I'll be back because that's what I feel like doing right now all right so let's go um okay see I'm gonna do three minutes because I can still speak in three minutes whereas one minute I can't speak at all it takes too much of my focus okay let's try one minute you guys will get to see my face be really weird I'll try to be normal on livestream but my face gets all weirded up and yeah I won't be able to talk too much but okay so you can see I have one minute he has one minute and we can lose on time or we can win by checkmating each other so right now I'm just trying to attack his dark square pawns like this one and he takes my knight which is okay I'm just gonna castle here okay whoops I overlooked that I'm dropping a pawn but that's you know that sucks but it's not the end of the world oh that is d5 here this is this is getting really ugly now oh there's maid here so I can't even take that okay so now I'm gonna ready to take this pawn or take here I'm down a piece so meaning that I'll very likely lose this game however I'll try my best to hold on here and and see how I do if he moves his Queen away at any point this Knight will hang he sees that and he stops me so now I'll go here and attack this pawn I'll go back here again to just annoy him okay now my counter play is okay if he wants a draw draw if we repeat position three times in chess it's a draw okay if I take here he basically saying he'll play a rook here and then when my bishop so I cannot allow that I'm just gonna run away now this pond should be in trouble he's gonna take here I think oh okay now no no he's not in on any trouble yet but he is low on time so I just have to play really fast here and I think I can do that did he just mess up yeah if he takes now I have this so I just want a piece one second left okay he's trying to trick me but that doesn't matter ooh checkmate okay that was really good actually so let me explain kind of what took place here who I was able to commentate and everything wow this is really awesome okay so I moved here you know he's not any threat because I'm trying to checkmate him cuz I got my bishop and Queen lined up but he has his knight here looking at it so he's still not in any trouble yet but then he plays this move rook to attack my queen now he's thinking okay I'll move my Queen back because if I take his rook then he just takes it back with the bishop and I'm down a queen and queen is nine points whereas the rook is five points so he's expecting me to move back or take here basically just get off this dangerous diagonal except he missed a tactic which is his back rank is really weak meaning that if his queen is not here if my rook comes down here that's a checkmate his King has no squares and so I exploited that I exploited his back rank weakness and I took his bishop because again you know I'm sacrificing my queen temporarily but if he takes my Queen then rook comes here and that's checkmate it's game over so he tried to waste he was really low on time he had about one second left here he he tried this desperate move rook check to waste my time but doesn't change anything I just take that rook and now if he takes my Queen which he did again rook here is checkmate and he was gonna lose on time anyways he had zero seconds I had eight seconds left but I played Road Caron you know just made it him instead so it was a pretty good game and now I'll come back to answer some questions all right let me do this in the quickest way possible I'm getting good at this live streaming stuff Wow there's like so many different moving parts that I got to keep track of and I think is doing fine all right let's see ah Gonzalo I'm sorry about that I see that you you added them to see them later I got you that some some people man ya never give up that's right knee and auntie Annie asks why do we use while / dowhile loops when we have for loop that's a good question for loop is when you know when something ends while loop is when you don't know when something ends so yeah I that's a weird answer I know but you know for example for loops are easier to write I love for loops but while loops are generally you know you'll use them and you don't know when something look for example let's say that you want to play a game that always allows the option of clicking play again at the end so you play a game of tictactoe and then you want it to give you the option of saying play again to start it again you don't know how many times a user that's using your program feels like playing that game they might want to play it thousand times or one time and then close it so you don't want to write a for loop there because in a for loop you might have to say something like for I in range or something like that you know meaning that for 20 times it should say play again for 10 times it should play again but you don't want to hardcode something that says that because you don't know if the user wants to play it 20 times or 10 times or thousand times for one time so you're gonna write a while loop which is pretty much gonna say while true meaning while the player wants to play keep going and as soon as they hit no then the while loop ends so that's an example of a while loop versus a for loop or another while loop might be while not tired from doing pushups keep going because you don't know how many pushes this person will do or a for loop you can say for I in range 20 keep going meaning for 20 pushups you know keep going until 20 pushups hopefully that gives you a little bit of an intuition and a little bit of an understanding between while loops versus for loops I was gonna say Froot Loops I've been playing chess for a while since I was about 14 or 15 high school played one state championships twice and became top 1% in the world fairly quickly because I am obsessive when I get on something I go allin baby so yeah where do you live mmhmm by the way you consolidate you so much I'm humbled to know that I was your inspiration to go back to Python I love hearing that and keep me updated on your progress I'm glad it's been smooth ride so far basic hash function I can't explain that super fast my friend that takes some drawing and screen sharing which I don't have set up right now but Jonathan yeah like they're basically the idea behind hashes is like caches you know see ACH II and it's to help you speed up things to use already existing data ooh Veronica's 16 14 hey if you guys play chess send me a live challenge and I'll play with you you know on Lee chess org I'll play with you there Henry says what should I do after completing my beginners course there are some online videos I have on YouTube you can launch those or straight up you can just try to find some more advanced trainings online on Udacity or a Coursera until of course I relaunch my course in like many months half a year probably and then you know you can join the course then yeah Gonzalo there you go haha ok moronic send me invite my name is Rafa 0 1 which is RAF eh 0 1 send me an invite there and I will accept it and then we will play online and everybody will watch me play against somebody who's in our livestream how freaking cool is that it's basically more onic we're basically gonna be like hanging out on my birthday you know just one on one you know sitting back and drinking some monster and playing some chess Jason Owens the best framework for someone new to Python is flask not Django foreknew not Django I'm not Grandmaster and chess moronic I wish Veronica I don't see your invite my friend my user name is Rafa 01 send me an invite I wonder if you guys can hear me gulping when I'm drinking monster it's almost like an ad let me get sponsored by monster hmm Sahil are gufa function is used to parse commandline arguments let me put on my smart glasses so args is used to powers commandline arguments meaning that you can pass in an argument to your function right from your command line without having to hardcoded into your Python script you can pass that argument as your about to call that script from your command line hopefully that confused you I'm I'm pretty good at understanding what somebody will understand or not and that while the words make sense I don't think you'll actually understand what I'm saying until I show you which I can't do right now in this live stream because I don't have the coding stuff set up here I do like stuff like astrophysics or genetic engineering I'm terrible at them but I'm very curious about those concepts which is why I'll watch these videos by this one guy who's always doing these documentaries on physics and he's explaining all this amazing stuff I forgot his name Tyron Woodley no no that's not I I don't know his name I'm gonna stop guessing I don't have a friend request from you my friend are you sending me a friend request or what I don't see a friend request I'm looking at my inbox I'm looking at everything I don't have a friend request no it's not rough is its raw fate RAF ages zero one like this look I wrote it for you okay let's see what other people are saying let's see interest sensor some interesting questions chase yeah it's it's like think of it like a movie launch you know and it's it comes to the theaters and then it goes away from the theaters and that's how this course works I closed it down because then I want to focus on the group that's inside the course and I want to focus on the course material and improving it and then once it's improved and that cohort kind of goes through that entire course and completes it then I will open it up again for a few days okay so I'll open up it up again in a few months for a few days if you're on my email list basically if you enroll in one of my free courses at clever programmer comm you'll find out all of this information alright let's see a fifteen minute game I don't want to play a fifteen minute game let's play a shorter time frame because it will take too long so I'm gonna cancel this but I'll send you a shorter time control the fans will be like this game is way too long alright so let's do this okay I'm sending you sending your rated threeminute match and let's play so but this guy he's not accepting my challenge what's going on future billionaire here well let's see hopefully gotta get to a million first million dollars is really not that hard like I don't know why people make it sound that hard it's so it's very simple it's very hard if you try to just do it by yourself and like you know by just doing jobs that's what makes it difficult as long as your hours are tied to the amount of money you make it's very difficult and life is very difficult you need to break the chains of work and what you're paid for and if if the only way you can make more money is by working more hours you're gonna be stuck in that cycle for the rest of your life and it's a pretty weird cycle maybe you like it I don't I like being able to do stuff on my own time but if you can find a way where the amount of money are making is not associated with the amount of time you're putting in now you're getting into a very good lifestyle which is why when you're doing when you're doing freelancing or consultations I highly recommend you're not sending me the challenges okay I'm gonna try one more time and if I if you don't accept it then I'm gonna play online with somebody else but okay anyways let me finish my thoughts so the reason why I yeah so what I suggest when you're doing freelancing or when you're consulting is you don't focus on setting hourly rates because that by definition ties you to the hours you should try to set result valuebased pricing is called valuebased pricing and go and learn more about it but that's the type of pricing where you're not charging hourly but you're charging based on a project and it doesn't matter if that project takes you two hours or one week it's just one price so if you get better at it you can do it in like three hours and send it to them completed like for example if somebody tells you to put together a website for them and they want to pay you $5,000 for it and that's the price you guys agree on it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter if you make the website in two hours or take three weeks to make it right that's where your proficiency and skill and how effective you are that comes into play and that starts to break you from the bonds of your hours with the money you're making and then you want to try to find you know after that you want to try to find higher paying clients who have the money don't bother yourself with petty shitty clients like I did for a while I worked with this lady and to this day she gives me nightmares even thinking about it like me and my friend worked our ass off we built everything from scratch like spent 40 hours working on it and you know we wanted to put something on our portfolio and we're like it's gonna be awesome is gonna be so good and after spending like 40 hours or something or more she wanted to pass not even not even three hundred dollars and she made us do like five or seven revisions and we were giving her like that was chump change like I was used to charging clients for that amount over like the five thousand ten thousand dollars and for her I was doing it for cheaper because I at that time I didn't have experience and didn't have a portfolio it didn't have resume so I was like okay I'll do something for cheaper as long as I can build a portfolio and resume but you see the problem that I had there was that I was going to somebody who didn't have money right she wasn't as much as I hated her and then to this day it still makes me angry that somebody would work somebody did that level and just grind them out and not even pay them anything yes she by the way she didn't pay us anything we made no money after 40 hours of work you know the lesson that I learned is go to the people that have money don't go to people who don't have money because it doesn't matter how good harder to they heart they are or how amazing they are you know there's there's no way that they can pay you even if they love you all right I'm gonna go and accept this challenge now Oh somebody else challenged me okay cool moronic I'll play you in a little bit but looks like somebody challenged me here okay guys so I'm playing against somebody on the on the livestream let me ask them so I just sent out a message saying hey did you come here from the livestream and we're playing oh okay cool this person is 1,300 that's really or 1,400 sorry it's a really good reading and let's see how does the game goes so he's developing his pieces that's really good you know you want to control the center and he's doing that you know every move he's playing like look at that pawn here Knights controlling this one this square brilliant chess Bishop here so all of these four squares every move that he's making they're being controlled you know even his queen is controlling those squares and I'm trying to do the same thing in chess you can make this move called castling this is the only time you can move your king and rook at the same time so that's what I'm gonna do you know I'm just gonna play it a little bit safe here he's moves his Bishop here to pressure my knight and you know I have a few options here but I'm just gonna say okay I had take my knight and he says no sir I don't want to take your knight and I'll say okay I'll just kick his Bishop again and then just defend this pawn so he let me expand a little bit on the Queen side which you know is I'm happy with and I'm gonna trade my knight for his Bishop because in chess in middle game if you can get a bishop pair it's usually considered advantageous for the side that has the two bishops hmm there's also Knight c5 in the position this is an interesting position there's nine takes b6 there's also Knight c5 I like Knight c5 mmm I'm gonna play Knight c5 and just just cramp down on him here a little bit still nobody really has you know a huge edge or anything like that it's a pretty closed position okay he decides to take now I can I can take whichever way I want I'm gonna take this way because I want to be able to pressure his it's funny cuz he's hearing all of this so he knows exactly what I'm gonna be doing but it's okay I'm gonna try to pressure this B file here and and let's see how he reacts to this okay I can attack his night which is it's pretty uncomfortable move to deal with it actually I'll see where he goes my pieces are getting a little bit inside of his position which can be a little bit annoying sometimes and I'm just gonna I can also play C six and then a six I move my bishop back he takes a pawn if I move here he can play b5 okay so I'm just gonna try to squeeze him a little bit here and make him a little restricted with his pieces and try to control more squares on the Queen side so he has some light square weaknesses here you know there are lots of light squares my pieces can get into that's kind of what I'm focusing on here so there's a lot of time left he has three minutes have two minutes 49 seconds it's also possible we can get under time trouble and things could start you know going a little bit wrong for us now I think I'm just going to take here he has a better pawn structure that's one of the advantages that he has right now but I am I do want to actually oh wait is bishop c6 here really good did he just miss that I can just play so if I play here and attack his knight and if his knight ever moved I can take his rook that's probably really good there's also c6 there's also 96 too many choices here Knight here it looks pretty good too he can go Queen e8 oh wow after Knight here he can go Queenie and or Queen d7 and in either case I can do Knight takes a 7 there are too many choices here too many choices I think I'm just gonna go Bishop c6 it looks like the simplest way to go I mean he can he can look to sack the exchange meaning he can move his knight and let me take his rook but I like my position better there I think I have winning chances but this is one of those things that happen you know so this is what I was talking about I get these light squares and he's gonna be oh very smart so he actually attacks my queen and breaks the pin at the same time so he is actually a genius I should have done the other thing all right all right no stress I'm just gonna play some solid chess here control squares it's gonna be up a pawn but I'd like to think I have some compensation here okay so he takes there that's expected hmm I am getting a little bit under time pressure here so I do need to keep playing fast he's playing incredibly well okay now I think there's might be some stuff going on on the C file okay if I take here he just takes back but I have 96 right attacking the Queen and the rook so I'm I have a disadvantage right now I'm down multiple pawns but it looks like I'm gonna get my exchange back what about rook here take stakes yeah rook here looks really good and if he don't I just win his rook okay so it looks like he messed up a little bit I think unless he has some resource here but it looks like he won't be able to actually defend this rook at all meaning he can't go Queen here because his queen is under attacks but he can't go Queen here too to defend his rook because I have Knight takes Queen and if he moves his queen let's say here then I can actually take his rook and just be up a rook and I think that's exactly what I'm going to do here I'm gonna play some weird tactical moves here that are gonna give him some trouble and let's see what he depending on what he plays but I have a move in mind that actually so this is a very annoying move to deal with under time pressure yeah so I just want more material there I have rook check here coming which is actually mate if he doesn't watch out for it I'll defend my pawn so he can't take my pawn with his knight he has five seconds left I'm up material so he looks like he's in a lot of trouble yes check but I'll just go back okay very good game it was very very well played and so I think he played really well I just think he got a little bit greedy by taking this pawn I don't I don't think you should take this pawn more natural moves are night here getting his night in the game yeah this this move looks really good he just needs to bring more pieces so he has a lot of activity but he chose instead to take my pawn which then brings this rook to life and he has to watch out for that and also I'm I'm I was looking to clear this Bishop from here so I can land the knight here and he actually allows me to do that and then he and then he gets in a little bit of trouble here okay so really good game and if anybody else wants to challenge I'll accept it and I'm gonna come back and answer your guys questions now okay cool cool cool cool Trump Donald nice chess it's to leech s org allied chess org it's like this and you can actually just go there and play any time it's free let's see somebody else sent me o moronic now sent me a challenge so I'm gonna go and play a challenge with him and then I'll come answer your guys's questions in a second okay so Austin Chang asked me a question Austin is actually in my course he's also on my snapchat which is super cool and he just asked me a question in livestream so I'm gonna answer that and he says if you make a website app for someone and get paid do you are you expected to maintain the site and fix it if something goes wrong I am very clear with my clients about this most of the times I want to deal with headache and me on the call so I will generally make it very clear that once we are done with the deal and they get what they need that's it like I'm out and if something goes wrong they should try to fix it but generally I will make sure that it's very clear I'll bring in a team of testers as third party unit testers and these people will test and make sure everything is working fine it's almost as if you know when you have that if you get into a car accident yeah you know you can call in a third party to unbiased ly look at what happened and like who gets how much money or who was at fault it's sort of like that so it's basically my insurance policy kind of thing you know I'll bring in third party unit testers and they'll test out everything they'll communicate with me they'll communicate with my client and then we part ways because I don't want to deal with that headache unless you're charging them monthly something for it you know $2,000 $4,000 I don't know whatever to you know if something goes wrong it's part of the contract or you can charge them an extra premium in the proposal so then when something like that comes up you're okay with it because you charge that extra premium and they paid it upfront so you can just give them life time like you know maintenance and you also have to understand which clients are working where there's some nasty stingy clients those are the clients you fire and don't work with in the start you want to work obviously I'll try to get any work that you can but try to be very respect yourself don't let shitty people destroy your life there are a lot of people like that who are very stingy watch over every little thing that you do always stay over your shoulder there to always complain and blame will never give you compliments if you do something right or respect you you know or you know so basically watch out for those types of people if you have good clients you'll know that even if you give them lifetime maintenance they're not gonna bother you for no reason unless there's really something wrong so those are the people you cannot be okay with giving them like okay I'll give you maintenance if anything goes wrong but the type of people who's exploited and take advantage of it those are the people you know you really want to run away from just like one of my clients who like literally used and abused us didn't pay us money at the end of the day and had us do like seven or eight revisions even though we were supposed to do only like maybe one revision like we were doing her a favor the entire time okay hopefully that answers the question Rudy that was a really good game you know yeah maybe you were nervous but you shouldn't be because you play really well you only made very few mistakes okay now Marana keeps sending me the challenge so I'm gonna go and accept his challenge and play a moronic moronic is also in the live chat right now so he's actually somebody who's in the live chat sending me a challenge and I'll play him if you guys want to send me a challenge it's my birthday and I'll play you I don't care it's fun all right let's go okay he's not playing let's go come on let's go moronic okay good good good good he finally played he says hi in the chat nice okay so now maybe we're gonna play a joke Oh piano I don't know let's see what he chooses to play here I'm gonna be right back I'm gonna make a quick call and I'll be right back you don't need to give me any extra time or anything this move is not accurate so you want to change that after this game and I'll show you why I'm gonna be back in a second okay all right what's up fellas I'm getting calls for my birthday so I have to go and take them sometimes it's okay you don't need to give me extra time thank you though I appreciate it okay so I'm gonna take here and the idea is that if he takes my night I fork him right and if he takes here I take here and I still get the center basically black is trying to control the center and if black can play these two moves a 5 and d5 black has a quality pretty much so that's really what I'm going for now I have a feeling we'll get a pretty sharp game and let's see how he deals with this move and I think now it's gonna get very tactical because his knights hanging hanging but my Knights hanging and if he takes my knight and take him back he takes here it's a fork he's looking at my king in my rook so let's see how moronic deals with it I won't do too many calculations because then again then he knows exactly what I'm calculating but you know I'll try to calculate more after the game and show you guys some of this stuff and and yeah I'm gonna be playing at a chess tournament this weekend it's gonna be a really huge tournament and people from all over the world actually come to play there um I'm wondering if I could take there here here here I mean why can't I just on passant and keep this oh my queen is hanging it oh my god okay ah I almost played pawn takes here but just realize my Queens hanging okay well I don't have a choice process of elimination my friend the ultimate process that's how I do coating as well process of elimination I'm wondering if I can play here you played there I play here no no no that I can't go there that doesn't make sense um this position is annoying let's see I can go there okay okay let's say I go here and just put more pressure on him what is happening here this is a it's a complicated position they're a bunch of things going on and basically we both have to figure it out you know we don't know what moves to play and we're trying to figure our way out of this complication so you place queen there which is a mistake just gonna calculate it one more time yeah I should be fine here yeah it was already defended so he didn't need to do that I love a bunch of pawns here but I am very low on time maybe I should just play it fast here whatever oh my god I'm an idiot okay that's the move I should not have played yeah because of that but okay let's look for some counter play I I'm really long time 30 seconds left and it looks like he's about to get the advantage what what am i doing I should have taken his this is just bad that's what it is okay 26 seconds to 2 minutes and 37 seconds he looks to be in a better position I do have a bunch of pawns for the trouble but I am I'm getting in a lot of trouble right now so I'm just gonna get out of the way really long time really suffering here not doing good at all let's see what he's got planned next surely poor time management on my part okay so he's attacking here when I attacked there he has struts of going Bishop there but you know the pressure my c7 pond I think I should be okay we'll see this is a very tough position here for me and more than position the time is a huge factor okay hopefully I'm not allowing any tactical shots here because I would get in a lot of trouble if I do so I have 11 seconds here's one minute 13 seconds he wants to trade in two opposite colored bishop endgame but um I'm on his f2 pawn so I'm not sure how he wants to deal with that Oh sneaky sneaky he's trying to mate me in the back rank okay oh wait that's that doesn't make any sense I thought that move was so good but it's not it's too much time trouble actually yeah so he knows I'm pretty much done here especially with the time trouble that I'm in oh okay good game good game here I miss my chance I kept thinking about this but I so I lost the game he played really well and great game great game so here's where it really happened so the reason why I played here was so I could play here next but then for some reason I forgot but yeah I should just play here he takes my pawn I take his pawn in and then it's a draw but good game very nice let's see if we have new challengers we have another challenger Lara fall and I'm gonna play one game with her and moronic I think we need to play a rematch my friend will play a rematch at some point great game though great game okay let's see if there's any new questions how were you one direction yeah I get that Zayn all right cool now let's go and play the game okay ooh that's an interesting move checkmate be careful about pushing this pawn in this pawn Laura and are you are you in livestream I mean you have to be I think pretty sure so okay so basically be careful about pushing this pawn and this pawn because you can get in some trouble like that check a median criminis game I didn't realize no no how they're five minutes 16 seconds okay cool anybody else wants a challenge go ahead we'll play another game oh I gotta close this maybe I'm not so good at this livestream thingy alright let's go down yeah I'm answering questions about coating as well Karl so few questions for coating I will do that ratchet says for the first time in my life I was enjoying chess cool I'll also make some kind of chess game for you guys Muhammad says cause you started learning Python for like 3 weeks but then it got hard and there are a few places and then I stopped look you can't stop when things get difficult there are tons of online resources but focus on making it enjoyable so then even if it's hard you'll still do it for example I don't know your relationship with your wife if you have a wife you know things get really difficult but you enjoy spending your time with her so you'll still go through very difficult things to do that and you won't just stop you know if you like eating cake you'll travel really far to Cheesecake Factory to get that delicious cheesecake or that extremely good fried rice at your favorite Thai place you know even if it's really hard you'll still keep going so as long as the thing that doing is enjoyable that's why really focus on making it something you enjoy that's why I always say 80 155 rule which is play 80% of the time build 15% of the time and learn 5 percent of the time reduce your time learning and get naturally good at it by playing with it and getting a feel for it to play me go to leech s org and just send me an invite my user my username is Rafa's or one and then you can play me like that on leech s no GS is really good I prefer Django so I would go with Django but there's nothing wrong with no Jess or Django they're both really really good it just depends if you are already skilled at Python then maybe go for Django and if you're more skilled with JavaScript then maybe go with node J s both of them are serverside you know frameworks mmhmm any new challenges no new challenges yeah I'll make a chassis eye and let it play for me actually okay moronic um let's see okay if nobody's sending me in our match from here I'm just gonna play against somebody online so let me know if you guys are gonna be doing that or not alright so I'm gonna play against somebody online play you know it's much harder to play and commentate than I thought it's definitely much more difficult because I'm always thinking I'm used to thinking quietly especially when I'm playing at a tournament in a very quiet but I got it you know it's just a skill I have to practice it so the more out I think out loud the better I'll get at it now he's starting to make some weaknesses in g3 and f2 but I think he knows the opening that he's playing if I take Knight c5 looks really good I'm gonna do that even though it's supposed to be slightly more passive for me you know I'm I am okay with this position because there's this long diagonal play that I get and I'm gonna try to exploit that diagonal now I wonder but I can play Knight h5 and we just trade a bunch of pieces I kind of I like don't mind this line at all I'm on here my Knights coming to places maybe and I mean yeah sure those straight Queens as well I don't care so we've traded down quite a bit okay now I'm trying to poke at his queen side so I can take take and then open up some position there night of four looks pretty night each four looks good to me I can also take take and put a ruck on the C file so there there's multiple ways to go about it there's 92 and 94 it's my maneuver here which she overlooked so I like my night on this square and it's actually a little bit tricky for him to challenge my night I should have actually put this rook on the B file because if he ever it takes I can take okay now he's getting oh that's why he played rook here so he's ready to challenge my knight um I'm gonna play here I'm okay with this all his pawns are on light squares so if we trade nights it should be okay for me in this position also playing Knight d5 and that's okay because now I just have a superior night so I was superior minor piece and all his pawns are on light squares which means his bishop has low mobility and I mean I'm just better here to be honest he like might have to sacrifice in exchange but there's no way to kick this Knight he can't do anything to this Knight so this Knight is just dominating and it's on a dark square so this Bishop would never take him now ruk is five points so he doesn't want to give up a rook for the night because rook is worth five points in Knights three points I also have Knight a5 at some point I wonder if I can play f5 here okay let's see I can play h5 take stakes take over they take over the hfile but I don't see well all I have to do I think to win is just trade down trade all the pieces till is just a night in a bishop and then I think my night should prove to be you know prove enough for a for a win I always have night f5 here he has to be careful about that so yeah okay so this is guys hanging I have to protect him for a second it's night c2 in the position okay again rook e8 threatening Knight f5 so if he plays that five I just take it that's you know he messed up here and then there's Knight h4 at some point if he is not careful yeah I'll just take this pawn and there's g5 and then Knight g6 95 yeah I should be okay here I'm just up to pawns I have 40 seconds just 57 seconds it just means I need now need to play quicker to win this I'm gonna make this my last game and then I'll answer some questions that you guys have there's Knight a5 again if he goes to e3 then I can go to night of 594 and one in one smooth motion there's still night of five because I have rookie 3 so I will actually play that because I rookie 3 and then I can actually take this guy here like that then there's rook h2 and now I'm threatening mate idea so he might need to trade a rock or two with me okay sure nice rock is hanging and I'm threatening mate I mean this is pretty reasonable for him he should just resign here there's nothing he can do it Moses Rock I just take if you move this rook oh yeah he can actually move this rook here or that that's fine so now I'm threatening to take here or rook here he has two seconds left I have 20 seconds really difficult position for him yeah I should actually just go here and here threatening to take here so and once he takes I take or yeah take this way and then I have passed pawns okay so I want this game yeah really the critical moments are you know this idea that because in chess you don't always have like a really obvious advantage you know when you're playing at a higher level that's not only about checkmating the other person you have to try to win some material but even more than that sometimes even winning material is not that easy so you have to find different ideas and right now my idea was okay my Knights really good all his pawns are on light squares which is not a good idea for him because it blocks in is at his own bishop as you can see that my lights my knights on dark square so it's just a better piece than this guy cuz he can't even take me and it's protected just an outpost in the center of the board so all I have to do is actually open up this hfile and then get my rooks in the game and then trade my rooks and then just be with King King and Night vs Bishop or I'm better and it was really this key maneuver that I think you know won the game is here here and this one right here you know so subtle moves but definitely you know very powerful and important to keep in mind I also missed a lot of things for example this pawn is pinned so I can take here and once he takes back I can take with the knight and once he takes I can take his Bishop so there are a bunch of things I missed too in the game but okay that's it for this game I have a challenge from Justin I don't want to play ten minutes with eight seconds my friend that is very long let's try to do five minutes so send me another challenge Mazur I definitely don't upload unlimited time so please send me a challenge with five minutes okay so I'm gonna decline these right now but I want to play with you just make them a little bit shorter in the meantime I'll jump over try to answer some programming stuff questions and then we'll come back here and play some some chests with you guys so let me jump back into the livestream here okay yeah I wish Kasparov was here yeah you can go to my course on clever programmer dot teachable calm and that's where all the courses are located and then we'll play no challenges huh okay so make sure that you can send me a challenge Austin I forgot what your name was here I can't find it anywhere things like Austin Jay Austin I don't know I totally forgot Austin oh my god there's so many Austin's I'll never have luck finding you here okay so let's see what do you recommend after I finished learning Python PHP or JavaScript if you finish learning Python I thought I would have you focus on actually developing real apps and real useful things with pythons because if you're done learning now the whole point of being done with learning is so now you can do the really enjoyable stuff which is actually creating things and bring your ideas to life but if you're just interested in learning another language after Python outside JavaScript and not PHP PHP sucks okay I'm gonna go and now play the game so I got the challenge I'm an accept Justin's challenge Jay Austin sorry and now you guys should be able to see okay Austin good luck so he opens with the King pawn that's a really good move he's controlling the center he moves his knight out again controlling the center the entire time very good I don't actually know what his rating is so the amount of time he's taking on this move I would guess that maybe his rating is like 900 800 like maybe he's really new to chess because this is actually known as the Scotch defense so if you're familiar with it you would play these moves pretty fast now on his Knight I have two pieces attacking the knight he has one piece defending it which means that if he doesn't move it then I could win it but he could also just choose to protect it which is exactly what he did I'm gonna go and pressure that night a little bit more when I tickle that night getting lots of calls and have your bird the emails is beautiful thank you guys so much I really appreciate it I know that some of you guys who were emailing me are also in this livestream which is amazing thank you thank you thank you bishop here is a tricky move why can't I just take take and take I'm gonna win upon I will do that so I think Austin missed the fact maybe unless he's he's doing something I don't see but he missed the fact that I had three attackers on the night you need two protectors he brought his bishop in to attack the knight but you know I moved the knight out to attack his knight right away so his bishop actually couldn't take my knight okay good defense he has to he had to watch out for a queen takes f2 and Bishop takes b2 he has protected both so that's really good I will develop a peace here in chess you want to constantly it's called development you want to focus on bringing your pieces into the game as fast as possible so you don't wanna I don't call pawns pieces I call pieces pieces so meaning when I say pieces I'm talking about these guys I'm not talking about these little tiny guys these guys you want to keep in the back row and try not to move them too much because once you move upon up it can never go back so if you move a pawn up and one of these squares becomes weak or you move these pawns up now you don't have shelter for your king that could be a problem okay Jay Austin Austin says happy birthday by the way he says great courses with a Python classes so he actually really likes the courses thank you so much and I'm glad that you're actually enjoying the courses I mean I personally think it's you know really useful Python course thank you sir all right now okay so he plays Bishop d3 I like that move but I am worried he's making lots of moves with his Queen and Bishop you know he's breaking opening rules in the opening you should never move one piece twice you should try to move all your pieces once before you move any one piece twice meaning that you know he shouldn't play with his Bishop here and then bring the bishop back here and waste two moves on him instead he should just move his Bishop here and then move his knight out and instead of moving his Queen here and here he should have just moved his Queen here and one go and then moved the bishop out with the next move so his position would look a lot different if he didn't waste and he moves his knight would be here and his bishop would be out here but now you know he since he waited a little bit it's possible he could get into a little bit of trouble but I still don't have a strong attack or anything but I'm trying to bring my pieces out as fast as possible so I played this move not only to control the center but also opening up my bishop so my bishop can actually join the game he has trouble developing some of his pieces because of my battery here okay good he wants to maybe put his knight on c4 one day no problem mate go ahead and do that he still has trouble developing that bishop because my ID can go here um okay what if I play an annoying move like b5 hmm just gonna play here I'm kind of fixing my pawn structure which is something I shouldn't be doing right now but you know I kind of like it I don't know kind of like controlling those dark squares like that my guy was more interested in Italy in playing c6 and then pushing this pawn up oh so when I'm saying stuff like c6 or d6 or Knight g4 I'm really looking at the coordinates so like in chess you can see this so there this file is called H file because there's a H written underneath it and this square every square has a name in chess just like your home everybody has a home unless you're homeless but if you have a home your home has an address and just like that in chess each square has an address so this is the H H squared because it's in the H file files go up and down and 8th ranked ranks go sideways so this square is H 8 you know let me ask you and you say it out loud if I point to it so what is this square called you know try to do this fast as you can give you three seconds three two one the squares be four right B be file and then rank is four so this is the squares be four how about this square quickly H 3 okay how about this square C 2 this be one so just like that so this rook on a one right now is hanging meaning it doesn't have any defender so I'm just gonna take it we got a few more challengers and I'll play till the challenges are here which is super cool you know I had some I'm really happy and thank you guys for actually playing with me but I really appreciate it you know it's something I love chess and it's awesome that I get to do it on my birthday and play with you guys like this is unreal this was never a possibility you know last year this wouldn't have been something that's possible I kind of loved how the internet works you know you're in some different part of the world and you and I are just sitting here and you know able to play this facetoface it's it's really incredible so he's very sneaky he's trying to win the game by you know kind of tricking me a little bit meaning that if I just play like a random move here let's say I play my pawn up here to kick his kick his knight or something his idea is that he can take my pawn here and that would almost be checkmate so I don't want to let him do that and I will play an annoying move here I'm gonna play this move and now his problem is that if he takes my bishop I just take it and if he goes and tries to take my pawn on the square what square is this quickly if he takes my pawn on b7 then I can take his Bishop on d3 the reason why I speak we speak in coordinates is so we're very specific about what we're talking about also when you know when I was training it also allowed me to read and study from chess books because you know there's no person there so you have to read from a actual you know chess book I'm trying to see if I have some kind of killing blow here maybe clean edge for threatening that mmhmm I don't think so I'm just gonna play it simple and trade some pieces I'm I'm up a rook so I can I'm up a rock in a few pawns so I can just choose to play here pretty safely here's another tip I want to give you guys when you're ahead in material try to just trade pieces you don't have to do anything fancy just try to trade pieces and get to as few pieces as possible because somebody who's losing they want to trick you right so the more pieces there are on the board they're more they're more chances there are of you actually getting tricked and losing so when you trade pieces you keep making the game simpler and simpler because they're less and less pieces and then there have less chances of tricking you so if somebody if you have two extra pieces but they're still they have six pieces and you have eight pieces the game can still be complicated but imagine if you traded all the pieces now they have zero pieces and you have two pieces now it's like no cop no complication at all it's actually very simple so there's a trick here his rook is actually unprotected so I have a trick here what I want to do is if this bishop didn't exist right imagine if this mission I just take it off the board it doesn't exist I would be able to just take his rook but this Bishop does exist so what I want to do here is move this Bishop which Czech sacrifice it so if once he takes it with his King now his rook is hanging so that's really his problem here and what I'll try to do is I'll try to simplify the game even more but by throwing in this check and this really simplifies the game so now he's forced to trade Queens and we have even traded Queens and as you can see we have very few pieces left on the board now but the game is getting simpler and simpler now I'm attacking his end Bishop I will play here and protect his pawn I have 42 seconds he has 18 seconds so he does need to be a little bit mindful of his time I'm just gonna play d4 and just push this pawn all the way through I think it's gonna be very difficult for him to protect and stop this idea I don't see any easy way to stop this idea for him just I mean this just pawns just going through so he chooses to sacrifice as Knight and I now as you can see there's so many pieces I have and he only has you know just a few pieces here let's see I'll play here now I have some ideas of taking that okay a very good game so he played pretty well but he you know in the end he got in a little bit of trouble he overlooked a few tactics yeah so here I would suggest for him instead of moving his bishop out maybe just focus on protecting this knight or just moving this knight out of the way you know instead of going Bishop here cuz automatically he gives me a pawn and then after that there are some other inaccuracies like giving me the full rook that was the biggest mistake you know when you see my Queen and Bishop on this diagonal don't push this pawn up and as soon as he did I just take his rook okay let's see if there are any questions for me to answer burning painful questions madness jack says he could make me cry in chess let's go madness Jack I'm gonna make you weep on livestream mmm let's go I'm round ready madness jack but you know I don't like crying so don't make me cry please let's see thank you thank you for wishing me happy birthday when does the next course open mullahs probably in five six months from now you know I I don't always know Sylvio Gaming asked your thought about the mean stack and he spelled it stash yeah but I know what you're talking about yeah I know I know mean stack is basically pretty sure it's what does the M I forget it sometimes but a is for angular and E is for something I keep forgetting this okay let's look it up mean stack yeah is for angular and it's for node and I forget the Ian M is for yeah I think Emma's from yeah okay so Express yeah it's a very good stack to learn and to get familiar with but it is very complicated for MongoDB you need to know sequel you know it's not based on sequel programming language because it literally says no sequel but you do need to know the concepts behind sequel and jumping straight into MongoDB is a lot more difficult not definitely not as straightforward as just doing something with regular databases once you do something with regular databases then I recommend to look into MongoDB angular is another framework that's pretty damn tricky so you definitely need to be very comfortable with building websites from scratch just using HTML and CSS before you can really go on and take advantage of angular so I would I would do this a little bit later same thing with node it's a little bit more complicated so you want to be familiar with JavaScript before you start going allout into node so that's what I would say on that question it's a good stack but those are the things that are required for it so before you do MongoDB learn a little bit of sequel before you do angularjs learn how to make websites from scratch using HTML using CSS you javascript go to websites like free code capcom you can learn from there as well how to build you know websites and then for no js' you know same thing they'll teach you a lot of JavaScript and then you can pick up node along as a way yeah pleather games.you so if I play I recently I have haven't been gaming too much but I do play Gears of War and I play some other games but yeah I am you know I I really like chests and I've been playing chests for a long time usually I I try not to spend my time gaming I try to just be very productive throughout the day it's very rare that I actually even play any games anymore my days look like I wake up at 430 a.m. in the morning then I'm going to lift then I come back a shower you know get coffee I'm like with what I have done usually by 1100 a.m. or 1200 p.m. is like most people's entire week's worth of work or like day's worth of work and usually that's done by 1100 a.m. or 1200 p.m. there's another thing I like about waking up in the morning and then after 1200 p.m. I just get to beat everybody and be ahead of everybody because I have from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. to do more stuff so then I read book you know and sneak in some time with a friend or to make content for this channel club or programmer make new videos or you know write out an email to you guys so that you know those are the things I'm gonna be I'm doing John Smith says co2 software on live please yeah definitely what I'll do is I've been thinking about this just do live stream kind of casual where you guys were watching over my shoulder and I make an app or I'm starting to work on something and I can show you guys how a framework like flask and Django and whatever works and how does HTML speak with Python code and how does that speak with CSS and all of that but I do need you guys to in the meantime you know go and learn the basic stuff so then when I'm making those more advanced videos you guys can follow along I don't want to make something that only like one percentage of this channel can get value from whereas I'm trying to focus on stuff that you know 99.9% of the people on this channel can get value from that's why I don't want to get too specific all the time with one framework but definitely you can expect live trainings like that John okay so we have a few more challenges I'm gonna go and take a look at those challenges Tory Maps and Mohammed I'm gonna play with Tory Maps accept the challenge okay so hi Tori ah thank you so much she says happy birthday or he or she um I don't know hopefully she'll tell me in the chat but it doesn't matter cuz we're gonna play this game of chess okay so Tori starts off with an interesting opening move g4 which doesn't control the center so I'm kind of against it but you know it could be pretty interesting she's moving her pieces to the side of the board okay cool I am going to put my bishop here you know sometimes your opponent's could have a sneaky strategy which you're not watching out for and you could get in a lot of trouble so you know I like to think that I know what I'm doing but you know maybe I would get in a lot of trouble so I got a focus all right maybe I'll take this pawn now because it wasn't protected this Knight is very scary I don't know what Tori's gonna do with this night so I got to keep an eye out on this guy cuz he can jump in here any time and fork my king and rook so I want to make sure that my queen is here protecting that stuff okay sneaky tori is trying to win this pawn here I'm going to move here and defend upon hmm let's see okay I am very scared of that night so I'm gonna have him move because that night is giving me like trauma oh my god now the other nights coming in jeez okay so this night is in trouble a little bit with my pawn could take it at any time so she does have to be a little bit careful and there's another sneaky little thing that I am threatening which she needs to be careful about but maybe she'll see it or maybe she'll miss it we will see okay so Tori is being really nice to me giving me this cute little checkmate she played really well and here is the point I would point out so this is a common thing that you guys can try this is a technique you guys can try against anybody bring your Bishop out here put your Queen here and then take care in checkmate so I'll show you this you can actually use it to checkmate people in four moves as little as four moves and it's a very good idea to actually do against you know maybe you're playing with friends or a family or anybody and you want to oneup them you know beat them quickly you can try this so I'll show you so for example let's just say White's playing some simple you know let's flip the board here so we can see it from White's perspective flip board so let's say that you're playing here you put this bishop here to look at this pawn so it looks like they're just playing natural moves to bring pieces to the center except look at this your Queens looking at this point your bishops looking at this pawn and there's only King defending it so if you take it that's it let's checkmate there's no move that black has game over lights out and it's it took only four moves so you guys can actually try this Bishop out Queen out and then go for a check like a slumber checkmate like Danielle wrench says okay I'm gonna go back um let's see I have never coated and at Johanna's Lucan says have you ever coated an Android app with Python I've never coated an Android app with Python but you can do it using a framework called Kiwi ki wwhy okay I'm drinking monster Muhammad Kamran okay now I'm going to see the live challenges and accept a one of them okay last challenge it's basically Ridge I don't know how to say his name but rides to hike 180 he wants a rematch so we're gonna play a rematch against him and then uh sorry I keep saying this but this but I have so much fun sitting here and talking with you guys I'm playing with you guys but I really got to get going after this one so it's gonna this definitely is gonna be the last game and I'll try to answer some questions before leaving but yeah so I'm gonna focus here for this game now but this is gonna be the last challenge for today guys okay if I play e5 what's a story takes takes takes takes oh that doesn't work okay so I will just play here he's a very good player Oh what is he so very interesting line and Kings Indian I never really looked into this so I'm trying to fight for the center and that's why I pushed my pawn up but in the opening and for much of chess you know most of the chess is based on those four magical squares in the center and whoever wins the battle over the center ends up winning the game okay he just decides to move away um did I miss anything no no he's just giving me one free pawn here so I'm gonna take that pawn and I'm gonna keep it I'm a pawn grabber I'm gonna tell them you know in chess you want to work with small advantages and make them bigger and bigger and you want to do the same thing with you know software development and programming you like learn a few things and you keep using those to you know get better and better so in chess that's what I'm doing I just take one advantage and then I try to make it bigger and bigger before I just had a slight positional advantage and now I want a pawn and now I might actually win two pawns hold on what's the story here oh I have a dirty tactic here yeah this is not looking good for my friend Raj Dyke I took in a unintuitive way but the bishop first generally you know you take with the knight first and with the bishop and then I would hit the rug but here he's quite frankly just in a lot of trouble I'm a bunch of pawns now I just want to trade I want to make the game simpler so to make the game simpler all I want to do is just trade stuff and as long as I trade stuff like I win you know that's that's pretty much the story there so I just want to keep you know getting the pieces off the board and that's it I have a fivepoint advantage okay so he wants to take my queen I'll just take his queen make my life simpler and then I want to put my bishop here my bit my rook wants to come into game so I want to move my bishop so I can get my rook in the game and yeah now my advantage is pretty huge in this game it's very difficult for him because I have so like for this rook I have this stroke for that rook I have disrupt so that's even right except I have this one bishop and that gives me a pretty big advantage oh is he getting made it here yeah I think he just got made it that's made okay so that was checkmate he kind of overlooked that idea so what he needs to play here is king g1 and that way when I move my rook here it's not a check but he played King h2 and that's a big mistake because after rook here he moves his king out and that's checkmate because bishops guarding the rook um yeah so let's let's point out where he made the mistake he he dropped his pawn that's a mistake and then the next mistake was here where my rooks still looking at this Bishop so what I did is I took took took and now my knight and his knight and his queen is attacked so a lot of trouble okay that's it I am done with chess for now thank you guys so much for the challenge request let's see if there's a question waiting for me coteacher says i'm a tech youtuber do you have some tips for me anybody that asks for business advice or you know youtube advice that some somewhere I am I don't want to say an expert but I definitely think I can offer you a lot of valuable advice there especially with YouTube or building your brand or channel or starting your business or startup you know things like that I would suggest to you that make helpful content consistently so if you are I don't know how many subscribers do you have tell me how many subscribers do you have coteacher but if you have very few subscribers let's say you have 50 or a hundred I want you to focus on making content consistently and when I was starting out I was doing constant content like at one video a day till something sticks and try to tackle like popular questions or popular topics if you're starting out but be consistent with the work that you're putting in so don't just like do it two videos and then stop and then three videos and stop and do that's the worst thing you can do okay one point 3000 is quite a bit that's good code teacher tell me how many subscribers do you get every day and when did you start your channel there's a little bit of lag in my stream so I have to actually you know whatever I say you guys here after like 20 seconds for something you guys are insane you guys have like wait gonzalo you have 1377 subs or are you saying how many subs coteacher has okay so alright one year are going one year ago in three months so I don't know how many subs you get per day but I would assume not too many because you got one that 1.3 thousand and one year and three months so post okay yeah post consistently posts about popular topics and then the video that should cover the most general or the most interesting topic right sometimes it you even have to name it something that you know it's not scammy but it feels scamming to you sometimes like for example it took me a long time to make the video for easy ways to make money online like that's such a scam me scam me quote unquote title but I did have a lot of valuable information so if I do give it a boring title oh realistic title there's gonna be nobody that watches it but the people who watch it then what I did is make sure the quality of that content was so damn good and so on point and the things that I show you they're so tangible you can actually use them to make money especially if you're trying to be a programmer that so what happens is there are two things you make it on a topic that's popular so now people watch it not to the thing is that if it's good content people want to share it so now it's that that one person coming to you is really two people coming to you it's like doubling or tripling the views and based on who's sharing it and how big of a following they have then there are more views coming in from there and more shares happening there so if you tackle a general hot topic you definitely want to make make sure that that video is really good and not just you sitting on a webcam speaking especially for channels starting out that will really give you a boost Jana Jeon thank you for wishing me happy birthday I saw your message in facebook I really appreciate it and coteacher who work on small goals right so for subscribers then you know your goal should be okay I want to now get to six subscribers every day or ten subscribers every day but if you make a video every day seven days a week thirty videos a month your subscribers should grow really fast and then if you want to slow down you can giant says hey Kazi any tips on how to concentrate and code for more time how to get rid of any distractions so I always like to code outside of my house because with your house you associate I don't know going to the bathroom reading a book watching Game of Thrones sitting watching Netflix playing a game playing guitar playing chess hanging out with friends sleeping there's so many things associated with your mind that I don't like to be at home and I'm working so my home for a while was Panera Bread and Starbucks and now it's my office so if you can afford it get an office you can get it for like you can get pretty good places for seven eight hundred bucks a month but if that's too expensive then you know just go to Starbucks or go to Panera Bread or go go to some local place that has a calm vibe that you like and then you can associate getting coffee and working there so then every time you go there you kind of go in your zone and then also listening to music but very specific kind of music music distracts me a lot and whenever I listen to music I start like listening to the lyrics and I'm just like singing along with them so listen I like to listen to like I go on Spotify I go in genres I click on moods and then I go to the playlist called focus or like brain food and those are playlists that play songs that don't have words is just very calm relaxing background music that's not annoying at all so that should help you yeah your coteacher listen your HTML series you can't say four easy ways to make money and then teach HTML that doesn't make sense so don't make it it doesn't have to be click baby or anything HTML itself is popular you just have to make sure you have 1520 videos on it and they're good quality content that's what happened with my Python programming course it was like it had no views for a while and then I had you know when I had for two videos or three videos or four videos but then when I got like 15 or 20 videos like people are going through and they're like holy this is good send a link to their friend or share it or something and then more people come in and then YouTube start seeing wow these people are spending a lot of time on this one programming Python playlist so then you to start suggesting this playlist to everybody else cuz now YouTube's algorithm doesn't favor how much percentage of your video is watched but rather how many minutes of your videos watched so don't shoot for making short videos because it doesn't matter if you make a 1 minute video that has a hundred percent watch time because if you because what's better is if you have a 1 hour long video that has a two minute watch time on average that one is actually better even though the first one has a higher completion rate because it was so short YouTube doesn't care they want people to spend more time on your channel so the one hour long video that gets watched for only two minutes for whatever reason actually gets suggested more often so when you have a playlist and you have people spending more time in that playlist your channel and your playlist and your videos are being recommended to more and more and more people so yeah and this is another thing that I want to talk about you know guys this this idea of consuming versus creating focus on creating content don't get in the habit of consuming content so meaning even if you suck in programming and you are like you have the worst skills ever and you're slow type or whatever make a video about what you're struggling with you the video could literally be about I don't get this thing you could talk for a few minutes and talk about that and then in the comments people could help you or they could identify with you going through the same struggles you could literally just document your own journey you don't even have to create anything new and later it could serve as you know first of all obviously you can get money from YouTube okay cool another thing that's really amazing I think is that you have this thing you can always go back and refer to so if you're covering some topics in a video it's there for you it only makes your understanding better when you're trying to teach it and three like some of my friends have gotten jobs because of their YouTube channel so it's possible that if you're even talking about software development and coding you can get an injunction or something cuz people be like wow this person is very dedicated so you know a lot of the times I hear people go it's so risky I don't want to start a channel what if it fails or I don't want to start a business you could be like 40 years old and have a business or a channel or you could be 40 years old and have no business and no channel like those are the two options the one I like is being 40 and having you know the channel and a business because very often I mean what are you gonna substitute that time with most of the times will substitute that time with watching house of cards so instead of spending your time watching a TV show you can build a business so the only risk is you don't get to watch as much house of cards or Game of Thrones you know so it's not really a risk and I suggest getting in the habit of creating content whether you want to write you're scared shitless of being on camera then you know just focus maybe on writing or overcome your fear of being in front of the camera and if you're not that afraid of being in front of the camera then you know make a video because I think it's so easy to create video versus sitting and writing but yeah I went on a little bit of tangent there but that's just a little bit of my philosophy and hopefully should be applicable outside of just YouTube yeah coteacher good luck best of luck to you keep me updated on how your channel is doing but just make sure that when you make the content make it damn good you know don't make it a PowerPoint hiding behind camera I like put some life into it make it interesting watch like okay let's say you want to make HTML series goal type in HTML course or something HTML on YouTube and the most popular one that comes up watch them and see how what are the things that they're doing what are their energy levels when they're speaking do they have a camera are they recording themselves in the video like what is it they're doing and then don't steal what they're doing but model what they're doing right so make your videos like them don't just like steal their content you can still make your own course your own curriculum but see a lot of what's working and then try to make it like that you know don't have one of those annoying tutorials where it's like some guy has the notepad on the screen and instead of just speaking to you he's like typing stuff on the notepad and then it's like you just have to read like what he's talking about I find those so annoying and those channels are always suffering so just try to make good normal quality content okay what is sooji said sujeet says how do free apps one will fall I did do private chest lessons I might still do them email me about it but I'm getting very like oneonone time I'm getting very crazy with my time I'm trying not to do too much oneonone with anybody cuz I want to focus on making content that helps the whole world so that's why oneonone is getting tougher and tougher for me as time progresses and I'm actually really trying to step away from it to be honest but yeah I did used to do private chess lessons okay so Sajid says how do free apps like whatsapp makes money so free apps make money by holding the attention of the audience once you build the audience they're unlimited amount of ways of making money you can sell them anything the number one thing is just having an audience and having people there this is very important to understand meaning even if your want to be a programmer you want to create an app most people think oh I'll just create a super awesome app and everybody will get it that's unfortunately not what will happen here's what will happen you will work you will work really hard you will spend years of your time you will spend money resources you will take risks you will put your family at risk by maybe reducing your job or quitting your job and taking that big initiative big jump maybe starting your own business to make that app because you believe in it so much and then when you launch it and it's out there in the market which you'll hear is cricket's nobody gets it and the reason is not because your app is not good or blah blah blah the reason is you don't have an audience so if you don't have anybody to get it what the hell is the point of your material or course that was one of the biggest realizations I had when I was working on some of my courses cuz I've always loved teaching and I built my chest a stick business which you know I I say it's fail old but really I just stopped working on it but it's called chest tastic comm and it's still online but I don't really do anything with it too much but you know what I lost my train of thought or somebody could remind me in the chat but Jesus I just had a train wreck oh yeah I remember now so make sure that you have an audience before you so basically my chest tastic channel I made these amazing phenomenal chess courses and then I was like okay I'll just sell them great and nobody ever bottom nobody took me up on my offer and it was like months of time I spent months on like designing the logo spending money on the logo you have to understand I was 17 or 18 years old even younger maybe 16 years old when I was building that company and I had no like real money you know as like a little bit of money but it wasn't a lot of money and I'm going to college I'm doing jobs so to invest my time there you know I wouldn't say risky but took a lot of effort and so that was the biggest problem you know there's no audience so even if you're building sass which is which it stands for SaaS you know software asaservice something like Spotify that's a sass write software as a service it's all automated and it's a software but it's like a service you just pay for it monthly and you get it you know if you want to build things like that or you know there's so many things I just can't come up with examples right now even to sell that you need an audience beforehand so it's important to understand how to build audience and then you can you know then when you build an app you which don't want to do is build an entire app and then try to sell it to them you want to build like a very small lightweight version of it that maybe takes you 2 to 3 weeks of your time and then put it out there and then people are using it and enjoying it then you can keep adding in new versions the great thing is you already have two instead we're ready to you know basically like you basically have to confirm with them that they'll buy your app before you ever make it and that reduces your risk reduces any chances of failure and that's something I could really help you I know that's super you know it's a tangent and it's something that you guys can't see yourself there yet but it's one of those you want to wrap it away in your head and once you get good at programming or a specific thing you know you could really use this to kickstart your own business gonzalo thank you so much take care have a good one my friend yeah coteacher it's it's not for earning money but just to cover the cost of YouTube yeah camera setup I understand when I started my channel I just like went crazy bought a $5,000 iMac like basically had to take loans to do that bottle I it's bought camera bought so many things and I had to take loans to do that because I didn't have money when I was starting out our very little money and and yeah like I was I mean was just my passion I wanted to get this message heard and across I didn't even care at that time about money or anything I just wanted just to be heard and so I just did it with whatever I had and with whatever I could I just believed in making quality content so that's really why I invested so much you don't need to invest that like I honestly think is stupid if I were to do it now I'll just do it with regular camera and stuff but it was enjoyable to me and I enjoyed it so you know if it's something that you enjoyed then go through with it and do it Ryan that is great to hear my friend that's good glad you're loving the courses and you're redoing them and you're grinding every day for several hours a day just really the only ways to do it you know it's not this field is there's no quick like you know a few days and you'll get success or you'll start making money you'll start landing clients or get a job it does take time it does take a lot of consistent effort redoing things prac saying but then once you start getting their rewards they are pretty unlike any other field and the amount of options you have right but you have to enjoy the journey of programming you have to learn to enjoy it so then even when it gets really hard it's not you're not doing it because you should want to put your nose to the grindstone it's because you're actually enjoying it and you know that will allow you to get past the hard parts all day without a problem Jona you said that this course has done nothing for you and you've been in programming for three years do you have a programming job right now yes I mean if you do the code Academy course on Python of course you'll learn a lot of things mmm dingo yes I will teach you guys how to connect Python to different frameworks Ryan good job yes exactly if you're in Silicon Valley take advantage of the resources around there and network with people people is like the number one thing you guys can do so you know courses and everything is always gonna be awesome but getting to work with people who are maybe even at a similar level or a little bit ahead of you who can show you the way that's gonna be amazing and if you can connect with them in real life it doesn't cost you anything and it's the best way to get going like I was I started coding when one of my best friends and we just did it like for 17 hours a day and it was incredibly fun because we both were just in it you know and we both were doing it so if I was struggling I saw him struggling and it just kept me going ah Jordan to come up with ideas first think about replicating things that exist and then you'll get better at coming up with the ideas because there are two problems coming up with an idea one is obviously coming up with the idea too it's executing the idea that you come up with even if you come up with an idea how do you know that you have the skill to execute it you know is it gonna be like two months long journey and at the end you find out you couldn't execute it and you didn't know the tools so that's why work on making stuff that already exists and try to clone it and then you can actually move on so like go online and type in like Python app tutorial or there's an app I show you guys how to make it I have a youtube tutorial on it it's a texting app so you can actually type in text app Python clever program or something like that my video should come up and in that video I show you how to make an app so basically in the start you want to just follow along and go on and you know just do exactly what's happening and then go on little tangents to like what if I do this instead what if I do this instead while you're following this tutorial and once you build a few apps you'll start to get an idea of how do you make them what kind of ideas should I make them about and then later you can also know whether you have the skill set to make something or not okay but first don't just start off but I want to just create something out of the blue first Jordan focus on making something that already exists you know maybe you can start off with a Pomodoro timer you know people go on your app and they click it and the timer source for five minutes and then it makes a little noise or does something you know something simple and then go from there okay guys I'm gonna get going I'm gonna take maybe one question or something Sahil I'm planning he says I'm planning to learn see after completing the book learning Python the hard way okay sure enjoy have fun I never understand why okay so I wanted to do this as well for the longest time just do language hopping and you know now I can save you a lot of time and just tell you like if you want excel in the field language hopping isn't gonna get you there the fastest way it doesn't hurt you it does make you more knowledgeable but it doesn't get you to where you want to go in the fastest way specializing does and then after specializing you can become more of a generalist if you want to so if you have learned Python I would say stick with Python but if you learned si and you're good with Si then I would say just stick with si and keep going instead of learning like 10 different languages and becoming proficient at them because it's not about the language is about what you can do with the languages it's like you learn English and now you're ready to get a job in America and you're just like screw this I'm gonna go to Germany and then you just like go learn German and then you leave that country and go somewhere else so when you're learning a language just understand that there's a reason behind it then follow through with that and don't just get lost and bounce back and forth I use having a victim mentality and a whiny attitude will not get you far my friend so if I don't answer your question that definitely will not make me answer it you know like one of the things about successful people is you don't want to blame things on something other than yourself you know grant cardone says this and I believe this in and well as well nothing happens to you it happens because of you okay so take matters into your own hands and the more you blame external things the less control you'll have over your life itself okay so yes okay guys thank you guys so much for coming I really appreciate it and I'm gonna get going and enjoy the rest of my day honestly yeah thank you guys so much for coming I appreciate it so much it was awesome we got to play some chess I might do this again hopefully I try to provide you guys with some value but does that is it guys thank you guys so much as always I love your face off and I'll see you in the next video
