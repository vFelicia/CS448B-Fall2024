yo what is up guys how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer today i want to do something a lot of fun and special and i think it's going to be really cool i'm glad that you're here today and i'm going to be doing a css battle against myself plus i'm just testing out the live streaming setup and uh you know of course i just want to hang out with you guys too i think it'll be a lot of fun so super random felt like i should do it so uh here i am and uh let's just do this okay so let's go here how can i i'm gonna get this out of my way so i can actually just code beautiful hi guys hi hi hi welcome beautiful to have you here where's my setup hey how's it going this is so cool hey there dark code lab what's up hey roshan hi satish welcome you guys are able to hear me clearly right shozeep says hello brother from bangladesh welcome nice to have you here my man uh let me see if i can make the chat a little bit cooler yo francisco what is up bro let's play around with the chat let me see if i can make the chat a little bit better for you guys i can't close this like ecam trash it's really annoying it's like just takes over my entire screen actually wow okay uh guys i'm sorry give me a second i'm having lots of technical issues okay you guys can hear me loud and clear that's a really good sign oh there we go okay okay okay you guys can see the chat clearly right let me see let me see if i can fix the chat make it maybe a little bit cooler i'm just playing around with it yeah i'm live right now actually will it change it let's see ah there you go i really appreciate the effort hi hi from philippines amazing that is really cool boxed twitch what does that look like just clean let's see what twitch one looks like sorry guys give me a second oh we got a new follower nice welcome okay with that said i think what i'm gonna do is let's actually go on here and start coding this thing up so let me get my ecam back now ecam come here okay maybe like this welcome ed baba spar says namaste welcome welcome welcome everybody because if you i learn very fast awesome good morning guys thank you for the kind words um all right guys so i'm gonna need your help with coming up with what battle to do uh can i have comments bring my comments here with me okay so i'm gonna go pick up and figure out which battle to do so let's see what you guys are saying let's see which one should i pick there's a circle one this looks like fun i'm i kind of suck at css so i'm just gonna pick like a random battle here to do let's start with this one actually that one looks not too crazy so let's start with that a dark code lab says we played chess yesterday yes we did nice back from the future says your content is like watching netflix always engaging thanks for that i appreciate that coding mastery um i'll tell you guys my font when i'm actually coding in visual studio code because i don't even know honestly the top of my head like that like i have no idea what i'm using okay let me zoom in my screen for you guys here okay so that should be nice and zoomed in for you guys and then i'll bring my face down here so it doesn't really get in the way of anything but yeah thank you guys for subscribing that's awesome hershey says dude you are just awesome thank you brother appreciate you this is really this is good vibes i hope you guys can hear the music and you guys are enjoying and uh let's just go and figure this uh battle out now so i'm gonna i'm gonna figure this out with you guys okay so let's go all right so we're supposed to make this thing over here on the right hand side and we're currently on the left hand side here so the first thing i'm gonna do do is let's grab the background and give it that color all right so that's pretty good okay we made decent progress so far so we got the background color now we're gonna make our square that same color as that yellow so let's go ahead and do that okay so we got that i think my strategy is going to be to bring this down here and then give it maybe some border radius and i hope that does kind of what i'm looking for actually i'll give it a class name of yellow i think that should be good oh how about banana all right let's give it a class name of banana uh and then let's see if i can actually grab banana ay that works that's nice harshit shoharda says your videos help me learn so much react hey that's amazing glad to hear that glad to hear i could help that's awesome that's really cool okay say it says proper beard you got now absolutely ahmad says please live stream on how to make and accept payments of cryptocurrencies one day for sure okay all right here we go so now let's actually move this square and can i do margin left 2 em yep that works 4 am five six something like that okay and then let's bring it down margin top oh it's two down 5am maybe okay now maybe let's make this square like a lot bigger uh maybe the width is too big i think that should be good okay and now let's maybe play with some border radius uh will that work okay so if i give it a lot of border radius okay so i can give it some border radius from the top and is there a border radius i can give it from the bottom two nope here nope that's not doing what i wanted to do is that doing what i wanted to do whoa that kind of worked now maybe let's make the width 100 yo i can't believe it that is sick that is sick i love it i'm like this gives me an incentive to actually learn css with you guys so it's definitely good vibes raj nice um okay so that worked so now i'll do the same thing with the other one uh and i think the other one is more like a peach so we'll call it peach class i'll do the same thing here and we'll do peach and i wonder if i can just give it a negative 4 am and negative 3. interesting really thought that would work why is it at the bottom maybe i can position absolute this that is not helping let's change the color oh it's mixed with the background that's not the color it's this color okay i see it at the bottom let's go margin zero okay maybe position absolute this as well okay do i still need to position absolute this sure okay that kind of works let's go negative 4am no margin right what happens if i comment this out okay that's fine 15 okay that's pretty good let's move it down a little bit nice and now i gotta flip it the other way how oh the border radius just needs to be flipped can i do negative seven and negative seven no sometimes me just playing i just play around with this guys until something works or something makes sense oh snap son yo i think we got it let's go jefferson esteva says transform translate jefferson that might actually help anybody that's good at css that'd be really cool if you're good at it um text me i would like to actually work with you even learn css because i want to get better at it honestly and maybe you can i mean if you want you can even come on the channel but if you don't want to come on the channel you could still like just teach me so if you want just text me um i'll say the number you guys could drop it in chat but it's one two two four six five one eight eight seven and just text me like uh causey css okay and if i see you text me hashtag causey css that means you have some css skills and i it would be cool to work with you on it can it can you make a cosmo says hey i've been looking for object recognition using python can you make a video for that okay do you guys think i this should be like a css match i mean it's a pretty close match let's just submit and let's see what we get actually can i submit here submit yo let's go 95 match give it up you guys if you guys thought that was sick go ahead and subscribe to the channel so i can give you a shout out objectoriented programming yo what's up guys welcome i'll give you a shout out and uh yeah i got some new features now which is super dope awesome let's see if youtube is actually showing this live stream oh yeah it is showing this live stream somebody live yeah i'm live oh let's go all right dope that's sick so i just made this with the 95 match whoa yeah that's awesome thank you try tryon for all subscribing appreciate you appreciate you um let me go turn my music back on wait music is on why can't i hear it huh hey what happened to my music i chill vibes going and then these guys came in all right i gave up um awesome so that looked like that actually worked that pretty much we completed the challenge that we had so my score is actually 22 11 right now with four targets you need to at least you need a you need at least a score of 10 000 to see your rank oh wow okay so please make a video on full css yes i definitely will css positioning is definitely yeah that's a challenging thing actually to pick up guys congrats in advance for 1 million subscribers joyesh thank you so much i appreciate you brother that's awesome okay let's see if there's any other challenge it's going to be really good otherwise we can do some object recognition with hot chocolate marshmallows let me try to unplug this okay all right i'm going to relocate guys because my roommates are very inconsiderate and very very loud so we're going to relocate okay all right i'm surprised the internet is working okay that's pretty freaking good what are you guys saying kashyap says bro i have been looking for wait i didn't mean to ban you i'm sorry kashyap says bro i've been looking for object recognition using python for months but i did not get any results can you make a video for that please yeah i'm sure that we can actually talk about that too welcome we have 182 people live that's amazing vasim says your clones are amazing thank you so much brother appreciate it okay yeah i think something with object recognition could be a lot of fun i could show you guys probably with javascript or python i think either would be really really cool actually let's take a look javascript object recognition i haven't done a lot of uh recognition stuff but that could be really cool let's look it up we got tensorflow here okay detecting objects okay model image does somebody have some sample code maybe like a github repo and we could pull it from there link to the full code interesting okay so let's see allow them to use my camera okay sick um oh it's detecting the person what the yo ed's detecting a bed i'm on a couch what whoa that is crazy it's already working what the heck okay let's see if it detects the tv okay does it detect a tv okay don't have to point it oh my god it's already working yo problem solved you guys gave me a challenge we already did that challenge that is sick image detection with javascript bro look at the thing we got two persons oh that tensorflow right tensorflow yeah look we got uh pillow yeah it detects everything it detected the tv it was crazy it said tv it was nuts yeah this is freaking one of the people said hey they wanted to use uh they wanted to learn object oriented programming so classes we did some stuff yeah this is freaking crazy guys okay let's take a look at the code and let's see what's happening so let's let's see what is happening so they're actually it looks like they're using react to do this which is pretty freaking cool uh they're using object oriented programming so we have component did mount okay um if navigator i'm gonna move this to the right hand side here so i can see the code and understand it all right so navigator.mediadevice i'm assuming that something that comes built in with where is navigator coming from is this a javascript thing or is this a navigator dot navigator dot media devices oh i think that actually might just be a javascript thing yeah i think that's the javascript thing you guys it's the javascript that's pretty cool and what does it actually do let's look at mozilla firefox it says it gets fired when a media input output device is attached or removed from the user's computer nice okay that's cool luke is writing us a message what's up luke how's it going brother luke says that's lit yeah it is pretty freaking crazy and it's working that's the crazy thing okay um so if media devices exist then do the following thing okay this that's what that n and chaining means so if they exist then go ahead and get the user media okay and i'm assuming that's the video that we're getting right now and webcam promise is going to be navigator media dot get user media okay um and get user media takes an object and we say audio false we don't need the audio we just need the video okay facing mode is user okay cool so for example i think if you had a mobile device it would by default start with facing you as opposed to away from you okay so let's take a look at the documentation for this user facing facing mode user right facing mode environment you see that to require the rear camera use uh environment so i imagine if you use environment it will actually face the other way which is so freaking which is pretty dope which is a i never knew that that's cool okay and then once we get the promise okay make the current window to be the actual stream that we're getting all right okay so stream is gonna be like something we're getting like probably every frame right this promise is running i imagine and it's getting every single frame all right wow we're freaking machine learning with javascript right now guys are you guys excited or what this is amazing i'm pretty excited cool good vibes pro eska says good vibes matthaub says yeah it is do you own dogecoin nice okay and then what happens we get the metadata and we resolve the promise okay we resolve it model promise load promise all these are the two promises we want them to run once this is the cool thing about promise.all by the way guys if you if you don't know this add promise.all to your uh to your list of things for you to know or learn let me move this here and make this bigger okay so you guys can very very clearly see this but promise.all is awesome you give it an array of the other promises and once both of them are done and resolved then and only then this fires so really cool thing that you guys can use whenever you have multiple promises you can run them up you can run them all together like that okay so then your code is cleaner and you don't have to write those like really long dot then chains with dot then dot then dot then okay use promise.all i think it's a very es6c esxy way of doing it i think we just coined a new term yes sexy okay oh wait this is a comment why is it freaking out okay whatever what happened what did i mess up let's refresh i broke the app how did i break that okay all right let's try not to break the app okay then let's go through the rest of this code what is happening okay so you guys can go here to this url and get access to this code as well all right but let's go down detect frame all right so probably get the first value of the frame value zero all right so what what is let me try one let's go back so another thing i like to do is just play around with the code okay break like try different things this is somebody else's code i didn't sit there and write it so the best way to pick it up is just debug it like go to random places try different things you'll pick it up faster but reading people's code will also make you good like right now we're just looking at somebody's machine learning uh or tensorflow object detection algorithm and we're just here and we're like okay let's just play with it let's see what we get okay let's see what we can understand detect frame video and model i think this is where the machine learning is happening model that detect video once you detect it then make the predictions that makes a lot of sense okay once you detect the video then make the predictions all right render predictions request animation frame frame video model okay and then here are the render predictions okay so this is that function render predictions and let's see what this is render predictions okay so one thing we're doing is we're making this uh rectangle okay and this is the rectangle that's being made around my face right there where it says person okay and that's how we're making it we're making a rectangle we're choosing our font to be sansserif that's how we're seeing the bed and right like for example if i just change this to like 24px you guys are going to notice that once of course it crashes let me see if there's a way i can save hit refresh and it hopefully loads the new code so now see the size of bed in person is a lot bigger right because i changed it and it worked so great now i understand that that's how the fonts are changing about the code okay baseline is at the top so i imagine you could change the text baseline and it'll move it to the bottom or somewhere else cool and then we're looping through the predictions so we have box one and we have box another box prediction box two three okay so what is let's look up prediction b box and let's see what we get in documentation i'll write a tensorflow i think it's a tensorflow thing bounding box regression so that's what be box is okay bounding box and that's the box you can use to bound and detect like okay there's the airplane okay a lot of coding is like just around with things and playing yes if you're a scientist maybe certain things can help but like unfortunately i'm not a scientist okay so for me looking at the math or the formulas doesn't really help me that much but me just playing around with it breaking the code having fun i just learned a lot better like that right so let me let me see is there anything else that gives me a better indicator of how to use this so let's go here tutorial just so i can maybe get a little better insight possibly into uh how to use tensorflow and react.js that's what i'm looking for okay so cell phone 96 sure that that's a cell phone okay machine learning library so tensorflow is a library for machine learning in javascript which enables machine learning models to be used directly in the browser okay so freaking powerful right because we're just using machine learning and unlike python guys like we didn't have to install anything right we didn't have to download anything this is so freaking easy it's just working straight out of the box i can't see your guys's text or chat messages i think it'd be kind of cool to see them so let me see if there is some way i can see them um it's chunky i think i might have to do box for them to like maybe that will make your guys's chat messages pop out a little bit more let's see okay so we have object detection going here right we have dog and a cat okay thank you somebody said you are awesome input image extract region compute cnn features and then classify regions okay so that's how the algorithm works okay we input our image it extracts uh propor uh region proposals about 2 000 things it extracted okay and then it computes the features and then it goes hey is it an airplane nope is it a person yes is it a tv monitor no okay now what is coco ssd because that's another thing we're using common objects context single shot multibox blah blah blah english please returns an array of bounding boxes with class names and confidence levels now that's important so for example that's what i'm looking for that's what be box is okay so we get okay so let's say that b box gets us four items right item number one item number zero or whatever right we have b box ten five five five nine and each items will have a name like this like traffic light or is it something else and then we have a confidence score we're 53 sure that that's a co that's a traffic light okay so right now i don't know what percentage sure we are but there's a high likelihood that that's a person that i'm looking at right now okay i don't like how the text is looking right now is there a way i can like add custom css to that like can i add background uh can you guys keep chatting because i want to see how the chatting looks and maybe i can add some css to it so just like maybe type something smart okay thank you said hello okay great let's see if i can like live code up um maybe i can give each uh log emote image okay meta badge name thank you for such nice words by the way guys that means a lot okay so we it does have a background color but like how come i don't really see the background color okay i'm just gonna do something crappy and i'm just gonna write black and and hit save and let's see what happens if you guys chat do i get some type of background color behind this now if i don't i'm just going to move it back i'm just going to move it back to the way it was because i don't want to break anything okay let's go back all right so that was really useful to actually understand uh let's go back right here that was useful to understand all right x y width and height okay draw the bounding box and then we draw the bounding box x y width and height okay so um this box i think is telling us like the coordinates to make the box okay so i think each of these are a coordinate that allows us to get the box text with text height that's the text that you guys are seeing above my head probably all right and then we draw it out cool so look at that how insane is that we just give the machine learning once we detect the face and the image and the video frames we send it over to our machine learning algorithm guys there's more code here to draw the freaking boxer on my face then we even need to make the machine learning actually happen isn't that nuts like the machine learning part actually is so freaking small and short in this that's kind of crazy yeah i mean literally i think that's the only thing index.js we installed two libraries here we have just a couple of dependencies let's see what our dependencies are react magic drop zone we have a tensorflow and then tensorflow models cocoa whatever so we have just a couple of important dependencies outside of that the code is 100 lines and majority of the code is freaking drawing the box around my stupid face okay so that to me is pretty freaking cool really really cool let me see if i can actually sign and save this sign in with github because i don't want to lose this this is actually really really cool um let's uh fork this all right did i fork it fork right i should have forked it and what's really cool about all of this right let me show you guys something you guys can actually go to this freaking app right now that's the most insane thing about this so like do you guys want to try this i just deployed this freaking app you guys can use this let me check it out okay let me go and hand it to you guys right now oh my life keeps dying maybe i should not be live streaming in 4k so check that out you guys thank you brother you are really awesome too i appreciate it thank you okay so i just sent you guys the deployed app let me know um if you guys got it and check it out qazi will you bring a series of desktop application with javascript yeah i mean i think i was talking with one of my developers about this we might actually do that um we might bring electron thank you tamar book appreciate you okay so yeah that was really cool thank you for suggesting the machine learning algorithm thing i had a lot of fun so we did a css challenge and then we launched an app that can detect um right we launched an app that can detect our faces and who we are like that's so freaking cool like this is crazy it's already working damn wow that's cool now we can even make some stupid changes to this app where are we getting the so video that's cool i literally fell in love with javascript that's amazing that's sick i look says my comments are not showing up but i can see them i can see them that's cool he made a ref to video ref and canvas ref and then this canvas is just actually referring okay and where are we updating it so let's go video ref wow this is a video the current dot source object the actual stream that's dope i love reading code man i have a lot of fun reading code because you can take so many projects and build on top of them and you don't have to start things from scratch i'm really against having to sit there and think like you don't you should try to avoid doing that and save it for the really hard problems or you truly have to think but a lot of times like get really good at um get really good at like understanding how to solve uh or how to be really resourceful that's gonna help out a lot this is dope by the way were any of are any of you guys able to use this so far the app the deployed version of it oh socket not working on a public address i think you guys should be able to use it so deep they're kind of like um they're a little bit like using you state refs but like look up refs versus uh you state that's gonna help you thanks brother ak says uh that was crazy yeah that was pretty crazy i mean i was really excited about it i don't know if it was as exciting for you guys but to me that was actually pretty exciting i had a lot of fun doing that uh please guys don't spam because otherwise i'm gonna have to ban you sorry you're gonna get banned buddy um how to connect python images processing in react js um i mean i feel like you can just do it with react right so then you don't really have to use python there that much and you should be good to go okay this is the article and now if i want to read it it actually explains what's happening so i'm actually curious and i will go through it right now because we made the app now let's actually read how it's working oh 83 000 reads nice oh so a machine learning model can tell us what's in an image but it doesn't mean it can tell us where it is in the image okay so for example a machine learning algorithm can tell us hey this is um this is kazi versus say this is garyvee right like it can distinguish between two different human beings or a human being versus an animal but object detection can detect where that thing is in the image okay okay detecting objects all we need is import okay so coco ssd helps us detect objects it's really good so it's we're importing the tensorflow model yo that's easy as look at that image get element by image by id that id and then load and just detect damage is it that easy can i actually like can i create a div right now put an image in it and get detect what it is um super curious let's try it out where should i go to try it out let's go stack blitz i really like stack blitz stack blitz okay let's go do i want to go um yeah let's just go react okay i'm gonna sign in let's play around with it and let's see if it's actually that easy because if it is that what's really really cool that looks like vanilla javascript too to me so that's really awesome okay so let's put this import statement at the top let's install that package let's install the missing dependencies as well okay everything is installed now okay get element by image so okay and uh let's uh okay let's have an image and uh i'll go to emger and get one of my images so let's grab uh let's grab this image right here put that right there did i not close the tag okay so my face is now there and uh let's give it an id of image so i wonder if that's enough for it to work no back end found in registry get element by id let me see if i can put this image and actually find the root okay all right no back end found in registry let's look at this error with tensorflow let's see what people are saying okay what were the dependencies that we had in this project let's add those dependencies as well so whatever were the dependencies ahead here okay do i have coco ssd as a dependency right now in this project i mean i'm signed in why does it keep saying sign in or you'll lose progress what just happened okay okay dependencies i have coco ssd i have this what else is different from right there okay i have coco and i have tfjs we have tfjs i think maybe just regular tfjs as well tensor flow get the same one okay let's try it again we still get keep getting that same uh still keep getting that same error actually all right let's just console log uh something else as well let's go console.log hello all right so that hello comes through but this does not that does not come through oh wait hold on is it because i didn't give it a hashtag what okay i'll keep reading this for now and we might go back but that's all that looks like they're doing okay get element by the image let's check let's check that image real quick can take several seconds so yeah i don't think i need to put the hashtag there right let's hit x don't really need that after we get our prediction away let me try it in just vanilla vanilla javascript and let's go from there actually so let's take let's get out of here and let's try in vanilla javascript okay so there we go let's take this and add it right there let's install the package let's install the missing dependencies and uh instead of just starter let's actually make this an image tag i'll go image it's going to be a selfclosing tag and we will go source is let's give it the image url let's give it an id of image so now all right so now we're getting the i'm getting the image yes i'm getting access to the image element so that's really really good but i have no idea why my coco ssd is not doing what it's supposed to do because i'm clearly getting access to the image it's right there and it's right here attributes right like for example i can do dot attributes dot id image dot attributes dot source attributes but now i want to know why am i not getting let's see if you guys have any clues in chat looking at chat now maybe try a different image princess but it's like it's not even telling me if there's an error or not you know pull the kill switch manish says um alok says const run coco async wait hold on is that it it's hard for me to actually copy your comment run coco okay so make a function it's an async function wait yeah this is um this is odd let's go take a look at this version i mean i want to just be able to do like a really simple version you know like i thought that they would have a simple way of doing this because i think the error that i'm still gonna get when i look at it because i have my face in there maybe let's just give it a width uh of 400 like this and let's also give it a height of something like that let's give it a smaller height so when i hit inspect let's see what it's saying same thing there's an error that is happening in the promise okay so let's go through what their explanation is of the code so we after we get our prediction we need a way to display it on the screen our prediction response will be a list of bounding boxes ah b box is a bounding box okay okay okay okay understood so we have our x and y coordinate we got width and height okay that makes sense and the confidence scores class classes cat and scores that okay that's beautiful that's really beautiful okay then the canvas element actually allows us to get this let me just look up coco javascript load image load image from url because that's what we're doing what the what the hell i mean is it me or does that look like way more complicated than it needs to be coco's load image from url bro there's got to be an easier way why is this so complicated what why wow um okay how about just like a regular image asset loading geez geez louise i was wondering how i can load sprites from external url such as friends okay so not only are we gonna not be able to pull the image so so not only is the image gonna be kind of um complicated to pull but what makes it um harder is uh you're also gonna have to worry with cores you're gonna have to get past cores and to get past cores oftentimes you need a server side um that can actually bypass cores so course is kind of annoying to deal with okay you can try it like this so that will give you the image it can now work on javascript binding this way only works on coco to the html5 jeez wow if any of you in the chat get a boiler boilerplate code running like meaning super freaking simple like what literally the first part of it like this that would be really cool because then i can copy um we can take a look at what you did and it might help everybody because otherwise it's like there's a lot of boilerplate and then also having to get past course requests it's just like really annoying and tedious and like i don't want to sit here and write a firebase like cloud function just to get past cores you know i want to be able to actually like you know just pick up this but i think even when we were going through the code earlier right close the video get element by video when we were going to the code earlier we were making sense of a lot of the things for example like the get media facing mode user the other one is environment so there are a lot of things that we picked up and then let's see what happens next okay streaming from the webcam to run realtime detection on a webcam stream is almost as easy as changing from an image tag to a video tag with the simple exception of this giant blob of code to start up the webcam okay so this is gonna be needed to start up the webcam got it we can then just pass our video element to our model for detection however this time we're going to call request animation frame which will call our detection function over and over in an infinite loop as fast as it can skipping frames when it can't keep up oh that's dope oh nice so we pass at the video element then we start making our predictions okay oh it's an infinite loop look at that call the function detect frame recursion baby let's go so this function is going to be in an infinite loop running forever and it just keeps pulling the video yeah that makes sense right because to stream video you need to be an infinite loop holy it's crazy we're in a infinite loop right now you just watching this video you're in an infinite loop you're stuck forever you're stuck here with me wow having a lot of they have made it extremely easy to play with machine learning with minimal headache but it only took me hours it's beautiful which screen marker do you use i use screen brush that's awesome yeah i think adding my own models would be cool to this too it'd be a lot of fun so that was awesome all right that was really really fun i think i picked up something i hope you guys had fun we did some css stuff and then we also picked up some machine learning tensorflow realtime object detection with javascript that was cool i had a ton of fun um i
