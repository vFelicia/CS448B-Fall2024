training so today we're going to be talking about a few things one thing we're going to talk about today is what i call bangers this guys is how you grow anything this is how you grow your youtube channel this is how you get the results that you're looking for it's one word bangers if you're not dropping bangers on your youtube channel you're never gonna get found you can drop 200 videos 800 videos 1500 videos you're not gonna get found now here's what this means a lot of people who are close to me even in my life a lot of them are confused and hurt they're like i've been doing social media for three years four years and this one guy goes i asked him like how long have you been doing social media for his like four years i'm like okay um what platforms like youtube i said how many subscribers do you have he said 100 and i'm like one you mean like 100 000 subscribers and he goes no 100 and i said what are you doing on it like you must be doing something wrong he's like no no like i'm working really hard i'm really and i went to watch his content and he had pretty decent content but he had 100 to 200 subscribers max and so what i want for you guys is i don't want you guys to be going down that path of where you're doing three to four years of youtube and you only have 100 subscribers what i actually want for you guys that within three months or six months or 12 months you guys have between 10 000 to 100 000 subscribers are you guys with this raise your hands if you are beautiful beautiful awesome everybody that's here guys i want you to fully play out and be willing to participate because that's how you're gonna get the results that you're looking for so thank you for that stacey and my mom thank you for participating that one all right so that is the most important thing if you want to grow your channel you want to work on banger so here is an example of what that means okay i'm gonna share that with you guys in just a second if i type in clever programmer what i'll show you guys is this so let's go to the channel and let's go to videos and this is the simple secret you go and you sort by most popular all right this go to any channel sort by most popular the videos that you see all over the top those are the bangers if you were in the coding industry and you made videos on similar titles and then you try to model them exactly like how i have them but maybe just change a few things here and there those will be bangers and your youtube channel in the world of coding will blow up does that make sense it's just as simple as that you don't have to get fancier you don't have to let your little ego get hurt because it's not unique enough you will just get results just that simple this is true for all the channels whatever channel that you're trying to build or whatever it is that you're trying to do model go where things are working model the people that are in similar industry that are crushing it then find their titles that are the most popular and then go from there okay so now so what i want to do is i want to take like one live example okay so out of the people that are here i want to like go over one of your guys's channel just to kind of give you an example of it okay so let's go here and we have a bunch of people i want to see some people so eric pollantov you have i haven't spoken with you yet so i would love to sp i want to open up the opportunity to you i want to open up our opportunity to to nil single carry on you have a beautiful background behind you and open up the opportunity to you um and i'm trying to see who else i haven't really spoken to yet i feel like i've almost spoken to every single person so um okay so eric eric are you thinking about starting a youtube channel brother oh sorry there we go sir i'm so sorry um kaiser i'm so sorry i actually missed your um that training because i'm yeah it's a lot of stuff to do so okay so i just asked a question where i can watch those things and okay okay i have a question for you are you trying to start a youtube channel eric oh yeah like a year ago i actually started i was thinking about that and even i bought those uh mini you got a camera beautiful i love it that's for the video things yeah beautiful what are you trying to make your videos on eric actually first i want to learn uh how to code should i say excellent my knowledge on javascript and then teach yeah yeah okay so what do you want to make your channel on uh youtube i'm i understand that what type of niche do you want to talk like what do you want to talk about on your channel uh about the coding probably about coding how to make like extra money because i know a lot of people in my home country struggling to make money got it yeah okay awesome so do you have any ideas of what titles have you thought it did you think about like what titles you want to make it on what exact topics uh i really didn't okay that's fine so here's so he wants to make money you want to show people how to maybe make money with coding yes exactly okay so let's go and do that make money with coding all right so this is how we do it we just type that in and we go here now i'm here and i'm taking a look at all of this right here okay this is a perfect place this is the perfect way to look at which titles can possibly do really really well all right so is it possible eric that you could make a video on this topic of how to make money with code yeah right i have to do everything on my language or in russian because sure people in my own country doesn't know english that's fine you can do that that's okay so you could do it in your own language but this still gives you an idea of what types of titles are working does that make sense yep yep awesome um okay i'm gonna take olivia so olivia you are doing youtube i know that you've been doing some research and stuff like that so talk to me about like what type of when we i want to come up with a banger idea for you guys live and then we're gonna break off into a workshop okay so this is why i want you guys all to really pay attention to this segment we're gonna do it live with some of the people so you guys can understand what we're doing and then after that guys we're gonna break off into workshop and in that segment you guys are actually going to be working by yourself coming up with eight video ideas okay yesterday i gave you guys homework to think about what is the what you want to make your channel on who went and did that homework raise your hands if you did raise your hands if you did okay so so i'm going to ask keep your hands raised so i can keep seeing you even though it's a little bit annoying but just keep your hands raised until i tell you guys to put it down although just rapid fire what are you gonna make your channel on go rapid fire aldo okay all those frozen adam what are you gonna make your channel on it's it's about a coding and students adam you're on mute you're on mute yeah dude uh please don't take offense to this but i was probably just gonna copy your top eight i was gonna start with google maps um i i actually you know the other day you gave me the challenge of coming up with a list of uh ideas so you're gonna so you're okay okay i just need one word answer rapid fire not too long so it's gonna be on coding got it robin robin what is your channel gonna be on chinese astrology astrology beautiful stacy what's your channel gonna be on coding projects beautiful got it mark what's your channel going to be on heavy bass music got it john what's your channel going to be on personal finance got it clarity creek aka clara because i remember your name from the first day and you're looking really nice what's your channel going to be on um it's going to be singing and learn with me coding beautiful okay radiyan what's your channel going to be on go there got it okay so i went through a bunch of people i'm sorry if we didn't cover every single one here's the next one did you guys um okay zeeshan go ahead you i saw you were in a lot of pain go for it yeah i i made my channel about coding got it beautiful next thing did you guys do the second part of the homework who did the second part of the homework where you think about what product or course or service you're gonna sell raise your hands if you did got it beautiful so i'm gonna ask samir what's what is what's the product or service that you're going to sell keep your hands raised programming it's programming and tech reviews okay um that's not a service that you sell but okay matt short uh it's gonna be a beginner's python coding course beautiful robin a customized report got it received it's gonna be a javascript beginner course got it aldo frozen again john um it's going to be on how to easily start an online business got it gobby personal finance and credit for enterprise got it mark i'm pretty much dude beautiful okay beautiful guys great work so i think we went through almost everyone um maybe some people raise their hands i d i i missed it i don't know if alexandros you were raising your hand on on it you're on mute hey i'm planning python uh got it already working as a python tutor so i can either keep doing one oneonone course perfect got it awesome sounds good so beautiful i'm glad that you guys did that work and got some clarity on it right did that homework assignment give you guys some clarity on what you're going to be doing and what you're going to be potentially selling yes or no yeah yes okay beautiful so guys now what i want to do what i want to get into is i'm going to do this exercise with a few people where we're going to come up with some banger video titles and once we do that then we're gonna break off into a workshop where you're gonna need to come up with eight banger titles if you come up with those you have such a [ __ ] great chance on on making your youtube explode you guys saw yesterday right with alicia when we were breaking down his channel do you guys remember that all of his videos had like 2 under 20 000 views and under 12 000 views but he had one video that was sitting at 666 000 views you guys remember that do you guys remember yesterday when i showed you my channel and how from just two videos i got 160 000 subscribers you guys remember that yes or no yes do you guys remember how from those hundreds uh from those two videos youtube also paid me 17 000 just from two videos would you guys like to make seventeen thousand dollars from just two videos yes or no yes yes so today now imagine instead of two you come up with eight banger ideas if you come up with those eight you have now the potential to have a youtube channel that could be over a hundred thousand subscribers just from those eight videos it doesn't take many videos you guys how many videos would it take for you to blow up just one just one right how many people need to have their lives changed from your channel for you to feel fulfilled just one right so remember that video i showed you guys where it was it was just a picture of a fan with the sound of a fan for 10 hours you guys remember that video it had 33 million views that channel had 1.94 million subscribers right so if it's possible for that it could be possible for you you guys believe that that it's possible for yes or no yes yes all right beautiful so with that what we're gonna now get into is i'm gonna do some examples live coming up with banger titles then we're gonna break off into a workshop sounds good yes cool so now watch watch these ones closely okay so olivia you and me let's go hi hi how are you doing okay i'm fine beautiful so what do you need now my like a my channel or link or what do you need so not a channel link but let's talk about maybe a new video like i literally want to talk to you like if you were in person and you were like hey how can we make our blue uh bluetooth yo up how can we make our youtube blow up what would be the video i need to work on this week okay that's the conversation we're having how can we make it up with which video to work on this week okay imagine you're liter yeah okay so um okay so yes oh i'm sorry no no so so let's work on a video idea for your next video okay okay what are you thinking about so i have i have i have a video idea um and it goes into like because i'm all into manifestation law of attraction yes um chosen ones uhhuh chosen ones and how they're set apart because i found a lot of uh similarities got it to like how you know your energy actually will separate you from people situations and things like that so i want to go into okay uh real quick real quick doing the video on chosen one got it got it videos on chosen one i don't want to get too much into the content right now so the idea is doing a video on chosen ones now is this a popular thing that ever like most people in this thing know about are there videos already with this are are there videos on this title already big time okay let's go and let's let's do let's do chosen ones uh law of attraction yeah can i type that in and hit enter signs you are a chosen one you are a chosen one now what to do 83 000 views okay abraham hicks okay cool number one sign you are a chosen one so you wanna let me see how many subscribers six jake two thousand subscribers but he got 25 000 views on this one so you know um that's not very um so this channel now you realize that your chosen dimensional space start to fall off that's right okay so not they're not crazy amount of views on chosen one thanks frankie star child okay what is this okay okay i'm pretty sure i'm going to get the same okay so what is this it's like going into like what star system you're from like politians they have yeah it's a lot so like i i get it but i'm not seeing a lot of proof that this will work like i'm not seeing a lot of proof like for example um it could be a great idea but i want to see proof that it will work so for example this [ __ ] was made four years ago so i don't i don't even know what that is um all a lot of this stuff nine months ago twenty one thousand views um okay let's go who could be filler ideas as well on my channel or their channel let me ask you are there channels or are there channels that you really like can you give me a youtube channel that's really popular that you also really like on this stuff yeah um i like trinius henderson um um this one right here i can't think of it right now yeah trini is henderson and then um aaron dowdy huge youtuber i can't think of his name yeah okay um but i can't think of what is this guy's name gosh um okay cool how about aaron dowdy do you know about aaron dowdy doubt oh yes i actually spoke to him you spoke to him yeah yeah he's cool yeah okay so he's in you so basically he's in the same space right of what you're trying to talk about yeah manifestations stuff like that yeah okay what about any of you okay from this first two rows are there any ideas that like jump out at you that you're like oh that's kind of cool uh yeah uh things you must give up uh a new you i'm all about mine so it's probably uh let me see listen to this for 21 days i'm all into listening to manifestation and mindset stuff so yeah three right up the top another thing by the way that i look for guys so i'm looking for here what are popular titles another thing that i'm looking for is how recent are they so for example if this is three years ago if some of them are three years ago that's like maybe that could work for your channel but it's also a really long time ago so i want to look at stuff that's recent so for example two months ago 51 000 views that's a really good um that's a really good sign five months ago okay also a really good sign oh my god 1.5 million views girl yeah she's awesome this girl right here uh get her name too the look the young girl oh i mean yeah she's with only 118 000 subscribers if she's killing it this is the one you want to model because because another she's killing me so this is what i want to say for you guys because this guy has 1.3 1.03 million subscribers he yeah i want to model him but it's sometimes this also could be like really far reach um with this 118 thousand subscribers if she's putting 1.6 million views on the map that's a really good one to model because it's not too far off yeah right so now i'm gonna go to his channel her channel click videos and i'm gonna sort to most popular okay five months ago four months ago two months ago this [ __ ] is really good so for example for example is this something you want to talk about how to manifest anything you want because this is something i constantly keep see i'm seeing it pop up as very like recent and it's like hitting hard is this something you want to talk about yeah i could talk about that basically all of her topics i have seen her videos so yeah okay cool so i believe that for you if you talked about this but also try to make your video good i mean this video is like not even good it just seems like she's just talking if if you were to make it a little bit a little bit like good i would say as in um have it a little bit thought out to what you're getting around yeah make sure and make sure the lighting is good on you so that's one thing i would say that's the one feedback that i gave you as well so if you're lighting if your lighting is good on there and you talk about this i think this is this can be one of those videos that can be a banger on your channel thank you quasi yup you got it awesome all right guys give it up for olivia thank you for jumping on appreciate you thank you all right beautiful i'm gonna take on did that give you guys an example of how the process works guys like a little inside example yes yes yes cool all right let's pick one more i want to go with one more person so raise your hands if you want to go um let me see if you want to go next okay um let's see john let's go yeah what's up so i'm doing um personal finance and gran graham stefan is a sample of someone that i like you're gonna model the right person you cannot go wrong with graham stefan yeah i got 12 banger titles that i just came up with wow beautiful okay so give me some of the stuff that you're thinking about um top five credit cards 2021 oh that's money right there uh how to get out of debt hold on one second let me just type this in yeah the credit card ones will crush the important thing i want to say is now you gotta just make it [ __ ] good you gotta make it like youtube just paid you eight thousand dollars this week to make it okay if i paid you eight thousand dollars you're not gonna give me back [ __ ] right if i gave you eight thousand dollars would you invest in a good [ __ ] camera good mic and make sure that it's the best thing that you can do in that one week because i don't know about you right now are you making eight thousand dollars a week right now no would you want to [ __ ] make eight thousand dollars a week yes would you if i gave you eight thousand dollars would you work like i paid you eight thousand dollars yes that's how i want you to work on this video okay because if you make it good it can actually blow you the [ __ ] up just this one video okay i'm gonna do that today beautiful what else do you want to make uh what other like what give me one more title um how i travel the world for zero dollars by the way by the way i would go maybe if you [ __ ] go this route the five best credit cards for beginners in 2021 something like that i think you might be able to dominate okay i have that on the list as well okay give me your second title um how to fix a bad credit score bad capitalized um how to okay how to fix a bad credit score okay cool so here's the thing now um graham stefan can make a video with no title and get a million views i'll give you an example of this okay so i'll go to this channel called davey504 it's [ __ ] nuts okay this guy kills it it's just like he just smashes it like every video of it just is like kills it i'm gonna sort by some of his most popular videos and i want to show you something really really ridiculous if i can find it um okay maybe i won't be able to find it like this let's just go newest all right take a look at this video over here so you guys see this video right you guys see the title right here all right now ignore this video this is the one i actually want you to look at look at this do you guys see a title for this video no 1.6 [ __ ] million views so my point here is some of the people are just so ridiculous that you can try to model them but that might actually not be a good thing to model so for example what i'm worried about here is look at this right this guy probably tried to model graham and five months ago and it's only at 8 200 views um and let me also see how many subscribers this guy has because if he has no oh [ __ ] okay so this guy had 300 subscribers and he got 8 000 views so it might actually be a good idea to do it nine months ago so there's not crazy numbers that are happening behind it but i would still consider it i i don't think i will consider it like a crazy banger but i think it's still hot um i had another one which was how i traveled the world for free that might be banger or just how to travel the world for free yeah okay 254 000 views 1.5 mm two years ago so that's a little too late five years ago five months ago 400 views that's not 174 000 it's decent um okay so still it seems like a decent idea i i'm not saying don't pursue it if you do a good job on it i think you get tons of love tons of views uh but i'm still like i think the first title you gave me is just truly banger i think this title is pretty good too cool cool all right all right hopefully that was helpful brother all right awesome i'll take one last person caitlyn you want to jump on yes sure hey how's it going hi how you doing good okay awesome excited to see you love the smile you're looking happy youtube channel banger ideas what are you thinking about to start out um real quick i think you're you have some other mic set up right now where the audio is coming from so i don't think it's coming from that maybe just click next to the mute button and choose your microphone um okay can you hear me i mean i can hear you i just didn't think it was can you hear me i i can hear you i can hear you the whole time i can hear you that's okay okay let me just try this can you can you hear me better now yeah yeah i can hear you perfect perfect okay cool so tell me what are you thinking about in terms of your next upcoming video um let's see uh how to tell if coding is for you yeah got it okay how to tell if coding is for you okay how to tell if coding is for you and by the way are you are there youtube channels that you like by the way um my favorite is david me and he just kills it with all the tutorials and stuff okay cool so here's what i'll say on this right so this title i think it's decent but for example if you take a look at this this guy got 3 000 views this guy got 30 000 views but it's two years ago plus joshua fluke is a pretty big youtube channel um this is five years ago so like i don't think that this same title is you know has proof this is 400 views so this title i don't see a lot of like i think it's a good title i don't think it's a banger well i guess it would be more like is coding for you you straight to the point i mean i still think that that one is going to get you similar like it's coding for you i think it'll be i don't think it'll be a banger i still think it'll be a good video so when i'm looking for the banker titles usually they have a lot of proof that they work like big views behind it um are there so you like dev ed right yeah okay so let's go to deved i already know one of his most popular videos is on this fiverr thing do you have you seen that video or have you seen have you come across it where he like i paid web designers five dollars and fiverr or some [ __ ] yeah yep so see that's his most popular video and and he stole this concept from a lot of other people who do the same thing i've actually watched a lot of those videos too because i was curious can you you can you pay can you go on fiverr and spend five bucks yeah it can even 15 hours you get something pretty basic but they'll give you like a wordpress site you can even do like five dollars versus like a hundred dollars or five dollars versus a hundred dollars like what what that got you or you can or sure so like if you like dev ed this is one of the videos that has that is his most popular and and honestly it's probably not too hard to do it's only 15 minutes long okay yeah it's probably a lot of uh prework before the video yeah to get everything right so like um all i want you to do if you're gonna actually do it is just look at his video and then just try to model it very closely okay so like if i go or you can also do like fiverr um there's so much stuff out there with fiverr like it's crazy popular you see how it's like a banger idea that just works for everybody like it's not like it works one person just works for four months ago 2.3 million views five months ago 733 000 views 3.4 million views 11 months ago by the way frankie we should do this write write this idea down for our channel this is [ __ ] it's gonna work so all the really banger ideas i'm also gonna do them but don't worry everybody can do them and we'll all get views okay it's not a competition um oh this look at this i worked on fiverr for a whole week and made blank and 2.6 million views oh my god i paid a stranger 25 to edit my pizza commercial i mean this is daniel schiffer so i mean that one is just going to bang because of him so that and then i want you to pick one person's thumbnail to model do you want to go the dev ed route or do you want to go this type of route which route do you want to go dev admin meaning for dev ed he doesn't compare he doesn't have two he just has one uh person right he does he's not like i paid five dollars to somebody and i paid 100 bucks to somebody else it's just five bucks so do you want to go that route or do you want to have like a comparison slash competition between two i like the competition the competition is gonna work way harder right dope uh what are you thinking about paying between what and what i guess it depends what i could get for what i don't think i want to go more i mean the cheapest first maybe something like 50. uh let me just let me just tell you something let me tell you something okay for this video just just youtube paid this person probably 15 000 just for this one video wow okay yeah probably over that over 15 000. so you probably won't really like i'm not saying go crazy with it but i'm saying that if you did go a little bit higher then 50 bucks or 100 bucks it won't end the world so you're thinking 5.70 or 5 or 100 what are you thinking it's like in case you're investing about that i mean i know there would be a big difference if i did like even what would you say if you did what oh my gosh if you like invest and then you will get hold on hold on one second i'm speaking one second so caitlyn i'm sorry i didn't hear you you you which one did you want to go oh my god am i back on i hello yes hi oh sorry it kicked me off oh god i missed your question okay so between which one do you want to go with like if you just pick up like you can just pick a random number oh you're not hearing anything okay um so it may be in the comments just write to her you know frankie or nas just like let her know um to just pick one but d was that helpful for you guys like do you see how we're going about it and that's how you come up with really really banger ideas that's how you come up with like which idea is going to work does that make sense yes yes you really want to go into it like if it's working for every [ __ ] person it's going to work for you you just have to then the thing that you have to make sure is um that's such a great idea like these ideas are all great so once you get the idea and you see there's a lot of proof then what you want to do is just go all in and make that video really really good that's the last step of the secret okay that's the secret sauce you want to make it really good like i might make a video i'm just thinking about this right now and i might just make one that's like i paid a fiver a guy 250 another one i paid 7 000 and let's just see like what happens and i know i'm thinking about it right now and i know that youtube video would just crush so it might actually be totally worth doing that this is five dollars versus five hundred dollars it crushed so see dang right that's a lot of money though but i can definitely see that too yeah so it can still crush between you know between this and this so that's how i go about my ideas when i'm thinking about them this is my way of doing it it usually works if you this is the most proven way that i've come across where if you find proof of what works and then you model that very closely make sure your whatever title you have has a lot of views behind it so like for olivia i don't believe in the chosen one title idea i don't believe in it it i think it's still a good idea i don't think it's a banger should she make that video of course but should she also know that that's not the video's going to put on the map yes like that's important to know if you want to make it what i think about is like i have my banger videos and then from those videos people come and watch all my other content right you guys saw how that dude davey 504 dropped a video with no title right got 1.6 million views remember that video in that video how he made that happen is because he already had tons of banger videos he's ton of he had a really big audience so then that audience goes and watches that video because he has many subscribers yes he has many many subscribers okay so that's the important part like for those deeper videos i would make them but make them either a little bit later or make sure you're putting more effort on your banger videos and then your other videos you can you know you can just make them on a regular basis because i want you to get a chance of really blowing up as a channel and then those other videos will get fed from those banker videos cool like i just wanted to ask a question about this yeah uh like a if you have uh like uh under 1k subscribers yeah uh and you make a banger video yep so you will get views but you will not get monetized i think what does that mean like monetization unlocks after like i don't know whatever subscribers 4 000 hours yeah it's something like yeah 4 000 hours watched so monetization gets enabled when you have past 1000 subscribers 4 000 hours watched yeah and then you can enable it but in the start you might not have monetization then you can enable it later yeah like i saw someone uh like his channel is named like it's ali jay yeah and his first video was the most popular one yeah and he got 57 million views wow jesus on his first video that's that's ridiculous so it's possible right like if you guys make a banger video it's very possible to just for the first video to get crazy views uh one thing i want to share with you guys is one like pro hack if you're making videos so like let me go to and see if i have python tutorial in there so if i go to this and we go to okay i'll just hit enter hopefully the video that i'm looking for comes up that's not it python tutorial show all all right so where is that 1.8 million one 11 ah right here yep so for this one for monetization because it's a 11 hour long video what you can do is you can do something it's like pretty advanced but this is something a lot of people don't talk about but you can manually go and actually place ads in your video so like usually if you let youtube put ads in your videos it might actually not put that many ads but manually you can go and put a whole bunch of ads and because it's an 11 hour video i knew it was it wouldn't bother my audience that much because it's 11 hours so like the gap between each ad is massive so it's not that big of a deal and because i sprinkled it with more ads then on the monetization level it also generates more revenue because of that so you guys see how this one video has generated 7 679 dollars so that's really like the key behind it to make sure that um the video is good and if it's longer you can add also manually more ads in there so i have a question about this yes can we do this before that monetization enables you cannot do that before the monetization enables because i think yeah once the monetization enables you can do it gabi go for it okay thanks hi i have a question about the banger views when do you recommend to upload a banger video because you told about the vanguard views will will send the the people to see the other videos yeah you recommend to have i don't know 10 videos and then a banger video no i i think um focus on bankers every week like every week you guys youtube you should focus on banger videos you can produce other content as well but i think like your biggest focus should be on banger titles that's how mr beast right now is at 46 million subscribers in just a few years because the only thing you focus on the big ideas another thing about big ideas when i say bankers you can either model [ __ ] that's already out there if you want to start to get creative you have to come up with ideas that make people's eyes like go [ __ ] like open up like crazy you want to look in people's pupils like literally when you're telling your idea to somebody face to face look into their eyes if their eyes don't go like their facial expression doesn't change that's not a [ __ ] banger idea if you have to explain what it is it's a garbage idea okay if so that's what i mean so certain things either will already have proof online but if you want to go with the cool idea that maybe isn't out there already and there's no proof then make sure when you say it bunch of people their eyes light up that also gives you oh that actually could be like a cool idea you know like mr mr beast does like crazy stuff right he'll be like i bought 5 000 cars for this random stranger like boom your eyes are like what the [ __ ] like i want to watch somebody buying 5 000 cars for one person and so then you're like go crazy about it so those videos might not be out there there might not be proof of it but because the idea is so wild and it gets people going it might be a good idea to drop that i like the one where he opened the bank that was giving you money everybody you just show up to the bank and they give you money for your money that's what i'm saying right a bank that gives you like that's crazy so that's a big idea so you can come up with a guy all right yeah that's awesome so go ahead ayoob okay uh yesterday i told you to ask you a question on another topic and i uh wait what okay do you have a question right now bro uh okay i'm gonna go with calvin unless you have a question ayub uh no no kazi yeah yesterday i told you to ask you a question on another topic and he told me to ask it later and i have uh what's your what's your question what's your question uh i learned python and jungkook from your lessons and tutorials and i can build a social media site and jungle okay can i work with you a live uh to build a social media site okay send us something right now we're not really taking on more content creators but if you want to send us something you can send it okay but thanks for your question ayoob i want to make sure we're talking about this training right now calvin go for it brother um can you hear me yeah okay so um i posted my video today like my first ever my channel yeah and youtube is saying something about copyright infringement or something like music music probably yeah yeah music yeah so why i understood that you would have to get a license get epidemic yeah so like get something like epidemic sounds or go to youtube and download free copyright free music and then use that in your videos because if your videos have copywriting infringement and you're using like popular songs uh what you're going to need to do then is there's no monetization on those videos okay yeah i understand that but like i also like i searched on youtube how to get a copyright for music for do you use music in your videos then appeal it yeah okay so that's how i can get it i should appeal like did you did you use copyrighted music or did you use noncopyrighted music i use copyrighted music so then you're going to get a copyright strike yeah it's like even even for like two seconds man it's like when you're a new channel and nobody knows you it's like right if you feel like you did something fair if you feel like you did something that's like it's supposed it's good then file and appeal okay okay because like i'm like what if i want to just use like a two second clip of drake's music i think if you use two seconds it falls under something called fair use so i think like maybe that could work so make sure you appeal it and look more into the youtube laws but i i think if you appeal it you might you'll you'll get it back uh although go for it brother i'll take on one or two more people guys i'll take on one more person and then after that guys we're going to jump into the workshop so go for it disable i disable my video because of the speed go for it i have two videos to get roasted do you say when um okay cool yes i'll take i'll do the

there we go china's trying to see about um what the top five languages like if i only know like four does it really you don't need to know the other languages i only know i only knew python javascript when i made my top five programming languages right okay so you don't have to know all of the five ones you can look up online and see what other people are saying about it and then you can say similar things about it that's okay your job is to deliver information to people make it entertaining make it valuable and that's it cool yeah got it who else is stuck or you need help raise your

ideas do you have let me count okay zeeshan what we're gonna do is frankie and nas are gonna privately chat with you and zoom and help you out okay i have five ideas okay keep an eye on your zoom chat frankie and not frankie or nas are going to help you so take a look at your zoom chat you guys got it beautiful samir what's up um i just i have just four ideas i'm rest i'm out of my ideas okay what are your four give me some of your ideas that you have uh learn the essentials of web web programming customize your terminal setup using item 2021 yeah uh vs code setup for mac and windows and python learning in 2021 question mark okay got it which of these so like very few of them sound like truly banger titles did you do your research yeah uh i before posting before creating my youtube channel i was doing some research for my own like what kind of titles i should be right there there are titles that are good and great then there are bangers are these bangers uh i feel some of them are bankers and some of them are just like not bangers yeah okay so are there channels that you follow on coding that you really enjoy what are some channels that you really really enjoy well to be honest and to be frank the first channel which i was uh i followed was was yours which one are you enjoying right now which channels do you like it's okay if it doesn't have to be mine that's fine no i'm not being really honest it was only you that's it then after that i went to uh so then go to some of my go to some of my videos and get inspiration from there so i have big time bankers how i learned to code in less than x amount of months um how uh there's top five programming languages to learn in 2021 top four dying programming languages to you know uh to not learn or whatever i have something like that top four dying programming languages of 2021 rap pascal yes so you can go negative as well if you can't come up with a positive idea of something you can go with the negative of something like why you should not code in 2021 if you make that a good video that can do really really well um so some ideas you know can you do a html crash course a css crash course can you do a s um can you do a basic beginner's javascript course those bang those crush so that's what i would say cool guys uh i'll do 30 more seconds does anybody need help with anything raise your hands if raise your hands if you're done okay most people are raising their hands raise your hands if you got a little bit to go raise your hands if you're not done yet you got a little bit to go oh okay dope so what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring it down bring it down and we're gonna get back right back into it cool you guys with me so far yeah i want to hear you guys are you guys with me so far hey how how was that exercise you guys have fun that was fun it was fun beautiful awesome awesome that's really exciting so good almost all of us got up to eight titles yes yeah yes okay even if we don't have full eight don't don't beat yourself up over it that is okay the point is that we got close to that goal all right so um we're gonna i'm gonna take a look at some of your guys's um i'm gonna look at some of your guys's ideas so for example i'm looking at hormones right now so he has making a 3d game in two hours they bet i can't do it number two designing using css no no javascript three i made a meme review app for writing an ai that rose people for me that might actually crush that might actually do really well top 10 apis for new developers hormone your ideas are great now it's time for you to execute if you execute it really well just with these eight videos really really well made these videos truly truly good videos you can look at for example how uh cali haldon makes his videos if you model good channels and you make these videos i believe that with just these eight videos if you sat over a hundred thousand eighty to a hundred thousand subscribers by the by next year i would not be surprised all right let's take a look at another one rocio says a five a five dollar logo versus a hundred dollar logo on fiverr rocio if you do a good great job with this video this can crush that's a great title great title how i became a software engineer racio that's going to crush most people one want to know that two if you're a female developer people want to know that even more because they're not a lot of female developers out there that have channels so like that gives you a very unique viewpoint into this world also you're going to inspire and help a lot of female software engineers or female developers that are trying to become a female developer because so male dominant so when you are a female developer and you're excited about you're talking about it you just become a path leader so i'm excited about awesome thank you thank you for that feedback yep you got it russia great daniel okay i'm looking at yours first steps into data science the hardest part of learning data science my biggest breakthroughs in data science the best tools to get started in data science tips and tricks daniel if you go around the route of data science and you make good content you're you're just going to fly you don't even need to be the craziest with the titles or ideas if you go to the data science route and you actually give valuable stuff you're going to blow up if you do the best data science interview tips and tricks if you do something on interviews with data science that video can be sitting at 800 000 views in six to 12 months so the interview stuff i think go more into that i think that could win uh nikhil okay i'm looking at this why you should pick up html5 right now and how it can change your life not a banger because bangers have a lot of proof behind them so not truly a banker let's code in 2021 i think it's good again nikhil not a banker uh so almost there i would work more on like make sure that there's proof behind what you're looking for and if you're similar titles to what you're about to talk about have hundreds of thousands or millions of views and within the last like nine to ten months then you're you know on on track to crush it matt short 15 python projects in 15 minutes that will do [ __ ] phenomenally well you just have that one has 1.2 million views on another guy's channel 1.2 million views and how long when did he post the video one year a year ago year ago yep i know which video you're talking about so if you make the video similar to his and you go with a similar thing you can win all right python beginner crash course you can win django crash course you can win uh python classes and instances i don't know maybe um i don't know about that one that one has a million hits yes i know i know when was this made uh that one is pretty old it's one of corey schaefer's it's like three or four years i know which one you're talking about so that's why i'm like i don't know uh but it could work so give it a try what does it take to become a python expert maybe build an amazon price tracker in python that's something we did that will work for you if you make it a good video um anything with like python course or a complete course those will work like anything with like oh a beginner uh beautiful soup tutorial 2021 like guide those will work beautiful soup is not going to get millions of views because first there's like a niche of python and then within that there's a niche of people that know actually about it most not every python developer is going to know about it so it's going to get fewer views just like django is going to get fewer views but you're going to have a very tight audience from it so that's that's still really good so great so should that one be like scraping instead of beautiful soup complete courses scraping yeah yeah i would go scraping yeah that will work better cool okay great great titles um let's see here naman good titles um but i don't really see a banger title in there so keep working on it uh let me see i'm going through i'm trying to fly through them as fast as i can alexandros you're right on the track python flask for absolute beginners if you go deep in that make that [ __ ] good you're [ __ ] gone that's gonna put you on the map data types in python that's cute how to use functions with python that's also cute the why i say that is because even with our channel with 830 000 subscribers those videos got like 800 [ __ ] views like 1200 views but python flash tutorial for beginners that's gonna fly okay so i would focus all my energy and attention into those like big courses and then just put them out there for free you'll win nora what career okay um i would again i would emphasize that you're probably not like look at truly the channels that are killing it or videos that have a lot of views and model them i would play with the titles here okay because yeah yeah i would definitely play with the titles here i think that requires some work frank how much does a mobile developer make that could be really good uber clone will bank uh instagram clone will do well let's see top four mobile programming languages i think that could do really well um and then all the dead ones i think will do good i don't think they're bangers but i think they'll do good um okay awesome redian that okay you're subscribing change the future uh top five programming language of 2021 that's i mean that's a banger now you just have to do a really good job of the video because once you're in the banker title then you have to really make sure you have a good video because you're going to be competing up there with me you're going to be competing up there with a few other people because my team is going to get to work on top five programming languages 2021 then like so you got to make sure it's good if it's better than ours you're going to win that's going to be [ __ ] sick i'll be pumped for you uh if it's not better than ours then it's going to be behind hours so for when you get the title and thumbnail right then it's got to go all in on the video and make sure it's the best thing that you can put out um okay cool clara all right a beginner entrepreneur so the one that pops out to me out of all of them almost every other idea that you have here my eyes kind of glaze over them because they're not necessarily great youtube video titles uh but the one that that's before how i became a software engineer and an apprentice you could do like medical assistant or i'm sorry i think how i went from being a medical assistant to a software engineer i think that could be a great so like how that one seems like a banger idea to me i think that would be cool thank you yes the other ones i think you are those ideas are very unique and they sound really good but i want you to actually go on youtube and make sure each idea has a lot of views and then work on those types of titles and then within the content say your message so for example i see a lot of your contents are like zero to hero become your own hero um rise and shine never give up on your dreams struggling till i'm not that's not your titles it's going to get you zero views if those are your titles but if you say those things in your videos if they're your signoffs if they're part of your intros if you're seeing them in the middle of the video people are going to listen to it and they're going to become a part of your culture but nobody's ever going to click on those videos where those are the titles okay so i want you to work on the titles and make them like something that's really hot okay okay got it awesome awesome so go more in the route of that number four that you have gabi start investing in saving today um is there a lot of proof behind that one do you know so that's like telling me something like it's almost like it's almost like you're telling me something but that's kind of it it's like if i came across that youtube title i should be like oh okay great idea and i'll just like move past it i don't even think i would need to click into the video maybe if you said how to start investing like nobody really wants to save so if that's there so like i would work if there's proof behind it then it's banger if there's no proof behind it i would work on that one more how to use a credit card or is there is there a lot of stuff behind that gabi yes in mexico yes got it okay so if there are a lot of views behind it then go for it how do you read okay cool how to get out of boro de credito okay tips top five credit cards for beginners top five credit cards pros and cons cool all right so these videos are great i think that if you go hard on this you can crush it from your youtube videos what i remember is invest guys please [ __ ] invest in a camera invest in this yeti might get if you're serious about this put that money down if you need to borrow that money buy that [ __ ] with a credit card finance it it's going to cost you 100 bucks a month to get a great computer it's going to cost you like some bucks a month to get a camera get all this equipment because if you do these videos well and with good quality these videos are going to pay you way more than what you're going to invest into the equipment so if you're serious about this just invest like don't spend time thinking about it and [ __ ] um even when i started there's also there's black friday sales on all the yeti mics too like look look out for those yeah so look out for the sales or whatever but like seriously guys because even when i started my youtube channel i went into debt to get a camera to get the equipment because i just believed that it would work and then those same videos that i put out have now generated six thousand eight thousand dollars just in ad revenue so they paid off for my imac and my camera and everything that i got so invest in it because if these are bangers make them as good as the you pop as you possibly can you okay thank you you got it awesome um aldo one second here i'm just going through all those okay that's looking good just make sure there's a lot of proof behind those although and these titles look they look good i think what you will have to do is make sure you make your videos also really good yes thank you um zach i mean if you go this route zach elson you're gonna just win and crush you just need to make sure your videos are good okay so follow people who are talking about this and they're making their videos good because machine learning for picture recognition how to study machine learning anything with data science and machine learning you're just gonna win by default like because there's so few people out there and the demand of it is just stupid um so you're gonna win just make sure you make it good okay guys so maybe i won't be able to go over everybody's but i hope that this was a valuable session for you where we worked out on these eight videos was it a valuable session for you guys yeah beautiful yes awesome awesome okay great so uh these are the videos that if you guys started caitlin did you put yours in the zoom chat yeah i put them individually i didn't lump them together yet okay okay got it um cool cool so yeah just make sure that if you get these titles right it's kind of like it's kind of like imagine you're navigating to um navigating to go somewhere right if you are navigating to go somewhere that you've never been before when is the perfect time to put that into the gps i'll give you guys a few options before you leave in the middle of driving or once you get at that place when is the best time to put in the directions into your gps when is the best time before you're starting before you leave okay that's what the [ __ ] you have to do when it comes to youtube you ha when it comes like you cannot be successful if you don't get the big ideas right you cannot win on youtube that's the most important thing it doesn't matter how much you drive if you don't know the address to the place that you're going and the directions to get there no matter how much you drive are you ever going to get to your destination no no no you can what if you drove for 2 000 hours did you get there no you literally won't right like what if the place is in [ __ ] england right it's like literally and if you're in different country you can't even so like so this is the really really important thing you have to map these out it doesn't matter how hard you work on youtube if your titles or ideas or whatever aren't on the money then everything else that you do you're just gonna scramble in million different places and it's gonna lead to zero results so i wanna make sure that this part that you guys have you guys have a down pat okay so now we should have an idea of what we're going to sell we have an idea of what niche that we want to go down on and we have our eight youtube videos yes yes yes cool yes now what happens is you will actually at some point have to start working on these videos so this is the second part and the last part of this workshop okay after this what we're gonna start doing is we're gonna go and anybody that hasn't signed up for the webinar yet we're gonna sign up for the webinar because then we're gonna see you guys on the 24th of november i'm not saying this to wrap it up because i'm still going to be taking your questions and answers today and i'm still going to be doing the the youtube roast okay so there's still a lot more to go so we're not like done yet they're still we're going to give you guys a lot more value and by the way nas is the air table done okay so one important thing i do want to say guys is uh this is part five of your guys's homework and this is gonna be the last part and so for

hopefully that'll give you a lot of value on how you can do that too another case study i'm going to show you guys how this one client went from 0 to 1.1 million dollars on youtube in one year okay and not in some kind of crazy niche like making crazy videos about how to give 5 000 cars to a homeless person like not those types of videos i'm talking about like the types of industries you guys

day we're also going to be giving you the 90 day road map to actually becoming a successful youtuber so hopefully it's clear what you guys are going to get out of it the value proposition that we have for you and um yeah it's going to be literally like the best training that we've put together so i'm super excited for you guys to show up cool all right so with that said i think now let's get into i want to do a few questions for you guys that you have and uh then we're gonna get into the youtube rose cool yes hey beautiful all right so let's take on a couple of questions so raise your hands if you have a question you can do that through okay naman go for it oh hi kazee how are you hey how are you doing man i'm doing fantastic perfect so i have this question like i after watching your videos like i i had no plan of starting a youtube channel but after watching your videos i was motivated and i have this idea that i want to share with people like or for the past one year yeah i've been solving a lot of data structural algorithms questions on lead code platform yep okay so what i want is like uh when i uh used to uh do any questions i used to search a lot in net all on youtube yeah and used to go through a lot of videos yeah but and every time i used to like change channel because some question was good in one particular channel and some question was good at one particular channel okay so what i'm planning to do is like i want to give a like a full tutorial of all the questions got it and all my videos would be about data structure and goal items got it but at the same time i understood like it doesn't have a banger title so can you help me out with that cool should i go for some other content or something like that like i'm a little confused over there okay did you study similar titles to what you're looking for and did they have a lot of views oh like a lot of views means 100k like okay 100k max there i mean look there's a channel cs dojo he does a lot of like computer programming questions right so maybe take something on how he does it and what his title is and do something similar oh but just tell me one thing like oh like i'm solving one question okay in particular in one video so isn't that restricting my target audience like i want to share this content right but i'm not sure that this content would be valuable to many people or not i mean if it's again i would look at the channels where they have done it they got tons of views so if it's cs dojo who's done it one channel kevin norton jr just check out one channel can you give me some feedback on that it's not mine like i was uh studying that channel kevin norton junior okay kevin um what is it yeah okay maybe just type in what you're looking for bro maybe just type in what you're looking for like on zoom because i have no idea what you're talking about i'm typing it in i'm getting edward snowden who's the whistleblower american whistleblower who copied and leaked highly classified information from national security all right um okay so here we go um and i know that there are other okay so what about it so this guy solves a lot of problems from lead code uhhuh so like i am planning to make a channel like this okay so is it the way to go for yeah is it the right track like you can see these amazon coding interview questions right so yes one of the questions yeah something like this yeah that's great is it a good way yeah it's a good way i mean again look at where they're getting really really good views and they're crushing it um i would go there so like i mean i don't know to me 62 000 views one year ago isn't like that crazy 68 000 six months ago that's decent but again if you stay in this track i mean the guy's 50 000 subscribers if you model him you're gonna be on the right track okay okay all right awesome thanks for coming on um beautiful any okay so i want to see you guys if you guys have questions about anything now would be the time i'll take on okay hold on just raise your hands if you have a question i'm going through okay harmon um okay so kazi like uh yesterday i said i'd be making a video right so um today i went down my discord and started like streaming on twitch because that's the usual way i make content nice and we had like seven to eight people in the channel right yeah so it was easier to talk during that call like you weren't stressed about making a video and content was sort of already generated yeah like my plan is to just take that time lapse it get the good bits and post it sure that's a great idea uh so like if uh let's say i want to directly stream on youtube yeah instead of like twitch but i i'm just starting my channel so i don't have any subs or like nobody would get notified for it that's fine will that be okay that's okay oh it's complete if i should uh like keep my like live streams up or should i just like you can keep them down never never delete anything never go backwards that's my belief never go backwards never delete anything so you can stream to your channel and then you can cut it up and post it too i can make it private and then like edit it one of my favorite channels is this one okay chess bro i love this channel i [ __ ] watch it so much um and they they stream to twitch all the time and then they just cut up their twitch and then just package them on youtube so for example they might have like a fun moment or like a really great moment that happens i was like eric kids top 10 highest chess.com ratings of all times right and now it's a 23 minute clip from his stream so if i watch this scott nice bird houses bluehost can help turn the curse off you need to pay for the that to go away man i have i've paid for it so many times it's not even funny all right so um here we go i have a channel that i'm like like this is so crazy this guy is just playing freaking chess right and it's just a video and it crushes it this guy's getting 60 000 100 000 views on every video that they're repackaging from their twitch i think that's a great idea right um can you look at the video that i'm referring to for the new spot it's by danny d and i dropped drop a link and check it out and he did a video on twitter just type twitter you'll find the video easily it's not a small channel see the first one no it's gni simply this one right this guy right here right okay yeah what about it uh like this is the sort of content that i'm trying to produce i mean you're gonna win that's something yeah if it's 3.6 million views six months ago why is that something that provides value so i uploaded a short video on twitter asking you to give me your game ideas and mechanics and the five most popular replies would be morphed into one single track so adding in some fights again yeah if you keep it similar to this i mean you're gonna crush yeah all right yeah okay if you keep it similar that's my main reference point awesome all right awesome harmon thanks for jumping on brother that's a great idea i think that's a great channel to model after okay that's like banger when i even was looking at your titles i'm like whoa those are looking like some great titles now on your end your execution has to be really money and then you're good to go um i have all the setup i need i just have to good like get things done and i have a lot of people who can review it maybe for postings got it awesome man uh i love shantanu santana says uh i love chestastic that's hilarious uh that's my youtube channel that i started before my coding channel and uh that was even like my my um man that those were the days that used to be really nice holy [ __ ] almost 500 subscribers what is happening here oh man almost 500 views i should keep posting on this thing hey guys what's up so i'm actually watching carlson here but i mean this these are that video was seven months ago but this is how i actually start 7 800 views not bad look at that 169 upvotes one down vote i mean that's pretty epic and i'm here to explain about a new concept in chess if you are new to chat that's vitally imp 20 total moves in the start well which one do you choose to play i mean that's me i'm gonna have to isn't the benghazi something changed some something definitely happened i think it's because i'm wearing different glasses now that's the main difference okay so uh what's up somebody said they have a question yes i do have a question eric go for it yeah um i have another idea instead of coding i have one more idea um what if i do like a random video chatting with people they don't know that i'm doing on the youtube so i will randomly talk with them yeah and i will post it in youtube should i ask them for the permission yes on youtube yes just to be safe like it should be only verbally like hey you you're going to be in youtube yeah yeah yeah i mean it's like not the craziest thing but like i would you know just to like cover your ass but i mean it's not again it's like not the craziest thing so like for example we went to we did this one video right where we're in a mall and we're interviewing people so i think it's like why you should learn programming clever programmers if i type that in this video so like this video we've all heard the stories about personal data being sold every time you use the internet our internet happens over and over and over again it's like the all right so here we go so how much do you guys think a programmer makes one i gotta do more of this [ __ ] dude is the lockdown happening or can we go and interview people in santa monica i would love to do like why you should start youtube and then we go and interview people yeah how much yeah that would be fun so in this video right like i go through it so i i actually asked the people and this last thing is this okay if we choose to put it on youtube go for it is this okay if we put this on youtube yes i'm fine can we put that on youtube yeah go yes yes amazing ruby nice to meet you where do i find you guys yeah so we asked the people in this one right like can is it cool with you if you put it on youtube they're like yeah is it cool with you is it cool with you yeah most of them are gonna be like yeah it's cool with me so i would just ask you know officially if i'm giving advice let's just ask and it makes it easier i generally ask at the end though so they're not weirded out um if you're if you're doing a call with strangers i would do the whole call and at the end i'll be like oh my god this was a great call by the way this is gonna i'm gonna put it on youtube is that cool with you and then they're gonna be like yeah that's cool with me and you're like okay okay just be careful be careful there's like kids in there or stuff like that like youtube does not like that stuff you gotta be really careful yeah so just probably you know um again again if you're not doing something crazy right if it's like not questionable content if you're just like whatever i think you're going to be fine all right just at the as long as at the end you can ask but i mean just whatever you're doing prank calls try to prank call somebody who's over the age of 18. you know don't prank call you're not about the playing cards at all um it's actually educational okay and second question if i like like soundtrack or music or something and i want to put it on my background video yeah uh because i tried to do that and youtube blocked me immediately so how can i get that um license or epidemic sounds epidemic sounds yeah i use epidemic sounds for all my music even the music right now that i'm doing right so it's like this music right or this one these are copyrighted free music this is not drake or something like that the reason is i'm streaming this video to youtube now if i had some other music this video would get shut down right away but because it's copyrighted free music i have a license to it i pay for epidemic sounds uh it's gonna be good but this particular if i like like i i have like a music which i really really love and i want to be on that you can't i mean you maybe maybe you could but then you i think you have to know that that video cannot get monetized so as long as you're okay with that then maybe i think you can that's one thing i always forget i like if you give up your rights for monetization i believe you can have whatever song you want playing in the back i think david david dubrick does that like there are people uh like who post lyrics of a a song and then play the song behind it yeah so they don't get copied rediane says qazi in my country youtube partners uh monetization is not supported do you think it will hold me back of doing youtube absolutely not i mean most of the times unless you're in like finance industry or something crazy how much youtube monetization is like pennies compared to like like it's not it just doesn't pay you almost any money so i wouldn't worry too much about that i would try to make my income from actually having a product or a service or even like doing lessons with those people or group coaching with those people like hey i'll charge you 15 an hour but like group of five or 10 people you know all of a sudden you're making 150 an hour because there's 10 people in that group session that's like really cheap right 15 is really really cheap to coach somebody but i'm just saying this so if you're new and you're like how do i start you could you know then later as time progresses now i'm charging people between 500 to 2 000 for an hour of my time but i couldn't in the start so in the start do whatever you need to do to be able to make that income um and be able to make a living off of it so then you can actually just go full time and all in because i just wanted to ask a quick question uh which mac or and a camera should i english um i mean i mean if you can afford it the new mac is out i think with the m1 chip or whatever i want to get that i'm super i got my eyes on it so you could you could spend it on that um or something cheaper and um to wait for the 16 inch sure so yeah you can wait for that and then on the camera panasonic gh5 is really good or you can go with the sony zv1 uh vicente says he has a question okay go for it vicente can you hear me yes okay um so we were talking this is kind of following up the question that was just made because um you earlier were saying that we should probably get uh either uh mike or a camera from maybe this coming on black friday we have the money um where would you recommend for us to kind of like do research on on what would we what would be good to buy starting off because i mean i know you probably got a nice one um but just kind of like what would be kind of like the base so what type of videos are you trying to do are you trying to do like screencast tutorial technical videos or yeah like educational tutorial videos you are gonna be fine with the logitech c920 which is a 70 dollar webcam okay i seen that one okay all right oh and uh earlier you also you said yeti um a blue yeti would be fine right all right awesome thanks man it'll be great and actually how about the last webinar i give you guys the exact like i have slides with the exact equipment and how much it costs would that be valuable for you guys yeah okay great so frankie can you make a note of that or send that to a monarch as a thing frankie or nas nazim um quasi okay give me one second you know sure sm7b yeti um panasonic gh5 road caster pro like throw some of that [ __ ] in there and then we'll have that ready for that day um yeah because if we could have it also like i think that something that that we're getting a lot of questions is like let's do like a budget setup let's do like a midrange budget setup midrange setup and a baller setup fantastic include the uh softwares that you'd mentioned yesterday in that slide include softwares too for this slide so make sure you're sending him all of this thank you my friends you got it thank you anything else you guys want to see in that training that we do in two days actually it's a great idea let me just ask you guys like what are things that are like you're gonna be really excited about seeing in that training so i can just make it as valuepacked for you guys possible basic of video editing basics of video editing okay if we can throw that in there it'd be great to have a studio tour in your setup too so setup tutorial okay maybe some lighting oh yeah the lights lighting okay so lighting stuff are you able to get all of this what i'm saying okay cool let's say that again headset headsets headsets okay what else um um software alternatives right like free versions and stuff like that well i just freeze alternatives for like also maybe windows and stuff like that on fire what i just landed a hundred dollar deal on fiverr holy [ __ ] that is amazing let's go for what let's go and web development from for making a website congratulations oh my gosh it's not for caitlyn is it wow great work oh yeah that's hilarious awesome cassie i'll say uh for the final webinar maybe like we have two days till that happens right yes so maybe some of us can try like uh taking what we learned during these five days and try to put up like at least one video on the channel so you can go through it see if if we are missing on to something per se okay got it because right oh nas yeah what if in that air table homework yeah because harman just said something awesome he said hey how about if we add um like for the last day like if people you know between these two days if people made a video and you can maybe review those videos or something on the last day but what if we had a great way for them to submit like a good one where should they post it i'll just put it in the air table right now you want to do it in the air table yeah what do you guys think if we added it to the uh air table that we have today and we made one field in there for like one of your youtube videos do you guys think it like um i think the channel uh okay i i think we already have a channel link field there so uh we can just reference that for people like we can just have a check mark for people who want to take that review during the seminar since we already have a channel feel you can just go there uh because youtube also we have to do oh okay harman is saying the channel link is already there so he said how about like to the air table we just add like a little check mark button if they want a review of their videos yeah like would you like us to give a feedback on your yeah i think yeah youtube channel and then maybe they can and maybe we can just have like one last thing anything else you want to let us know and maybe they can be like our my last video give me a review on my last video right okay so basically just a check mark and then just like anything else comment field and a check mark okay cool we'll add that to the homework um for you guys and it'll just be an optional thing is that cool with you guys yeah okay yeah awesome awesome because what i can do if you guys actually want what i can do is like i can literally make a video review personally by me for each and every one of you and then actually send it to you so if you want an actual review and you want to know for a specific video you can let us know in that anything else you want us to know section and i can make a personalized video and send it to you guys cool nice okay that would be awesome okay great so then you get personalized feedback dope awesome awesome awesome great um okay other than that i think we took on the questions i don't know if there was anybody else like i don't know aldo were you raising your hand at any point yes yes go for it i will disable the video because of the audio uh i think that this guy kali uh kali hogan do you think that the success of this guy is because how he looks the percentage is because of the setup or the programs he made um i think it's how he makes his videos and tells his stories yes yes because his videos are like really good uh brolls right yeah so like for example what's the when you watch his working on a project right he'll be like okay today we're gonna do a build on something he's not necessarily going to a full tutorial where you can watch it and you just get exactly how to do it it's more like storytelling so it's like he's one part of his day then he cuts to like some of it built then he gives you a little this is where i'm at so you can kind of sit back and watch it like a movie and at the end of those 20 or 30 minutes you feel like you built the app so that's the cool thing about it so if you want to model his thing that's what it's like it's more like telling a story and getting the other person to go on a journey with you okay thanks yes you got it um alex okay i thought alexandro do you have a question okay i thought you had a quote okay got it nice nice uh okay clara i just wanted to know what time is there a deadline tonight for when the um the assignment is due i think for the deadline of the assignment let's make it midnight tonight so right now where i'm at in california it's 1 19 p.m so let's make it you know whatever is that like 10 hours 11 hours left kind of so almost 11 hours so in 11 hours let's submit this awesome thank you okay great and again guys for the video make sure it's landscape so when i say landscape it means not a vertical video a horizontal video okay and if you want to make this video really cool you could have your computer or your youtube channel open actually that'll be really cool if you can have your youtube channel open up behind you with all your videos okay or just the name of your youtube channel if you don't have any videos so you could have that in the framing so like literally you know right behind you and you can be like toss you can be talking at the camera and then the camera's showing you and right behind you'll be showing your entire setup if that makes sense dope dope cool i have one more question go for it clara i don't know if if anybody can help me because i was trying to set up my youtube channel but apparently when i set up my youtube channel i didn't do a business or a brand account and um so i'm just trying to make my current youtube channel be um so they wanted me to make a whole new youtube channel and i already have subscribers on um i think you can keep it going honestly i don't think it's like that big of a deal if you don't have that many subscribers and you don't care just start a new one but if you've already started i wouldn't worry about it too much you should be fine okay yeah like there's there's not much that you get out of it that's crazy like i think the only thing that you get out of it is maybe you can add in other people who can manage your youtube channel so like you know if you want to add in an editor but you don't want to give them access to your password something small like that so so there's not much crazy benefits you're going to get out of it you'll still have your analytics you'll still be able to monetize it you'll still be able to do everything that pretty much anybody can do it's just that when i wanted to change my name um it still wanted a first and a last name and it's like i had a different idea for a name got it and i can't change it do you i mean can you is it is it too um how far are you into your channel let's just say how many videos do you have how many subscribers you i don't i just started you guys you inspired me so i haven't even made my first one but i'm going to okay so maybe maybe now it might be just a good time to start a new one then if you want to just start it and name it a certain way and you want all that access just go for it i did do that so okay beautiful beautiful awesome thank you yep you got it um who was the person we're talking about okay cool my power went out due to weather okay all good hopefully you're back what's happening somebody's saying oh okay yeah congrats got it okay awesome so if you guys want now we can start the youtube rose and um hey let's go drop in your channels i'll try to start going in order and then let me know what type of roast you're looking for so are you looking for a medium roast uh dark roast light roast or a decaf all right here we go melissa what type of rose you looking for melissa i can't hear you deep fried deep fried holy [ __ ] um i remember this was your idea not mine completely but okay got it but the execution of it is looking a little funny let's go do it hey guys welcome to my channel i want to talk to you about sleep or i love your energy the thumbnail is awful i want you to work on your [ __ ] thumbnail okay if your thumbnail is good your video is going to get a lot of views so look at more sleepy videos okay so let's type in sleep uh if i type in something with sleep i'm gonna see thumbnails um these are pretty weird [ __ ] thumbnails too but that's fine but you can't go wrong with this funny ones but because i'm injured it was hard to make them happen so hold on what is your video sleep disturbed so what are you trying to say what maybe let's come up with a better idea for the video the better title so you're what's your main idea in the video are you basically um yeah introducing the idea of my guy friends reading bedtime stories okay cool that usually is not gonna do well as a video because i think it's a great video because you made it so that's good you should give yourself props but it's not like nobody's going to watch it or care or have any idea or context as to what's happening so generally videos like that won't really do that well until of course you have a big subscriber base that starts to care then they'll care um is there any other is there like a valuable idea that if somebody watches it they get value out of it well if you scroll to the middle of the video you actually will hear the beginning of one of the stories uh you literally will see it switch to just a still shot okay so then you can actually hear my friend's voice she woke suddenly again was she dreaming was he actually here so i'm just introducing okay one of my guys all right got it that's really good tell your guy to stop recording on a [ __ ] wooden potato tell him to get a good 70 right now so the poor guy can afford a yeti so he can get a yeti he'll be good to go that's all he needs is he actually here he has a great voice but if i can if it can you know it again makes a big difference right so keep listening to my voice keep listening to my voice keep listening to my voice keep listening to my voice keep listening to my voice sounds much worse right now right just kidding hold on hold on hold on hold on i tricked i tricked all of you that was just to [ __ ] see if you guys are paying attention all right sounds much worse now right yes yes so keep listening to it keep listening to it and here we go it sounds so much better now right so same thing audio is so important if you're telling me bedtime stories you better be telling it to me in good audio quality otherwise it's hard for me to pay attention so yeah let's look up titles on bedtime stories specifically that's what nas says so let's take a look at bedtime stories all right here we go for adults because you're going to get a million kid once that time sorry for the whole are there are there other p there's actually sleep cove is not doing bad sleep cove is doing pretty good six months ago 172 thousand views man i might watch this i mean i might like have you always wanted to learn to code oh please do not listen to any sleep recording whilst driving or operating is so good guys i actually want to listen to it let's listen to this heavy machinery please listen in a place where my marriage had drifted us away from each other it's depressing as [ __ ] i am completely make you go to sleep my marriage has drifted away from each other centered interest so right that's that's the one we're looking at someone we're looking at i'm getting naused by nas um nas has this like crazy ability where he will take your idea say it louder than you and everybody will laugh at his joke not laugh at yours even though you've said the same [ __ ] thing so i call it getting naused um so here let me go to most popular stuff this is your channel this is the channel you gotta follow okay this is the channel that survived that didn't get errors in the back and died on the you know it's like uh it's like the when you're pioneering or like finding new land and they're a bunch of dead people this is the channel that's not dead this is the person who like actually found you know that secret land and made it um so i would model this channel okay yeah um maybe the thumbnails honestly can be even better but it's okay i think if it's working it's working that's great these are great views for a sleeping channel and you know telling stories they're doing a great job so i would few things i think you will win on ticktock and instagram reels and i think you can win on youtube so if they can make those videos all you need is simple broll i like the broll that these guys have oh it's actually literally the same video they use for every video you're noticing that yeah it's like yeah he got like one license and he's using that yeah yeah yeah [Laughter] this feels like uh that game memory tiles you know where you like match the [Laughter] match which two match i'm winning i'm winning with 100 accuracy so this is a good one to model make your title something like this thumbnails look like this and then with the voiceover i think that will do well okay model it closely better mic and yeah i think that will be good okay yep dope okay cool great job melissa thank you everybody give it up for melissa nice work nice job nice work okay victor you're raising your hands do you want to go it's just for just for the for the roast yeah okay drop your link let's go and what type of roast are you looking for as dark as possible all right cool let's go bro um all right here we go so when i looked at your video yesterday something was funny about it it was pretty good but let me actually which one did you send me yesterday was it one of these uh excessive thinking yes uh with the drawing with the drawing oh okay the third one yeah this one there's something about the is it shot in a normal aspect ratio like it looks i was using my tablet and i i was the ratio was uh was weird but i corrected that for for the next ones yeah yeah so stay away from these ratios i think youtube really [ __ ] freaks out when it has like weird ratios like those videos it tries to kill for some reason just like on instagram if you go landscape on a picture it [ __ ] dies it never does well but if you go square on instagram it always wins so on youtube make sure that the format is right because otherwise youtube will freak out and i think people also like when i first saw it i'm like what is this what the [ __ ] am i watching get me out of here in this video i'm gonna show you mike how existed mike really important so you hear that hum that noise in the background right that makes me want to also run away so make sure that your mic and that hum is not there again i know you're shooting it with the tablet um or i know you can afford a yeti right so try actually i have my my i use my yeti mic actually i don't know what happened for this video you might have the gain really high then oh i see that's it in this video i'm gonna show you how you can become more peaceful okay um also one thing i want to make sure that's happening is you i like that it's dark outside so that's good but it almost looks like you're kind of not in focus it looks like a little blurry i think that's just because it's yeah it's eye patches yeah yeah yeah happy and smarter than ever and the concept i want to introduce to you today is a concept of presence so what is presence so let's dive in so we have this timeline let me use some blue so we have all those points here on the left music i would go down a little bit it's like too competing with your voice so like where the music starts to go really high i'll i'll i would pull that down because right now it's way louder than your actual voice and on the right so bots have really is this uh in everything you do okay so overall i think a great idea a great type of video i know what type of market you're in i think you're gonna do really well i mean frankie was looking at it too he thought it was real it was really cool and it's a really cool idea to draw this type of stuff out let me look at this in this video i'm gonna show you the secret nice this is like that default music that comes with like final cut pro i love it insanely productive again music a little bit lower because you're speaking the secret you're yeti i think so a few things yeti is not a mic you point to yourself so don't point it to yourself yeti is like a cardioid mic so you want to make sure it's straight up and you are really close to it because it's not picking up the audio from here it's actually picking up the audio from here see what i'm saying okay so you actually want to keep it straight up straight up not pointing to you straight up and go close to it and talk also i would reduce the gain to almost zero because it's still a lot of gain threat is this so the number one okay insanely productive the secret is this so the number one tool for being productive is deadlines we all have experience this magical night before an exam you know suddenly before and more and if you add all the little bug in in the us so the it moves too slow in the start so move it way fast like okay this i really like that you have this human life this human life calendar looks freaking awesome and it's really cool to visualize this over here i would move i would make the video more like it hooks you in the start so maybe a little bit more faster paced maybe the music a little bit lower so i can hear you better and then whatever you want to hit me with give me a much stronger hook because that really really works so like for you i would say like study some of videos from andrew kirby have you ever watched anything from andrew kirby uh nope okay so uh do you watch any alex becker uh not really okay cool so here is andrew kirby right so like let's say i spent 50 000 on fake gurus here's what i learned right all right over the past couple of years i've spent fifty thousand dollars on internet gurus i've bought a fifty dollar course an eighty dollar course a nine hundred ninety seven dollar course a fifteen hundred dollar course at two thousand five 500 course a couple around the 10 000 mark and finally a 25 000 course and i know what you're thinking this sounds absolutely crazy but hear me out let me explain this is what i've learned so it all started a few years ago that's a fantastic intro and hook right yeah it's so good that is so good that is what you guys want your interest be like i mean that is phenomenal if you can have your intro like this you're gonna crush so like if you even for this video i almost imagine like dramatic music um like i have an example of one where i have some dramatic music going um it's my it's my ad which i think you guys have seen i don't actually if you've seen it or not biggest opportunity or developers clever programmer so like here's how the hook of this one is what the heck is up with all these coding channels on youtube we've got clever programmer jomatech tech lead free code cam code drip traversing media corey shaffer and the list just goes on i believe what we discovered is so you see what i'm saying how it hooks you right in the start so like your videos for you i would have something along the lines of like i would make it a little bit more dramatic maybe in the start and i would have the concept of human calendar come up just a little bit even if you don't fully get into it you can have it come up a little bit because i think that's like a really good angle and i i pay attention to them oh [ __ ] like my whole life is being visualized on the screen right here and then you can get into your video from there so you can talk about like what you're going to cover in this video and then you can get to it other than that brother i think your channel has a lot of potential i think this has actually it's a it's a it's a very messy you see uh there's mathematical proofs and uh and stuff like that so oh [ __ ] i like like a personal development data science and uh and trading yeah so i put a bit of everything uh in that in that so yeah yeah for now i'm trying to combine uh finance trading with personal development for example my latest uh video that i just uploaded like during this call welcome in this video i'm gonna show you how traders manage the risk and how it can be applied to your own life even though you're not in finance so the stuff that will make you improve these and i get it it's okay i think sometimes you can go in different directions and your videos can still bang if they're good uh the only thing i'll recommend is making sure in the start at the very least you can add broll or you can add images coming up on the screen even that's another good hack you can do so if you're talking about traders maybe like a broll of somebody doing day trading can come up or an image of somebody doing day trading can come up those are also really good i said okay i don't think it's too much of a problem even if you're going in a little bit different directions i think it's better if you stick to one thing if you can um it's like now i'm combining like uh trading and personal development so it's like uh yeah i start explaining the the concepts in finance but in the end i'm like uh talking about ecartolio stuff like that you know oh [ __ ] i love it so [ __ ] nuts but i love it you have a so here's what i would say make sure you're picking titles that have potential to be found these these ideas don't have the potential to be found so they're like really good if i'm already um kind of on your channel i might find it otherwise i don't think it might come up so try to also pick some titles where you can really be found so for example examples of titles where you can really be found is like i tried day trading for 30 days here's what happened i tried being insanely productive for 30 days here's what happened so some of those you'll see those um i tried 30 days there's like this whole trend with this [ __ ] that works like alicia was here yesterday and he had a video that blew up with this type of [ __ ] so you can do that type of stuff you can you can study andrew kirby and sam evans and alex becker they're very simple i'm here brother i'm here oh okay beautiful um you can study you can study alex becker and andrew kirby and sam evans they're very cerebral and analytical people just like you and they're also kind of do talking about stuff like that you're talking about i think that can help you blow up if you try to model them okay oh cool cool yeah thanks was the advice all right brother you got it thank you yo man we got into that one nice uh let's go with i'm gonna go with kelvin let's go with kelvin all right all right and guys let's give it up for who was here i forgot who did we just do right now victor all right guys let's give it up for victor hey all right cool how to host a website for free under five minutes holy [ __ ] bro i just saw the intro and that looks good so thumbnail is good there's something slightly weird about it i don't know it's good it's not sick um i think maybe two fonts maybe too much text maybe no logos of something that you're talking about a little font and the background uh i think i don't know there's something about it i would need to play with it a little bit but other than that it's decent okay it's a decent decent thumbnail decent start let me click on it hey there guys my name is kelvin welcome to negro tech today i'm going to show you how to host your basic [ __ ] junior dev website audio is too low i would increase the audio so like that part is bad so in increase your audio up uh yeah i just was just a test just to see how i can you know talk in front of the camera got it i'll get all the all the devices the camera the yeti mic i'll also get this got it got it got it okay in just five minutes you know what say less wrote the intro hey that's [ __ ] clean um i'm signing off oh my god all right all right so here's what i would say okay energy is amazing your smile is amazing so keep your face in front of the [ __ ] camera always so i love that i actually even like how you what your background is there's a lot of cool texture so it kind of pops you out i love how you roll the intro man that's really cool like you put that little cap on the camera roll the intro here here's what i'll tell you when i want the intro to be over okay so i'll tell you exactly when i want it to be over let's get back into the video here like right there get back in the video so like probably just a few seconds even here okay cool if you get back into the video right about now i can still [ __ ] with it but then now it's already getting too long definitely too long now and then it keeps getting longer and longer so i would keep the intro shorter okay the shorter intros are like what's super hot right now it's like a really clean way to do it look at casey neistat right his intros are like one second long logan paul's vlogs their intro is like one second long when they pop up cool also when the video starts make sure it starts right away so like at 33 seconds when the camera so first of all it shouldn't go to black for a few seconds and then it's like quiet it should cut from here to right where you're speaking and we're back guys because i honestly just started at this thing with adobe premiere today like this video was done about like two hours ago or three hours ago yes everything so i'll work more on that and got it you you wanted a medium rose right yeah yeah so that's why you're getting this because because my honest to god truth is the only thing i want to do is actually give you props like for your first [ __ ] video this is incredible bro sometimes i hate it but when you guys want a medium or a darker roast i kind of have to like say the shitty parts because i don't want to leave you with the shitty parts but if you wanted a medium roast i gotta give you the shitty parts so that's the only reason other than that dude you killed it with this video this is a phenomenal first video phenomenal thumbnail just start doing more okay uh improvements for you mic some of that stuff i know you already got it but like turn your audio up a lot higher other than that phenomenal video thanks so much for jumping on let's give it up guys thank you great job kelvin that was awesome thank you hey nice all right let's go with okay uh i want to see if there are people who i haven't we haven't done much yet see okay all right let's go with aldo hey i'm here all right so medium got it you sent me two videos which one you want me to look at oh i mean you want me to probably look at not the spanish one got it if you want to improve your skills in school or programming the ipad and the surface are really good tools to do that but which one has the best experience let's find out number one wake up speed because i need to study now yeah okay so great video as in great framing uh your energy is looking really great a few things i would improve maybe actually have something on the screens that makes it really visually appealing another thing i would recommend is when you sit closer it's actually a lot better but when you go far away it's not really that great so let me go here so like right now you're blended into the background you see how like you got this prop you got this prop you got this prop you got this prop and it almost seems like you're a prop too because you're like sitting with the things see what i'm saying yes in order to pop out right like look at this framing and then i want you to look at this framing so i want you to take a look at this framing right here how to get your do you see that i'm popping out yes okay so what's the difference between this framing and this framing it makes a big difference right you can see there's a big difference but what is it why am i popping out and you're not popping out because you are maybe the focus yes and i'm very [ __ ] close to the camera yeah too close i'm like really close right and then i still can see the technology that you're using exactly so that stuff is in the background so i would recommend being closer to the camera so when you actually come and the surface are really good tools to do that but which one has the best experience let's find out number one wake up speed click on the ice so this when you come closer it actually starts to look better so i would put you closer um of course there's the equipment right are you gonna get better equipment yes well i have right now the c920s pro so scene so c9 i don't know how to use it so c920 the logitech camera it's really good for screencast tutorials where your screen is really small like when your screen is this small in the top right or top left or whatever right bottom right corner but if you're shooting c920 to do this full screen video it's gonna not look that great okay so like if you can afford it i would highly recommend investing into an actual camera okay yeah i will look forward to for your next videos and tutorials about the equipment okay in the next training i'll have all the equipment ready for you okay please okay yep you got it so i would have that for your audio you're using your computer's audio right the the c9020 mic yeah so that's why it doesn't sound good because it's an ipad it's all right and now look at the difference here's the here's the thing it makes such a [ __ ] crazy difference you're talking saying important stuff but now listen to this how to get your first 1 000 subscribers do you guys feel the difference yeah yeah of course it's [ __ ] crazy well what where it was located there the mic in your shot in your foot okay i i cheated on this one so here's actually what i did for this one i um i shot it with the cameras mic right i shot it with the cameras mic but then i realized that that camera camera's mic is like garbage it's not that good it's like the the audio quality isn't that great so then i actually sat down on my actual mic and did a dub like i dubbed it wow that's a lot of work how yeah but but it's just for one thing how to get your first 1000 subscribers that's it so it's just okay yeah so it's like how to get your first 1 000 subscribers let's talk about it right if you really pay attention you can't see it now yeah you cannot see it now right how to get your first one it's like if you like look at my face i know it's off a little bit yeah it's off a little bit so you'll see it if i tell you but if i don't tell you you won't notice it and on a phone you're very unlikely to notice it if you're watching it i notice it because i'm watching it right now on a 60inch tv you know how and i know about it to get your first but who is there when it's 1 000 you see how even though i'm not saying the craziest things on the planet my video really pops out and makes you want to watch it yeah yeah because of the energy is projected yes so if you are if you even have better equipment where your audio quality is just solid and if you're popping out more visually in the frame just few of those things can help you like win and crush it okay sometimes oh things yes exactly so sometimes it doesn't require you like it doesn't really require too many crazy things just few of those things can make you pop and you can have the same type of feel that my video has yes yes i can see it now thanks thanks a lot yeah this is my pressing a button thing windows and also think about wake up time speed no number two take notes and bring your ideas to life fast i like your energy you have really good energy what i would say is just push there's you're again like similar to frank ramos you have good energy i know you got it there's just something on camera that you're holding back give more of that okay so the same thing that like at your corporate job they're [ __ ] sucking your soul it's completely okay to just let that part out on the video like where in your corporate job you might have to hold that like few percent of you back on this video let a few percent of that out a little bit more because i can tell your energy is really great i just want a little bit more okay okay i got it you got it awesome maybe and if you um and pick up some kind of software to edit so right now i think you just shot it and then you uploaded it which is cool but i think if you can find uh final cut pro or you can even use a software like video leap on your phone you can shoot the video and make it more fun okay like you can edit it and take out the uh what's up i use imovie okay so yeah you can cut the pauses in there yeah okay faster yeah yeah like make it a little bit faster so like for example uh say i take something right so like you can take still talking shots and make them like pretty interesting so let me take something that i have let's see if i have some kind of footage in here that's useful so is it this not this okay i'm trying to find a still of like a shot where i'm kind of just like talking for a second so like let's oh that's really hard for me to change being in bed and like doing great things what's easy to do so let's take this one right this one looks like a pretty um regular not very exciting clip of me would you guys agree just like me kind of talking yeah yeah yeah sure so let's just click this and we'll just say um white yt day five and i'm gonna throw this in there so we're gonna watch this good morning you guys that's when i text my girlfriend i was like hey i'm gonna be lazy i'm gonna watch shit's creek i'm gonna eat food in bed i'm gonna like just do everything in bed like watch shows and just relax and take a day off but i realized wow it's kind of right like out of a 1 out of a 10 what would you guys give this like this is probably like four kind of in terms of watching it it's kind of like yeah right you guys feel that yeah kind of it's just like me talking not the craziest energy doesn't really so now watch what happens so this is shit's creek wow that's really hard for me to change being in bed and like doing great things what's easy to do is by changing my location going out somewhere i'm gonna be going to bricks and scones and there i always feel great so i'm much more likely to do great things there here are the nonnegotiables that i gotta do one i check the sales and the ads two edit the vlog three workout or shower yeah other than that i can relax all right so by something simple i can give you guys even if you have a talking shot like you just talking at the camera if you add in simple things like punch in and punch out so you guys see how like this is a little bit more punched punched in and zoomed in and then this is like zoomed out yes yes i can see that right you can actually do that when you're editing like i can for example take this thing hit this button and just like zoom it in a little bit and now this entire shot is going to be like you're going to break some scones see what i'm saying is life what's up movement it creates life yes you are using a steel shot it's like boring but the same shot with movement yeah it gives some more life exactly so you can add more life simply by like for example if you're talking and there's images popping up that gives it more life if you have text if the if it's changing as in it's like punching and punching out it gives it more life so for your video i would say something similar like add a little bit more context like whether images or text popping up about what you're saying a great place to start is simply images popping up as what you're talking about then the second great place is cut all the garbage out there's going to be a ton of like random [ __ ] that you're saying cut that out and once you cut that out then it's really really good oh okay i used a teleprompter so i was kind of uh keep track of the time because got it that i used got it okay all right that's fine i mean i recommend make sure you're doing it in a way where your energy you can give your energy so like yeah if you can maybe do bullet points but then like speak on it but that's okay if you're using a teleprompter other than that great job okay let's give it up for all though guys nice work hey awesome love it love it love it okay every time i say love it love it i love it i always have to say gordon love it i don't know why um okay who is next wait melissa uhhuh okay i love it some people it's like they're 4am and they're still watching it that's so cool okay who didn't i not go over yet zach allison okay let's do hold on gabi says gobby is for before that i would love a dark roast on this video because for me it's my best video invest time work and knowledge but it's but is it not okay cool got it it's not the best video on quality but she spent a lot of time and energy on it god let's take a look a you will crush so much if the only thing you invested in gabi was a [ __ ] like awesome mic you will crush so much you have great energy you get this youtube game you get the title i i i can tell you you got the ring light that looks great if your audio because there's so much noise like i can hear the traffic or the cars i don't know what's out there but there's so much hum and noise in the background if that could go away and i could if your voice could pop this would already be such a great video right you hear all that gobby yes i told you it's not the best quality i don't have a mic yes it's just my cell phone okay got it got it when the stand what i love about technical videos is you can barely ever go wrong like with technical videos all you have to do is do a great job of explaining and you don't have to make it a fancy video you don't have to make it like anything special the only thing is what's up with all this space that's not being used here like why is it not full screen like there's tons of space not being used okay yeah export 1920 by 1080 okay so then the whole screen will be shared other than that my my only thing that will make this video great like i said is a better like you know you know this too you're already going to do it just better quality i think we'll make it really good when it comes to you're using windows or mac i'm using mac mac okay usually this how are you doing you're using loom yes i'm listening alone cool and what quality is it recording in it's the freelance i i don't have the chance to to choose so either use loom or use screenflow if you want to do a lot of these technical trainings i would highly recommend using screenflow loom will [ __ ] you up at some point um it's going to be a really frustrating experience you're gonna be 44 minutes into a really really technically difficult video and it's gonna crash on you and it's gonna [ __ ] suck so yes yes i know so stick with screenflow you can edit in it and it is amazing export in 1920 by 1080 record in as high of a quality as you can um you know preferably whatever the resolution of your laptop is so recording good quality for the screencast and audio just make it good other than that the only other things you can do is cut pauses and stuff like that out where you're pausing for too much so then you can keep the pace of it moving really fast but great video okay one of my best quality videos can you go to my channel sure second so great intro i like it i still hear a lot of humming which again is not the end of the world but i think if you mic uh actual mic like a yeti will work better okay it would help if i actually understood what you were saying let's get started yeah i can still hear like the dudes going on the bike or whatever um so that makes it harder to pay attention to what you're saying okay and uh what i really want to give you feedback on is your is title and your thumbnail uh frankie you know how to read what's going on here so what's muertos doesn't that mean death frankie what does this title say c that does i understand okay what does this say it's something about the terror the terror of the history of finance or what is it or like antifraud tips a terror history about finance and that's that guy's that buy are there popular titles around this type of stuff the last part um so okay so stick to titles that are already banging and stick with more of them that's one big thing i would recommend other than that i think if you just keep going your energy is great you're giving value like i love when people get into the technical [ __ ] like right now right i can't go wrong giving you guys value because i'm like getting into it like i'm screen sharing i'm like technically giving precise information so i can't go wrong my channel is just gonna grow if i do nothing else but this same thing with a lot of you guys who are doing technical stuff you're in a really good place so great work thumbnails i would just again i wish i could read it i could probably give you better advice but um keep going in invest in solid audio quality and then you're you're going to be really good gabi cassie what what is that percentage um can you oh i'm using a a vid iq for that so vid iq shows me the like to dislike percentage so for example this video has 100 likes this has 90 likes oh perfect that's awesome thank you that's also on the side you know i have socialblade and that tells me you know how this video did in the last 30 days what's your average subscribers blah blah blah all that stuff okay oh oh yeah so um frankie can you add social blade to the slides with the monitor because i want to talk about that because that's like the greatest thing you guys can actually use so let me show you guys why we're zoom did the call end what the how come where where is zoom no but like look oh i have to hit okay i couldn't see it i couldn't see it all right all right that was a dumb moment on my part all right i couldn't i couldn't see where to hit stop sure what's up with this new chrome update does it is it just me or is it crashing for everybody it's everywhere all the time like it's kind of nuts how much is crashing now all right so socialblade is a great place to go it's probably one of my favorite resources that shows me like how how to get your first whoops oh damn this video is at 800 views if you want to improve yourself so gabi's channel if i go to if i go to her channel it's so annoying like all right gobby okay that's the name of it all right so let's go here and type that in abby there we go all right so on here it's a really good platform it's completely free type in whoever you're looking for click on them and this tells you like how what's going on and then just click see full monthly statistics most channels it won't show if your channel isn't like at least has some views or subscribers behind it like it might not even show it but if you have some views and subscribers they'll show your looks like for example redian is going to show his channel alicia is going to show your channel and it's really good to see how many daily average subscribers you're getting what's your weekly average how this this channel is doing overall i just started my personal brand channel 11 uploads so like if i go here it's not doing too bad 118 subscribers 14 subscribers 5 34 27 59 62 9 5 10. so the real number probably is 9 5 10 because i think all these other days i was promoting it you know so i think that's why i got more but the 9510 that's probably like the real number so i want these like low numbers to improve and as long as they're improving then this channel is going to like start going fast okay gabi was that helpful super helpful thank you very much beautiful all right you got it all right guys give it up for gabi thank you so much for jumping on appreciate you that was amazing all righty let's go with zach elson zach all right let's go with you brother this is your second video yep okay i cannot see what that text is at all i know i need to fix that i uh finish that at four in the morning so i haven't i'll go back and recreate that thumbnail and pop that text out okay great so other than that much i like this thumbnail quite a bit this is pretty cool good job on learning the cutting out that's kind of that's really cool good job hello and welcome welcome to view it you no bro no it's not the right story bro you may have recently moved to ubuntu 2004 no bro what is happening your first video is way better part of it is my webcam is not on my linux box so i have no um camera no no this is not a webcam problem whatever and um you guys stay away from really crazy random fancy stuff that comes um built in like those templates cause like if you want to add graphics keep it minimalistic generally you won't go wrong with like minimalistic stuff just black screen it's kind of insane but like just a black screen with white text usually works wonders if you want to have that in but like stay away from this because this is like some 19 freaking like this video feels like it's like 1970s video actually maybe there weren't computers back then but like it feels like one of those older ones anaconda first go up here and launch your um web browser and just type in anaconda python go to the individual edition anaconda if you click on download you're you're very well spoken so that's really good take you to the bottom of the page i like that it's kind of it's in 60 frame rates per second so it looks pretty smooth and creamy you can click and the installer already downloaded it mike reduced the gain so it's um so it's the audio just keep the mic up close so the audio is clear i would definitely edit out these parts man like you're it's just kind of like you're scrolling around and like installing it to your home directory so it seems like at 2 47 right you kind of stopped speaking i think that's where i had done a um a mess up so i had cut it out and re recorded that piece so you have to cut that part out i gotta cut out a little bit more yes so like notice it's three minutes in three two three three e4 now this is gonna so like literally for 40 or 50 seconds you're not saying anything so that's a big problem i gotta go i gotta edit it a little bit more i'm sure yes yes so if you're not gonna have if you're not gonna bring your a game and just come in with [ __ ] great energy then start cutting like i want you to think about yourself like that crazy [ __ ] chef that has like that cuts those onions into thousands of pieces like then that's the type of chef i want you to be like go in that [ __ ] cutting lab and start cutting it up and put it if you're not gonna put in work while you're supposed to be working then put a lot of work in editing like a lot of work so this is how i say if you're gonna just over deliver and commit and just bring your crazy energy that video is gonna be by default so good you're gonna not need to edit it too much if you're gonna hold it back and keep it more reserved in the tank get ready to edit like [ __ ] crazy but that's okay because it is a good skill to pick up so bro i think honestly your first video you were really on the right track like your intro looks good [ __ ] looks modern you're using slides the design looks clean and minimalistic i mean even though you're tiny you're still there um the second video i feel like got much worse in terms of like the prep like the design of it and stuff like that so i would go more the route of your first one uh and on the title probably not anaconda install like i would probably pick a title that's more popular so along the lines of how to install anaconda or something like that gotcha cool yep okay other than that with this technical stuff as long as you keep making content you're going to win thank you okay great job love it all right awesome so everybody give it up for zach thank you for coming on brother appreciate it awesome let's see who is going to go next so let's go garveet i'll go with you and uh what type of roast are you looking for hey guys my name is garwith mothwani and i welcome what is happening hey gravit are you there he's not there um okay so that's definitely not what i want to start a html for beginners tutorial from hey guys my name is mothwani and i welcome you to don't do this the first few seconds are really important so if you're going to use a slideshow at least put an image room and i'm starting this new series at least should have had the html in the store for hyper text markup language something called tag the closing title see you in the next lecture all right so great you're teaching them something that's good i like it your thumbnail is actually pretty good um yeah i would try to make like not one minute long videos i try to make them more valuable like if it was a 30 minute video and you actually trained something then that's great and if you can what i'd recommend is making like 15 like tutorial go all the way until tutorial number 15 or tutorial number 23 and then finally just do a compilation of all the tutorials that one video is going to outperform all of these like 23 videos the compilations do the best we should compile my python tutorial my old one yeah it's great it's actually phenomenal so we should compile that one awesome cool all right we went with victor we went with zach we went with garveet who else we went with kelvin all righty all right all right all right samir samir wanna did i miss anybody it's a mirror all right samir are you on here yes uh can we spotlight him please oh there we go samir i see you okay let's spawn light in please and let's go all right so let's go here one thing i'd recommend i like the route you're going i get it flexbox froggy uh we've done these two but probably like maybe put something coding related or css related in the thumbnail because we tried just going the frog route and it generally is not a good idea because it doesn't get that many views um on it so okay but let's go okay what's up yeah but that's really good that's one hour long so maybe you have some value in here learn css properties by playing flexbox froggie okay what i did is i played the whole 24 levels and all together i compiled that video yeah that's what i did too um okay so today we are going to talk about so definitely in the start not the time to don't do that in the start do that before the video starts okay and take that welcome stuff out too it's just it wastes time hey guys um so today we are going to talk about flexbox froggy as you can see in the video uh so i am samir good music choice i like your music i'll be your host and i'll be talking about the flexbox froggie uh so basically it is it's a game okay it's a game uh where you can when you help frogging friends but i think this is good so we have to guide this floor to its lily lily pad okay cool um music a little bit down your audio a little bit up so i can hear you clearly okay okay other than that just personally for you samir i want you to work on hold on a few important things okay i want you to get used to looking at the camera more i want you to use your face more okay so i want you to like use the camera to practice like your fa range of facial expressions okay so for me samir i want you to smile for me okay smile like smile beautiful look at how great that [ __ ] smile is okay so when you're speaking on the camera make eye contact so are you making eye contact right now are you looking at the camera yeah beautiful so i want you to do more of that i want you to smile more when you speak on there okay so so say something like let's do the intro okay so today you're gonna learn about css whatever today you're gonna learn about flexbox froggie so give me an intro look at the camera and go today we're gonna learn about flexbox froggy okay so today we are going to talk about the effects of flexbox froggy and let's get into the video let's do that again the first line okay so great work let's do that one more time so today we're gonna learn about flexbox froggy so today we are going to talk about flex of flexbox froggy and let's don't say anything else after that don't say anything else after the flexbox froggy okay so let's talk about like flexbox froggy today don't say anything after the flexbox froggy okay so don't say today just practice this today let's talk about flexbox froggy today let's talk about flexbox froggy done yeah okay that's the time the intro comes in you want to end your words with impact you see how even when i say impact and when i stop it has more impact now imagine if i said so you should have impact and then so and then yeah impact right so let's try that again today we're going to talk about flexbox froggy so today we're going to talk about flexbox froggy great now the second thing i want you to do okay we're gonna increase your voice so it's called projection right now you're talking this is the level you're talking at right now today we're gonna talk about flexbox froggy okay today we're to talk about 1 30 in the morning everyone's sleeping so after peace okay are they close by are they going to be able to hear you yeah in the next room okay when are you recording these tutorials at night you gotta [ __ ] stop recording them at night so you don't have to whisper okay so uh try to record these tutorials at a time where people aren't sleeping right next to you okay okay okay now so projection is gonna be important right now we can't practice projection i would love to practice it with you but projection is an important part of the game your voice is a [ __ ] gift if you learn to use it the right way it makes people pay attention to you it makes people listen to you you stand out from the group of friends when you meet a potential employer they remember you over so many other people there's a there's a lot of power to it so learn to develop and use it the right way if i speak like this hey guys so today we're going to have a little bit more we're going to have impact so we can have an impact we're going to learn about flexbox froggy and then i think um and then i think um i think the next thing we're gonna talk about is uh youtube you see how it's actually difficult to pay attention to me yes yes make sense like you can feel that i'm like torn between words and i'm confused so when you do this you gotta comment [ __ ] 100 like you're just going at it and second just projection smile camera use your range of emotions really really helpful again okay um definitely it seems almost like it's crazy but what seems crazy maybe in real life is actually really comes off really amazing to other people and on camera okay okay so the best thing i can tell you is like keep making videos and keep looking at yourself don't look at yourself by judging or hating just go okay here i'm doing this thing i need to improve it here i'm doing this other thing i need to improve that other than that you're good to go thanks thanks thanks other than that great job okay thanks cool love that smile keep smiling and guys let's give samir a big round of applause awesome job buddy beautiful okay all right who else do we got we got uh z sean let's go z sean where is z sean z shawn are you still on here okay misha misha are you on here okay cool let's you want to take a look at your video yeah all right brother let's go ahead and do that nice i like that you got the download one cool instagram logo i like that you took feedback so when i'm gonna be grading you guys in the challenge on who's gonna win where you guys rank that's an important part for me to see how you're taking feedback so last time i told misha hey put thumbnails here put text somewhere he's doing that he's got the text here he's got the images now here if uh before it was like too crazy you also removed hyper developer great job again you don't need it bro you can get rid of it it's not gonna [ __ ] change the world it's not super important to brand yourself your brand is your content so remove this stuff this watermarking stuff there's no need for it okay other than that let's see download instagram videos for free cool so let's so i think this is this is pretty good try to not put so much text on your thumbnail like your thumbnail isn't supposed to be exactly your title so try to look at thumbnails that are cleaner that are similar to what you're trying to get across okay so go with cleaner thumbnails with less text okay what's up guys your boy michael from happening i love your intros your personality is really great i look i like how you just look at the camera and talk you got the little music going today i'm going to show you how to download a high quality great job that something came up nice good if you stick to the end of this video to show you how to download this and if you stick to the end of this video holy [ __ ] what what just happened there on instagram and if you stick to the end of this video that's that's weird you don't i don't you don't need to do that you cut somewhere you can just do a hard cut the hard cut will actually look better than adding a transition that fades to black and then it see what i'm saying misha so just do a hard cut between those how to download a very high desktop the url and then audio quality i would try to if you come to this website this is what is going to something funny is happening with the audio so i would nip that in the butt i would try to work on improving that audio quality what what what it looks like then it can download video but other than that i like that you're providing actual value to people that's great okay in this video i will show you how to download facebook videos and live streams into your mac or pc like here your audio could be better but it's not too bad come and click here that audio sounds better then copy the link this actually might be your best video so far bro you got the music in the back but it's so quiet like i can feel it but it's quiet i love that your audio what you want to do is you want to go in your editing software and increase your audio by by six decibels or 10 decibels like you want to ramp it up does that make sense yeah if you are in this website it will give you two of you can be able to add this it has it cut a lot of the silences out if you can yeah okay hi and if you can speak in and keep energy high keep energy high really really important i can't stress that enough for almost all of you guys keep your energy high guys it's a skill that you can train yourself in it's really trainable if you go back to my older videos my energy is really low as you get later later into the videos my energy is high it's a skill develop it keep your energy high all the good speakers that you guys look up to or hear they have a high energy and they can hold that for a longer period of time so i want you to practice that that means using your voice to project louder that means like keeping your body involved in what you're doing you know what you're saying because otherwise you'll lose my interest as i'm going through this tutorial set it to this website and if you want to say stuff to me feel free to also look at the camera and talk because that means like oh now you're talking to me that's cool you can enjoy it these are the two best websites i can suggest you to download i love i love your intros and outros are really good facebook videos if you find it helpful please smash the like button and subscribe thank you for watching see you in the next video hey dude really clean i like the music too nice work brother so what about the titles and stuff uh i think the title is cool like i don't know are is there a lot of like people looking this up download instagram video let's let's type that in let's see what i get so i would i mean model the people who are winning bro model this model this these are these people are winning so model the winners okay yeah so like if they're right there i mean you should be [ __ ] having the same exact type of thumbnails bro okay so i would model these guys who are like crushing it with that 475 000 views 10 months ago i mean geez so go with that and then also for the titles i would keep their titles more however they have them right keep it like this uh and so then because yeah right now there's something about your titles it feels weird like it feels almost like i don't know it feels like a scammy video or like you're trying you're creating spam like there's something about the title or title of your video that makes me feel weird and thumbnail because the thumbnail looks a little cheesy and there's too much text on it like i want to stay away from like if i saw it i would stay away from it i would not click it 100 i would click uh i would definitely click probably this one if i was trying to do it um or maybe this one okay um or this one like that's really cool so if you can make it a clean modern less cringy and like you know less so much text on the thumbnail then you're gonna be in the right area and then for your title look at these titles that are winning okay yeah okay thank you all right brother you got it awesome thanks for coming on and guys let's give misha a big round of applause thank you brother i appreciate you awesome all right i
