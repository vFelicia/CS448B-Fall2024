like all kinds of crazy there's some people talking about cooking there's some people talking about coding there's some people talking about like what i explained yesterday like literally there's a dude that sleeps for 10 hours a day and then records it just records him sleeping with like four fans on and his videos get like 10 million views all right and and if you think i'm like making this up like literally you can actually type in sleeping with fan sounds i saw this the other day and i couldn't fricking believe it 33 million views this is web flow that's an ad 33 million views like i feel like i have to start sleeping with the fan on [Laughter] so let's take a like literally guys this is sir like look at this it's of image like nas is getting angry in the back that he doesn't have a youtube channel that has this many views it's an image with just right so do you okay does any of you believe that you can make a video like this yes or no raise your hands if you believe you could you might be able to make a video like this with the image of a fan with the sound of a fan yes zach is saying yes yeah we have a lot of people saying yes okay so this is just to prove to you guys that if it's possible for this do you guys think it could be possible for you yes or no raise your hands if it's a yes beautiful everybody that's here i want you to play all out guys so if you're on this call right now put your cameras on that's step number one to being able to have a youtube channel one day thing number two you're here to play all out all right you're here to be committed all right so on the count of three i want you guys to say out loud i am committed to starting my youtube channel so give me one second not yet okay what i want you guys to say is i am committed to starting my youtube channel i want you to lose your voice when you said that okay so i'm gonna stay on the count of three and i'm gonna say go and then you guys are gonna say you guys got it got it

time all right let's do it better this time i am committed to starting my youtube channel let's go three two one go starting my youtube channel i'm gonna play a little round of applause for everybody that is here awesome guys so here's a few things that are important about like actually making a change so a few things right if we're interested in starting a youtube channel a few things one is we need to change our emotional energy and we need to get committed behind that thing number two is then we want to take that emotional energy and actually put it in motion by setting a plan a time more of the tactics does that make sense so yeah those are the things that are like uh important in making sure that your thing whatever you're dreaming about comes true so just a quick recap right on i'm gonna share my screen with you guys so you can see what i'm talking about a quick recap on the first few days the day one what we talked about the challenge give me one second let me make sure that this thing is on so i can draw for you guys oh wait guys does this keyboard work yeah it's working okay let's try again there we go so day one of the youtube challenge what we talked about is the opportunity that exists so i showed you guys you can have a picture of a fan and it can possibly get 33 million views so do you guys think that there exists an opportunity maybe for you that you could have your own youtube channel yes or no yes yes yeah great absolutely so hopefully we've overcome the challenge of the opportunity of a youtube channel uh chat uh challenge right thing number two we talked about you can how you can have your first 1000 subscribers so yesterday i started this thing where i was roasting your guys's youtube channels live that was a lot of fun uh who was here for that the roasting of the youtube channels were you guys here yesterday yes yeah nice what is olivia is olivia on this call no gabi i see you you're here i went over your channel too so we we started the series where it was like it's either going to be a light roast medium roast or a dark roast and you could drop your youtube chan channel and tell me what type of roast you want and if you wanted me to be nice you could say i want a decaf all right so if you guys want to do that today as well we can do that i think that would be a lot of fun okay do you guys want to do that at some point today yes okay awesome so we'll do it yes great it'll be great so on that we talked about how to break through your first 1000 subscribers but what's important is i want you guys to be able to believe that it's possible for you so i want to ask you guys do you believe that it's possible for you to break 1 000 subscribers yes or no yes yes yes okay you guys saw a video of a of a fan a picture of a fan with the sound of a fan for eight hours and it has 33 million views and he has 1 million subscribers so it's possible maybe for you to have over 1 000 subscribers yes yes okay yes that's really important because if we don't agree on step number one there's opportunity that exists or step number two you can have a first thousand subscribers we can't continue on to day three day four day five so with agreeing that that's possible now we come to the point of is it possible for you to be able to make your first one thousand dollars from youtube that's what we're going to talk about okay feedback feedback feedback a lot of feedback so one thing is keep your guys mic if you can if you have background noise especially please it would really help if you keep it muted if you have background noise and then when i'm asking questions just open your mic and then jump in cool guys it helps a lot by the way when you guys jump in and actually talk because right now when i'm if it's just me it just sounds like i'm a crazy dude just talking to myself but it's really exciting when you guys jump in and chat it seems like we're all sitting at a dinner table or we're just all sitting around like a fireside chat and having a chat so that's why the participation in that connection really helps plus i do believe that that level of participation will move you physiologically to then start your own cool so multiple benefits of it selfishly for me and then selfishly for you all right so for me i want to talk about what made it so i could actually make my first 1 thousand dollars on youtube i in the first so i'll show you guys there are different ways of making money with youtube can somebody list out i want you just list out one way you can make money from youtube so just open your mics and give me different ways you can make money but just give me one per person so go ahead sponsorships so somebody said sponsorships what other ways of making money are there from youtube selling merch ads selling merch right ads so youtube paying you what else monetization monetization great what else driving people to other social media okay driving people to other social media right affiliate links affiliate links great what other ways is there affiliate marketing affiliate marketing data donations what data donations donations okay cool selling coaching selling coaching great what other ways gathering data something with data okay got it freelance okay you can freelance what so basically maybe youtube might allow you to get opportunities to freelance cool anything else maybe like try merging or something uh okay email marketing that's a little can do like patreon and somebody's thing keeps saying trial version is that me or is that somebody else on the call trial version you guys hear that right the trial version um coming from alexandros or something like patreon okay so let's just mute where the voice the sound is coming from uh so you're if you want me to make you the host as well i can but i think we should be good with david and amanath okay all right so we just listed out wait host muted everyone what is happening okay cool so there are ten ways that we list it out are there any other ways you guys so we listed out ten are there any other ways patreon super chat patreon super chat okay great patreon is a different definitely away super chat yes donations people can pay you okay how about can you sell uh can you sell something that you know can you sell something like a course for example oh yeah definitely right that's possible yeah so if you have that 100 if you have a product maybe you have a service that you can sell right yeah if you show up if on your youtube you're talking people how you can make websites then maybe it's possible you can sell your freelancing time or your own like time to help somebody make websites yeah yeah cool so there are these are 13 or 14 different ways if somebody wants to write them out in chat you can uh so everybody can visually see it but there are 13 or 14 ways that we list it out so there there's no like limitation of how you can make money right from youtube there are a lot of different ways now i'll show you guys the real truth behind it okay how it actually works you guys want to see like the reality of what it looks like yeah yeah okay yes yes yes beautiful awesome i'll go i love the enthusiasm thank you guys i love it like that's like my god it's like i'm thirsty for like years and when i hear that it just gets me going i love it thank you all right so let's hit apply here right who here would like to spend ten months working their ass off and making twelve dollars me negative this is where it gets real tricky right this is where it gets tricky this is the part that everybody's like um i don't know you know i'm not sure about this but well not fulltime anyway right but who would like to make 98 000 just from youtube ads youtube paying you that's a good number that's gonna be me right bring it on exactly so i'll show you something right the 98 000 guys is made around here right 10 is made around here this is like the first 10 months almost and we're right right now we're just talking about one way of making money we're just talking about youtube paying you all right we're just talking about youtube paying you if you sold a product or a service which i highly highly highly highly recommend i don't even see youtube adds money as money i just see it as like oh this is just like just like random um so i only see the product and revenue as like the real thing so for example the first time i did a product launch like literally it at the end of december i didn't even know what the hell i was doing but i had a lot of people that i provided value for for some some amount of time and then at some point i asked for a sale i was like hey would you guys like to buy this thing and they're like yeah sure right so that's all marketing is like think about it even right now you guys are here if you're get if you're getting value from this from the last three days or even right now just let me know are you getting value from this yes or no yes right yes i'm learning a lot yes so yes if at some point i was like hey i think you should buy this would you at least consider it hey yes yeah right people are asking me what camera should i get and i'm like hey get this camera and people are buying that camera could i have made affiliate income from that yeah yeah yeah i could have made affiliate income from that right if i'm sending you guys to a specific software from final cut pro or use video leap you think i could make sponsorship income like they could pay me to send you guys to like do vid edit on a specific software definitely yes yes yes so so like i'm not telling you guys something that's just like random or a get rich quick thing right like this is requires hard work i had to develop my skills but if i can bring you value then at some point if i find a way to ask for a sale i might just get it right you guys get value i get value we keep the world moving forward make sense yeah yeah yeah so so this is the thing that um a lot of the stuff is a lot about mindset right like if you don't get past your ten dollar mark you'll never get to your 98 000 mark you'll never get to your beyond six figure mark you'll never get so this is the hardest part that i want you guys to take a look at and really really internalize because if you can really internalize this and this doesn't phase you and you actually start falling in love with it those are the people that are actually going to make a breakthrough and start something this is the part that you actually have to get through this is the hardest part but if you are like i'm not gonna go all in until i get so like let me show you something right let me show you guys want to see what happens a little bit after this like month of because this is we're looking at 2016 right so do you guys want to see what happens when i move it just a little bit over into 2017 just a little bit ahead of this sure right so if i go to 17 take a look at this and i'll i won't even go too far out i'll just go to the month of february um and we'll just go just a little bit farther out than november take a look at this okay you guys see the number of subscribers and now the revenue is getting into hey this is a good side hustle now but if you're not playing all out beforehand then it doesn't then it doesn't work for me another thing i want to share with you guys is take a look at this i started to the channel started to take off right here it wasn't taking off here can anybody tell me why the channel wasn't taking off here it's like a lot of time in the beginning for sure i think you made no videos at that time maybe you didn't make as many videos i didn't i wasn't making videos right right now talent matters those things matters but you guys saw that you could have a video of a fan and that can potentially blow up like crazy like that right i'm not telling you have a channel about that uh just to make extra money but like you could if you wanted to here's where i started taking off where like i was actually posting a bunch of videos and then pretty immediately after that right like how long did it take me to start taking off after i started making my videos how long so little time it's very little time like literally few weeks i started getting traction so that's the thing about if you really commit so if you don't commit then that change doesn't happen but if you actually commit and go in then it works now your question might be hey what does that mean i might be busy do any of you guys like how many people here have jobs you're working full time or you don't have that much free time like raise your hands if you're already like you got something going on and you don't have like not you're not full time like free right so we have a lot of us have limited amount of time i saw robin raised her hand i saw stacy clara gilberto um so when you don't have unlimited amount of time what i want to tell you is these videos that i made that actually started putting me on the map guys these videos took me i spent one hour every day between 9 p.m to 10 p.m i would work i would leave at 6 00 a.m i would go to my college then i would come i would be done with college around 3 4 p.m then i would go do my parttime jobs and i would come home at 9 00 p.m so i would leave home at 6 00 a.m i would come home at 9 00 p.m and not between 9 00 p.m to 10 p.m i had a onehour window that was the only time i had available it was just that one hour window within that one hour window i had to make things work because at 10 pm then i had to go back to sleep right so in that one hour window is where i created my videos do you guys do you guys have do you have a one hour window in your day yes or no one hour yeah sure yes yes so i asked how long were the videos you were making at that point adam yo what's up so the videos i was making at that point were between uh 20 to 50 minutes so you just did so there wasn't much editing going on i'm finding that it's taken me you know a couple hours at least to add music and do all this stuff yup so for me when i had limited amount of time i think it's worth learning how to edit but i don't think it's worth if it's gonna stop you so i would i made my process so i had no editing i never did more than one take um and i just like i would think about what i needed to speak about and then i would just do it how many videos did you bang out in like a month or like per day as well i was i started doing one a day for for quite a bit and then i started to slow down as my channel started taking off and i had to like focus on different things but like i mean i'll show you because like reality is just reality so let's just take a look at what the actual stats say so i'll move this over to 16 the first you know i got started and then we'll move this over to um move this over to december cool so let's go here so if you actually look this week i produced eight videos you guys see the dates september 1st september 2nd september 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th all of these were published right so eight videos that week eight videos this week four videos the week after that five videos the week after that eight videos a week after that nine videos a week after that eight videos a week after that eight videos a week after that two after that then took a week off then two videos and then four videos and you guys see that like and then i just exploded but uh hi qazi i have one question may i ask you now uh yes you can ask me just give me one second the explosion was caused by this guys see what i'm saying yeah yeah and something weird i'll tell you to this day a lot of it comes from this to this day four years later that's pretty cool right so that's a really important thing to understand about youtube you're essentially putting in a lot of work ahead of time and for free to create opportunity and leverage for yourself right okay all right go ahead um uh go ahead okay uh thanks so my question is that uh as you started i think four or five years ago let's say four years ago so you you said you didn't actually do a lot of editing and everything so but now the market is kind of maybe different into uh 2020 and not true you saw you saw a video of a fan right now you saw a picture of a fan huh for 10 hours and has 33 million views yeah yeah so okay yeah that's that's true that's true for sure yeah yeah yeah so yeah a very good fun but by the way yeah you're enjoying this nice so um go ahead i still want to listen to you go if you didn't finish your question go for it okay yeah so basically i can if you i'm not sure how the time will go i can take maybe one minute if possible sure i actually uh work full time i mean i work at a very good company i i'm like i work at ebay actually if i'm like oh nice you're working at ebay right that's clear so i actually saw your video uh like on on facebook first and then i was really i'm sorry curious and i joined today i mean i was probably late i'm sorry i'm sorry it's okay bro it's okay but but the thing is i mean i had one channel like a few months ago then i posted i think four or five videos and i also posted my channel link here then i was really i mean i'm really busy that's for sure but then i lost my my enthusiasm or you know everything then for last few months i have not posted any video but i mean as i work professionally for last 10 years if i can spend some time i even have like all the equipments which is needed i have my uh mirrorless camera canon m50 i have my microphone camera like yeah i have i have everything literally which is needed to begin or got a nice chair channel so yeah i mean but i'm not getting that that you know power in in my mind that i can i should invest a good amount of time and really do that but i really want to but i'm losing that power so can you choose how can i do that yep so here the here what's happening my friend is you're not like whatever it is that you're gonna be making content on that's not something either meaningful to you or you're not enjoying you haven't created a process that you actually enjoy right like why do you feel like you're not making content like you have all the equipment you have everything even though i want to make sure that you guys understand you guys hi olivia nice to have you here uh your audio your mic is off right now but i just wanted to say hi because i remember we went over your channel yesterday um awesome so shajada think about that think about i want i want you to think about that like why are you not making why are you not making videos like you guys don't need anything outside of a phone so it's important like what is stopping you shajada like i know you said go ahead that's same question to my mind actually because are you do you enjoy the stuff you're making content on i enjoy but i think somehow i'm also kind of lazy to that i'm not lazy personally i work hard i work a lot study a lot you know in technology world how it how it goes but i think when i start making videos there i'm really lazy right it's not because you're lazy it's because you one either don't have clarity of plan most of the times we lack clarity yeah um you know how can you be lazy but you are working a fulltime job like it doesn't even matter exactly you know what yeah i mean like i even work fulltime i think he's fine i think it's like the important thing here sujata for you is you're not lazy so you have to one change that internal dialogue the important thing about it is you have to do it in a way that you enjoy there's something about this process that you're doing it in a way you're not enjoying and two you're not giving yourself a clear plan so the best way that i did it is the day before okay youtube isn't something you do normally right youtube isn't something for most of you that you do normally maybe just for some of you if it's not a normal thing you're not just gonna do it randomly one day like there's no cue in your day that's gonna cause that br behavior to get triggered right it's not like for me i can drink water randomly i need it to survive right i can eat food randomly i can talk to a friend randomly because those are things that i enjoy so much and they're just kind of there they're just gonna happen some people develop a habit of exercising and that that happens automatically here if youtube is not a thing that you do it's not a part of your identity then you have to plan a day ahead or that day once you see can i ask you something uh yes go ahead so basically you're saying that we need to make it a habit and enjoy it right yes thank you thank you cozy yeah go for it yeah so i actually had a question so you know how you were saying like when you uploaded multiple videos in one week yeah you got more revenue and more people liked what you're doing right so would you recommend that we record say i start my youtube channel today okay yeah and say i just i've recorded a python course and i edited everything and i have the separate videos and everything yep should i publish one out every single day you can yes and then would that get me to the same point of when you started to boom or would i still have to wait in that sense so okay so this is where it gets tricky this is where you have to like what i'm getting paid for is essentially uh being willing to handle a lot of um i have really high tolerance to things not being clear entrepreneurs get paid a lot because they can handle uncertainty the more uncertainty you can handle the more likely you are to like actually succeed in this journey if you're looking for certainty you're this is not a good area for you to be in so like if i do this exact thing will i be in the exact same place i don't know bro you could have 20 views or maybe 10 subscribers or you could have like 20 000 subscribers it's like that part is out of your control what's in your control is the amount of effort that you actually put into it so if you can put in x amount of effort and do it for a prolonged period of time and don't see it don't be so driven to the results and the numbers you will succeed like there's literally no way you can't youtube is safer than any job you can ever dream of because at the worst case scenario and this is what i always say to people worst case scenario if everything goes to hell i can just ask for a job like i can go to my audience and i can be like hey is there anybody who has a job for me i can you know i can do a job true so yeah you see what i'm saying so ultimately it's like building relationships like all of you guys are here on this call worst kid worst comes to worst and everything is over i'll be like hey do you guys have any like people that are looking for a job one of you guys might be like yeah actually i have somebody who could use your help with this or this other thing i'm like cool i got a job now that's the worst thing that can happen i think it's safer than a job because at a job they can let you go right a job it can be and then what you have to start all over again then be dependent on somebody again depending on somebody's financial so that's the part that i want you guys to understand but i want to i really want to go the opposite route of every other guru that's out there that's talking about youtube that's talking about these things i want to go the route of opposite of like making it sound easy i want to go the opposite of making it sound like something that every single person can just get and it will happen i want you to understand the amount of work that it requires because what i believe about everybody here is that none of you is lazy what i believe is every single person that's here is looking to execute every single person that's here is hungry and ambitious and driven nobody at a friday 11 50 a.m is on a zoom call with some weird dude with purple headsets listening and talking about youtube right like i have a question i want to ask go go ahead ronald i already have a youtube channel and i have about five or maybe more um on there but i don't get no views what are you making your content how many videos have you put out ronald probably about five or six i'm i'm a minister and i do i do my uh sermons and put them on youtube you have a great opportunity so let me actually give you some tips on this i got something i got something good for you yeah my chrome just crashed so one second let me open it up um i'll get your partner mr quasi uh one second please i want to answer this question and then we'll take you on right after okay yes sir okay all right cool so let me go here oh man really awesome fan sound for sleep white noise for super slumber studying and relaxation 1.94 million subscribers all right everybody has hope i have hope too holy crap i think i've gone to sleep to that fan that's a very niche thing right there very natural very niche um let me start a channel for that ronald what's your channel called koh624 koh624 got it okay this one right here by the way just to add another thing that white noise channel is really popular i also know that channel personally nice so ronald this is your channel right yes oh i'm not sharing my screen whoops yeah i can't my bad here we go here we go so this is your channel right ronald yes okay so your thing here i already know that you're a great speaker just by actually listening to you on this call the reason why you're right now your problem is packaging so the main problem why it's not actually getting found is thumbnail and title so for example a lot of your videos the title is like may 16 2019. nobody's gonna type that in for it to come up also if i see it i don't know what's in the video so i won't click on it okay so that is one big thing and also the thumbnail so you know like for example each of these titles like this is a better title two masters lucifer wages war this is like a little bit better than something that has that's my book that's the book i wrote cool that's cool now ronald here's something else i want to tell you um nobody knows what you do and what your book is or cares about your book what they care about is the message so for example i have a product that i think is the best in the world but if i literally made a video with that product i do believe that i have the best product one of the best products in the world the problem that happens is nobody else knows that product so i'll say something and it'll be like oh what the hell like why is nobody caring but i won't that video is not gonna get any views and no but none of you guys is gonna watch it the reason why you guys are even here is i'm not even talking that much about myself like some of you guys probably don't even know how my name is spelled right and that's okay would you right like that's that's totally fine the main thing is while you're even here ronald and other people here is i'm directly addressing you totally forgetting about myself and just addressing what your pain point is what your concern what your problem is right now on this youtube why it's not going out to a lot of people is it's it's made for people who already know all this stuff which you know which is probably you and a few other people that listen to you in real life the other people who don't know your stuff it's really hard for them to find you the best advice i can give you is find somebody else who's similar to what you're doing who's also giving sermons but they're blowing up and they're getting a lot of views and you want to model your channel after them was eric thomas doing sermons at some point like eric thomas the person who does a lot of motivation like he had he had a huge channel um i mean he's here every night right yeah he i don't know if he did sermons ever but i know there are a few people who are like he did right at some point so you don't have to make your thumbnails this fancy like you could have like this right like secrets to success nothing funny this is not him doing sermons but basically he's speaking giving valuable advice so you can model a lot of things out of this so i would try to find people you enjoy ronald keep going with your messaging but thumbnail and title is the most important thing if you change that i believe your channel can grow okay second thing when you go ahead go ahead when you say thumbnail thumbnail what is that oh okay so thumbnail is this thing right here like your book cover it's like your book cover exactly so it's this thing is the image for every video but basically yeah so this over here like this cover right here is the thumbnail for this video this cover right here is a thumbnail for this video all right so your whatever you're covering you're talking about the picture of the picture of the picture that i put up yeah for the video yes the picture that you put up for the video correct yep so that is gonna be your that's your thumbnail so if you have a thumbnail that's maybe like a closer even a closer up of your face that is pretty good uh something where we can see you or see you in the middle of you talking so it looks like you're talk like almost like this right like this thumbnail is quit lying about your grind and if i look at this picture right here i can see that he's in the middle of talking or saying something i can look at this picture and the words underneath it and i'm like okay this video he's gonna like talk about quit lying about your grind it's gonna be something about passion i already know what it is before clicking into it so the problem that's happening with you is there's probably valuable content that you have but you're not giving me enough reason to click on it so okay that's the most important thing okay okay yeah and totally random and left field um if you started putting out your content on like if you you can even get somebody's help but if you put all your content on tick tock i actually believe you would grow like crazy i have a tic tac account yes i believe if you put out your content on tick tock you can point those people to your youtube but like if you just put out your advice your biggest thing is you want to get your message out to as many people as possible right yes yes so then i'm not religious about what platform it happens with the only thing i like about youtube is that's eventually where people go to go deeply and listen to you like in long form so they can truly hear your message so youtube of course like you should have but i believe that if you had a tick tock and you put out messages there that are 50 or 60 seconds small enough to be for people to consume and hear it it keeps going out to a lot of people and it'll get you really like known and then people will start watching your youtube more too okay so i actually would really release uh yeah i believe that i see okay go for a gilberto yeah and how do you overcome the fear of talking to the camera i mean i'm doing it but it feels a little bit tricky sometimes or uh let me ask you something was there any other thing in your life can you give me one thing in your life that you were at one point scared of and then you overcame it yeah almost everything i think okay so give me one specific thing running what scared you about running running 10k a race of 10k whoa nice that's awesome dude i i i was i wasn't sure if i can do it and then i prepare and that's awesome guys everybody everybody give them a round of applause that's huge so congratulations this is awesome excuse me whoo it's nothing to be scared of man thank you thank you so how did you overcome the fear of it and and then you did it i don't know i just push push myself i think can you do the same thing you think for making videos yeah i'm doing it but my question if is if you know some way to to get better to overcome that fear do you want the painful answer or you want the sugarcoated answer yeah yeah it's it's just painful like there's no secret way there's no secret okay okay thank you i will i would love i would love to sell you something for ten thousand dollars where i can help you overcome your fear but unfortunately like as much as you want to believe that there's something you just overcome like this or there's just nothing the best advice i can give you is just looking at the camera and doing it okay okay again and again and again and again and again and again so like let me can i ask a question uh yes go ahead claro um so like i'm struggling with what the content that i want to like make my youtube channel about and because i'm a beginner like coder yeah um i was thinking maybe like learn with me or something so like i'm kind of struggling just getting started got it ah okay so what is something what is something that you're so i see what your pro right your problem right now is hey i'm a beginner coder what do i make my content about yeah journey what is that what i kind of wanted to do i had the idea to do like learn with me or watch me struggle uh something like that like and maybe i'll be helping somebody else in the long run but like that's the idea that i have yeah but i don't know like how to start right so okay so a few things i want to share with you there okay so that's brilliant i love that you're already thinking about it you're already thinking about how you want to get started so that's huge so congratulations on that now the important thing that i want to mention here is for you to get started on your journey to making content the first thing is you have to there's always going to be like so many different options options lead to paralysis right like sometimes if i go to like a restaurant and they're like i'm like what do you recommend and they're like i recommend you get the grill skirt steak oh i also recommend you get the roasted mary's chicken oh by the way we have this other thing i'm like please just stop talking i'm like like i just like i feel the pain you know i'm like oh my god so many good options now i'm in just pain and i can't appreciate even one thing right so one i need a second opinion exactly yep yeah so one thing is i want you to at some point you know pick one thing and just do it it will allow you like you will start seeing a lot more as you start actually moving forward i think of it like driving a car you can't prepare for all the turns and adjustments you're going to make ahead of time right like you guys don't before you leave whoa is that an actual snake oh yeah actually actually i see the very first videos that i watched from you was what that's a thumbnail bruh oh python videos as soon as i started programming on python i decided to just get my bold python oh my god do you let your clients touch your python yeah that's a sexual harassment training just waiting to happen [Laughter] that's one of my best things i have inspired somebody to do i love that kayla kayla says that's real commitment yeah i thank you you could get viral with this thing okay i love it clara um i don't want to miss your question so um when it comes to making your content one one thing we have to just pick now the second thing is you're torn and i can feel the pain between this thing or that thing for me when i when i started learning coding is when i started making my videos okay so the best thing to study from is like not even what i'm saying but what i've done and what other people have done oftentimes that is way more valuable and truthful than the words coming out of somebody's mouth because like even if i don't want to be maybe i can be wrong or forget something right i'm human being but if you just go look at what i actually did you'll see the real answer so i'll give you an example let's take a look at this video okay um we've all heard the stories about personal data being sold why do i have ads i pay for not having ads okay all right so this video here right um clara have you learned what a for loop is in programming no i'm basically i'm learning javascript right now i i've learned html and kind of familiar with css so i'm truly a beginner okay the example i'll give you is in this one um i was learning a programming like how you're learning a language called javascript right i was learning a language called r at the time okay okay i was a beginner in this and i was solving a problem like it was just like a problem and i was like you know what i can solve it on my own and just do it but what if i just like explained how i solved it and just put it up on youtube do you guys see that i didn't even know how to make it a full screen you guys see how like this much of the screen is like not even used because i i literally did not you make something full screen on youtube right and i posted this video another thing i want you guys to tell me is i call the video r programming week two assignment one pollutant mean walk through part one you think i knew how to title videos back then no maybe not no not really oh i think you should have got a python yeah absolutely not i didn't know how to title videos right and i wasn't even trying to get views on this video i just thought i will do a random thing and it might be helpful to somebody else my only methodology that i operate with is i call it just one right how many viewers do i need for me to feel happy how many just one that's one how many subscribers how many subscribers do i need to feel fulfilled just one just one right how many people need to watch this video for them to change their life just one just one right i just need one person's life to be changed so you guys see how that makes everything so easy to do so easy right i just need one older me to watch it and get some amount of value so like when i solve this problem i'm like literally a younger me might come through this and if they see it solved it will help them that's it right i just solved the problem i put up online i didn't expect for it to get 50 000 views i didn't expect for it to do this is so helpful blah blah blah there's like um there's a student that says i'm a phd student trying to get my head around it this is a great resource i was a complete beginner and apparently i'm helping a phd wow so something beautiful happens when like look at this right oh man this is super helpful i'm very frustrated by the week two assignment as i did not know how to do that i've been using blah blah blah for two plus years something else for six months started using like i don't even know to this day i don't even know what any of that means what this guy's talking about i put out a video i didn't listen to any voices and i just moved on i just thought just one i'm gonna make how many videos am i gonna wake today just one right and okay go ahead somebody use them thank you yeah yeah so like uh there are there are some weeks in which you uploaded like seven videos or eight videos yeah so my question is like how much time it would take to you to upload uh one video like from shooting it till editing one hour okay cool i was doing it in a way where i was doing one hour so i'll tell you my secret to what got me started because i had limited amount of time so again let's just look at the truth so like here's a i'll show you the actual video right so like i'll show you my first few videos that i made oh my god how many ads which is going to be i'm going to go through the entire code category course like i didn't know we were all going to be having fun watching my younger self at one point asmr yeah it's like it feels like asmr yeah it's like so relaxing and soothing listening to it you just have this but on the fans channel just you know all the ambient noise right and i was i was sick when i was making this too it's like if you got your beard you're gonna get to go back to that something like this the beard is just a just a hack to look older you know i was like man i'm tired of looking like i'm i just came out so this video was something that i had to not script out it was just something i had to go over it was almost like i was going through a book together with you so it was like this coding thing that i was just doing for the first time and i decided to go through it online um all these videos are one take because i believe in i call it the one take wonder so i want all of you guys to become the one take wonder yeah right yeah and something beautiful about that is here's the thing uh how many of you guys believe that you can do a a video in one take like raise your hand just be honest like raise your hands yeah i do i do okay a lot of times a lot of us believe that it wasn't great yet but yeah right now one takes perfect wonders beautiful now let me ask you guys something how many of you uh when you guys are speaking with me directly or you're speaking with somebody else directly how many times you have to do multiple takes when you're speaking to a person you guys go ah i didn't mean to say that i'm so sorry cut let me say that again does that happen right so how many of us how many of us can have a conversation in one take how many of us can have a conversation in one take raise your hands everyone yeah how pretty she is right so if you can have a conversation in one if you can have a conversation in one take i like that joke by the way david so if you can have a conversation in one take with a person in real life well then you can do the same thing in a video okay you can do the exact same same thing in a video i see olivia just going crazy we need to give her some music in the back and we can go crazy with her um i love the music in her videos i get going i'm like i lost my mind yesterday so much fun so so for me my videos were were like i want to do them in a way where i only have to do one take and just speak the whole thing is i just planned out what i was going to talk about ahead of time and if it's your truth you don't have to make up it's just your truth right like ronald doesn't have to think about how does this how do i have to be how do i do a sermon like he doesn't have to be like how do i what words do i need to say to make it sound like i'm doing a sermon he actually does them so all he needs is somebody to record them and package them nicely and that's it like so for us if you're doing it on your truths you don't need to do eight different takes you know you can just actually talk about it and and share your experience or insight or the video um now i'm not making you shy away from learning editing because i think it's a good thing to enjoy it and be able to tell your story i think it's awesome to actually learn it but it's not something if you have limited time you can totally do a video in one take and then so all of my videos um and this is something i even do to this day i don't do that thing where i'm like i need to post one a day i'm not religious to posting one a day i just do it and i hit publish i do another one i hit publish i do another one i hit publish i don't like cue them i don't like schedule them i don't try to do 30 videos and then i'm gonna release one at a time i just do them and i hit publish so if you look at my channel there's there never has been any consistency in my channel but i don't i don't care some some weeks i make eight videos in 10 videos some weeks i make zero the other weeks i make 12. it doesn't matter i just keep going uh quasi i have a question um okay a lot of people are raising their hands i just started noticing so i don't know how many people were raising their hands so i'm gonna uh address them and then i'll come to you is it iona ionak yes you got it right okay i appreciate the the value you've been giving away so far thank you brother i appreciate you saying that i really do appreciate that thank you um let's go uh julio i i wonder if i'm saying your name right bro i always say julio i hope it's right yeah close close julio julio okay got it all right i mean you already touched upon uh the the points my question also before uh before i answer my question i don't know if gilberto is still here but uh i kind of have a suggestion that i started thinking about that made everything easier when it comes to yeah yeah so yeah uh one thing that i realized that made it much easier for me to start posting was don't talk to your entire audience you're not talking to everyone trying to beat everyone and trying to make sure that everyone likes you just choose a couple of friends that you know will enjoy your content right when you do that now you're pleasing just a handful of people much easier for you to say okay i know that they will like what i'm going to say that makes you feel good and just consider the rest of the audience just people that are spectating and if they don't like you oh that's money let me play some sounds for that say that for the comments that i received in one video or in one of my videos no wait no what i don't know nothing nothing nothing for your question before you were saying the fear how to overcome the fear of talking to the guy yeah yeah yeah so what what he's saying is imagine like you're talking like gilberta you have you have friends yes yes okay good thumb what's name your one friend that's a good friend andres andres okay when you look at the camera when you speak to andres how do you feel normal normal right now so when you look at the camera i want you to look at the camera like you're looking at andres okay so speak to that one person that's what he's saying that's what julia is saying to you ah okay i get it i get it oh thank you thank you very much that is actually money that advice is actually really money but you you have to actually like you can even say it like andres let me actually let me say that back and then go and say it like actually like you're talking to him my first youtube video my first one is actually made for one person so i wasn't even trying to play games i was literally trying to help a person do their coursera assignment and i'm even saying his name in the video that has 50 000 views right now like i'm actually saying his name so if it helps you can even say the person's name you're talking to and just let other people be confused when they're watching the video i'm not on grace all right so going back to my question but i'm glad that that might help um so my question is do you have a specific so there's there's a difference between like when you're doing one take you're going in free flow right so you're just talking to the camera you're not really scripting anything um and you mentioned that sometimes you do prepare right so that preparation phase yeah do you have a specific structure that makes it easy so that you can follow some bullet points without scripting it too much yes yes yes yes 100 uh let me actually see if um i can pull up uh yeah okay give me one second i let me see if i can actually pull up something that i can actually show you okay so let's go here so i'll give you an example okay so this is what it actually looks like so here's a video i wanted to do about like uh i wanted to do this series which i actually should do which was pretty cool and it was a series i was doing on billionaire developers so like mark zuckerberg uh steve jobs those people and i had a lot of like really dense concepts that i wanted to share like it dense thoughts not just something you can just sit there and just chat like dense because i was like going deep into some of these books and i was pulling out facts and i was using that to construct my video and construct solid arguments so for that i was writing down bullet points so like here you'll see like best developers outperform average developers not by 10x or 100x by what but by 1000x and i wanted to quote this part and it was from a book called uh i think the book is called essentialism or something like that right so that um i wanted to reference deep work by cal newport so i made sure i wrote that i wanted to talk about the salary of developers making over 100 100 000 so i wrote i first just wrote out all bullet points okay then i came up with like what this video will be called i came up with like 10 or 15 different titles all right so like average developers versus 1000 x developers and i was like but i kept going i didn't judge myself so and then i wrote ultra high performing like with this title right i liked it but it was kind of like eh like nobody's really looking for this title then i wrote ultra high performing developer and like like that's pretty kind of unclear then i was like how to become a 1000x developer yeah like kind of cool power of deep work for developers this was okay i kept going i kept going kept going and the last one i came to was how billionaire developers think decoding the mind of billionaire developers what do you guys think about that title that's good that's a good one right actually i was watching the video yesterday right so like even if you're not a developer you click on it so packaging here's a here's the unfortunate truth but a fortunate truth if you learn it guys you can have the best video on the planet but unfortunately that this one part is actually one million percent more important than what you're actually what you actually say in the video because if i don't click on your video it doesn't matter like it literally doesn't matter what you say in the video it's almost like you don't exist or your content doesn't exist and then this is where it gets advanced julio and you know i i try not to go too much this route because people are like i need this like i need million bullet points and i need to but then what i do is i will and i don't always do this again guys so like to be completely honest out of the 2000 videos i've made there's probably like seven or nine that i've truly truly scripted out okay so i want to make that clear all right like truly scripted out then what i did for this video is i took those bullet points and then i turned them into a script right so like i i wanted my hook to be strong so my hook i was like what if my hook is like bill gates mark zuckerberg ron jeremy what do they all have in common a huge ego just kidding and then i'm like twothirds of them are ultra high performing developers and you see what i'm saying so like a little joke in the start solid hook and then i get into the video um so other than that what i recommend for most people is just some bullet points and then just go i don't think you need a script you can have certain bullet points and then you can address them like i can imagine like when i watched olivia's video yesterday i can almost imagine i would be okay with watching her videos if she even had a notebook in her hand like without doing any editing or cutting and she like if she literally had a notebook in her hand and she had like five points and she looked at the point and she was like okay number one and then she just puts the notebook down and she's like i'm gonna talk about like mentality and why it's so important and then she keeps talking about talk about it picks up her notebook and looks at the bullet point number two and goes ah yes this is the second thing i wanna talk about and then she talks about it the beat drops i don't care i don't need her to even edit that but if she's going through really good content even if she has to look at it i that is pure gold so for me when it comes to scripting it's bullet points and and that that's good for me it's good enough for roasting yeah so i'm picturing i know that you you cut out the poses right uh and that also adds to the to the video itself so potentially like all i would have to do in case there's some very intensive subject that i want to discuss regarding the career of a ceo um maybe i can just look on the script read it jump back say it and cut that cut the part where i'm reading it you can you you can't you can you definitely if you want to have it scripted you definitely can do that um and cut yeah exactly and you can cut the part where you're reading it right but one important thing julia i want you or julie i'm sorry giulio one important thing julio julio giulio julia one important thing i want you to get out of this is don't lose the soul and i know you won't lose a soul in there you're too charismatic and energetic and i love that about you but just make sure that you're not you're not putting the words on the pedestal put the feeling in the heart on a pedestal because that comes through the camera i can feel that when i'm talking do you guys feel my energy on the call you guys like feel something right absolutely yes if i had a if i had a random slideshow and i was just talking about the slideshow would you guys feel the same way yeah yeah obviously no right so that's the important part like you will you want to make sure that that feeling comes across and you want to put that on a pedestal so you may if you have to go off script i go off script so much you know if i'm like if i just have a bullet point and i talk about it and then i remember some other i just go i make sure i'm feeling it like i feel it in my heart it's a truth that resonates with me and then i go there hacks what's up say amen yeah yeah yeah yeah awesome so feel it so it's like the hack few hacks to feel it is if you get frustrated about something it's really hot it's really hard to not feel frustration you feel frustrated it's like one of those feelings you can feel very quickly those are hacks um harder things are feeling grateful about something but like rants and feeling frustrated it quickly gets you in your body and like you can you can experience what you're saying so i keep some bullet points and then i go and then if i feel them the better the video gets i like that all right so now the reason why i like scripting at least a little bit because my my feeling part like my brainstorming mode my free flow talks in very long sentences ah i see okay very very precise so um but i really really appreciate that yep cool got it got it yeah so you can have a bullet point and then go through them and then they'll keep you on track most of the times you know that's what i actually like about that that's why i actually really like slide shows like making like making google slides so it keeps me talking and doesn't give me a script i just have images so like i'll put 20 images of what i want to talk about and that keeps me on track without even needing a script and it's visually cool for you guys because you get to see like what we're talking about now so yeah little cues for yourself would be great and it keeps you on track the whole time and then you can just like boom move to the next part um as soon as i feel like the value is not there anymore i very quickly will move to the next point that's valuable i have like this crazy value radar that's just like like value value like and then as soon as i start detecting this is not value it's kind of like what it sounds like in my head is you guys know like those new cars now when you're like backing out if there's something around you'll be like right or when you're turning and like beep like crazy and it gives you anxiety you're like what the hell like what's happening i'm not even close to anybody so like that starts going in my head as soon as i'm getting away from the value i think that has come from uploading 490 plus videos on just one youtube channel plus probably doing over like 500 lives um countless coaching calls so i have like probably over 1000 to 2000 like videos of me like speaking so over time i just developed like this really strong sense and as soon as i feel like i'm on tangents i go back but it's a dangerous area because you i also want you to be in your heart and not too much in your head so micro improvements every video don't over judge yourself but you'll improve over a quantity like long period of time think about like developing a skill like guitar or skateboarding or biking or whatever it will take a lot of repetitions i believe that you can't get quality uh without doing quantity so just do a lot of it and do what you're feeling with the script and i think you will get so good at it bro uh hi kazi would you would you like to review my youtube channel uh it has like five six videos do you have one minute time to see who is this uh i'm sure okay we went over you so give me one second i wanna address i'm gonna go with stacy and a few others and then maybe at some point i'll do the roasting of the youtube channels or reviewing of the youtube channel is that cool um and and uh you good with that answer absolutely okay beautiful all right thank you so let's bring on so stacy i see your hand hi how's it going does somebody want to help me spotlight oh awesome thank you somebody's helping with that beautiful go ahead so i guess my question was um since this is about the making that of that one thousand dollars i wanted to maybe get some insight on whether or not you got your first 1000 just strictly from youtube or was it from other sources my first uh so okay that's a brilliant question thank you for that so let's go and look at the truth i love just looking at the actual truth so i want to go here you guys can see that let me go i think january so this is where i did something i'm going gonna share with you guys in a second we're gonna get a little bit advanced is that okay if we get just a little bit advanced guys sure i try to yeah yes all right yeah that's fine i'm always like man i i don't wanna just everybody be like oh my god this is so crazy all right so um let's go to january all right so right at the start of jan i remember like new year's day what i decided to do was i sold a product i sold the product like i i came up with something and i'm like people are already following me for programming what if i had something on programming that maybe went deeper and gave more value but i could charge 47 bucks for it okay so i sold that thing that thing that day made me uh i think twelve hundred dollars whoa yeah okay so in one day yeah that was huge that was huge for me i was like oh my god i was losing my mind now that number is not twelve hundred dollars that number is a lot more but that those days it was it was that so that is how i broke my first one thousand subs uh one thousand dollars okay and remember we talked about there's 14 15 different ways we can make an income stacy yes for me i recommend like making a channel on what you're good at or what you like wanna sh whatever it is that you're like providing specific value on and then maybe one day you can sell a course i think that's like a really good solid way to go about it um it doesn't and so for me that's what i did i decided to sell a course um and i that's how i broke my first thousand dollars okay um and this is the part what's up you can also do affiliate marketing yes i will click bank yes you can there's a lot of that stuff you guys can do just one thing with me guys everybody has their own ways of going about it for me i like to recommend build your own brand like build your own brand affiliate and stuff like there's so many ways to do it there's no but like for me it dilutes your brand and your message you end up sometimes like the la there's lack of trust because you're always trying to sell other people's product and then you're dependent on other people and so if those people decide to not be your affiliates anymore for whatever reason i believe in like make something valuable and then sell your own thing i think that's the best way to be the most profitable um what's your friends of income so i have a question when you have a moment uh okay one second so stacy does that help at all yeah definitely helps yeah i like that um that you you mentioned branding and i think that's very important is really um once you get that confidence about yourself and what what value you have to bring then that's when it really hits home that you can build your own brand yes i think that's good here's the here's the tricky part about the confidence um if you wait if you wait for permission to get that confidence most of these things will never become a reality that was one big difference between me and my close friends where we started out and then i built something and they didn't or they couldn't um so like here here's a crazy part right stacy if you don't have if you don't start trying to believe in yourself or like that i can do this or i'm gonna start working on it now you're not going to make those videos and you're not going to make them like with your heart as much because you're always like looking for permission they're like i don't have enough permission right now to uh be really confident my videos are like really deliver my all really deliver my value that's gonna make guys what is what's going on if we can just mute the weird sounds uh okay thank you i checked everyone somewhere okay cool so um so you have to almost be delusional a little bit and just decide to believe in yourself today okay see what i'm saying like is it okay if i just decided to believe in myself today is it okay is it okay with you stacy so yeah don't and that's good because yesterday when olivia talked and she was like super motivated and i was like yeah i can do this i'm gonna show my face so i hope you can look at my video and roast me if you have to yeah i think i did i showed my face this time okay perfect i love that i apprec that is amazing so selfesteem is such a big part of this game i want man uh i can get technical with this so okay i'll get a little technical with this so we have money right like let's say we let's say we want to make money so the closest thing to money is what what's one step that happens before i like if you wanted to build a brand or sell a course what's the thing that happens right before there's actually the money hits your bank account what's the step right before value value i i believe that there is something that's actually demanding closer than that you guys are going further product who said that uh kayla yep so product is the thing that comes right before you get money because you can't even if you wanted to pay me stacy you can't pay me if i don't have a product okay right what comes so like you literally cannot like if i have a product on a page you can pay me and buy the product or the service so that's what it is now what's the thing that comes right above the product right before the product what gets you to my product in the first place excitement excitement interest interest yep yeah so the youtube videos and the content is actually the thing that gets you to my product if you hadn't viewed my content you wouldn't get to the product if you don't get to the product you don't get to the money see what i'm saying so there's money right above money's product directly above money's product directly above product is content and what's above content this is where it gets tricky what's above content what's the thing that happens before content happens ideas ideas inspiration inspiration execution right just starting so i like to put i'd like to combine all of those things inspiration whatever all of those things right who are what is it the thing that brings inspiration what is the thing humans humans passion right like humans is the thing above content if you don't have human if you don't have a person or talent you're never to come up with those inspiration or the ideas or making content you see what i'm saying so all the way at the top is like you that's where everything flows from the human is the per the actual person comes up with the content then product happens and then money happens right the slowest and the hardest path the quickest path to getting to money is working on your product right this second right there's a quick like literally uh if gilberta is just like here's a product here's my link go buy this right now and he just drops it in the chat that's the shortest path to him making income he can get to see what i'm saying but it's very short term we'll very quickly probably tune them out maybe one person will buy it but like everybody else will just we're tuned out so product is the quickest thing to work on the thing that happens above it is content now it's harder because a slower path to getting money but it's a really powerful way to get to money right and the thing that's way harder than that and takes even longer is working on yourself working on the actual human the talent for me right now what that might what that means is hiring people and the actual training the people for you what that means is working on yourself working on your inner confidence working on your guys's selfesteem working on like the belief canceling the other noises that are stopping you from doing this the validation that you're looking for that you won't get ever you or you might get it like hundred thousand subscribers in but you're not gonna get to the hundred thousand or one thousand subscribers if you don't give it to yourself today okay right if people are waiting to get permission to make content when they like most people don't say this but they think this how many of you will how many of you have went to your youtube channel and tomorrow it had 100 000 subscribers how many of you will actually start taking youtube seriously and start making content raise your hands right if today you got to check for 20 000 for you like hey you should do youtube how many of you will start taking youtube seriously that's a real thing problem is you're waiting for that that's the problem that's why you're not doing it today that's good i i started my channel a couple of days ago when you start this journey and i have i think four subscribers give me give me give me one second give me one second stacy are you you good yeah i'm ready for my roasting whenever you're ready but yeah thank you for answering that okay awesome you got it for the spotlight guys if we can only make one person spotlight so not me it take out you can take out me as well you can take on okay all right okay so um i'll go with uh devon hello causey it's me again um so kind of just just just one thing before i we get into your question uh you guys you uh does everybody here know this is a fiveday youtube challenge that we're doing yeah yeah okay and everybody here knows that there's a call happening for day four tomorrow i didn't know that okay i know now okay cool um i mean did you guys know there was gonna be a live stream happening for tomorrow like day four yes okay cool so like yeah so tomorrow we're also gonna do this call because it's so much more fun to do this call than the i was like man i don't like just looking at the comments like i actually want to talk to the people i want to talk to you guys like i'm having a million times more fun yeah exactly although a million times more fun like actually communicating with you guys right now so we're gonna be doing a call tomorrow at the same time okay 11 a.m pacific so mark that in your calendar uh because i think a lot of people don't know about this so this way you and i get to have that oneonone so take advantage of it take maximal advantage of it awesome thank you for this opportunity will you also share the zoom link for tomorrow um yes i'll try to share it through email i'll try to share it through the text message and maybe even in the facebook group but facebook just does an awful job of letting people know that there's anything going on we have 3 700 members and like only 40 show up to the facebook live calls like it's not telling anybody about the call so it's really like frustrating but i mean i just enjoy zoom so this is super cool i'm going to be doing a lot of this i'm going to set up a whole system actually okay sorry question about question about that meeting tomorrow yeah because for for today's zoom call uh you know the whole meeting id and everything actually came in like 15 minutes after 11 a.m um is there a way that we can have that meeting id and the passcode like before 11 yes yes yes yes it's my fault that it happened after that because i just randomly came up with the idea and my team was like what the hell you're doing a zoom call now we have to change everything i'm like i want to talk with them i don't care let's figure it out guys so so sorry about that but tomorrow it'll it'll happen ahead of time okay and will we get that link through email uh you guys will get it through email and text uh if you guys join that texting platform like you if you guys sent the text when you guys join the channel yeah yeah so then it'll happen to your phone as well email and phone okay guys i'm gonna go into devon's question now all right devin go for it all right so based on what everyone's kind of been saying as far as finding the motivation or content like i've all those things are good but the main thing for me that i'm having trouble focusing on is well looking into the webcam for one and two uh the energy because when i'm talking to you on zoom or you know there's a group of people there's a certain energy and then when i'm recording by myself and it's just me in my room in silence you need to work okay you i'll tell you because i already know you um you need to work on becoming happier it's like once you like this is a hard thing to think about and this is a thing that's like oh like this is crazy but like i just want to go to the deepest thing because i already know you so i have rapport with you everything else is going to be temporary dude like literally every other solution is only going to be temporary like if you're going to be around me and this energy temporarily you're going to keep going up you're going to want to make content you're going to want to do this as soon as that energy goes away it's going to drop so like the and the best way to actually have that is be around people who are like sillier come off like stupid laugh a lot and have fun like get to that you have like a child in you and i know that right so you're very smart you're very deeply analytical you're very thoughtful but that can also lead to overthinking for you yes or no absolutely right sometimes instead of being in your body you're sometimes in your mind right also you have a child in you and i know that you can like laugh at the dumbest things and have fun yes or no yes so you need to like love that part more and feed that part more like it's a really weird answer because it's like has nothing to do with youtube analytics but like the more you actually feed that like even that part where you're laughing right now the more you make yourself happier the more you're going to want to do this so like tactical tips i can give you spend more time around people that are just like stupidly happy all the time where you're like you have no reason to be happy like you just got up today and they're like oh i know yeah like be around people who are just happy that's like the best thing i can share with you like actually spend time with them what's gonna happen is you're gonna start coming up and then at some point it's going to start becoming your normal happiness leads to just like the most insane amount of action like you can force yourself and use discipline but it's like temporary like you could brood for like you're gonna be angry you can punish yourself and be like what the is wrong with me why am i not making videos there's something wrong with me come on you can yell at yourself all day temporary so i don't want you guys to get into that pattern it's a shortterm pattern that works but it's like being in an abusive relationship you know it's like that person you found really attractive but they're awful people but you decide to get into it and then it's just like a nightmare getting out of it and it gets abusive so it's almost like i don't want you to develop that pattern or for people to develop that pattern of themselves where you just yell at yourself to do it because then you develop a bad relationship like even when shazada was here he was like i'm lazy that is gonna if he keeps saying that language you know he's like i'm lazy with making content i just need to force myself and push myself he's gonna actually start not enjoying making content because this is to be like trying to force himself to be disciplined he's going to start being his own disciplinarian dad which we all know what happens when you just have a purely discipline iranian father mother you start running away from them like as a little kid like for me when i had that sometimes i would start running away because i was like i don't want to deal with that you'll start running away from yourself so what's important is to like it's a weird answer but i really do believe it that like yes you can plan out like i know you don't have you don't have a problem with planning content right right you know even what to make it on do you know what i'm going to make after this call yeah so so i want you to pay attention to that you will make one after this call and latch on to that like that emotional when you get that emotional push when you feel your energy going up latch onto that like a hungry dog behind the meat truck so like make the actual video you take advantage of it but then what i want you to actually work on is like literally physically smile and laugh more throughout the day like literally you know how when you look at your phone and it says you use instagram for four hours today i want you to literally be able to sit down at the end of the day and be like for 47 minutes i i couldn't stop laughing today hard like that much like where you can almost quantify the amount of time like how much happy you are if i go to sleep and it isn't a day where i laughed so hard that i had tears coming out of my eyes i'm like damn man i gotta work on happiness more like so really like be happy and do that like watch comedy watch stuff that you like what's gonna happen is while you're planning stuff out about making content another tangible hack is you can watch content about making content so like that's gonna excite you about making content the biggest thing is like overall raising your levels of happiness but being around happy people listening to happy things your level of like what you actually produce in your output will go way beyond like that's the actual solution to what you're looking for that is crazy and i believe that's the correct answer at the same time so i'm gonna okay i didn't know this this took an interesting turn but yeah i'm definitely gonna do that hey beautiful are you gonna make a video right after this yeah because i got an interview at two and they sent me some questions to prepare on and i was just gonna do a video basically going over this list of um questions guys how amazing is this guys how amazing was this right now like what you just experienced with him i want everybody to just give him a round of applause like we actually want you to do this bro like this is awesome like whoa oh you got this most random uh therapy session ever yes but i appreciate it yes yes i'll invoice you after okay discovered by my insurance is fine paypal request clever programmer therapist llc what is this new company um but i so like like when you're motivated about something latch onto it i believe that with everybody like understand that it's coming from external source but latch onto it it's important that you latch onto it don't just be like oh you know what it's not coming from me like i'm gonna we're all a product of our environment we're all a product of our environment if 50 people around you and your family work out you're going to work out 50 people around you eat potatoes 24 7. you're gonna start eating potatoes like we are really a product of our environment so you're here you're excited now what happens if you feel excitement and energy if you guys feel that right now maybe now is the time to actually set an implementation intention for when you're going to shoot your video all right now are you guys feeling some type of energy right now are you just feeling some type of like little tingling sensation motivation hope something that you can do in the future uncertainty excitement any of you guys feeling that raise your hands says right if you guys feel it like frank i see him like smiling a little bit right like i see it in clara i see it in you so what i want you guys to do right now is let's use this moment to commit to actually making something like shooting something today all right i want you guys to shoot something today so then you guys can actually bring it tomorrow and we can take a look at it cool guys are you guys with me on this yep can i ask a question on that beautiful uh yes go for it does this here apply to talking to an empty room yes talking to a camera is always talking to an empty room i mean i have an issue with that they're my own so i'm like him talking to an empty room is a problem with me i'm used to having an audience yes yes so like that's the hard part um when you don't have an audience on the other side there's nothing feeding you energy and so just like who am i even talking to but like i know that you have a great imagination i know that like you have that certainty in you so you for you i would say like almost imagine that the audience is there but the best thing i can say is like over time of just doing it it'll get better and trust me ronald the crowd that is actually watching is way bigger than any stadium or any indoor place that can ever fill up and same thing and same thing with the impact that you're making on people's lives i'ma try it too beautiful awesome yeah so if you can feel that you're gonna make that effort then you know that's what's amazing about it and if you feel like you can impact those people like before you even start i want you to feel the impact that you can have by just doing that by just speaking directly so guys let's give ronald a round of applause because he's going to be doing this and i'm super excited for him this is amazing awesome ronald i appreciate it that's awesome brother um please cool remove me from the spotlight because i want other people to be spotlighted not me so thank you um and guys at this time what i want you to do is either say out loud actually i want everybody to say out loud what your implementation intention is so that means what time you're gonna shoot your video okay so if you're feeling that energy now it's time for us to put it in action and motion because outside of that there's no purpose for us being here the purpose is we're here we're going to feel some type of energy let's put it into motion let's put it into action right away you guys with me on this so far raise your hands we're saying yes yes yes yes are you guys with me on this let's say it louder you guys with me on this say yes yeah yeah beautiful absolutely with you right now so right now at the count of three i want you guys to say so i'll demonstrate it okay so for example you can be like i commit to shooting my next video at 2 p.m i commit to shooting my next video in an hour from now or at 6 00 p.m or a 5 p.m does that make sense what i'm asking of you don't say it yeah it makes sense okay so at the count of three i want you guys all to physically say your implementation intention of what you're going to shoot or what time you're going to shoot it makes sense guys okay so at the count of three one two three yo that is beautiful guys wow let's do it one more time let's go one two it up for three that is brilliant energy i absolutely love it so that's your implementation intention okay that's your intention and once we commit to that we're going to make sure that we do that we're all going to do it here yes yes we're all here for that reason beautiful julian i believe you when i see you adam i believe you i know you're in space right now adam but i still believe it this is going to happen i'm at work man i'm i'm trying to do two things at once coding and doing this awesome spoken on iss beautiful so i want to see a video from all of you guys tomorrow okay excellent beautiful where do we send it uh you guys could put it as a comment or when you guys jump on this call you guys can actually bring it with you yeah i have mine in the chat yeah yeah yeah dropping it in the comments or in the chat is a great place we'll make a post for is is on his coaching call maybe nas can help make a homework post for today and everybody can actually like submit their videos to that post okay cool so we'll make a homework post cool guys and then you can actually submit your video there link it there cool that's gonna be on facebook yeah on the facebook group yes excellent it's going to be on the facebook group yep fantastic awesome all right cool so i'm really excited about that i'm glad that the intention is in so now i'm going to start taking more of your guys's questions and then at some point we're gonna start doing the youtube roast as well uh i have a question um hold on i saw i'm gonna go with frank right now because i saw his hand was raised frank go for it yeah no cause this uh this fiveday series thing is amazing i got my i got my mic now so you guys can hear me a lot better um yeah putting out the intention is great i got the energy um i think i get stuck sometimes on like what is like what is something interesting some evergreen content right it's like i don't want to get in too much into the weeds so it's like you know you saw the one i saw previously was you know my ecommerce one like i know that space really well like i can teach that to anybody yeah um but i want to you know do something more evergreen that's like you know relevant with the times um i think that's kind of what i get stuck on sometimes okay cool so a few things here if it's evergreen it's by definition not gonna be relevant with time see what i'm saying trending right so it's like for example if you're doing something that's like right now trending or like meme worthy like it might be really good for now and it's a good way to do it but it's by definition not necessarily content is truly going to be like evergreen forever because it's like maybe just happening in the now okay so it's like imagine if you watched a video and it had like some meme song in there you know uh what's that harlem shake you guys remember when harlem shake was like a crazy thing right um and so if that like when you watch it today it's not evergreen it's like outdated like you can tell it's outdated but truly evergreen stuff there's content that people have made 10 years ago on youtube or they're maybe giving advice or valuable things that can be really really like potentially evergreen now and nothing is going to be like forever nothing is going to be like permanent but you know for example one of the videos that works always really well in the programming world this top five programming languages to learn you know okay yeah so like that could be your evergreen type of content if you want to do something along those lines right or like the top five programming roles like right like something like that that maybe i'll kind of go that direction too because i my gut feeling if you want to crush it on the developer level my gut feeling and this is something that i discovered and i had a hunch and then i told sunny about it and he jumped on it with me was those builds i deeply believed that it was going to be the most valuable thing and it turned out to be truly the most valuable thing they got countless people jobs countless people got jobs from it um you were one of the people that i believe leveraged it to get a higher paying job oh all the way like i'm probably the most successful like off that and it's like i really appreciate it tell everybody here where what job did you have like how much were you making before and then after those clones you watch those videos what was the new job that you got so um previous to the job i was making around 150 um and after doing the the build with sonos like the the guys who make these speakers really highend speakers um i put it on the uh profitable javascript thing too i was able to get uh land 175 000 job off of one of the clones that sunny came up with uh which was the spotify clone so amazing bro that's amazing and basically picked up react enough to do that and then i built a dashboard for them and then i'm also making their app because i'm i'm primarily a mobile app developer and i'm making that in react native so so here's one thing i just knew we were never gonna go wrong with if he can use our video to go from a hundred and fifty thousand dollar job to 170 000 job do you guys would you guys say that we brought him value oh yeah right absolutely so yeah when there's something that i feel like is gonna truly bring value i just know that it's gonna crush like truly bring val so like in the developer world the ultimate hack is just bills there's a lot of other stuff but if you are good which you are dude i will just personally tell you go the route of builds you can do other stuff if you want and you're truly excited for but you're like yo i want the fastest path to like growth and success build build a tesla landing page build uh you know what i mean build like uh uh uber clone with react native build a spotify clone with react native like just like we were dropping like ticktock uh we showed people how to make ticktock right so that's trending it's hot and all of our developers wanted to learn it we showed people how to make tinder we showed people how to make um all of these like amazon like would any of you guys would be interested to even see like yo how do you actually make amazon in one day that's kind of cool right the amazon store i'm interested how do you do that yeah so like that's what we showed like we built all of these things because we're developers and then other people were able to build them so that stupid amount of value i knew that even if the videos weren't the best edited the best this the data i knew that that was just gonna dominate so as on the developer side if you go that route you're just gonna dominate and especially if you're good which you are oh bro it's time to fly and what i will even extend to you is if you want to make content like that we have a channel clever programmer with 830 thousand subscribers i would love for it to be even on there i'm totally down for that i'm totally down for that okay so like if you actually want to do it pick a build and we can build it yeah like i've been telling sunny like it would be amazing to have like a super build right everything from the react all the way to maybe some back ends some stuff yep all the way to the native like all the full stack and that would be amazing and that would be so like pick one thing like you know whatever you want to do it on spotify tick tock tinder whatever it is pick one thing do the video however long it is and then if i think instead of even doing a live you can do the video you can record it and then like just put that out i think that's gonna do really well and if you want we i'd be happy to put it down on our channel too because coding related 100 yeah and and yeah all prerecorded you know just because like some of what you were saying like for me doing it live is not not usually an option because of you know because i'm working on it yeah yeah um but um but the idea the idea is i want to provide something really good value yeah um i think i'm going to pick up that sony um blogger vlogger camera that you were talking about it's really handy awesome and uh yeah let's produce some content man i'm i'm totally down for that that would be sick that would be really really sick i'm so excited about that bro uh jump on it i think that's uh that's one of those opportunities that can be just truly lifechanging uh it can give you a head start into you making content and helping people and our number one goal is always to like even in 2021 our number one goal is to help 5 000 developers get jobs and we document that every time they get jobs we document that and yeah and and getting mobile mobile development is a huge it's a huge thing too and a lot of people want to learn it i get questions like that all the time i'm like how do i become a mobile developer and stuff and i coach people and i talk to them like just for free right but it'd be good if i was like hey let me show you let me show you how to make instagram or show you how to make an uber app for real for yes beautiful beautiful i'm down man let's do it awesome awesome great so there um you know hopefully that give you guys something with like you know with insight into how to think about content like sometimes sometimes if you can find something that you deeply believe and know that it's valuable like truly valuable they could just use it man that is usually one of the best routes you can go like for example one of the best routes i can go is like share like even right now what i'm doing is is this right now what you're watching like is this edited is there cool music happening are there cuts is there anything that's fancy about this yet why are you still here we've been here for two hours and a close to two hours and eight minutes why are we here why are you still here wow excuse me because we have a passion for it and we want to learn and we want to just absorb what we can yes you have a commitment to absorb you have a passion and then now there's value for you right that's why you're like you're staying here because you're getting value right people if you're not you don't care about anything except like if you're not getting value like i'm out of here right like sometimes my dad will be talking and i'm like man this guy's going on a tangent how do i get out of this call you know but then i'm like dad let's talk about something else so like that's the important part if you can truly have something that's valuable that's usually just a great way to go about it um i'm gonna take a question from aldo okay thanks uh that's this is a great and i was thinking about making two uh or three channels because i love technology yeah um stuff like anthropology because i'm an educator so do you think that i can make some uh work about it in those three fields what is it that you love topology anthropology anthropology what else and developing as a developer and technology the first video that i will do is it's about technology it's about you use an ipad yeah to study and i think it's great but later on i will talk about anthropology because it's related to education uh but do you think that it helps to have two or three channels and keep feeding those two three channels and to see uh no no so okay i have a i have different answers on this okay so most people don't even have bandwidth for one channel right like most people don't have the bandwidth or the ability to create ad volume or at scale or do it justice even at one channel right so uh doing three like even we have 15 plus employees a clever programmer and even this is hard to produce do a second channel i'm now starting a personal brand channel right rafikaze that's where you guys are are at i have a youtube called rafikaze so like oh wait hold on uh which is actually exciting i want to actually take a look at this am i about to break um let's see give me one yes you are 988 i guess wow look at that 997. oh wait hold on you guys can't see it so let me actually show it to you guys my bad i stopped sharing but uh about to break 997 uh i mean about to break a thousand subscribers so remember i talked to you guys about how to break your first 1000 subscribers guys yesterday isn't that cool that i'm doing that in real time right now so it's not just yeah if i should go subscribe to him so he can reach us they're like we should subscribe to him so it breaks a thousand thank you guys that was not my point but i really appreciate it thank you that's not why i did this so let's go smash the subscribe let's go um man so oh i was waiting for uh nine nine nine and i just because that's amazing same thing i was waiting for 9.99 yeah what people keep doing is they keep uh when you play this game with people if you do it live they keep unsubscribing so then they can be the one to like do the thousand subscribe and i remember i was like seeing this i was like oh my god people would keep unsubscribing um yeah so although what the hell were we talking about i'm sorry yeah about delivering into oh cool but i think that i'll i will try to mix technology and education yeah like for example you can make apps on anthropo i don't know bro like anthropology app you know and then like infuse the passion or you can give anthropological like um examples when you're talking about programming so like infusing it i think is a good idea i think just the bandwidth required to make three channels grow is really really really really it's like if you're like you know i want to have uh i want to have kids but like i don't know which kid is gonna be the best or like how i can have like a really really great child so let me just have triplets right now and then like let's go and uh like they're all gonna be and then whichever one is great like i'll just go with that one like don't have triplets right now bro it's going to be really hard i'm saying so i appreciate that that's that's what i would say it's it's hard it's like yeah so and i loved your chair and your likes oh thanks afraid that's awesome yeah yeah this setup took freaking years but i used to sleep under like i had a my whole channel was built when i was in like a 400 square foot office like a tiny office and i would like it would be always so heated i would always need to put like napkins under my armpits because it would just get so hot and there was never air and we would work we would work like 15 or 18 hours and like i would sleep under the under the desk and then i would wake up and then start the next day i had a home i'm not trying to like make a sob story i could have went to my parents house like my house but like i just worked so hard and loved it so much like i didn't care i would just like sleep under the desk wake up and then like start shooting videos and i'll be like let's go like so you know it's just yeah i just i grind it really hard you don't have to yeah you know but i just did it that way so coming here and having this i i'm so grateful for it every day you know i never take the setup that i have right now for granted you know because everything was made in like out of nowhere you know so um it makes me appreciate everything all right aldo that answers your question yes yes okay brother thank you for coming on appreciate you all right we'll go with yazid uh i cannot hear you so you might have to click the mic and make sure you're on zoom okay now hey here we go we got a content creator in the house i already know you have a ring light you got the good mic going that's great that's great start you got a great smile i love it thanks yeah so i want to ask you about do you think it's good to talk a native language or an english for youtube programming whichever whichever one you want do you want to have a if you want to do english but it's not really the best one like i feel i could make some mistakes so um if you're doing it out of insecurity if you're not doing english one out of insecurity i want you to do the english one in that case especially in that case because my biggest thing for all of you guys is your selfesteem and confidence growth that youtube allows you to have like that's the biggest gift that it can give you okay um so uh it's just a small uh thing if you can watch your video it's 30 seconds so it's not very long okay if you can't give me like any feedback okay how about this we'll start the um we'll start the roasting session slash review sessions now is that cool with you guys if we start the review sessions now yes okay i think everybody's been waiting oh okay yeah yeah i didn't know that was okay cool all right so let's start with yazid let's go so uh yazid you want uh decaf light roast dark roast what are you looking for dark groves like dark rocks give me everything all right give you everything okay got

your channel i don't give a who you are okay okay i'm coming today it's too dark it's too dark i'm coming to watch something that brings me value okay so make sure make sure you put the value proposition first okay what i get out of it as entertaining as and as energetic and loving your personality is i want something for me because i'm about to watch a video and there are a million other videos um so that's one now okay you are so good that like it's really hard for me to do more dark like dark roast uh but but yeah that's my biggest concern okay for you which is okay just make sure you give the value first and then worry about yourself later outside of that i want to kind of get to the good parts you have i mean you are built for youtube like you are good i could like i felt left from your confidence and smile and energy when i just spoke with you but this video is like an actual youtuber if this channel had like 20 000 subscribers or 30 000 subscribers i might not be like surprised i might be like oh no i expect this channel to have a lot you see what i'm saying yeah um myself to you so let's start good job with the music i would lower it a little bit so i can hear your audio better i am i'm 15 years old okay don't panic i started loving this field since i won amazing job on the brolls amazing job with the brolls like we need to learn this broll in our company if you were old enough i would hire you like like we're not doing a good job of brolls our brolls are garbage we don't have a lot of brolls it's just like me sit standing there and talking if we added this it would make our videos million times better so like you're already on the broll side you're better than me and some of our editors in this team that are like actually amazing so great job on that what's in this rank so when i say broll guys what that means is it's not just like it's um it's images and videos with his voiceover in the back you guys understand what i mean when i say broll like this says aroll this is him just looking at the camera and talking today i'm gonna this is called aroll this is just you looking at the camera you're talking right now this with his voice over but videos of some other stuff playing it's broll make sense guys yes no yes yeah yeah and i don't remember specifically but in this range web and mobile development are the fields that i like and work dude you're going to crash apparently what meanwhile i have two apps on the play store this guy has two apps on the play store that was yeah well then killing it man you're gonna go far man all right what's the legal hiring age where you're at the description new videos every week 1916. okay uh you already have 342 subscribers yeah um the story behind this channel uh i made multiple videos but just one day i woke up and found some motion guy hacked the channel oh all the videos got deleted wait how can somebody hack your channel dude i don't know like my password is really so long do you have siblings no yeah i have do you have any older jealous siblings of you i don't write data let's start with the family first so no kidding so like nothing ever got deleted on my youtube bro and people know my youtube you know so like i would i would are you giving out your passwords to random people no it's like i changed them and they are very long yeah like it's hard to guess them do you have they are not related to me do you have any do you have any like do you have a hunch of who who it could be i feel like this is getting interesting it's from russia i got the ip address oh maybe they were using it he even put his nose maybe it was your brother maybe it's your brother using a proxy everybody knows how to proxy right vpn okay cool so uh the only reason i'm asking that is i don't want this happen to you later so enable twofactor authentication okay okay so if you have two factor and then like change your passwords you change your passwords yeah okay cool so you'll be fine you're a developer you know what you're doing thanks just like yeah thank you so much now on this video the what i will say is good job i think even the thumbnail is actually looking good so great job on that um this thumbnail i don't like at all yeah it was just for uh uh desktop letter installer no that's okay yeah yeah sure so what i want you to know is like try to make your thumbnails the simplest way you can make good thumbnails is by making them less busy just more like really simple the less you can have your you can't go wrong with less you can go wrong with a lot on your thumbnail so like here there's a lot that you're trying to do with this thumbnail like you literally just took like some the whole page and put it on here so when i look at it immediately i'm not gonna click on it if it's in my home recommended right how people watch videos is they go to their youtube recommended right a lot of you are watching your videos by based on what youtube is recommending to you right right in this field and then you click on it so if i see that image i'm not gonna click on it because it looks like a it looks like a pamphlet it looks like a flyer like a marketing flyer or something you know so make it less busy um if you can add your face in there you have a great personality with the smile have that and just have one word like flutter or something oh okay right like i would have here's how actually would do your thumbnail okay so um do we have a photo of you all right let's see um i do want to be mindful of time so i want to make sure that we don't actually like go too crazy with this but let's go and um just another thing bro uh an easy way for him to create uh thumbnails is using canva yes so canva or you can use photoshop so like this i know this is not the picture of you that we're gonna be using i know this is like um you know this is this is a small just an avatar photo that you have but honestly even a thumbnail like your face in it with like flutter logo so like let me go here and go flutter like this logo right yeah with like literally some text underneath it flutter like weird colors all kinds of craziness happening but you're already much better and like people are more likely to click this then they are likely to click the other one that has too much on it okay okay so like i would i would have a good i would choose a good photo of you here so it's like full screen kind of like that right on the righthand side and a flutter does this is this starting to look like kind of like a regular youtube thumbnail yeah see what i'm saying so this is kind of what you want to do you want to like keep it simple image some words done simplicity will get more clicks more views more whatever all right um thanks so much yeah so at this point i want you to just go all in bro like for you now it's just time to go all in and start making tons of content i'll start to speed up the roasting because otherwise gonna take too long okay hopefully you got value out of it yeah thank you so much all right awesome who's next who's the next one guys please don't spot him don't spotlight me all right who's spotlighting me david david amanath which one of you spotlighting me okay please don't spotlight me because i only want one person to be spotlighted okay so like the person who asks the question i want them spotlighted i don't need me spotlighted thank you okay okay you wanna go with my one i'm sajida um okay let's go uh i will i'll put my channel name in the chat okay uh zoom set yeah try to drop the links but okay cool okay yeah i will i will i also posted the channel uh url perfect that's way better thank you yeah all right so let's go here and we're gonna go fast so if you guys have no i might give you a lot of feedback really fast because i want to speed it up so if you guys want to take notes and then implement then go ahead and do that okay cool uh and what type of roast are you looking for decaf you can give me any kind of information so i would like to know okay all right cool so um just off the cuff um okay good a little bit better good no and no okay cool so those are the just just off the cuff thumbnails all right now i'm gonna just look at titles and uh these are all your videos yeah yeah yeah okay cool so now i'm just gonna look at like titles and stuff like that okay this is valuable because you're teaching um how to create a package convert a video like i like i like value so every video that you have is it seems valuable so i like that uh this is all about you and it's a promo so i i kind of i go away from those things but other than that like i like all of these the direction you're headed in um is there a specific video you want me to look at uh you can probably uh look the last one yeah this one actually that is my latest video still six hi everyone welcome to my channel the destro dev show today we'll talk about array.prototype.flat the only thing i would change there is i would uh reverse the order i would say what this video contains first and then i would talk about my channel this shows me that you're thinking about yourself first and the audience second it's a big mindset shift that i want you guys all to change audience first you second or if you can you last okay uh whenever you guys have a conversation with somebody which type of person you enjoy having a conversation with the person who speaks about themselves the whole time and then asks you or do you guys enjoy your conversation with somebody who listens the entire time which person do you guys enjoy more go ahead and just say it out loud listens yes we're thirsty to be listened to right same thing here value first your thing second let's see the code first good you get into it so fast this was like the best that i've seen out of all the videos we've watched i mean we only watch one person's video but like i like how fast you're getting into the actual value by doing it is flattening the nested so the video is like really early i want you to keep speaking and using your emotional human energy to guide me through it almost imagine like a slide right the more momentum i start picking up in the start then later the momentum just keeps taking me right so or like think about a car going downhill like in neutral in the start it's hard to push the car but then it just gets going yeah so you're you're deciding to put a lot of your quiet parts in this here in this area right there that's too that's really dangerous in this part is the part where you actually need to push the car okay this part is already rolling i'm already addicted and hooked and watching so even if you are quiet here i'll i'll be okay see what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah yeah so like you're quiet you're just typing um yo frankie what are you up to yo nas what are you guys up to right now oh you want to grab some food let me just watch this video for a second um all right bro let's go grab some food you see what i'm saying like you lost me bro like literally i can have a conversation with somebody i can talk about grabbing t i can do texting on my phone so like you need to hold my attention you need to be speaking the whole time so an example of it would be like first right let's get into it so guys right now what i'm going to be doing is we're going to flatten the array so let's create a variable called flatten my arrays equal to myarray.flatten my array if you guys hit tab it will auto complete it do you see how i'm using my voice to energetically keep you going through it yeah it's energetically keeping you going through it yep if i run and your audio quality is really good this flat method you speak well and clearly your screen is looking great and you're using zsh the same thing i use that's good but do this and run if i do this it will be basically the same if we want to flat if you want to make videos that are extremely direct and to the point look up fire ship and look up cory shaffer if you just want him direct to the point model the pace of cory schaefer you'll notice they're even though their energy is lower but their pace is really fast then that too there is cool so good video those are my notes for you okay let's move on to the next one look at mine uh okay awesome one second one second guys i'm looking also at the chat so the next person that dropped their thing is muktum um hussein are you there if you're not there in part like if you're not there i might have to skip you i want you to be actually there okay so yuri let's go with you okay cool okay i already like your title yeah sharing your screen bro oh my bad so only i'm liking the title i was still stand corrected oh okay intro is too long nice dude she's got like trap music playing and everything yes that is sick the number one and the most fascinating reason is that you can convert ideas into reality okay so great i'm loving it um you got i you're gonna do really well because you're the type of person so you're ready like you're actually a type of person that people want to listen to and follow okay so i haven't played a lot of this video so not a lot of people will get a sense of that but i know you your words hit hard and like you're just you have like a leadership thing going okay not a lot of people have that people maybe are good conveyors of information but you have leadership going you can literally make videos just like this for a hundred videos and i would not be surprised if you're like 50 000 subscribers just yeah like a little bit short on my android phone actually my sister was holding the camera for me yes people literally want to follow you because you're they want to actually be like you and they want to have that mentality and they're like you have something that's the really valuable part about you so you just need to keep the camera on and speak more like and you're good the only tactical things i'll tell you is your music is too loud and it it drowns out your voice i can't hear you over the music so i so like whatever app you're using you need to bring your music down to like negative 12 decibels or maybe even negative 20 decibels your voice should be zero or 12 decibels positive and it will it will create it so your voice pops out okay so don't make me compete between music and your words then i will start listening to music intro good job on the intro you have a really cool intro i would make it like one second long like so okay i'll tell you like right when i get bored of it okay i'll tell you like right when i want you to switch it right there okay a second longer and it's like it's painful to me like almost like oh so four to five seconds too long cut it good so that's my tip to you other than that your title is looking great uh i like your channel oh my god and you got the thumbnail game on point you just need to make more content you just need to make more content um just another thing bro uh like what i've seen on yeah clear programmers content like when you're going through the title like you're actually speaking in the background and the slide like the title comes up and there's a slight background music like you don't like speaking right you know yeah yeah so you could do like what yeah yeah so you could do it both ways so amana brought up a good point like you can keep speaking the title uh and have it playing or you could do what you did if you do what you did you got to keep it short that's what makes it clean so like for example i'll show i'll show you um an example of this okay so let me know that top five programming languages right not that one but i i uh i you already know that one but i'll give you a different example of an intro so like in these videos i'm doing an intro right and i want you to actually pay attention to the intro so for this video i'm going to play oh i'm not sharing my screen oh okay okay thank you thank you guys so for this video i want you to watch how quickly the intro happens okay i'm really did you see the intro sequence yeah yeah yeah it's just a few seconds i get my signature that's part of my intro where it says rq is a frame it's a fraction of a second it goes so fast that you can't even see my actual like uh let me like i can't even pause there i literally cannot pause there even if i wanted to but you guys see that little rq that happens really quick so that's so when i say the intro it's like from here it's hard to let go until whatever but like just it's just short i'm really that's it so i i recommend making intro just a little bit shorter outside of that great video you just need to do more and you'll you'll win okay so like uh what's your suggestions on the thumbnail is it right like your thumbnail is pretty good your thumbnail is pretty good um let me actually tell you if there's something i find annoying about it let's see um i think like it's a little busy so like i would just maybe remove this like this okay like that the dude at the bottom right uh the apps coming out from the phone at the bottom left okay if you want to make a really good thumbnail like a really good one you looking at the computer and coding and just the image of you from the side like an image of you from the side coding generally is like the best way to do it it's the simplest and it works really really well outside of that great thumbnail good job okay thank you guys okay cool all right um let's go zach carson ultra dark roast please zach where are you at yes i'm right here are you ready for this you sure you want this yep i need it all right okay cool let's get into it so we'll go with zach uh i'll share the screen uh i love that song that's like literally one of my favorite songs it's awesome well i love them i like that song okay so let me actually just go to your channel first i'm going to go to your channel i'm going to switch to this um how how long ago did you start okay one year ago all right all right you know what you're doing like on youtube it seems like you know what you're up to like when i look at this it looks like somebody who's who understands how youtube works they haven't done it long enough so like why are you not making more videos like why is your last video like five months ago and there's like months long gap in between them why um yeah that's kind of like the problem for me is just like finding finding the time trying to like put out content i mean there is time but like trying to like prioritize well it's not important to you then it's not your priority okay yeah like to me all this means is like when i see this is i know what i'm doing i spent all this time learning it but eh it's not a priority i don't feel like it's important okay i can't want it for you do you think it's important for you yeah like you actually want to do it yes i do why why do you want to do it well i mean to like give other people um like i i know like whenever i watch like music videos or something you know it just like kind of helps soothe me you know just kind of like it's soothing it's nice and relaxing to watch yeah but so you're telling me you want to do it right yes but at the same time you're lying straight to my face okay because your words are telling me you want to do it but your actions aren't so you can be the sweetest person on planet earth and i can love you i love your energy but like i don't want you to look at me straight in the face and lie and i don't want you to look at yourself straight in the face and lie okay if you wanted to do it then you would have been doing it tell me tell me certain things you like doing that you do on a regular day like just tell me a few things that you do throughout your day like what's an average day in zack's life um i like to edit videos okay what else um i mean obviously play play the piano okay great what else um i mean that's usually what i focus on i mean but what are the things do you do do you scr like do you not scroll on facebook or instagram or youtube dude like texting your phone he's a big time consumer okay youtube is what you like consuming youtube is what you want to do and if you told me that that's the truth because you're actually if i look at your phone i can see the time you're investing in there yeah if i actually look at the time you're spending playing piano you want to play the piano and it'd be the truth that you would be telling me because you're actually doing it if i had a hidden camera there would be x hours of footage behind it right yeah so youtube doesn't seem like something you want to do okay that i just have to call you out on your on that like you have you have talent you have the skill to do it why are you not doing it that's the thing that like i need you to understand and i want me and everybody here to understand like why are you not doing it you say you want to do it but you're not doing it so why is that i guess i just have to want to do it more you know i guess that's what it is okay and part of wanting to do something more requires you to do what um i mean put forth work i guess maybe right maybe put forth work yeah yeah maybe put forth time and energy into it yeah and actual hours behind it okay right so like that is the last missing piece of the puzzle here it seems like you you enjoy it it seems like you get it it seems like you have a knack for editing and you enjoy consuming content and there are a few things that tell me you enjoy consuming content one you told me when you tell me you're spending hours consuming content i spend hours consuming content another thing that tells me you consume a lot of content is i'm looking at your thumbnails and it tells me you have an eye for what's happening out there and what works now the problem might be you might be spending too much time consuming content yeah i i feel like that is the issue right so there's too much outside noises in your head instead of you going internal and creating stuff okay internal requires you to go inside and stop outside all right creation is a really weird thing it happens from within yeah okay when you're playing the piano and you're feeling yourself you know what what's happening at that moment it's just silence in you nobody around you saying anything in your ears you enjoying it and you're feeling it right there's a certain energy that's there like right now you're thinking about it you're smiling you're feeling happy you're in your flow state right yeah your hands moving and hitting the keys at what shows me you're passionate about it the work that's the work right yep so like you have to take your wants that you want like i had one team member a while ago on my team and he came up to me and he's like hey i want you to pay me more i said okay that's great um i'm like i'd love to um why should i pay you more he's like i want to help my parents and when he started saying that he started crying tears coming out of his eyes he's like i want to help my parents i want to change their lives i want to like make more money so i can help them blah blah blah he said all these things yeah i looked at him i had tears coming out of my eyes what did you think i said to him zack hmm i would think yes i looked him in his face and i was extremely sad and i looked him dead in his eyes and i said you're lying he wouldn't be coming in at 11 30 strolling in to work 11 30 a.m when i'm the ceo and i'm starting work at 5 or 7 a.m right he wouldn't be leaving before everybody else leaves like he wouldn't be you know like and so that's the thing the actions are the truth you can want something you can feel emotional about it but like if people who have done you can't lie to them like yeah so like you have to treat yourself the same way don't lie to yourself either because it'll start with yourself then your boundaries will get stretched and everything will just feel fine at a certain point like yeah i want to do youtube i want to do this on and then like it's you start to spread your own boundaries of what you can do and what you can do even in a relationship right if somebody wants to be in a faithful relationship with their partner right and they're like i don't want you to cheat on me and it's actually one of the boundaries in the relationship and that will end it that's a fair enough boundary right for most relationships yeah right well what happens if you go ahead and cheat anyway and she lets you come back and be in the relationship or he lets you come back and be in the relationship what is that that's stretching the boundary that's stretching the boundary right eventually what happens is that your partner's selfesteem goes to negative 1 000. selfconfidence drops to negative 1 000. and then you're you create a codependent weird relationship that has no boundaries and right and so just it gets downhill from there same thing we start doing with ourselves we're like one we want to do youtube then we're like all right we're gonna do it then we do it and then we like stop doing it and we say we're and it happens in many many other areas of your life it's not just happening in youtube bro it's happening many other areas of your life probably right now where you're like there are things that you want to do and you like mean to do and you know they're going to change your life but then you get on them and you stop them right so it starts to become a pattern and so that's what i want you to be careful about because you have so much potential i can see it in your eyes i know you have so much hunger but now your work has to actually match it or you need to be called out on it and you need to call yourself out on it with love with love with the with the beautiful smile like you have right thank you but truth and the actual work yeah okay i agree so you know when you check next week and the amount of hours you spent scrolling on instagram or youtube or greater than the amount of hours you spent on your own youtube i can't help you there's not a single soul in the world that can help you okay yep okay so what are you gonna do as a result of this conversation i'm going to make sure i don't you know spend too much time you know just like not overdoing the whole um youtube cool so not doing is a difficult vague task it's not clear oftentimes we lack clarity not motivation so like if you pick a task that's vague it's going to be difficult to actually execute on it because what does it actually mean right like maybe you're sitting there and you're like does it mean i don't just use it in the bathroom but then i can use youtube when i'm like outside of the bathroom waiting in line you see what i mean so it's like it's not clear so like let's set a clear goal of like maybe not even a gold something you're running away from let's maybe set a goal of what you want to run towards okay okay is that fair enough yeah what can you run towards what is one action that you can do and i don't like to think about actions a week from now that's because that's just not gonna happen or that just tells me that you're not serious about it and you don't want it right okay so what's an action that you're gonna do to make sure that you're actually focusing on youtube right after this zoom call is over shoot a video that's what the i'm talking about guys everybody give him a round of applause that that is money right there okay zach and okay so like right now that came to my mind go ahead like since he's doing a piano right it's not about something programming or anything it's piano what he can do is like just simply just do a time lapse like since he plays piano every day he can just simply record that and upload it on youtube you know yes that's a fantastic way to start okay or okay what i want you to do is the only thing i want you to add is when the video starts just be like guys i'm going to be playing the cover of xyz and then just show me the you actually playing it okay all right that's what i want to see from you i have so much hope for you i have so much faith in you because i can see hope in your eyes and i can see that smile and it lights up everybody's day here i just want you to put in the work behind it because i'm desperate for you to actually get the results that will follow after you put in the work all righty thank you okay i love you dude so much thank you so much for jumping thank you for this opportunity i really appreciate it got it beautiful all right thank you all right awesome so do you guys enjoy that by the way yeah that was again the darkest but the lightest rose that was somebody has echo going on so maybe yeah okay there we go thank you thank you thank you thank you i appreciate that but yeah exactly it got really quiet in here because we had one of the mods uh mute everyone so i got quiet so if you want to speak again you can unmute yourself and then mute but yeah it's funny thank you guys i i'm glad you guys enjoyed that it was like dark roast mixed with like love and so you know he wanted he said to me ultra dark roast so that's what ultra dark roast looks like like it's we kind of get in there okay so if you're looking for that um then we can get into it so um it's it's a work we're both working here i'm working you're working like we're not taking you know there's no timeoffs here all right cool so i'll take um let's see here who do you want to take next uh stacy did i go over your stuff yet no i think she's amused okay so i'll go not yet i'm ready okay stacy so let's do it what type of what are you looking for medium media okay medium got it all right here we go hello dance i'm about to pop a squat right here guys and get ready to tell you a little bit about putting together this algebra app today nice great intro okay so yes i would remove the uh again i'm gonna again i'm gonna try to go fast so like if you guys have to take notes you can if you want to i mean this video is going to be up there anyway but if you want to take notes it's more internal as you can i would remove this thing because it's confusing and i don't know what it is i would just like not have it ever in any video ever again i'm coming to you live and in person i love your energy i love your smile i love the way you speak i want to see your face in every video this time um i want to give you an introduction on this channel since this is my first nice good music great music i would lower it a little bit so i can hear your beautiful voice over the music extremely clearly okay stacy okay first video and i just want to um get to know you guys we don't want to be pill and paddling with this additional subtraction you've got um you have your buttons and everything import so that's the module that will be great so now that you're getting into the technical stuff i'm loving it nice you're making a tekinter app with python i love it great uh i would reduce the audio i'm sorry the music by a lot i'm loving how you have yourself here so a lot of you guys are doing screencasts guys your personality is a gift stop hiding yourself um you so like put that like you're the ultimate asset so use it you know like seriously use it like i'm i'm so crazy about like selfesteem and all this stuff i think it's the most important gift that it can give you making youtube videos and stuff and then how it plays out in a like over your entire life is just massive right like you start developing low selfesteem then you have kids then they develop low selfesteem and then your daughter is dating somebody who's abusive because your daughter can't put boundaries because she doesn't have selfesteem like it plays out in really awful ways use youtube to like boost up your selfconfidence and selflove and praise and reduce judgment on yourself learn to look at yourself and be happy right like learn to look at your face in a video and like actually stop judging yourself so there's there's such a beautiful opportunity for growth here internally like you know and then the external results will follow too so if you want to do it selfishly like how do i make the fastest money or subscribers the same way like if you actually work on your selfesteem and all of that you're gonna get the most amount of sales the most amount of youtube views the most amount of followers you know because people want to follow people who they would like or who they want to be like so that's the fastest way to grow so i would i don't know if this thing stays there the whole time stacy if it stays there for a limited amount of time that's okay i wouldn't leave it there the whole time okay um i like where you are at here and coding that i love um i would somehow figure out a way to maybe increase a resolution on the screen is it a windows laptop yes windows okay well yeah okay cool all right nice job with the comment below i love that you're giving me a reason to engage you're giving me a ton of value i like that you're annotating on the screen makes it very clear for me what to do um the only way the only way i would improve it is i would remove this pop code maker stuff i really don't know what that is it stays just for so long um and i would show your app in the start so like we're gonna be making a calculator app with python and then i would actually show i would recommend showing it in the first five to nine seconds okay other than that great energy great video great job nice job let's give her a round of applause guys oh that was a good medium real stick yep you got it you got it awesome thank you for jumping on uh okay let's go misha misha misha um are you here misha yeah or is it meecha how do you say it okay yeah actually the full name is michael but just because okay cool here we go um guys let's keep spotlighting okay so i spotlighted okay cool so here we go i'm gonna take a look at your page now okay um and what type of roast are you looking for light roast medium rose dark roast what are you looking for or anything espresso okay cool actually i i started this channel today but oh yeah nice good job that's amazing yeah awesome three hours ago i see it all right so let's see here so i'll just start spitting out what i think and then you if you want to take notes go for it okay okay um oh so this video is about how to download high quality videos from youtube okay cool yeah um so i would so like nobody cares about this because they don't know this so i would not have this being there at all okay your face is already here so you're the brand so you don't need to also have this so like this is great and you got a beautiful face so just that's perfect right there i would remove this and i would make this much bigger okay um i would make this white text much bigger so it takes up like maybe a lot of space like this okay um and then i would just have like a youtube logo so if i if any of you guys yeah i mean if you guys want to go really far with it you guys can sometimes even send me a thumbnail image and then sometimes i might just make something on the fly to give you an example but yeah i would i would have the youtube logo right here like that i would not use pink background because it makes it hard to read i would use like a black background or a white background and then i would have the text like download youtube videos for free something like that or just like download videos so the less text you can have the better on a thumbnail okay that's crazy other than that great thumbnail and then let's get into the title is good how to download high quality videos from youtube easy two ways for free so title is good nice great start today nice today what i'm gonna be talking about i'm three seconds in nice smile standing in front of the camera talking confidently good posture from youtube in the first step i'm going to show you how you can eventually i want you to invest in a mic right now it's okay just keep going with this youtube software to download video from youtube and in the second step i will show you how you can use a third party software what i like to do in the start of the video is just like pop in few things so for example if you say youtube pop up the youtube logo right here like an image that's it right then when you say download uh drop a download image you know like a logo of download and what download looks like just drop that right here and maybe just like text come up comes up right here that says download you know just for a few seconds while you're talking as you say those things to download videos from youtube in this twist i will show you how you can download a high resolution and high quality videos great on youtube i know the tricks i'm going to show you will blow your mind off nice i love that i know the tricks i'm gonna show you're gonna blow your mind you're like also foreshadowing what's gonna come you're keeping me excited for what's to come that's great so let's get into it so this is the part where you're gonna lose me and a lot of people um just speak this you know it's not a slideshow so you might lose people with so much text don't have so much text just see you can speak this part also it's really hard to read this it's really hard like to use font that's easy to read because this font is very like weird all right guys okay so yeah resolution is really hard to see um like you see what i'm talking about like it's really hard for me to read anything really hard so uh you gotta do it in a way where i can read stuff so i would work on increasing the resolution when you export the video because it's like really hard to read okay cool um other than that great job you're dropping valuable content you got a great thumbnail i would just improve the video uh video quality okay that's the number one thing i can give you great job awesome give him a round of applause guys awesome job awesome awesome awesome great great okay cool um who wants to go next oh wait okay let me see we got joey we got zach elson let's go with zach because i don't think i did anything with zach elson um camera on perfect beautiful there's zach nice sitting sitting with vimhoff i like it let's go medium roast all right medium roast cool here we go it's like people want the dark roast um okay cool so here we go we got managing anaconda environments okay great i mean it's hard to go wrong with technical content you it's like that's what i love about technical content like it just works because people like need it it's kind of like needing medicine you need medicine you know even if the receptionist isn't the best you'll still buy your advil because you need your headache to be gone or something you know so like technical content people just need it like they need water so hard to go wrong with it i would thumbnail is a lot going on so i would what i would recommend again is an image of you on the right side and an image of anaconda or jupiter or something on the left hand side generally that's what i recommend it works really really well it's just the easiest and the cleanest thing stay away from so much text on your thumbnail there's tons of text create a new anaconda environment load the kernel into jupiter anaconda individual edition tutorial python3 python data change like there's a lot of text in this whole thing is tons of text so i would simplify it by just having your face a logo and one word face logo in one word generally is like one of the best cleanest ways to do it all right let's go into the video hello and welcome to you where i try and break down data analytic practices into easy to understand and digestible bits a great intro fantastic intro to hopefully make them a little bit simpler you may have recently installed the anaconda package for machine learning or data analytics nice but you don't really know where to start you may have seen something about anaconda environments but don't really understand them yep in this video i'm going to try and do a simple straightforward look at managing the environments and how to use them so i like that where he's like empathizing with me where he's like hey you might have downloaded it but you might have been confused about what's the step that happens next yes always whenever i dealt with anaconda uh because i'm in the code like i'll you know i'm a developer so like when i was learning programming i always had trouble with this so when you say that it is great great and slideshows you can't go wrong with them if you guys have slideshows those videos do really well why do you use the environments or so really a lot of time being quiet i would change that i would make sure that i'm like now you're taking me to really black screens psychologically and emotionally for a human being it's not very fun to look at this how many of you guys are like your eyes are having fun looking at this it's glazed over already yeah like a developer so like uh this is why in my videos i try to even make my terminal look like it's fun right like when i turn my terminal as ton of colors and it's like exciting to look at um this is exciting to look at this isn't so if you take me to this at least use your voice or talk or do something where it's moving it otherwise i'm you're gonna lose me around here so just to create your first environment so my feedback is the start is really really good i love the slides and i love how you don't just completely start the technical part right like away you kind of wait a little bit and you warm me up to it and then you get into it i would just increase the energy just the quickest hack i can give you is increase your energy and like literally even if you start saying what you're doing helps so all right guys we're gonna work on this boom and then if you're really messing up or really slowing down it really just doesn't have any movement to it you can add really light music in the background oh wait other packages oh you're here at the bottom right what the i didn't see you there so he's right there um if we want to let's say so i would put me like much bigger or you know um some were visible you know so like i would put myself where like because then you give me you to look at so i would put it here or here but bigger you know much bigger because where you put yourself nobody looks there you won't be seen i'm just trying to not cover the code and so i wanted to make sure i was out of the frame you'll be fine you'll be fine uh and in editing sometimes if it you do really block it you can move it a little bit in in like you know in post you can move yourself for something so um but you'll be fine there's usually not that much happening on that side of the screen jupiter notebook so let's go ahead and close it other than that good technical video just keep making more okay okay great job great job um okay let's give him a round of applause guys zach nice awesome great work fantastic okay who wants to go next who wants to go next i'll go next i own act let's go okay all right i'll open up your video so the older ones i just used for like social proof and the two new videos are kind of what i'm trying to do oh this is you oh dude this is gonna be a good one thank you i spent over 1 000 in collectibles and i'm talking about sports cards and comic books i mean yeah you're gonna win but the pokemon type that's going on right now with celebrities like logan paul and logic starmie two cards left charizard you're doing it on something that's trending extremely relevant it's very entertaining so far i was hooked right in the start did you guys feel you were hooked right in the start yes yeah so i have a confession i spent over 1 000 in collectibles so i have a confession i spent over 1 000 in collectibles four seconds in i'm hooked i'm talking about sports cards and comic books but the pokemon now you got gary vee and a simpson reference so like now i'm in because i might not know you i might not even pay that much attention to pokemon but garyvee and other things one hype that's going on right now with celebrities like logan paul and live when you do logan paul i'm in i know logan paul i watch his i'm in and then you throw logic so that's another big one for a lot of people so guys this is called borrowed authority like even if you like if you start your video and you start talking about bill gates and melinda gates and like tony robbins and steve jobs like all of a sudden i'm paying attention to you because you've almost borrowed their authority social proof because i'm like oh this person is going to say some relevant stuff because i know those people it's crazy but it works starmie two cards left hit the notification bell it's the best way to awesome support this channel and allows me to give you guys as much free value as i can every day and what type of roast are you looking for bro um harsh as possible i'm really just trying to like improve as quickly as i can like i i think i can be good at doing youtube videos but just anything that could possibly help me grow faster is what i'm asking for um okay cool so let's go here yeah the older videos are more for like social proof that i used to film back then so i don't really count those as good quality content and then if you can maybe give me like some marketing tips possibly i'll be very helpful if anything can i say something sure yes i honestly from the look of it i think it's pretty good channel and his video would be like if i was to watch it be very entertaining to watch that's just like from my perspective i think he's doing a really great job yes thank you i'm gonna continue off of that so uh ioneck um your biggest problem here is um you have you made two videos yeah so you are you're like one of those channels that's gonna blow the up you're one of those channels i appreciate it thank you what i would tell you to improve in your videos improve your video quality because it seems like you're really shooting with a webcam which you you probably are right webcam yes so i would improve the video uh the video quality uh what are you doing for the audio your audio sounded decent uh typing out uh notes on a notepad uh for the i'm doing a yeti yeah your audio sounded good so your audio is good your it's your video i would improve but don't make that a thing that stops you from making more videos okay so keep going um outside of that dude you are gonna kill it you just have to keep going there's no marketing tactic there's no strategy there's no hack there's no youtube ad thing that i'm gonna tell you that's gonna you have to just go you have to keep going like for example right even if i run youtube ads to my youtube channel it's gonna temporarily flood traffic but that's not going to do then it just ends so like i might get 4 000 views but then it just ends the way you actually grow on a platform is if you make good content for the platform that by itself keeps growing if your is dependent on you having to go to facebook groups to promote it it's never gonna grow it's temporary does that make sense so like um as advice from you you just recommend just having patience from what i'm understanding and just kind of just just hustle them right it's called so i will give you the ultimate thing okay you want the ultimate secret to it yes please okay it's called the magic 70. i want you to write that down on your paper right now okay the magic 70. my notepad yeah okay this is the most important rule that has helped me and is with guaranteed results like i i have had this rule for not just for myself and all multiple other people even my clients that helped them grow to like over hundreds of thousand subscribers and they've done millions of dollars of revenue and started from complete zero the magic 70 rule is the ultimate thing that has had them be successful and me be successful okay what this rule is and i'm going to say it in a harsh way but this is just how my brain thinks and it's just like shut the up for 70 videos and just go for 70 videos just shut the up and do the actual work 70 about 70 videos in is where you'll start seeing breakthroughs it might happen earlier it might but 70 videos is like i don't look at success when i look at people's channels i'm not looking at do you have 71 views you have 150 views you have 5 000 views on a video 10 000. i'm like did this person produce 70 videos what's the goal like look at the actual make the number of videos your guys's goal if you set a goal like subscribers or viewers it's so random it's not in your control do you guys does that make sense guys like for example if you set a goal of having an eight pack somebody can genetically a lot of people on the planet can't genetically even have a eight pack so if you set a goal that's in numbers and subscribers you're just bound to be unhappy set goals on in terms of your process set goals in terms of quantity and then hit those goals and you will dominate so your guys's goals should it be i want to get to 2 000 subscribers by the end of this month i'm gonna your goal should be i want to make 15 i commit to making 15 or 30 videos this month see what i'm saying so that goal is actually going to be the thing that leads to the ultimate results the the processbased goal so like for you if you have a lot more videos and you're going you're gonna crush okay ionic i want you to commit to something here and i want you to think about it but i want you to give us a goal that you commit to for the month of not even december not even something far off in the month of november how many more videos are you going to produce i want to um i'm trying as best as i can because i have like a business i'm running on the side but i try to make a goal to at least do one video how much okay so this business that you're doing on the side what is it why you're doing it how passionate you are about it and how much are you making from it uh for that i so i used to sell like tours and stuff when i was doing that i was making around four grand a month and for this side business with flipping cards and everything else it maybe comes out now i'm taking like a small pay cut of like two grand a month just selling in person but i'm trying to scale up and use the uh youtube platform to basically do my marketing to sell some sort of product it's just a lot of hustle work and ground work that i understand that i know you went through and it's like a shitton dude it's like 6080 hours a week so it's tons of tons of work in the initial beginning that i have to do but to get to your uh answer your question i'm planning on doing at least one video a week if i can have more time opened up okay i'll tell you this if you sucked at videos uh and you had a long way to go i would tell you just do your other job as much as you can and do this within a very limited amount of time you're killer at videos i'm not saying this to blow smoke up your ass or whatever and i also don't want you to just listen to it and just be like oh now i'm not gonna do anything with it what this means is you need to lean into this as hard as like no it's not a matter of if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen like i'm not literally i'm not trying to motivate you like my goal here is not to motivate you i know that this is gonna happen because i see your channel and it's actually good videos good thumbnails the videos dialed in go the other way bro try to maximize this as much as you can give up the short term cash for a little bit this will be the fastest explosion to your revenue goals or whatever goals you have right now you're making two thousand dollars a month is that what you said yeah two thousand with no job just selling um how much how much do you need to just purely survive every month um i i try to aim for three to four that's my thing how much not even a goal how much do you need to just pay the bills and like eat food and 1500 1600 okay like little less than two do whatever it takes to make 1600 and every single other second i want you to just put into this 100 they're so close to blowing up you don't even know it but just like going to this hardest dude like seriously thank you yeah thank you very much all right brother awesome love it take care um okay let's go with yeah um ionic we didn't get a chance for this but drop your intention for what you plan to do this week as a result of this conversation so like set a specific goal in zoom chat and if somebody can amana you can read it out loud once you see it um i want to see you actually taking action on it because the the worst thing is hearing something feeling something and not like actually taking action on it that's the worst thing so um set some kind of intention for this week so then you can actually put it into motion all right let's go with um who is okay caitlyn i'll go with caitlyn and she's dark roast all right caitlyn you're up oh here we go hi here we go i saw you like wake up i saw you like do everything then you're like started driving i saw you drive like i mean i've been through your whole day already like we've been doing i've been running around the whole day yeah it's like it's like a vlog um joining with me yeah there you go so let's take a look at this i'm gonna click it and uh let's uh and i'm gonna hit share screen in just a second here we go oh boy how's it going guys my name is kate and i'm going to be talking to you guys about codecademypro and big question we all want to know why there are so many outlets right behind me is it worth it just kidding just kidding okay so hey so okay you want you want a dark roast but i will i will just do what feels fair to me okay okay so start how's it going guys start is great there's something with your camera is it like is it not focusing on your face like is it out of focus it was um a transition that i thought looked question i guess it's questionable but it was a transition that i added no no no no like i mean like even right now it looks like it's not your face doesn't look like completely in focus frankie am i making this up doesn't look like yeah it's like there's something oh you mean oh is is it so not a transition you mean like you added an effect to make it a little blurrier or what no in the very beginning i added a transition but i don't know about right now it shouldn't be blurry do you guys feel like the face is a little bit blurry you guys yeah i think it's focusing on your hand motion okay um now it looks a little bit more in focus actually so not not the end of the world okay let me actually give you what i think i think fantastic energy i'll let you know nice i like that we all want to know i would project more your voice you're a very kind person and i can feel like you're soft like you're softhearted and like you're a little bit quieter on the quieter spectrum i would project louder okay okay thank you because i want to hear your voice you have a great voice you have great personality great charisma i would project louder academy pro and big question we all want to know how's it going guys my name is kate and i'm going to be talking to you guys about co pro i like that right in the start you tell me what's going to be happening so like i'm i complimented that about a few people's because the worst thing is like not knowing what's happening right in the start um the same thing i'll tell you is that first four seconds i would swap it them first right like so so you say hey guys i'm you say who you are first and then you address what's in it for the audience address what's in it for the audience first so swap okay it's a little mindset shift but it's actually a really deep level shift because um essentially you're thinking about yourself first an audience second and then it comes out in your video not again not um any of this stuff like i want you to hear me because you're a very kind person so when you hear my things you might actually take them really to heart so just understand that i'm it's micro it's a tiny thing okay so just a little swap bro and big question we all want to know is it worth it i'll let you well cool let's all get there it's okay caitlyn i love it you have to do it you have to you have to do it you have to own it you got to keep going and you got to keep doing it more and more and then there will be one day where the timing is right and it punches in and punches out at the right time so like little hacks i can tell you so like you did a joke and you want to make it land so what like the big props i'll give you is you actually executed it so great job on that okay so you have to thank yourself for that later you'll start learning how to actually make it land so like for example a few things that can be happening is you can keep playing the music and you'll be like what's it worth you can take you can pull out the music when you're saying was it worth it oh see what i'm saying another thing you can do is you can punch in so like when you're editing you can zoom into your face more for that one bit so you're yeah see what i'm saying so the whole point of your joke is it's a pattern interrupt right it's like so guys today we're going to be talking about codecademy pro and the one question that we all have on your mind punch in was it really worth it stop like stop the music punch in as soon as my joke lands punch out start the music again just that you see it oh yeah that would that would totally that would sell it a lot better right so just little things but the biggest thing you have to thank yourself taking the effort and taking those shots okay so let's go back cool i would fasten up just a tiny bit because it's a little long especially if it's in every video it ends up taking a lot of time here is my personal co academy pro um and but they um so i would recommend you get a yeti mic yeti pro or yeti some type of yeti i'm imagining you're using your laptop's mic here it was actually some like it's called like an irig i think it was actually a mic so oh perhaps i probably wasn't close enough though oh okay pretty cool this cute little quiz okay okay that is part of the free version as well so one thing i don't know why so here's one thing i'll tell you sometimes people like that mic to not be in the video actually what i think is i think it's actually cooler that for the mic to show like i actually think it's cooler i actually put it you guys see me with my mic right like i actually enjoy it i think it makes the video look better um so all right okay so yeah i was trying to hide it right so if you're not feel free to put it in the video if you want audio quality is more important than video quality so 60 emphasis i put on audio and 40 on the video so that's why on ionex video i'm like okay with him using a webcam because his audio quality is good and then his video is good so like i don't really mind it that much like viewers don't mind it but if your audio quality is lacking it's like this uh it's distracting because especially if you're trying to teach me something technical i don't want to like fight to hear you and understand what you're saying i'm an engineer back end engineer a lot of background noise i would uh yeah full stack but i just had so much fun great personality like you feel it like what you're saying you're like i just had so much fun doing it i love that because it takes me through what we're doing i hate when people are just monotonous and just like a machine i personally it stops me from going these challenge projects are openended projects where they pretty much i think that your channel if you go it it it can be one of those like landmines that can blow up few things i would change about it um if you and i are friends and we're sitting and literally we're sitting at like the lunch table or the dinner table i'm just looking your face and i'm like yo what do you need to do to make your video just work and hit home few things audio is probably the best thing i can give you like get it today you have a nice apple watch i know you can afford it so get it today um get a yeti it won't cost you more than 70 bucks it'll be here today if you get it with amazon prime or by by latest tomorrow so the first thing yeti yeti mike i would keep it up close so i make sure the audio is good i would put the gain almost on zero you guys see how close i am to my mic like i'm making out with my mic you guys see this how close i am to it it's important for you to be like audio quality is so important it helps you actually pay attention and get through it so make sure that you're up and close to your mic and i reduce the gain to zero that way you guys won't hear that hum and hot like the background room noise oh okay gain to zero yeah i put my gain to zero i just like literally just kill it completely you can have it a little bit if you want but i just say get closer and speak like that and so i would add audio outside of that i would have you speak just either a little bit louder um and that would be good sometimes there are pauses that are happening that are a little bit on the longer side so either you can edit that out or you can just work on improving your energy so like engage with me more and tell me more jokes so keep it going or get it then sit afterwards and edit like you don't have to go crazy edit every single pause you could edit some of like the big ones out that you feel like reduce the flow to slow down the flow of the video okay other than that yeah i'm pretty bad at talking so no no don't say that you're good at talking you're really good oh okay why does it say there's no videos because i only have one oh it's unlisted oh yeah i have it unlisted just because i i still have to fix my channel and upload the banner and stuff okay so here's the most important part of this journey where we come to okay we can't move forward on this call until this one thing happens but i want from you caitlyn so i want you to go right now and please make that video public really without the banner and all of that yes yes oh okay i can do that right now cool like really right now okay like yeah like really right like literally like we're all waiting on you and we're looking at you no no pressure no pressure well you're lucky i had it open okay i just made it i made it live oh you did did i i think oh okay i was gonna play some music let's see okay so share there wait what i i reached wait it's on mine what is happening we got scammed i don't see it no it's on mine i did refresh many times probably cash oh thank you for subscribing man why can't i oh my god thank you guys why can't i never see this video hold on i need to get to this video it's very important for me i have to see it i don't believe anybody they could all be lying um can you link it can you link it again caitlyn oh i see it i see the channel hold on one second now we're gonna take a look at it oh it got 11 views hey hey let's go guys give it up for caitlyn all right caitlyn nice thank you guys so much yes we love it um and i'll subscribe to the channel i think some of us have subscribed to the channel i'm going to tell you something and um this is important okay did the world explode when you hit public i mean kind of in a good way though you all liked it right there we go so here's the crazy things we think that hitting public or publish is kind of like hitting like a detonate button and there's a lot that happens it's like weird how anticlimactic it is like nothing happens when you actually hit public like literally nothing happens like i've made so many videos there was never a single time a really cool thing happened when i hit public it's always like literally like crickets it's like quiet and i just hit public okay i guess publish now okay moving on so um sometimes you'll put on a pedestal what i want you to for you caitlyn like in terms of the dark roast i'll give it with love for you the most important part that i want you to work on is like just you have a great personality of a great charisma you have great energy i want you to stop beating yourself up i want you to work on the little phrases like little tiny phrases like oh like i don't know how to talk like ah you know what i mean more love for yourself less questioning hit publish and just move forward okay like how did you guys think how was her video guys if you guys liked her video just let me know like would you enjoy the video just make a sound of you enjoying the video like whoa was it awesome like clap how was your video it was good it was good great it was awesome it was awesome i subscribed right thank you so right now right now it's good because you're getting like social validation from us but i want you to not need that okay got it because you're not gonna have it most of the times and if you pay too much attention to our social validation then you're also gonna pay attention to the negative validation like the negative side of it okay so i want you to uh for creating i want you to go extremely internal and don't look outward so for example if you have an idea just get excited about the idea then just make the idea then hit publish and move on never um i'm a big believer and never redo only iterate and improve this okay so like never remake this video when i get better ever okay never ever ever you might have a you might think you want to delete it you want to make no that's going backwards right like when you learned how to walk your mom didn't like remove your memories of like you not knowing how to walk before that it's just an evolution it's an iteration every day you become a bet like different better more evolved version of yourself that's how your channel is going to be it's a very living and breathing thing but you have to accept all those moments where you fall off the bike and eat see what i'm saying so like yeah just hit publish go on to the next one any improvements you want to make never go backwards move forwards and add those improvements to your second video right okay then the third video so great job caitlyn i'm excited for you thank you so much i appreciate all your feedback thank you for coming on i appreciate you all right guys let's give it up for caitlyn and let's go on to one more okay make one video per week hit 52 videos by the end of the year focus more time into video making beautiful that's great great job ionic yeah give it up for him guys great job ionic that's a great goal i love it um one video a week is a good goal 52 videos when you guys get like when you quantify that's good i want you to play all out but i want you to set the expect like i want you to expect that until your 70th video nothing is gonna happen for you i want you to like in a weird way expect that i want you to play all out and believe that youtube can change your life but at the same time i want you to expect that you're not even going to get 100 subscribers by your 70th video i mean i know you already have 418 but like that's how i want you to think then what happens is now you've created maximum amount of room of happiness almost like everything is going to make you happy and keep moving you forward you can't do better than the best that you can do would you guys agree yeah i agree but because by the definition is the best that you can do so if you set the expectations to negative and then just do the best that you can do you see how much room you guys have created for happiness like everything in between is happiness but if you set it the other way where you're not going to be happy until you get to 10 000 subscribers then it's a very unhappy journey all the way there and then so um process based goals are king all right we're gonna take one more question um what i want to say is i hope that you guys can see how you can get past your 1000 subscribers and hopefully you guys can even see how you can get past your one thousand dollars you could make from youtube it requires you to just keep going there's a bajillion different ways and i'm gonna take on one more person but what i do want to say is like who's showing up here for day four of the challenge for tomorrow we plan out your first one million dollars how to make your first one million dollars from youtube who's going to

the facebook live streams so ibrahim i didn't get a chance to touch with them hey ibrahim how you doing brother angela alhamdulillah nice awesome you have a video okay cool let's take a look at it nice he knows about that hack so he he dropped the link with the subscribe thing popping up that's cool so um if you guys send the link with with the with it ending in a question mark and this it automatically pops up people um to subscribe i mean it's just a little hack um focus on just making good content like avoid uh but this is good i would do the same thing so cool all right okay um okay so time to we're gonna get into feedback on this thing i don't know this language so french french okay cool do we have english let's see so i know that these are not exactly same translation but for four like gold or amazing businesses to launch quickly in 2021 without money that's a great title great title uh thumbnails you have too much going on your thumbnails so i would avoid that i would avoid like english caption i would avoid adding this logo here um i would this is good and your face here is good that's really good um yeah so less like make it less text okay for your thumbnails make it less it'll perform better you're doing a great job with titles so i think that you got a good idea on what what titles will work oh nice oh nice that's something to do oh man i love the hustle and it's hot right like are you were you like physically hot was there a lot of heat when you were making the video dude i love it a dancer video oh man let's go damn bro i'm feeling some type of way great man this is a great intro uh i would say the same thing that i bet i say to a lot of people i would uh speed up the intro a little bit i like that you're showing me different images with different words and it has this nice like it has a vibe like what i like about your intro is like it has a vibe to it so i can i can flow with it a little bit so i like that it emotionally keeps me going reduce but reduce how long it is it's like 20 seconds i would reduce it a little bit guys did you see that he tells you who he is one minute and 47 seconds in you guys see that yes it's a great way of doing it um you put yourself as later as you can or as last as you can do that all the time and you'll have a great business okay like be the last person to be fed i'll tell you guys something right uh we this year on track to make over 1.7 million dollars i make 5 000 a month i don't make more than 5 000 a month okay like ah like my their team like my team is making some people are making less money than me some people are making more money than me but my team makes more when we have to do everybody's salary and payments increase every single member on the team their pay is increased first let's see what i'm saying so like i will be the last who actually like gets a bump so like it comes out in my business when i'm like making a video and then it comes out on the team like when i actually have a business from it you know depending on whatever you want to do so that part is important so i like that you did that um i probably wouldn't have this like uh thing that's scrolling at the bottom like a news anchor um i mean it just looks too busy i wouldn't do that like if you want to say something have text some text pop up and then it goes away then have more text pop up what you're saying that is better than this like news anchor thing don't do that great and sometimes if you're speaking you can add an image here of what you're talking about so if you're talking about money you could have like a image of money pop up right here yeah so that you can do that too images are better than text okay so more images other than that great intro great energy um great video oh wait is that actually there or is that an image yeah it's an image oh my god that's cool nice that's good try to do more of this stuff in the start if you can try to add more of this in the start so like it makes a video it makes me it tells me oh there's going to be a lot of things that are going to be covered in this video that are going to be awesome so like even when you're introing the video you'll be like guys we're going to be talking about this we're going to be talking about freelancing we're going to be talking about farming try to add the broll in the start okay okay overall other than that great great videos i think this channel is going to work you just have to keep going okay 70 videos don't complain until 70 videos cool awesome all right guys give it up for ibrahim that was
