when this is Kazi from clever programmer comm and today I have an interview this is going to be really really valuable for every single one of you watching this I'm bringing on Miss brandy Morgan I actually found her from Instagram and I thought her profile was awesome but it turns out she's an incredible freelancer software developer and a designer and she's figured it out herself so today I want to be bringing her on on this platform I'm gonna be asking her a lot of questions and then you guys in the chat can be asking questions too and dropping them and we'll just straightup try to bring you guys as much in value as possible what's going on miss brandy Morgan hi yes I can hear you so nice to have you on here we're absolutely shooting this too so this is gonna be on YouTube which is gonna be super awesome yeah so this is awesome I ain't read you a little bit and I just I told everybody that you're a developer you're also a designer and you've been doing freelancing but just jump in feel free to drop in like about yourself so everybody could get context around what it is that you do and who you are and everything like that yeah Oh beautiful yeah my friend who's any lives he's one of my best friends and he has a YouTube channel what's Deb and he does JavaScript that's primarily what he's doing so you started so you started from email marketing you were doing digital marketing what caused the shift into becoming a developer for you why did you want him why do why do you want to learn programming they say passions aren't born out of love they're born out of hate sometimes you know so right so it's almost like you had so much pain around here you're like I'm just gonna learn myself so I love that now what happened talk to me about once you got into coding what happened after that did you eventually leave your job to start freelancing did you find a role at that job as a developer what happened how was that transition I'm very curious hold on one second so you left your job and then he jumped into college wait so talk to me about that like what did you just already have money sitting in the back or was there somebody supporting you what made it so easy for you to just jump out like that now this school specialized in coding specifically or was it giving you like general classes as well okay so now you go to this pro you go to the school you pick up coding skills now how did you take those and did you turn that into freelancing jobs for yourself or getting fulltime jobs as a developer how did that turn out okay got it and that's that's a fulltime job or was that a freelancing okay God and your and then what were you doing with them as a developer yeah and when you were working on these projects with them also talk to me about because a lot of developers say they feel this imposter syndrome they feel that they're never good enough most of the time so did you feel like oh but them about to work on this view j/s project I'm about to work for them I don't think I'm good enough did you experience that 100% and from there were you getting other freelancing job opportunities and did you start doing other freelancing work or have you been working with them you know i okay that's incredible I love that that's a very I mean to me a few of the things that I've really gotten out here that I think would be really valuable to people is like I love the fact that you were just up and ready to drop a job like you had a job as a marketer and you you were like I think I like this development thing so I'm gonna go do no digital marketer or marketer in the right mind with just up and leave especially when somebody's comfortable and they have a job they don't want to do that so I love that you just took a risk like that and then went into a school and it took loans so that I actually really admire and they're I think a lot of people you have to be selfaware and then from there you work and from there the other big thing that I got out of it is like the power of relationships like the next fulltime job that you got or the next freelancing thing that you got was from a teacher then the next fulltime job you got was from relationships and then the next freelancing job at the startup that you were talking about you God also because your husband knew somebody and that led you in the door now they wouldn't keep you there for nine months and help you build a version one if you sucked right they wouldn't keep you there but like that really helps and I feel that a lot of developers and people just missed that you know I think so so I'm curious what are your thoughts on developers in general and their soft skills like because I think it's one of the weak skills that most developers have they're mostly introverted and they undervalue that so in your opinion how do you value the soft skills what's your opinion on just the whole thing yep I totally agree I think that is you're right that is one of these skills that needs to at the forefront of everybody's
