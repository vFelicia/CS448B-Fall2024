fourteen billion nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine rust bucks and ninety nine rush cents code like the wind my lady okay that was not that funny i mean i don't really get it but ah let's get going yo what's up guys i was inspired and i thought how about if i make a video and in today's video we're actually going to be reacting to a scene from silicon valley where algel foil guilfoyle actually debugs code so we're going to jump into it let's see how it is i want you to go ahead smash that like button but right before we get into this video subscribe to the channel because this is the channel where you're going to be learning all things full stack development this is your boy and this is a developer react series let's get straight into it oh okay so apparently they're a bunch of developers they're working overnight they're sleeping here um and you know there's somewhat truth to this because as developers you kind of do crazy sometimes and it does feel like that where you're coding for so long that you ended up sleeping but realistically at your actual job that's not what you're gonna see okay bunch of people sleeping that's not really real but okay it's funny let's keep going my merry knights of piper sir owen doing valiant battle with the authentication service yes good yeah oh and prithee becky my queen i'll go with cashless payments russ's pricing keeps tripping us up okay how so well this morning he decided everyone at russ fest should be a billionaire so every dollar someone puts into their account will now be worth one billion rust bucks zwoons so what like a sandwich will be worth 15 billion rest bucks or something 14 billion 999 million 999 999 rust bucks and 99 rush cents because he thought that would sound cheaper it's kind of screwing up the interface but the whole etnt deal is writing on this right we'll get there good okay excellent well uh code like the wind my lady okay that was not that funny i mean i don't really get it but ah let's get going oh good friar gabriel how does thou fare with the ticketing module it's gone what do you mean gone for some reason guilfoyle deleted the whole thing a few minutes ago what yeah okay that's really scary if you find out a developer just deleted something and you work with them or you were also working on that software and you walk in and they're just deleted the entire freaking repo or the code base is gone that's something to be stressed about foil yes richard i'm aware the drone dispatching code has been deleted and i'm working very hard to restore the right version whoa i love how deadpan he is you just told me that the ticketing module got deleted ticketing too so let's see what's going on so what it looks like is on the screens he has um so here i actually see he has the command line open uh on the left hand side it also looks like he has sublime text open on the right computer and there's like three sublime texts open i don't know why you would do that you would normally just have all the tabs open in one you know that gives it away you know i don't know just like a real developer situation going on because real developer i don't know that's i mean they get messy but uh most of the times that's not how you would do it but you know every developer is different and most developers just have their own setups and their own likings that's problematic i'll get on that next what the is going on based on the amount of work left to do and the number of hours left before the festival i decided to task son of anton to use machine learning to debug some of our code okay that's so debugging is already a nightmare it's one of the hardest things you can do in coding to take that one step further and have to debug um write a machine learning algorithm that debugs that's essentially machine trying to debug your code good luck you're gonna have a lot of trouble figuring out what went wrong can wear you kidding me you gave your ai permission to overwrite code in the internal file system were you gonna tell me about this no i thought that was the company policy these days okay so another thing to get out of this he makes the code changes and he doesn't even actually inform anybody now something important as a developer you're going to be working on a team with people one of the worst things that so many developers tend to do is they lack communication and that makes them a developer like guilfoyle where they're really good at what they do and they have three freaking sublime texts open but nobody freaking likes working with them so what happens when you do that well whenever somebody gets a chance they're gonna try to fire you you get in a really bad situation so you'd rather be a developer that's not the best but you have excellent communication skills and teamworking skills because at the end of the day if you're going to build anything great you got to do it with the team well your ai just failed epically that's unclear it's possible that son of anton decided that the most efficient way to get rid of all the bugs was to get rid of all the software which is technically and statistically correct but artificial neural nets are sort of a black box so will artificial neural nets are a actual black box never know for sure so now we get into this situation and this is super interesting to talk about if you have a developer that does something like this where they think that they're intellectually superior than everybody else which is pretty much all a stack overflow but if you have a developer that kind of thinks like this you are in a really difficult situation because they're going to get defensive when you try to talk to them about something they feel like their software is their own and if and because they spend so much time writing that code and working with that software if you're saying the software is bad they really think you're saying they are bad as human beings and so separating the two is very difficult now one thing he could have done when he was talking to guilfoyle is made him less defensive and instead of talking to him in such a harsh way and going could you believe that your code did this and i can't believe you did that you could be like hey you're an excellent developer you crush it at this job you're fantastic but just this one thing that happened i think this might be causing problems that would have made guilfoyle a lot less defensive and open up more so this is a tip for if you're working on a software development team and you have a colleague that's how you should approach it and that's how you should speak with them did you order meet like a bunch of meat like 4 000 pounds of meat interesting i put son of anton on finding us cheap hamburgers for lunch it looks like the reward function was a little underspecified okay that's hilarious so basically what happened is basically he's writing this machine learning algorithm and i like how he has like github octacat on the lefthand side what's funny that's happening here he has a machine learning algorithm and now machine learning algorithm is designed to you know where things get more rewarded does more of those things when you get less rewards for something it does less of those things that's how artificial intelligence works okay so if you taught artificial intelligence machine hey you get rewarded for surviving longer and you get not rewarded for dying off earlier it'll try to survive longer okay or it'll try to eat more food or attack more people whatever you teach it to do so scary he made this uh algorithm this algorithm got out of control and it started report being rewarded really highly for ordering food so it went and like ordered freaking 4 000 or 10 000 pounds of meat instead of just a little bit of meat reward function was a little underspecified okay that's why he said the reward function was a little underspecified which is a good idea for you to write unit tests for your code before you do them but a lot of developers that think they're better than everybody else sometimes will not write unit tests and do things directly which causes problems so one tell that you're a senior developer and you're excellent at your job they do tons of testing senior developers do so much freaking testing it's crazy before this put things into production so don't put things into production before testing now on son of anton is banned just write code like a normal human being please hey guilfoyle so i've been thinking about your ai and its many deficits i think son of anton's issue might be how it's handling reward uncertainty your issue man right that's the problem it's handling reward uncertainty in a poor way and so it's going crazy but again guilfoyle is getting defensive again the insecurity masked by false bravado and unisex cologne off it's not unisex oh man okay well that's all i had for you today guys you know if you want to become a developer and you want to learn more about this or if you enjoyed this video let me know this was the first of many developer react series i hope you enjoyed me reacting to silicon valley i hope it was entertaining you'll learn something and hopefully you're not going to order 10 000 pounds of meat with that said i love your beautiful face this is your boy kazzy and i'll see you in the next video
