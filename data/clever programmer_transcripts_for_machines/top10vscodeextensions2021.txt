hey what is up you guys it's david here from cleverprogrammer.com and today we are going to be talking about the 10 most useful and best extensions for vs code that you can possibly download today to make you more productive and make you a better developer before we get started i want you to go ahead and smash that like button for the youtube algorithm comment down below what you want me to go ahead and make a video on about next and i also want you to go ahead and check that link down below it is actually directing you to profit with javascript our number one course and probably the best javascript and react.js developer communities out there we have so many uh people who land their jobs at big companies such as paypal so i definitely want you to go ahead check it out and with that said let's roll that intro all right so let's get started and let's take a look at what we have here and what kind of extensions am i talking about that will make you a better developer so the first one is actually auto close tag so before we actually get started this is a simple react js project i just ran a create react app in a dummy folder i think i even called this one react dummy yeah that's right and so this is only for demonstration purposes i'm not going to use this uh in any live project but yeah i just made it so i can demonstrate all the stuff that i will be talking about today all right so the first one is actually auto close tag now this one is pretty selfexplanatory now this one is actually explains itself so let's take a look at how it works so if i uh make a little space over here and i just open up a h1 tag and notice that the moment i close it it closes the tag immediately uh so that's pretty much our first one super helpful you will never ever forget ever again uh to forget any kind of html attacks it just saves you a ton of time and you will just not be worried about like okay why is my react app not working why is it not showing up the way i want it to because auto close tag is actually going to take care of it all right so the next one is actually i still counted it as number one uh this pretty much ties into the auto close tag and all these html uh helper stuff this is auto rename text so let's go back to our app.js and remember i have the h1 and say i don't even want that h1 anymore i want a p tag instead so i will just go ahead delete and notice immediately deleted that one as i go and now i have empty tags and i can just type in p or whatever i want to so if i want a table instead i can have it and notice that once i start typing in the class name it's not going to do that so it's super helpful again saves you a ton of time you don't have to worry about uh what's gonna happen it takes care of it for you all right so number two is actually bracket pair colorizer now this one is again going to help you uh not to miss out on anything and this is actually just going to mark your brackets with the same color so you can take you can go ahead and start uh taking a look at what's going on here so now this right over here you have a purple one which actually gets closed right away another purple one which is going to be closed over here it also actually highlights how long that bracket uh is so super helpful once again let's take a look at how it works so right now i'm just going to go in and type in use effect boom and i will actually create a little bit of space over here which is good so notice that i have this purple one which closes over here and actually it marks everything for me so i don't have to worry about not closing a bracket anymore because if i in case i delete this one obviously my app is going to freak out and it's not going to know what i will be what i'm doing but i know that something is off i don't have one of these closed so let's go ahead and close it and everything is fixed so simple as that super helpful i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead and downloads this one all right number three is actually prettier this is a code formatter that we here at cleverprogrammer use a ton we recommended everybody to go ahead and and set it up work with it play with it and just uh just work with all the indentation stuff it saves again a ton of time for you it just makes your code uh easily readable so if i remove the space that i put in here so now i you see i have all this indentation uh correctly but if i go ahead and mess it up and just fix it boom it actually works perfectly i can also set it to trigger once i save my file and i actually have it set up in a way that once i unfocus the window it actually saves it so i will have it immediately auto saved and also my code will be formatted so that's probably the best way that you can go ahead and work with vs code it actually saved me a ton of time so let's go ahead and take a look at the next one all right number four is es7 react redux graphql react native snippets this is it over here take a look at it and go ahead download it this saves me so much time i can't express how useful it is go ahead download it and start messing with it so let's say i don't i want to create a new component so i will go ahead and add a component.js file now i have a empty file i want to have a react component but every time i want to do it i would have to type in so many lines of code just to have a working component i obviously don't want to do that so instead i'll just type in rafc e which will actually create a react arrow function export component boom that's it simple as that i can also do it with the redux slice so i will just type in rx slice so many like i saved myself a headache not typing 18 lines of code instead i just typed in a few letters and hit return boom that's it super helpful i think it speaks for itself why it is so helpful number five get lens get lens is yeah get super charged but it gives you a nice little overview of what is happening inside of your application helps you identify uh what kind of code did you move around and what happened so if i add a h1 clever programmer in here and another return i can go ahead and compare these two codes and i see that i added these three lines obviously i can move back in time can do all these kind of sort of stuff so it is super amazing to have this thing and i can also if i go back in here i know that i can highlight this and i know that i made these changes what's happening uh what what i did and also here if i made the commit i know that i made it four days ago on the 28th of january and it was called initials pro initialize project using create react app super helpful once again helps you identify what was happening and when so highly recommend once again go ahead and download it on to the next one number six import cost import cost actually helps you how much stuff did you import into your project so if i were to say go ahead and add material ui and then import the button and then actually use it in the project then it would tell me that i am using an extra 73.9 kilobytes in the node modules so that's just a nice to have a nice to know and if you are like really on the optimization side of things it is actually really helpful as you know that how much uh storage your application is going to cost all right moving on to number seven live server this is actually probably going to be only used by people who are working with plain html css and javascript files this is super beginner friendly and makes your job so much easier by just firing up a live server and enabling live review and live reload and hot reloading inside of your browser and that way you can just go ahead save the file and just like here just like over here i am live boom it actually changed it uh changed it immediately so super helpful makes your life so much easier so make sure to go ahead check it out and use it moving on to number eight this is a collaboration application uh especially nowadays when everybody is working from home super helpful to have something that you that helps you work with your teammates or a coworker or somebody and actually give them access to run to type code in your machine run stuff in your terminal and that way you guys can work together debug stuff build stuff together something like that this is something that we use a ton inside of clever programmer so again highly highly recommend going ahead and downloading it and actually this is the one that we used uh during live streams so once again an amazing tool go ahead use it sometimes it actually can be super buggy because it's a microsoft product you're kind of used to that anyways helps you a ton saves you so much time number nine air lens this one is by far probably one of my favorites this one actually detects if you make a mistake i did not close this button tag it already tells me that yo something's up and and highlights a row might not tell you exactly what's up but it definitely helps you a ton when you're debugging definitely once again probably one of my favorite ones just because it just highlights and it just doesn't let you make uh syntactical mistakes so super helpful once again especially for beginners this is going to save you so much time and so much pain and you will actually enjoy programming a ton more number 10 react native tools this is a little more advanced stuff but this actually helps you uh create react native apps i use it a lot when i'm working with react native makes it easier for you to to write react native applications and it just helps you a lot all right i actually have two more bonuses just because 10 wasn't enough let's take a look at those all right bonus number one is firebase snippets we all use firebase we love firebase but sometimes it just so good to have a few different snippets that we can actually go ahead and take take advantage of and i just don't have to type out all the code and bonus number two because i'm an apple junkie i kind of hate how we as code looks so i just installed this xcode 12 theme so if you are a apple junkie just like me you will appreciate this a lot if you guys are not that much of an apple junkies you don't have to worry about this any at all this is just a nice little theme that i use and i actually like the colors much more i think these are more more vibrant and they just make me so much more happy unlike the original colors of bs code which are kind of boring and matte and i just don't like them these are so much nicer colors alright so there you have it the 10 actually 12 best extensions that you can get started with today for vs code that will 10x your programming career and up your game so much and you will get so much more effective i can't wait to see all of you going ahead using them
