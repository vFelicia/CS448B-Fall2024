hey guys what's up this is kazzy from clever program.com and you are going to be finding out kind of a lot of the stuff that's been going on recently so sorry I've been gone for a while I think it's been six days now since I last uploaded a video but today I just wanted to kind of fill you guys in on a lot of the things that are going on so in this video we're going to talk about first of all 20K Subs okay thank you for that um a fight that broke out at a bar where I went to watch UFC fight so it's kind of like recursion um I started an investment account I have to talk about that with you guys because I think you can find a lot of value from it and the 0.5% guy struck again yeah so lots of crazy stuff uh going to be covered in this one so I hope you stay with me all right so let's start off with the 20K Subs oh my goodness thank you guys so much I mean this this is crazy like I at this point when I see that like 20,000 subscribers I literally don't even know how to react um I don't know when you guys joined me along my journey I don't know when you joined some of you you guys were there when the channel literally just started some of you guys are here already but just a little backstory to all of this before my YouTube channel even got started I mean it was like there was a point where obviously didn't exist right there was nothing called clever programmer I was just a college student um and I was having this idea of putting clever programmer together um was going through John sas's book called um soft skills yeah it's called soft skills for software developers or whatever um and he talks about like how to put a YouTube channel together and whatever and I thought that was great and so I kind of was you know got started on this whole idea and literally every single day would look something like this I would wake up at like 530 a.m. in the morning morning I would go to lift at YMCA uh I would get done lifting and then I would run like a maniac to my train because every time I was just in the nick of time to catch my train to for college um I would yeah catch the train at like 900 a.m. or 800 a.m. I would go to school and while I was there I was thinking about how am I going to put this channel together I would be thinking about the video and planning it out and then like my math teacher or whatever she'd be like what are you working on there and i' I obviously wouldn't show her and then she's like you know maybe you should be paying attention in class so she would get really upset at me but I was just focusing on all of this and then as soon as I would you know kind of do my whole day at College then I would come back and I would spend a lot of time working so whether it was working with clients or or working on a software project on my own but after I got done with my job after I got done with school I would have this mapped out plan of exactly what videos I was going to be making so in the start it was like the code Academy videos and I would kind of just get started right on that so as soon as I so like at 700 p.m. or 6 PM I would just get started and boom boom boom boom boom I would just bust out all these videos and I'm like okay I'm done for the day and then I would upload the video I would fill out the entire description I would do keyword research I would tag these videos I mean there's so much that goes behind a completed video that you might see even this video right now is probably you know the I don't script anything but like I recorded you know I edited now my workflow is much tighter because I've just improved but before it was kind of crazy I was figuring a lot of this stuff out you know when's the best time to put something up on YouTube is anybody even going to watch it are they going to hate it so tons of things but I you know I was focused that was my goal it was produce at least one video every single day and that's what I did every single day woke up at 530 went to the gym went to college went to work came back I didn't care if I was tired I didn't care if I had a headache I did not care if I felt like I would just bust out content cuz I had it planned and I'm like boom boom boom this is what I'm going to be doing so I would make these videos whatever that we're going to be about was already researched before because remember motivation and willpower is extremely limited it's a limited resource so you want to not have to depend on it you should try to get motivation get willpower and then build a system that keeps you going even when the willpower and the motivation runs out and anytime you have to do thinking you're spending your motivation and willpower think of it like a door you have to exert energy to open the door right but to keep it open you can just put that little door stopper and then that's your system that just keeps it right there so in the start I was producing no videos no content most people produce only one video a month most people only produce one video a week but nobody was producing one video a day right and so I'm like okay I'm going to motivate the hell out of myself to go 10x and then build a system which was my schedule was so specific like the night before I wouldn't just think about oh I'm going to do this at 500 a.m. I'm going to do this .m. the night before I would literally step bystep plan out exactly how my day would go I would visualize my day so clearly that it was everything so for example for sing I'm like okay I'm going to go to the wake up at 530 a.m. but it's going to take me a little bit of time so 540 a.m. I'm going to be completely out of bed getting ready 555 a.m. I should be done by taking a shower and I should be getting breakfast at then from 555 a.m. to 605 a.m. a.m. I'm going to get in my car from 605 a.m. to 635 a.m. I'm going to get to the gym 635 a.m. to 7 a.m. or 7 or you know 800 a.m. or whatever I'm going to be lifting and for each of those time slots what exercise I was going to be doing I mean I had all the way like so much brutal detail of what my Daye was going to look like that when I would get ahead of what I was doing I would be super happy I'm like yes I got a lead on this so I should just keep going now and also I never had to actually think and make a decision because whenever you have to make a decision like should I hang out with my friend or should I write this paper I guess I'll just hang out with my friend but when I would look at my calendar I'm like I got to this this this this this and this I'm like dude I'm sorry I can't hang out right now but I can hang out at 900 p.m. like guiltfree hanging out right that's what you want to be able to do so with my friends that's how I would deal with it that's what even gave me the ability to say no people were like wow you're such a strong leaderlike person you must be like perfect I'm like no I just have this system that helps me so again that kept me on track it kept me producing all this content and the the system and being very methodical about it was what kept me going and then obviously the willpower and the motivation helps right so I was listening to Gary ve gr Cardone everyday 10x 10x baby like let's go let's go let's go now when I make a video within one minute there will be a comment saying first or second or there will be like hundreds of people that have already viewed it you know you guys are already I mean you guys are providing so much support at this point that it's impossible for me to quit like I'm I'm going to keep going forever but in the start I would have zero views the only person like literally if I refresh the page VI too many times I would skew the data you know like 10 of those views was was me essentially so if I did get one unique view that would account for nothing so even refreshing the page would completely destroy my data so I wouldn't even refresh my page or view my video over and over again because I like oh man that could really skew my skew My Views but and each video was really hard it took a lot of time so like when I was working on these and I saw no results it was hard to keep going right like okay I'm going to make a video today and I'm going to make a video today and I'm going to make a video today and I'm going to this is such an awesome video that I spent so long planning out and executing and editing and Publishing and tagging and re keyword researching and everything and then I go and look at the video and I all I hear is crickets nobody's there nobody's watching it I don't have a single comment appreciating this acknowledging this but because I had a system because I was like I'm not going to complain till I have 100 videos I just kept going you know it just kept going I would get discouraged at times like man nobody's responding nobody's you know paying attention to this I kept going and then eventually started paying off like some videos started getting thousands of views like my corsera videos started getting traffic and people were like oh my God you help me so much or oh my God you help me with this so much so that was you know those would be those would give you the fuel to keep going but you know a takea away from this is for you guys is sometimes you do things that are right that you're you know you're supposed to be doing that are extremely difficult to do but you don't see the results for a while it could be bodybuilding you're trying to bodybuild and your Aesthetics are just not showing up your chest is not how you want it to be the six packs haven't showed up it could be trying to lose weight you working really hard but your belly fat is just not going away it could be in a relationship you've worked so hard you've been through so many fights but it's just not panning out to what you want wanted it to be that understanding is not there you guys keep having those conflicts the crazy thing is that just on the other side of all that failure just on the other side of all that failure right when you get AC on top and past that hill of failure lies success if you look at my you know if you look at my uh Channel's history it's like dead dead dead dead dead dead dead dead failure failure failure oh a little bit of audience maybe two people five people viewed it back to failure failure failure failure I was getting one sub two subs a day one sub subscribers right and I would look at this every day and I was like oh man that's like not much was get Zero Subs one subs two subs failure after failure and then eventually boom a huge Spike comes up but to everybody else everybody who knew me all my friends are like oh my God like or the people who were actually looking from the outside in you know who just superficially know you your acquaintances not your real friends like your your Facebook friends they're like oh my God overnight success see it is possible check out my boy Kazi you know he just made it it is possible anything is possible um you know overnight success blah blah blah yeah maybe to them it was an overnight success right they didn't see the six months of work waking up at 530 a.m. to make freaking videos the one video that I have that has 175,000 views right now it's called what programming language should I learn first and it ranks first out of like a million videos do you know who I made it for I made it for one friend his name is Danny I'm not gonna say his last name but he's my Facebook friend literally that video is made for him he asked me a question he said hey I'm trying to figure out what language should I learn first I told him Hey look it's 940 p.m. right now I'm going to bed because at 10 p.m. I was trying to sleep and I wake up at 530 a.m. I'm like hey look I'm trying to go to bed but as soon as I wake up the first thing I'll do for you is I'll make this video and he's like whoa are you serious I'm like yeah I'm like I can't answer your question right now but I'll do it in the morning and that's what I did I woke up that video was made at 530 a.m. and I spent probably 1 and 1 half hour recording it like scripting it writing it coming up with the idea and then I started recording it and then you know editing and blah blah all of that few hours so overall it took me maybe six to 10 hours of hard work planning and all of that but I woke up at 530 a.m. and that's not what other people see right nobody knows that not a lot of people know that so if you're going through a lot of hard things that you're doing to get some results and you're not getting people who are motivating you you're not getting people who are cheering for you you don't have people who believe in you you don't have people who support you that's okay like I've been there I was in that situation up until now so don't don't really feel bad about those things and don't let those things make you quit um I have quit too like I used to have a channel called chess Tas it has it said 50 subscribers great potential if I if I look at it now I know I can easily make it go to 20,000 subs or more but it just stopped at 50 Subs because I quit I was like all those thoughts in my head about failure the fear of failure fear of you know it not panning out well whatever I mean I put in the effort but it wasn't consistent effort I didn't have a system and then I the motivation and The Willpower juices end up running out but with this channel it's different and for you I'm telling you if it's weightlifting or trying to keep the body fat off or you're working on a YouTube channel or you're trying to build online business or a brickandmortar business whatever kind of business or whatever thing that you're trying to do in real life right even like a relationship success is right on the other side of failure okay and nobody's there when you're failing trust me nobody's there when you're failing but every single person is there when you succeed before when I was going through this hustle and all of that I know what these people were saying when I wasn't paying like not in front of me which was look at this guy like posting every day about how hard he's working blah blah you know not focusing on this other stuff like I know he's going to be a failure essentially is what they're saying in their head but now everybody's coming out of the Woodworks and is like congratulations I knew it I knew you would make it I've always believed in you blah blah blah blah blah really really you weren't there when I was starting this all out right and that's how you might feel in whatever you're doing focus on persisting if it's coding and you have to practice programming every single freaking day and it's not the sex I thing in the world it's a lot of pain and you have to go through go through it I'm telling you you're doing the right thing if you're doing the hard work for building your body or going through and working out your relationship like is it worth it or not worth it it's worth it put in that work okay nothing is going to come to you without putting in the work there's no such thing as you know yes grass is always greener on the other side but it's not you haven't seen the times that those people have mowed their lawns called in the laborers to make it look damn beautiful or did it themselves everything takes work so please believe in your dreams even if it's something crazy you know follow through with it so again that's a little bit of my story where how everything is you know happened so far thank you for the 20,000 subscribers it's really unbelievable you know I was running around my entire freaking house when I got when I used to get five subscribers per day I used to compare myself to this one channel called a concept um and also one of my other uh competitors at the time coding tutorials 360 who I hated um why do I do this like everybody thinks please don't talk start talking about coding tutorial 360s the channel is great okay um like I said something about engineer truth in a funny way and everybody lost their minds I'm joking I'm literally joking okay if you don't understand that if you don't understand me you shouldn't be listening to me all right I'm literally kidding engineer truth is a great Channel coding tutorials 360 is a great Channel now that out of the way because everything goes out of control on the internet when I was starting my channel I looked at coding tutorials 360 and I was like I could make better videos but I wanted to I had this idea of doing code academy 3 uh code academy uh videos and I was like oh I'm going to walk everybody through and it's going to be great but then my heart broke when I found out there was already a pretty big channel that was doing it at the time I think coding tutorial 360 had 10K subs or 11k Subs 11,000 subs and I was like whoa that's crazy and it broke my heart cuz I'm like somebody's already done my idea so I can't do it but not true I'm like forget it I'm just going to go ahead and do it anyways and that's exactly what I did I went ahead I kept persisting doing it and every time I would try to compare myself to how many subscribers he was getting per day I think he was getting 30 or 60 or something like that and I was getting two and then it started getting five and then I started getting 10 and I was like yes and then I remember the day there was one day I got 37 I literally went crazy I was running around my entire house I called my friends I called my brother in California I was like oh my God I just she got 37 subscribers like this is the craziest freaking day of my life like and for me it's always about the implications it's not about literally that I got 37 Subs it was holy crap this is real if I could get 37 today then tomorrow maybe I could get more like this is crazy um but after the 37 oh it's 137 p.m. that's kind of funny but after the 37 Subs I went back to having 10 15 20 Subs per day but eventually my channel started getting bigger and bigger and my growth started getting bigger and bigger um and then I started hitting numbers that Channels with 150,000 subscribers we hitting like I'm talking you know 100 Subs per day like 150 Subs per day 200 Subs per day and I'm happy to say that at this point my channel has overtaken coding tutorials 360 it happened a few weeks ago and now I think we're way ahead of him and and we're only going forward I don't know why I don't like his I don't like his tutorials cuz I think there was a time when I started watching them and they just weren't personable and I just didn't like the monotony and the way of speaking just personally me okay and I was like I constantly found the same problem like these people aren't speaking to human beings like human beings um they have a very weird way of talking to people they're all in their heads making these tutorial so I wanted to make these tutorials from a perspective of like I want to be right there with you and I I understand you and I do because I went through the same problems all right this is a long video so I don't know if I want to talk about the other things but I'll try to make them short I'll talk about my investment with Charles Schwab in another video um but I'll talk about the UFC so just two days ago I went with my friend friends and we went to watch UFC I think 209 with Tyron Woodley and uh God I forgot his name I can't believe it I I love him but Tyron Woodley versus Steve Steve okay I'm going to look it up I'm getting really pissed off uh Tyron Woodley versus stevenh Thompson that's right I'm not going to tell you the result of the fight but uh it was a pretty great fight and while that was happening we were at the bar and we were watching this fight all of a sudden we started hearing some crazy yelling and whatever going on in the back and what the hell's going on so we look back there's this guy and he's literally going like this okay you're not going to believe it he's going he's talking to somebody and he's like oh oh you know I'm and it it makes it to me to us it looks like he's saying I'm okay I'm okay so he's like and as he's saying that this guy's literally bleeding from his forehead like there's just blood Cushing out and we're looking at him and we like what the hell is going on like he seems like he's so normal blood gushing out and then there's this other crazy gun like like like veins are popping out and then we started overhearing more and then all the bouncers started walking towards these guys and we're whoa so we're like there's a fight going on here there's a fight going on here like what's going on um and basically the guy who got hit in the head like this guy cracked a bottle and broke it in his forehead um because allegedly the guy with the who got hit with the broken bottle slapped the other guy and um the other guy got so mad that he broke a bottle so I guess don't get into crazy fights you know uh it doesn't matter if you're bigger or stronger somebody has if they can pull a knife on out on you hurt you or somebody you know um is it really worth it you know so sometimes it sucks it'll hurt your ego um to not end up getting into a fight but it might save you and your family a lot of trouble if you just go okay I'm not going to actually be the first one to initiate it cuz I never know what this guy's got right you got all kinds of psychos going around nowadays and yeah so pretty crazy story huh but I'm going to tell you guys about the 0.55% guy striking again so if you guys didn't watch the video watch it it's called ideas versus execution and I tell you the story about this guy who wanted to make me work for him as a fulltime partner for 0.5% basically he wanted to just tell me the idea and then just go to freaking sleep and make me work on everything and then share 0.5% of the profits with me that was his whole idea okay and there are a bunch of people like that that email me every day and I'm going to start putting these people on blast cuz they deserve it I mean they deserve it they're horrible people anyways so now yeah the 0.5% guy strikes again so I want to tell you guys about part two of that story and then also the investment one in the next video so thank you for sticking with me up to this point you guys are are my real people everybody else who's exited they're just the fake wannabe clever programmers y'all are the real deal thank you for sticking through if you stuck through comment below I want to talk to you and say beautiful that you made it up until this this point some crazy new changings are happening uh at clever programmer I think I'm going to be taking the oop course off the market and only for specific group of people so I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about that too that's going to be a little bit crazy it's probably going to be happening this month so if you're on the fence about that course it's a great course you make fullon applications if you're on the fence I would suggest to hop off the fence and probably join that course now because once I take it off I'm going to go in the phase of doing more market research turning it into a better and ultimate product for you guys and then when I open it up again the price is going to be higher um and no is going to get the same price again um so for those two or three months you know where you don't have access to it you also won't be able to create any apps so if you're on the fence I suggest take a look into it other than that I love your guys' faces off thank you guys so much for watching this video and I will see you in the next video
