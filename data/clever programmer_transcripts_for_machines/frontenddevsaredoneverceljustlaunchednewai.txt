frontend devs are done or so I've heard with versel v0 coming out I've been so excited to check it out all day but I purposely decided not to so I could react live with you in real time so let's go ahead and check out versel v0 which is apparently generative UI meaning you go to versel type in stuff it creates front end for you so let's see what the heck this is about all right so generating UI announcing v0 a few weeks ago we introduced it a product makes website creation as simple as describing your ideas we call it generative UI combining the best practices of front end development with the potential of generative AI the interest in V has been incredible with 100,000 people registering for the weight list in just 3 weeks today we're transitioning from alpha to Beta okay our goal is help developers B build the first iteration of their product like Ingo who built the first version of the Resume Builder product of the vzer or Brain Trust a new platform that built its pricing page using vzer Okay so let's take a look somebody built their pricing page all right okay so this was apparently built with v0 interesting okay let's take a look at this Resume Builder this was also built with VZ okay great I mean this is a lot of stuff that it's doing okay is there a way I can use it can I use it get started oh here we go okay v.d so if you go to v.d you can use it as well uh okay an eCommerce store for software developer merch okay let's see I got to authenticate so let's go go ahead and do that continue with GitHub sure oh man I hate this authentication I'll need to get my oh looks like it worked okay use generative AI to create copy and paste friendly react code based on Shad CDN UI and Tailwind okay great all right so how is this different than Chad GPT so far I'm confused oh mine was dark mode cuz I had my dark mode plugin enabled it's called Dark reader when you submit a prompt or up or an upload an image VZ will use AI to generate three different uis okay a pricing section with a title and description okay nice you can select individual parts of a generated UI to refine your creation or edit the code directly once you're ready you can then copy paste it into your react app and ship make this longer blah blah blah okay welcome start generating let's go let's see what this is about all right so I'm going to hit enter and let's see what happens I'm excited boys and girl probably the one girl that watches this channel if you're a girl comment below we we need some more ladies up in here this is too much too many boys on this channel all right so it's actually building it if you guys could see at the bottom I can see it's starting to build it interesting okay so it looks like it's building a a yeah is is it building three different versions did it say that and I'm just like tweaking right now or is one side building the Navar and then the other side is building something else wow this is great like when you code with Chad GPT you guys know how it makes it look like ass when you get the front end from there it looks so terrible and this front end looks amazing like this is usable front end that's amazing okay so it gave G me three options I guess so I I I like option A I like having this sidebar and then being able to do this okay what else can we do here so I'm going to say um call The Shop clever programmer programmer okay and then on the leftand side on the left hand side add a donate button okay um and for join now button say let's see so this so basically here I wanted to add a donate button here I wanted to say clever programmer and here join now I wanted to actually say join today to save $100 um I don't even know if that'll fit there but we'll see I'm going to hit enter and let's just see what happens it might crash it might shut down it might do something awful but we'll see this is exciting you guys this is this is revolutionary uh I'm I'm so genuinely excited about this cuz I want to be coding I hate doing front end I want to do backend stuff it makes me feel like I'm enjoying my life instead of changing colors of buttons for hours or positioning ooh here we go so we got a button that says donate okay fantastic we got clever programmer and it figured out how to do it in a really smart way it goes join our membership join today to save $100 on exclusive discounts and perks guys give it up for v0 this is fantastic um okay let's uh oh wait I can get the code holy look at that I got full react code here and I bet I could paste it somewhere and it would work and I got the HTML okay so let's try this HTML and let's put it in code pen we'll start say we'll say start coding paste it here and yeah I mean of course it'll look like because we don't have styling right does does it do inline styling how's it doing styling oh yes because we don't have Tailwind uh it's using Tailwind styling how do you enable Tailwind here let's see Tailwind in code pen can we do Tailwind in code pen how to use tailwind and code pin Okay so somebody has a page that has Tailwind I guess somehow um that's what we need we just need the Tailwind CDN I think okay I don't use codepen a lot so if you're like oh you can just do it this way it's okay like relax I don't I don't use it all the time okay so that's why close there we go look at that we're getting the styling beautiful it doesn't look perfectly like the one we wanted but it's still there and I bet if we actually looked at the react version probably that's just up and running so if you go to repet you can just probably have it up and running or stack Blitz and have it up and running but nonetheless like the point is that it works right that's the point like look at this it's even responsive so if I actually go like this right you see that how it just turned responsive and it hit the nav bar right and now when I go here boom it brings it back like that is crazy cuz I again I just remember right like how bad Chad gpt's front end code was if you asked Chad GPT for this it would have give you something that you would want to vomit at if it if it gave you and this is so damn good this is very exciting good job versel whoever is behind this that's fantastic okay I can go back to the canvas now I can also do new generation if I'm done with this right so let's say we're done with our little ecommer store Vibes we can leave this and then to add functionality you could go back to Chad GPT o interesting so here's new generations a button with Border Great so if you need a button you could do that uh SAS results page interesting pricing is something very common so let's go pricing or testimonials are also really common so let's say give me a pricing page with three uh PR uh three tables one for starter second for pro and third for ultimate ultimate uh starter should be $300 Pro should be I don't know like let's say 1K uh and ultimate should be 3K okay so those are the three packages we have and then put in different things that should be included in there for example the $300 one uh should just have a course and 1K should have group coaching and the 3K one should also include one on ones okay let's hit enter and let's see what the hell we get because if I get a nice pricing page man I'm going to start freaking using this this is exciting gone are the days of writing front end by hand oh my God import this import that do this do that oh look at that we got the pricing tables coming up boys and I like how it live writes it in front of your face that is clean dude that is awesome here we go choose Pro choose starter choose ultimate fantastic now we got the second one nice um I actually like the second one a lot I actually like the third one even more this is so cool that it gives you three options at the same time I love the third one we're going to stick with the third one uh we're going to make the pro package most popular can you make the pro package most popular like like add a badge or something and give all three of these different colors but we want the user to pick the pro package right because uiux is a lot of psychology right it's not just making things look pretty psychology like what Behavior do we want to drive so like we want to drive the behavior where the user picks um the happened just vanish hello that was weird is it ever going to come back what's happening here I'm so lost oh you can even pick an edit like that whoa it did it it did it it did it most popular badge we got three different colors um colors seem a bit too tacky and sharp I I don't know if I'm using the right lingo I'm probably using the wrong lingo can you make them can you give them a little more Gra um make it look better I don't know I'm not a friend end developer okay so some other frontend developer can come in and tell me but it got the most popular badge which is absolutely fantastic it got you know it got the different colors which is amazing I mean I don't really mind the colors I think the colors actually look pretty good they just look a tiny bit on the cheap side and I I I feel like if it was like like glass or neomorph oh maybe I could tell it that maybe I could be like try making it oh I think it added a gradient right like this has a gradient those other ones didn't the gradient does look nicer try making it neomorphic ooh big word hopefully I'm using the right word and I'm not using the one where you're your um your you you like dead people you know I hope I'm not using that one I think that's a Nyo Maniac um please YouTube Don't demonetize this that's not my [Laughter] intention all right let's see I'm excited let's see what happens here so I do like the gradient and like look at that the gradient is slick if I asked that the Chad GPT Chad GPT would just like rip off everything thing and just gave me like a H2 just like one H2 nothing else okay so it did make it neomorphic like you see how it pops out like pops out from the screen when I hover over on it and all that stuff that's awesome um Okay cool so I think we get it right like how it's working and what it could do now we could Fork share it so we could share this with people so interesting okay so if I go here and I paste this wow it just brings you straight up so you could just like build design so fast and share it can you imagine a product manager or somebody who's even a a product person or somebody who's a design person can now just coat it up just talk to CH GPT or talk to versel uh v.d right I mean come up with better names guys you you you know it's some Dev right they gave it the freaking name vzero sounds so cool ha like guys come on let's come up with a better name for this right but you know that if you are a frontend developer you could just build stuff with this then you got the code right and then from here this is all your front end code and then you use Chad GPT to write all the backend code and oh my God like that's it this is it I'm so excited this is freaking revolutionary uh to add wait hold on add the component by using the code interesting wow you can add it as a component that is sick so you could actually just go npx vzer add blah blah blah right and then you actually don't need to carry around this code then it seems like you could just call this component so there you go guys that was the first look at v0o vers Sal's brand new generative UI that they released today couple of hours ago in beta that now everybody could use so check it out at vz. Dev but here's the thing right I said frontend developers are dead you still need the developers to massage it and do stuff you saw how we needed to do that we needed to guide it and give it Direction so no development isn't over coding is not over understanding it is still necessary you still need to give it the vision of what you want that's still necessary the same reason a boss needs developers he has a vision for an app and then he gets a team and then that team helps brings that Vision to life now you're going to be the boss every developer is now a boss with a team of almost imagine Junior developer coders that can code for you you give them a Direction I want a pricing page I want it to look like this I want to have these things I wanted to make it pop put a most popular badge on it boom it'll do all of that rather than you you having sitting there figuring out how do I get a badge where do I put a badge how do I make it look like a badge doesn't look like a badge how do I put the red border behind it all Annoying stuff anyways so no your jobs are not going away if you learn how to use Ai and you learn how to use chbt you'll be able to land your dream jobs get the promotions you're looking for and land literally your dream career so if you are serious and you want to learn how to use Ai and chpt to make money and learn the skills you need to land the job or become an entrepreneur and launch even your own SAS then what I recommend you do is click the link in the description below I just launched my course profit with AI and Chad GPT where you learn skills like these and you learn how to make your first dollar selling your own SAS within 8 weeks we have students doing that in their first week we have students building their first app within 15 minutes of joining the course if you don't trust me go click the link below and check out the page look at all the testimonials read them through look at the course and then jump in okay once you jump in you have a 60day money bag guarantee so you can always decide to change your mind later so you have nothing to lose but I promise you the core is going to blow your mind I even had a father today join and he got his his son joined a few days ago and then now his son told his dad that the course is absolutely amazing so now the dad joined in so now they're both taking the course together and they're looking to build they're looking to learn better coding skills so they can make their apps and they're so excited because they have a couple of weeks off right now and so they're going to work together and code together and build apps together before the year is over so I want you to join in on that Community because the community of this course is absolutely amazing we also have a WhatsApp group where we get together and build all of these things and we're always on the latest and greatest with AI and Tech and we have students in here or who are looking at jobs at some of the biggest companies in the world and so if they come up with opportunities or find them they'll also be able to share some of those with you okay so if you're excited about this and you want to learn about AI chat GPT how to use all these tools like vzer Dev and how do you stay on top of all of the stuff so you can keep building with it and inste of becoming replaced you become IR replaceable so if that excites you cuz I know it freaking excites me and you want to be a part of this community click the link below jump in because prices are going to go up okay they're going to go up especially within the next few days before the New Year's I promise I will have increased the price of this course by at least another $100 so don't miss out because you're going to be upset so click the link below jump in the course I want to see your beautiful face inside that's it I'm Cy I'll see you in the next video peace
