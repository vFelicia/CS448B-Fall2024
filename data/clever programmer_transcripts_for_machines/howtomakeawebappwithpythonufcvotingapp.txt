do you watch fights by any chance no boxing fight yeah Mayweather in McGregor you guys watching it how's it going guys man nice to meet you guys and let's check it out what it looks like now and I'm going to hit refresh on this website and boom look at that it says clever programmers who do you think will win hey guys how's it going this is ecology from clever programmer calm in this video we're going to be going out to Chicago today we're going to be shooting videos at the beam the cloud gate in Chicago and basically we're just going to be interviewing people on if they think McGregor is going to win or mayweather is going to win on august 26 and what we're going to do is um since this is a computer programming channel what we're going to do is I'm going to show you guys also how to create a web app okay with Python that'll take votes from other people so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be asking these people the questions and then the app that we're going to make together we're gonna have these people put their votes in that app and then also I'll show you how to make that app step by step okay so you can make that app and share with your friends and family and people can just go on your website let's say your name is Johnny they can just go to Johnny dead calm and then they can actually play around with your app so how freakin cool is that okay I am super excited I hope you're excited let's go and bother some people and ask them the questions and have fun alright that's it and I'll see you at the beans okay so the question is you guys know about the fight that's coming up with Conor McGregor and Mayweather okay the first guy's name is McGregor and the other guy's name is Mayweather and who do you think is gonna win no we don't register it here oh okay well thanks for the interview it was unbelievable which one's power my Greg McGregor is a taller one okay then the other one Mayweather oh yeah the shorter one who's gonna win why is that because we both have weather in our last name Oh what's your name weather holds weather holes oh wow cool who do you think is gonna win I mean I guess the other one which one McGregor or that's the taller one or the shorter one make right you're the taller one Mayweather Mayweather why is that I mean come on he's been dominating for the longest Mayweather and how about you um you know what does that mean same thing okay awesome so we have how many votes not four yeah yeah we're done now okay thank you guys were great sorry to ruin your day all right okay I'm going to stay here for five second I'm gonna sit down here Mayweather's gonna win classic mayweather things so you're going for McGregor yeah guess we're talking you're going for Mayweather I think Mayweather the judges a good talker but Mayweather is going to win at the end all right who do you think Mayweather Mayweather regret Mayweather all right well I know who those people are oh I'm not a dumbass she's not a dumbass that's good good I don't know I mean yeah I honestly don't know like you guys yeah yeah yeah they're wonderful um I just may weather okay her vote is on Mayweather arm cool okay well everyone's rooting for the underdog so I think I've heard McGregor you're going for McGregor well I hope so I feel like you'd be underdogs and maybe I always root for the underdog and you are going for Mayweather how'd you lose I didn't know anything giant about it oh all right good we're gonna win the fight for sure yeah guaranteed gonna win I do yeah like Conor yeah so you think Connor is gonna win yeah we're breaking up now all right we just broke up a couple amazing what percentage of chance you want to put on that I'm just gonna bet on it because the odds are against him really badly oh so you're just gonna do it just for fun you know he's gonna lose but you want to vote for him I'm think he's going to lose and do you watch a lot of fight do you follow do you follow up with USC and a boxing now I just mean I like the hype for this so so if you don't watch a lot of fights you know it's like hard to trust your opinion not not really I just kind of watch some of the bigger fights but I don't really follow into the scene we've got you know the best points and I'm not going of that fight and all that stuff so no I don't okay so if you had to vote you can only vote for one fighter to win which fighter would it be McGregor my cracker alright thanks so much man I appreciate it the other guy not Conor but not Conor negative one vote for Conor how about you Conor Conor how about you Mayweather my boy money Mayweather is going to win by technical knockout in the 12th round oh I think he's got the speed he's got the quickness you have the size advantage but I think he's got the boxing experience it takes a deep Conor McGregor also he's not a complete yeah that's right and what's the only color Mayweather seed green that's right great all right Thank You boys this is great we're going to post this up on our YouTube channel you can find on clever programmer oh I forgot to ask is it okay if we post this up yes I use okay all right well as long as I get Tel Aviv well I'll just like to say you're welcome for allowing us to a make your channel more popular it's going to blow up once people see our beautiful faces signing off from Sacramento California ESC BFB 2k16 Stateline boys all right thank you guys so we went out and we interviewed a lot of people about who to think is going to win between McGregor and mayweather so as cool as that is what's even freaking cooler is we're going to build an app that is going to allow us to vote between McGregor and mayweather all right so to show you guys what this app actually looks like I'm going to take you to where I have this app right now and I'll show you kind of what it does all right so here's this app kind of in motion and I'll show you exactly how you can build it and how you can have this app actually for yourself so here you can see that have MacGregor on the lefthand side and we have Mayweather on the righthand side so I can choose to vote for either of them and let's say I put in my email and you I'm just putting in some random fake emails all right I'm going to vote for Conor McGregor and let's see what happens and you see that it went total votes from two to three and also the blue bar Conor McGregor's bar went a little bit further now let's vote on Floyd Mayweather and let's hit vote and you'll see what happens it went back into the middle and it said total votes for all right now let's say I try the same email address I just tried which is for at Gmail about four at gmail.com and I will try to pick Floyd or even Kaname with Conor McGregor and what happens okay let's try that one more time sorry I think I hadn't picked four yet but you saw that when I picked four again it actually says you have already voted so this app actually tells you if you've done something wrong and actually doesn't allow you to do it so that's pretty cool and the steps I'll show you for getting this app is actually super easy it's basically like you literally stealing this app and getting your own app the same one that I have up and running and then you can control it so you can change the pictures if you want to you can change how some of it looks if you want to you can do whatever you want to it and you could even put it on your portfolio you know like if you make a Python developer website later on you can actually put on your portfolio be like hey look what I made or look what I know how to make and I'm gonna in this video show you the easiest way to actually get this up and running without actually even having to worry so much about coding it okay that's not the scope of this video because I want to make it so it's accessible to anybody you know even if you're just a complete beginner it's your first time in Python you will be able to actually get this done and I know this because I tried it up my friend right before starting this video and he was actually able to install it get it up and running by himself so you will all right so now that you actually know what this looks like I'm going to show you exactly how you can build it and have it for yourself so here's your first step you're going to install Python alright so just go online type in install Python or download Python and go to python org alright and here what you want to click on is download Python three point six point two or whichever version is available when you're watching the video button install the newer one now when you're going through the installation process especially if you're on Windows there will be a command it will say add this to path or there will be a little checkbox when you're installing it says add to path make sure that that checkbox is clicked this is very important if you don't get that step done then this app actually might not work for you so make sure that that step is done all right cool let's move on to the second step what I want you to do is go to Heroku comm and create an account I already have an account but what I need you to do is go to Heroku comm just create an account okay that is step number two okay after this what I need you to do is install the Heroku CLI client alright so if you don't know how to install it you can just literally look it up and I will walk you through how to do it between Windows and Mac because installation process and both of them is different ok so if you're trying to install it for Mac there's this command you can use brew install Heroku now I have a feeling a lot of you guys don't have brew on your home brew on your Mac ok so what I mean by this is you can just open up terminal right sorry you can just open up terminal and you can just type in brew install Heroku like this ok but this might now work for you because you actually might need to install homebrew first on your Mac so here's the command you need for that okay so install homebrew man look that up and here's what comes up it's the home brew package literally copy this line okay again press command space or hit the top search thing on your Mac type in terminal and hit enter and paste that command now once you paste that command it will install and obviously after pasting it you need to hit enter and once you do that it will install homebrew once homebrew is installed what you want to do is you want to do brew install Heroku and that will install your Heroku toolbelt ok or the CLI client now if you're on Windows what you want to do is go here and click the 64bit installer okay and then it's just a simple Exe file and just like hit next next next and download it ok I'm not going to take you guys through those steps because they're very simple and they're like it's a normal installation process so you have to use for installing anything right antivirus Microsoft Word it's the same thing as just a standard installation wizard alright so once we're done with all of that what I want you guys to do after this is um I want you to install git ok so if you don't have get what I want you to do is do install git ok and go here and just simply click on this thing if you're on Windows and just go through the installation process ok so they have an installation on Mac but you can try this so if you already have it you don't need to do it so if you type in git and you see some stuff pop up then it means you have git installed so you don't have to do anything but if it says command not found or something along the lines of some kind of error then maybe get isn't installed for you and it's not working on the windows to try out your command line how you're going to use it is you're going to hit the windows key or just open up the windows search bar or whatever type in CMD CMD or powershell and in there type in get and see if you have good or not if you don't have get what you want to do is install git for windows ok so here's this link and for me it's automatically installing but I'm going to cancel it because I am fond of Max that wouldn't make any sense all right cool so once we have get installed here is the next step okay and you can use you can literally copy the same step that I'm doing so here's what I'm going to do first if you look at my desktop I don't have something called flask vote app okay but now here's what I want you to see okay it's like magic I type in git clone HTTP github.com slash clever programmer slash flask vote app what I'll do for you is in the description I'll try to put in these commands so it's easier for you to actually just copy and paste them that way you're not likely to get frustrated by making simple mistakes okay so I'm going to do get clone now I forget if you get clone gives you problems I don't think you need to count on github.com but I think you should be fine all right so now that I've cloned it look at what happened I will have something called flask app on my desktop oh sorry I got to go to my desktop first so what I'm going to do on my Mac is do CD desktop and that should take me to the desktop because that's where you guys like installing your things right so you can see it but you don't have to do this if CD desktop is giving you an error or you're confused don't worry about that okay just simply do the command I just showed you for some reason it's not running that command for me yeah this one right git clone HTTP so now when I clone it the only reason I'm moving to my desktop and then putting it so you guys can actually see this flask vote app right here okay where I've just highlighted it alright so now that we have this app here's what we're going to do okay we're going to do CD and we're going to do CD flask underscore vote underscore app so we're actually in that folder okay so basically from the command line where as at we're acting as if we've just double clicked inside a flask vote app and then we see all this what we're just doing it from command line because we're cooler right we're like hackers okay so now what we want to do is we want to do a command called Heroku login and basically now you want to log into the Heroku account you created earlier cool so if this work and didn't even air that means you have logged into your Hiroko account after this we have a few more commands and after this your app should be actually up and running and people will be able to use it ok so we have a few more things just bear with me here all right and we're going to go right through them so let's try here okuu create okay at least I've reached I've reached the limit so what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete the app that I have right now so this way I don't reach the limit and I can go through this entire process with you guys okay so I've deleted my app now let's go back and let's type in here oku create again and let's call it something cool like my Gregor vs. Floyd okay whatever oh that's giving you problems too complicated let's just do Heroku oh crap alright it created on radiant forces I'm going to delete that again because I want to make sure that there weren't any mistakes that happen there let's just do Heroku create vote app ok whatever just call it something simple so if somebody has taken your app's name it wouldn't allow you to make it which is kind of what happened here when I did Heroku create vote app ok so now I just do Heroku create and this way what it does is it just creates a new app and it randomly picks a name for it so as you see our app is currently hosted on safe Hallows three four six zero zero kept calm but there are a few finishing touches we have to put so if you go to that link now like your app is up okay but if you go to it now is going to not show you anything so we have to put a few of the final touches okay so here are the commands for this and we're going to do get push Heroku master all right now this is an important command if it gives you an error at some point in here then there's a big problem but if it doesn't we should be good to go and how you're going to know it doesn't give you an error is it's not just going to like say it's a bunch of red text or something insane if it looks somewhat like it says something like done or verified then you're good okay so in my screen you're currently seeing what it's saying so right now just that done that's good and it says it's 48 point 3 megabytes okay cool all right now we're going to add our database because we want to all these votes that are coming in we want to actually be able to store them somewhere right so for that we need to create a database on Heroku right now what we're doing is we're taking this app and we're pushing it on this thing called Heroku where this Python app will live ok and how I'll prove it to its PI thon by actually going into flask vote app and I'll show you some code in like for example this file called run dot py and in this app you can actually see this is Python code okay so if you've never coded in Python before that's okay but if you have then you can see that this app is actually running on Python alright so I have pushed this now I'm going to create a database and I'm going to basically tell Heroku to create a database where we can actually store our votes and then actually every time we close the app and we come back to it the votes are still there this is a key key key point this is one of the things that I've had so much trouble with for such a long time because what I would do is I would only make these apps that would run but then when you close Python and you come back everything is gone so then what's the point of this it's not really a cool web app or a cool web site for anybody to use right imagine if somebody buy something like you go on amazon.com and you order something and when you click recent orders it shows up there but now you log out or you close Amazon you come back and you go to recent orders it's not there anymore all your recent orders are gone every time you close or get out of it that would mean if they like didn't have a database but in our case we have we want to have a database so it can store all that information you guys this is a absolute game changer this will make all of your apps useful give them life so I'm not going to talk more about this but it's just cool it gets me excited because this is one of those things that took me like two years to figure out and it changed my life now I'm just trying to make it as easy for you as possible all right let's finish this command that we're typing again I'll try to put all this in the YouTube description wherever you're watching the video I'll try to add in some kind of text so it's easy for you to see ok cool now our database is created another thing we need to do is tell Heroku to like launch a like a web worker so that just means it's going to like make it work ok don't worry about anything else without this is like won't work and you'll give yours cool and here's one of the last commands we want to type in so I have a script that creates all the flask tables and stuff and we want to run it from hero who's bash if that doesn't make sense don't worry too much about it because again the goal is to get you to have this app up and running and then later we'll focus at some point on how to create this ok I have a special announcement at the end of this video so make sure you stick around for that as well alright so now I have told told it where to find that script blah blah blah I'm going to exit out of it so what I did is ctrl D ok this is important one control D to exit out of what you were in okay and last thing I want to do hopefully this works fingers crossed is Heroku open once this works we should see this app up and running completely ahead and that should be really really cool boom there you have it this app is up and running that is so second I am so excited by this right now just looking at it it again this is one of those things that just took me literally forever to figure out so I'm really happy if you have gotten to this point let's type in one at gmail.com and vote for Conor McGregor and let's see what happens and boom there you have it let's do two at gmail.com and let's vote for Floyd Mayweather let's see what happens boom and now it put a vote for Floyd Mayweather and you can actually send this link you can actually go to this link right now save hollows whatever I'm not going to change it and you can actually vote right on this app to test it out also when you make your own app you can just share that link with anybody and anybody from anywhere in the world can go to your Python app and actually play with it now one of the cool things I want to show you is it let's say you want to make one or two changes to it right maybe you want to change the fighters maybe you want to change the colors maybe you want to change something basic okay I'm going to I'm going to just show you something very very basic if you want to change I'll show you how you can do that so we're going to go in our flask vote app I'm going to go in my either run py this is where I can change some of the Python code but let's say I want to change not my Python code but instead I want to change something like about the design of the website so I'm going to just do open with and I'll open it with sublime text if you don't have it download it it's a awesome editor for code and instead of saying who will win I will say are clever programmers comma who do you think will win okay and I'll put this question mark there I'll close out of it and I'll open my terminal again and what I'll do is these commands these commands you probably want to either write down or memorize or just write it down follow along get add I'll do get come in and I'll just say change headline okay whatever and I'll do get push Heroku master okay now if I it doesn't give me any errors when it's building this I should be good but if it does give me errors then I'm in trouble and if you ever close out of your terminal remember that command CD space slash underscore vote underscore app CD means change directory so when you open your command line and you type something like PWD it shows you where you are and if you're not in the folder called flask underscore voters for app then it means you're in somewhere incorrect so you want to do CD and then go in there otherwise these commands will not run all right so I push with Heroku and let's check it out what it looks like now and I'm going to hit refresh on this website and boom look at that it says clever programmers who do you think will win now if you want to get fancier you know with some of the code you can certainly try to do that and actually change like some of the more advanced code like not just random text but some of the stuff that's going on here in HTML or Jinja right you can change that but that's outside the scope of this video because already it's probably very long I really hope you were able to go through it get this up and running I think that was going to be fascinating please share that with your friends and family I would love for nothing more than that you know you just got just post it up and just see what your friend circle thinks who they think is going to win I think that's cool and if the votes are anonymous that's really cool too because you know you don't know which guy voted what and then you can ask them later have a discussion you know talk with your amongst your family friends and you know it's going to be an epic fight I think Floyd Mayweather is going to win if you ask for my opinion because I just think you know obviously he's been a boxer and this is what he does and Conor McGregor is in his territory where he's been champion for twenty years so I think he's at a disadvantage fighting against Floyd Mayweather I think if it was in the Octagon obviously Conor McGregor would win but right now you're in Floyd's Octagon so to speak so I think that McGregor is not really going to have much of a chance there though I am excited to see what happens in this fight okay hopefully you have this app running now here's an announcement um this app that you guys created you know again most of the coding specific stuff it's outside the scope of this video but if you really want to know how you can code this up how you can actually build your own custom web app how you can actually make this from scratch how you can change everything inside of this app or any other ones you make right if you want to know how you can become a web developer a programmer somebody who can actually build this from scratch and build bring this to life my course called create apps with Python and land your first client is going to be coming out this November 2017 if you're watching this video sometime after that that's fine what happens is I close this course down then I upgraded improve it make it so it's very results focused and you know gets you guys to become a developer as fast as possible and start making money with coding that's really the goal of this course so I close this course down for many months I only open it only a few times a year because the students that are inside of that course then I want to make sure that I'm focusing on them as well as then improving the course for the next time that I launch it okay so I'm going to be launching it in November 2017 and then I'll probably launch it many months after that so again if you're watching it sometime after 2017 you know I'll keep launching this course but here's what you can do if you're interested in joining this course there's a link below where you can sign up for free and that just shows that you're actually in interested and I'll also give you a bonus where I'll teach you how to create you know I'll give you my best coding resources that I that allowed me to become a developer in like less than three or two months and I'll give you those resources for free when you sign up for you know this this amazing course right this uh this list that we have so use the link below it's absolutely free I just want to see if you're interested in this course or not so then when this course gets launched everybody
