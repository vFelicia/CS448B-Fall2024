what is up guys are you excited you know why cuz I'm excited we are on part one two three four five six seven eight nine ten we are on part ten you guys that means you've officially run out of fingers to represent what part we're on so I'm gonna have to get very creative in the next tutorial but these are the kind of problems I like to face alright how am I going to represent eleven if you guys got any ideas put put them down in the comments below other than that check it out we are at 39% we were working and talking about some spending a day at the supermarket you know and we figured out in some better ways how to use lists and dictionaries so let's continue on this thing we've completed this part 30% string looping so just like Python lists and dictionary loops you can loop through strings here is an example I'm going to take this paste it here for letter in code Academy I can say print letter I will run it and you can see that it's going to print out see the first time oh the next time d the next time and E and so on and so forth as you can see here what happens well the first time letter is C and so it prints out a C then the next time the letter is o and therefore letter is o here and it prints out an O to the screen which you see right below the C and it keeps going all the way to the Y it prints out the Y and then it understands automagically that we have reached the limit we have reached the last letter in the string and so therefore it stops got it awesome so that is looping in a string pretty simple pretty nice so they have this here word programming is fun enough for a letter and word which means that we loop through the string programming is fun if the letter is I we print out the letter so here we only print out something if the letter is I so let's check out how this bad boy works word programming is fun here we're using the variable word you can also put the string here but that would be a little stupid and the reason is because we've already defined what word is so no need to redefine it simply use the variable right over here and no need to paste this whole thing because when the program is running this automatically gets evaluated to programming is fun okay so for letter in word so for letter in this string over here how many letters is this string have I don't know a lot more than 10 probably so the first time letter is P the next time the letter is R the next time it's o G blah blah blah then at one point the letter is going to be that little space in between programming and the word is then it's going to be I and in its S and then the space in between the is and fun part and the letter is going to go all the way up to being an exclamation mark and then this loop is going to stop when do we print out a letter the only time we print out a letter is when the letter is equal to I you see that that's what this line 5 is so we loop over and over and over again if the letter is I we print it out and so that's it so here it's going to print out I and print out I so it's pretty simple okay and if we wanted to get fancy want to get real fancy I bet they're going to probably have you do something like this later on but I'm going to just show you this right now because you know we're cool like that so on line 5 I'm going to create a variable called counter or count or let's call it counter and what it's going to do is it's going to keep track of the count of how many times we've seen the letter I so here I'm going to say counter is equal to counter plus one so every time it loops and it sees the letter I it will go into this if block and everywhere it sees counter everywhere it sees an i or once it sees an i it's going to increment the variable counter by one right so basically this is saying the old counter or the original counter is now equal to what counter actually was plus one okay or rather the new counter this part here is going to equal to what counter was or is plus one so this is going to change this counters value and then at the end of the loop we can simply print counter okay or actually at the end of the loop right so I'm going to uninvent it and put it right there and let's see where do we have an error inconsistent use of tabs and spaces okay let's go here let's go here make everything consistent okay so why did that happen oh sorry this should actually be outside of the loop you should run it and you can see counter is now says it's two okay for every time it saw I cool we got ahead of ourselves there but no worries it's all good owning a store alright so now we own a store let's see what they want us to do in this example we create a new dictionary animal counts with three entries key and value three key bear value six key crow value to each of them separated by commas as you can see create a new dictionary called prices using the dictionary format or the squiggly format like the example above so we're going to create prices and it's going to have put these values in your prices dictionary I am a good programmer as a lazy programmer and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to simply paste all this in there so I don't have to type we can call it prices is equal to blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah and let's put this on you know just to make it nicer and easier read okay we can certainly put all of this on one line but this is how I like to do it so it's very easy to read what the dictionary prices is and that's how you'll see it a lot of times in written in professional software development code yeah this place is really expensive your supermarket subsidizes the zoo from the last course let's do this thing and start next lesson investing in stock create a stock dictionary with the values below so we're going to call this dictionaries no no sorry stock so effectively what we're doing is we have a dictionary called prices and that's keeping track of how much a banana is and how much an Apple is and how much in orange is but in stock what we're keeping track of us how many bananas do we have how many apples do we have and how many oranges do we have okay so one is keeping price of the dollar amount of the thing and the other one might be keeping track of the quantity amount okay so stock is equal to this guy here and I'm going to do it the same way separated by commas because if you don't separate by commas it's going to give you an error so we got prices in stock cool let's keep going keeping track of the produce so now they're getting fancy here a little bit we'll talk through this one really quickly okay so they're created a dictionary called once and then they create a dictionary called twice this is an example they're giving you okay we have a key a with the value one key B with the value two and in the dictionary twice basically you know you see a is 2 B is 4 so what we're doing is for a key and once so for each key inside the dictionary once so the first time key is going to be a then the next time is going to be okay remember how we loop through just I'm going to print it out so you guys can see remember when we loop through a dictionary we access its keys every time so the first time key is a then the next time key is B so for a key and once print key right that's what we did but here's what they're showing us or here's the code that they have okay so we go and the keys in B now look in twice also notice that the keys are the same it's a and B so both of them have the same key now what we do here is once so we print out once and this % s is just a placeholder and you can put in anything that you want there so in our case we're accessing the value of the key so for example the first time we iterate over this we're going to get 4a in once one is going to get evaluated to you know that dictionary up there okay it's going to get evaluated to this thing which is the same thing as once so when we go through the first key then on line six what we're going to do is we're going to go to the dictionary once and access key key in our case is a the first time so once a should give you back one so now because of this place holder this part here translates to a one okay and then this part pretty much goes away and that gets printed out to the screen so you're going to get once one then the next time we go and then the same thing is going to happen for the twice part of it okay so twice key it's going to pass an a for it this gets evaluated to two and four twice we're going to have twice is two right there okay then if we go all the way back the second time in the loop of the dictionary once we'll access the key B then this will put be right here for the dictionary once which will give you back the value to it will replace because of the placeholder this would this part goes away we'll print that out it'll go into the twice key put B right here this part because we're doing dictionary key is going to give you back the value which is going to be four it's going to replace this with the four this part is going to go away and it's going to print that out so now hopefully you have a little bit of understanding of what's going on let's run it here and you can see once one twice then once twice for okay again your examples are weird right very force they could do much better than that but the choose not to so they can confuse you anyways let's keep going maybe if I get endorsed by Codecademy and I'm talking all these bad things about them sometime you know they might be like oh we don't want you to be endorsed by us in the above example we create two dictionaries once and twice and now because we met we know that they have the same keys we can loop through one dictionary and print values from both once and twice so the trick here is notice that they both have the same key so at the same loop going through really one dictionary once they know that the both have the same key so they can print both of their stuff out so the idea that they want you to take away from this is notice that the keys in prices and stock are the same right keys and prices and stock are the same so you can say four key in prices print prices so your dictionary key it's going to give you back the value and print prices or I'm sorry stock dictionary stock passing the same keys and you're going to get back to corresponding values so the first time you know if it's the key is banana for prices is going to print out for and for stock it's going to print out six okay but the first time the key was pair so it printed out at three and pair stock is fifteen so on and so forth okay you can see all of that okay let's continue moving on make sure you have exactly three print statements okay so we have to actually do something loop through so we wrote the loop I'm going to copy that loop right well I don't have to it's more we're copying and Equuleus wrote it loop through each key in prices so we done that four key in prices just by itself does that like the example above for each key print out the key along with this price and stock information print the answer in the following format so it should actually look like this so here's what I'm going to say print right we want to print out what key it is now underneath the key we want to print price right it should say price every time that's why I'm putting it in a string this is not a variable thing variable means something that changes this is a hardcoded thing and it should set price just like this with a colon after it now the next part of it is variable so I'm going to put that percent s as a placeholder I'm going to put a percent here and I'm going to say give me the value here from the dictionary prices prices pass in my key and effectively for the next one I'm going to do pretty much the same thing except the dictionary is going to be changed is going to be stock and I'm going to say stock right over here and if I save and submit this should work just fine so as you can see we have an orange in our shop and the price of that orange is one dollar and fifty cents and in stock we have thirty two oranges left as you can see in our next one price pair we have price three and stock fifteen so on and four so forth so hopefully you get the idea let's keep rolling something of value of paperwork interpret let's record the total value of your inventory it's nice to know what we're worth okay so we're going to create a variable called total and set it to zero all right total is equal to zero loop through the prices dictionaries for a key in prices for each key in prices multiply the number and prices by the number in stock so what we're doing is we're like let's say we have orange is 32 so we are going to be multiplying orange thirtytwo with orange 1.5 which means we're multiplying thirtytwo oranges with their price one dollar fifty cents that will tell you how much all your oranges are worth so 32 times 1.5 that gives you 48 which means that if you sold all your oranges you would have 48 dollars left ok you could do the same thing with you have to do the same thing with pears and bananas so you're finding what all other values are pretty much so for each key in prices multiply the number in prices by the number in stock okay so what I'm going to say and we have to add it to total okay print that value into the console on the Edit tools okay so prices key multiplied by the stock key and then I'm going to say total actually there's a smarter way to do this I'm going to call a create a variable called value and I'm going to set print value and I'm going to say total is equal to what taught so new total is equal to a total was which initially will be zero plus a value okay so for example if our key is banana we would have banana banana right here then we would go to this part and we would look up the dictionary and the dictionary would look up banana we'd go all the line two we'll see that the prices is four so this part is going to get evaluated to four we will look up banana in the stock dictionary we would see that the quantity of that is six so we would get 4 times 6 4 times 6 is 24 this part a values to 24 now with set print 24 and then it would say total is equal to 0 plus 24 which means total is equal to 24 which means that this total is also not equal to 24 this is how incrementing works now next time it's looping through and let's say it is Apple now now in okay we got to go back just so I have that code the total was at 24 let's remember that now we're going to go again and let's say this time it's Apple and prices we got app will look up Apple in prices and we'll look up Apple in stock apples price is $2 or whatever currency you're in and then Apple stock is 0 2 times 0 gives you 0 value is 0 and total is equal to total plus value this total is 24 is zero and so this effectively stays at 24 and then we loop again okay so I think you get the idea and I will move on from this part now okay and then finally outside your loop print total okay so outside the loop right if we keep it indented underneath the for loop then it's going to keep looping over and over again but we want to print out total only one so we're going to keep it outside of the loop here you can see 40 a 45 24 and all of that stuff and then total you see is 117 dollars right that's the total value of your store okay not a very expensive not a lot of money are making there so on fruit but hey better than nothing shopping at the market great work now we're going to take a step back from a management side and take a look through the eyes of the shopper in order for customers to order online we're going to have to make a consumer interface don't worry it's easier than it sounds so what we are going to be doing is we're going to make a list called groceries with the values banana orange and apple okay that's cool because we remember I was creating a lot of stuff with groceries earlier and I didn't even know about that they're going to be teaching you this so this is exciting everything that I was foreshadowing is coming into play somehow and I think we're going to keep this to be the last video of this this is we're going to keep this section to be the last section of this tutorial and then we'll continue afterward after that why don't we get tick marks for any of these that's weird okay so save and submit code gradually let's do one more part because that was very easy took no time at all oh now they're getting into some big stuff right here so what they're doing here is they defined a function whoops so they're doing is defined a function called sum which takes in as input up I'm assuming it says numbers here so I'm assuming it takes in a list of numbers and then it keeps a counter variable like total right there then it goes for each number in the list numbers are increment total by that number increment this is just like saying total plus number so increment total by that number and then return total so all it does is it goes one then it goes plus two so now total will be at three then it will see that we have five so we'll do 3 plus 5 we'll get back eight then it'll say eight plus ten right here we'll get back 18 and then it will say that plus 13 and we'll get back 31 and then I'll return 31 and this part will print out 31 and then we're good to go so let's now actually tangibly look at what might happen if we pass then this list and so here we define this function right when you define a function nothing happens right you just define it so if I print out nothing is going to get print out you have to call your function it's just like saying if I defined a variable V is equal to 5 well that's not going to do anything in and of itself I have to say a print V or whatever I have to call V and then it shows me the value of what V is so just like that we have to call our function but our function is dependent on a list of numbers so here we're creating a list N and we're giving it numbers 1 2 5 10 and 13 so we're calling our functions some and we're passing in this list over here so what's effectively happening is it comes to this here it puts in that list now it goes boom I've initialized total to zero let's get going this numbers is 1 2 5 10 13 the first time we loop through number is 1 so total gets incremented this is a shorthand for the incremental notation it gets incremented by 1 so effectively this total here becomes 1 then the loop goes again and it goes okay now I'm so what I'm going to do is that so this part here says number right so now this part is 2 and so total gets incremented by 2 and we get 3 2 here then it becomes 5 it gets implemented by 5 this becomes 8 and once all that happens it's finally 13 or sorry this part is finally 13 total gets incremented by 13 so at that point whatever it is something like 31 and you return 31 so what you've done is you've taken this whole list and add it all up and that's how you return 31 makes sense if you do 1 plus 2 plus 5 plus 10 just to doublecheck you indeed get 31 and so will your function so let's call our function now with the given list and let's see if it gives us back 31 print Python 3 parent is a function you have to put parentheses after it and we indeed do get 31 so define a function anytime this I define a function where a d EF compute bill takes one argument food as input in the function create a variable total with initial values 0 for each item in the list for each every time I here for each I'm writing a for loop for each item in the list so item in food or in shopping list soon um right this variable right here shopping list that's where I'm getting that from and item is just a arbitrary variable you can call it whatever you want I'm gonna call it item and after put a colon and hit enter after that don't forget at the price of the item to total so I'm going to say I'm going to get the user prices so I'm going to take the variable total and I'm going to increment it using the shorthand notation and to get the price of that item so here banana orange and apple well which dictionary am I going to look up the pricing of that item in stock no I'm going to look it up in prices so I'm going to call the prices dictionary pass in that item as a key and I'm going to be incrementing total by that and then it says a return total so after we are done with that it's going to return total so the first time is going to be banana banana and then it's going to look up a banana in the dictionary and it's going to increment this by 4 then you look up orange it's going to look for it's going to be orange and the shopping list it's going to come down here it's going to look up orange in the prices that whole part is going to get evaluated to 1.5 this is going to get incremented by one point five so this is now going to be you know what was it for so now it's going to be five point five and it's going to maybe return that right or add Apple and then return it um okay cool so let's take a look at how this works compute bill Apple return something incorrect hmm let's see what we did wrong note that your function should work for any food list let's see why it returned a wrong answer I have total here I loop through I use the key to access that item I increment total by that and then once the loop is over I return the total so once it passed it Apple for some reason it returned oh I see I'm being silly I should not be using okay so this is a common mistake that beginners made and apparently I've made that's what happens when you're live coding you make a lot of silly mistakes but it's okay because it's part of a learning experience what I forgot to notice that it's a function so we're taking in food as a parameter so I'm not going to hard code and put this shopping list on line one from line one I should actually put food here this way you don't have to give me this exact exact list you could be giving you a different list for example if you gave me a list like this my code should work fine but if you also gave me a list with just one item Apple the code should also work fine but in this case shopping list if you use this function compute Bill and you try to pass in a list with like let's say just Apple what's going to happen is that is going to still be using the shopping list and not what you actually gave me as input so silly little mistake there let's fix that with food and that should be now golden okay perfect this this is it for this video guys please if you get a chance we've just reached 100
