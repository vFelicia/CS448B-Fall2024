testing to see if we're going live on YouTube let me know if we are I'm just doing YouTube right now it's showing me that I'm live my life I'm live on YouTube oh wow that's epic see okay cool restream chat all right guys how many people are here one person that can't be right bro I it says I'm alive oh okay so we figured it out guys what we're gonna do sorry about this we're testing out this new live setup I'm gonna jump off live and then in just a second I'm gonna jump back on I have something important on my mind something important to talk to you about and I hope I see you there sup guys this is cozy I hope we're gonna be live in just a second so I'm gonna wait for it just so it pops up cool we are live YouTube is killing my channel and I mean what the [ __ ] why YouTube why why are you doing this to me look at this this is the lowest amount of subscribe this is a lowest number of subscribers and views we've had on this channel since the birth of this channel okay since this channel started look at this 2016 alright and now we're getting less subscribers and even 2016 all less views than 2016 now why is YouTube doing this well this is a funny thing about YouTube right if you're caught on the bad side of the YouTube algorithm you kind of get really [ __ ] up but I want to make this a lesson for everybody don't give up you're gonna have these difficult things happen to you in your life where it's like it's the end of the world I mean think about it right we're running an entire business that's dependent on this YouTube channel we have our whole team we're creating content on a daily basis I mean this is what I do every day create content for you guys manage the team make sure that you guys are getting consistently something like on YouTube getting consistent content on emails work consistently creating new free courses new free coding tutorials new products for you guys so this is this right here right is our livelihood this is my livelihood this is this is everything for me so why is this happening look at the number of subscriber right we were getting 400 subscribers on a daily average up until just a few months ago and now why 140 average subscribers on YouTube okay is it because we're producing content consistently you know and this is good content we have good thumbnails right sure we dropped this one it got 88% people were like hey this is a click baby thumbnail cool we're gonna improve on it okay we're gonna improve and we're gonna make it better but like if you look at all of this other content this is a three hour long livestream that we just did recently and it has 98% likes a dislike ratio and it has a really high watch time and this was a great video where we built a full application from scratch okay we're interviewing developers like these are fullon hardcore interviews I interviewed a developer who is that Facebook we interviewed a murrain this video what programming language to learn first is probably the most detailed one of the best videos on what programming language you learn first it's 45 minutes long of just valuable content so yeah I don't know what's happening in the chat I'm seeing this right now people are like let me see if I can actually hit some button and make the chats come up or something like that but probably not but to be honest with you guys I don't know why this is happening okay so people angel Carter is like seriously what's going on Ville is like what is happening Omar says hope everything goes well Jonathan's like I love your channel please don't stop man thank you guys like a support right now means [ __ ] everything with our team we have this thing for calling it like operation save YouTube and save this entire business and this channel because at this rate we're not gonna have a business like in a few months we're gonna be out of a business and I can't create this content this is my passion this fuels me this is something that I want to be doing every day to this date we have zero dollars of profit every day okay zero dollars of profit every month the reason is that we continuously reinvest into the business continuously reinvest into creating courses continuously reinvest into making free information available for every single person out there so this is like Ronald says are awesome maybe you broke into let me see what are the comments that we're getting okay love your channel please yeah we'll try not to stop Ronald says maybe you broke into a new barrier of views this is not a new barrier of views so like let me let me go back to the screen here right these are the three hundred and eighteen thousand views this is what we were getting around this number like back in 2017 this is 2019 so we're not breaking into a new segment of views and the way the curve is going it's actually to keep dropping if we take a look at the amount of subscribers right five thousand subscribers but this is not true or recent my most recent analytics actually said we've got three point nine thousand subscribers so now we're officially like I mean this is this is officially like literally the day that channels started so now we're back to that and actually on a decline right so that trend is there and it's gonna it's gonna keep going down and YouTube is a really weird beast you don't have control over it but I'm also not gonna cry and gonna be a little [ __ ] because they allowed us to put content on here for free but it's just that at this point we have to get smarter with the strategy so when trying to come up with it's something that's stressing the whole team out but I think that we can get really creative here and come up with some kind of strategic solution I will not let this [ __ ] channel die okay we worked really hard to build it so we're definitely gonna try not to let this channel die off and when YouTube likes you then it's putting all your content in front of people and when it like you it stops putting the content in the recommended right recommended is how channels grow so for example if you go to your home page right and my video is not showing up here and it's not recommended then that video is not gonna grow then this channel is not gonna grow and YouTube is just choking us it's like not putting any of our content in the recommended and all of that why no idea sometimes YouTube just plays these games with you but one hunch we have is maybe we can improve the watch time of the channel so one of the things that we're seeing a lot of people do right and Joshua a fluke who's a YouTube channel is really really smart I've been watching him and growing it really fast and I'm like what the hell is happening is this one enema dude he just sits in his chair and he talks really monotonous Lee what the [ __ ] is going on how is he growing so fast and he's a smart dude like one of the things that he says that I loved and actually took away from it was he's like when he tried so many things that he failed and he goes what I learned from my grandpa he goes he said that and when things are going he's like when things are going good he's like keep your head up and when things are going bad when things are wait hold on listen when things are going bad keep your chin up when things are going good keep your head down and keep going so I love that but what I learned what he was doing was he's really smart and people who are smart are figuring out how to actually hack the algorithm they're figuring out what they can do to actually go around the algorithm or actually the boost algorithm and YouTube is all about watch time nothing gets more watch time than live streams and so we're like hey [ __ ] it maybe we'll do more live streams and then that's what we decided to do we want to do this week we want to try out live streaming seven days a week and just see how it does okay if the Challenger is growing and we're sure getting more views cool we'll keep going with it if it keeps dying we'll keep trying new strategies what Oh somebody just sent $5.00 holy [ __ ] let me see holy [ __ ] how about the Christ okay so seeker just sent five oh hold on we got this punch and capability baby okay let me put it right there please focus please focus can you hold the camera button so focuses just lightly there okay so that's awesome seeker just said hey have you tried collaborating with others youtubers to get more viewers and subscribers honestly I have not tried that yet I have to try that I got to collaborate with other youtubers but to get going Jose he wants to learn I see her ads in multiple videos a day yeah we're trying to run ads to grow the business or something you know so we can get some revenue so we don't literally die off like YouTube is choking us so all organic Reach is dead so we're now running ads so we can grow the business get revenue and like survive because if we don't we just we won't survive at this rate like when because if we don't get views then we don't get people into our email list if people don't come into our email list we can't sell the coating products if we can't solve the coating products well then there's no business right we don't have a business make your own platform and monetize it software called PHP Payan all the rights to my site ronald that's pretty smart I'd love to talk to you about that yeah so like for example right where's Joshua fluke he's man this guy's smart he's [ __ ] smart he's awesome too like you know what to be honest I'm not gonna lie I [ __ ] hated the guy before because I just like nice guys just stole monotonous and like boring but he's just really really smart and his grind is awesome he just doesn't stop and he keeps going and what I realized was like he makes good content it's not that he's not making good content but it's like he's figuring out a way to actually grow his YouTube right so for example take a look at this every day he's figured this out which is he makes a video and then he goes live oh right here right live he makes a video then he goes live every red dot that you see is actually him going live he makes a video and then he goes live so basically for every two videos about you'll see one live okay live and the thing about lives are that it the when the watch time I think grows on YouTube it starts recommending your videos like people so then he'll have a random video which will do like crazy numbers you're like what this isn't even like a crazy popular title but I mean 37,000 views for two days this is this is better than some channels I've seen with a million subscribers he's doing better than them let me see rdrd says you should reach out let me see the comment you should reach out to other youtubers I've heard this from other creators lately I think it's I think it's a way door officially decrease your revenue streams expose YouTube strengthen numbers yeah man that is just painful yeah you're right I think we have to like gotta collaborate or something yeah Jarvis Johnson he created remember like I don't know if you guys remember but Jarvis Johnson grew hundred thousand subscribers overnight you really think he created a video that was so incredible that like you went from twenty thousand subscribers so like 150 thousand subscribers his scripting is really great his comedic timing is really good okay I'm not taking any of that away from him but to grow by a hundred thousand one day that's ridiculous he got the the algorithm he got locked down on the algorithm and overnight so this is a lot about algorithm it's not about the content it's not about the quality sometimes the algorithm just favors you and you go [ __ ] nuts and then sometimes algorithm doesn't favor you and it just chokes the [ __ ] out of you and there's literally almost nothing you can do we've been creating consistent content the entire year this year I was the most consistent I've ever been Emporia says clever programmers one of the best channels on YouTube that keeps inspired keep going learning and being the bestest thank you so much I really really appreciate it we don't have a patreon we try to do our business from like actually creating digital products bringing value to you guys but when YouTube chokes us we don't get people in and then we can sell a product and we literally have about $40,000 $45,000 per month expenses every month if not more because we're so much focused on content creation we have a big team and everybody just trying to focus on how can we provide you with free value on a weekly basis you know secret yeah thank you thank you thank you man I love this yeah Jonathan says get a hold of Johnson mez including Bulldog yeah I'm actually in touch with yeah I mean I'm in touch with John actually but we're not live on Facebook are we we are oh sweet yeah so basically I'm in touch with John and we do could do collaborations and I'm even about to meet him again and so yeah that's actually a really good idea Jonathan Richard do to duplicate content it's hard to get original content topics nontech huh Wow is that what it is I don't know what that means is it because we're creating it cuz like I'm trying everything like I'm literally trying everything right like for example I have these right if I go to my videos I have these garyvee style of videos where we're going deep so like you're getting very very deep level content right it's 45 minutes 21 minutes and I'm going super deep and providing massive amounts of value we tried doing a podcast which is like fun entertaining lots of value two hours long I tried doing these short videos like the same video that I created a while ago that like generated 800,000 views now at plateaued like what can you do with Python it's a popular title and now I just plateaued at 8,000 views everything it just chokes it like nothing in the last few months has gone over like 10,000 views and we have a huge channel like it should be wait [ __ ] more than that's amazing that's awesome it should be way more than you know the the 2,000 or 1000 views that we get but it's just not putting us out in front of the people I'm trying to see what other comments a seeker says seeker and thank you so much I really appreciate the secret just sent another two dollars and seeker says make March and I'll buy a shirt with your face on it okay yeah well we'll put some merch if somebody wants to help us out there's something called T Springs I think you can integrate it with YouTube and we could sell mushroom there I think that'd be cool yeah but Richard I think you might I don't know you might be right on that we might be hitting some kind of duplicate content algorithm which I don't know what they know what that means but maybe we're doing too many videos aren't popular topics but not too many like this year we literally did one like day in the life of a software engineer but most were top two huh so I'm curious I don't know how to trace the video backlinks Ronald collab would Patrick shoot technically he's killing it lately yeah that would be awesome if somebody wants to put in a word with tech lead like I don't care like I'll fly to these [ __ ] like you know and make videos with them I'd love to like I know I have good stuff to ask and I can bring a lot of value by asking questions and all of this stuff and there's a lot of great content that we have for you guys that is you know I genuinely think it's really really valuable it just needs to be able to get out more in front of the people so yeah I'd happily collab with tech lead or Joma tag or any of these like if you guys want to reach out to them that I really really appreciate it we'll reach out to them to honor says make a digital marketing course yeah I can I can definitely do that yeah I think that would be cool I'm thinking about creating like a personal brand course for developers and I think that might be really really cool but right now we're all all gears in unlike operations save YouTube Sam says you should collaborate with Joma tech yeah man like I I should I should I'll reply here collaborate honor says hire me as a digital marketer yeah I mean if you're a good man like send us an email like honestly we're looking for anything right now to grow anyway like it would just be the worst day of my [ __ ] life if does YouTube channel dies I would literally cry myself to [ __ ] sleep like this means everything way too hard like to build this so we don't want to lose this channel that we built you know and we want to keep it going and keep it growing we're growing on Instagram but like YouTube is just really really hurting you just mass front and drag there's no how to monetize okay Michael says I think people are looking for onscreen tutorials so Michael okay that's a great point now let me show you my point okay so let's go to our videos right I would so look at this we made a whole series on onscreen tutorials the same type of videos that do so well that like get millions of views right and even on my channel these have gotten hundreds of thousands of views but this video for example what are variables with Python the same thing that for many other people have gone 300,000 views right and it's a screen casts type of tutorial 12,000 views 6000 views 3000 views 2000 years 2000 years 1000 views and all of these respond screen tutorials right then we get advanced web scraping how'd 8 times work 11,000 mm so like I'm thinking okay if these are not gonna work then I'm not gonna keep making the tutorials because then the channel dies off right so we want to be careful with that here's another example like we built this entire app right this app we livestream built this like literally in front of everyone's face we're like this is what its gonna look like it's gonna be a Craigslist clone it's gonna be awesome and then we add a stuff on the whiteboard and the functionality of this app and what its gonna do and all of that but and it was a three hour long tutorial in which we actually build out this entire app we literally built out this entire thing and when you type in the result and then we even hosted it on Heroku so for you guys who can see the link if we show the link you can literally even go and use the app so let's go back so we're doing LAN screen tutorials as well yeah you can borrow for sure please create a marshmallows looking for a clever program or a shirt and pillows even wristbands okay so on YouTube we can create a Murr store and then we can see how that yeah we can definitely put together a mere store I think that would be awesome but Thank You Jonathan for that idea that's great armor says where did you get your shirt I want it I actually got it it's funny like my my girlfriend it's like she's not a fan of this shirt she's like it's just too wild I'm like that's why I if I can love this shirt is awesome I got this shirt from uh what was that store do you remember sorry no that's all know I ever been Urban Outfitters yeah I got into Urban Outfitters I don't know if I'll be able to link to it have you said anything bad to youtube no man I don't even have the power I'm nobody on YouTube but 300,000 subscribers YouTube is not even gonna like think about you I don't know who Carly clausus but I'll try to reach out to them okay let's reach out to all these people let's reach out to Patrick Xu let's reach out to Joe METEC I just want to do something to help him grow I even reach out to coding dojo and then unfortunately something happened with his eye during that time I messaged him about it that was did that video made me cry that that's [ __ ] weird like I started crying randomly Isabeau says what can we do here hope we can talk about this over a meeting next week yeah Isabel that'd be amazing message me on Instagram let's talk about it Carlos says I'm kind of new to this channel and I have to admit that it would be an awesome experience to work with you yeah if you're interested in helping out or being able to work like we have lots of opportunity is just that we have lots of customers too but one we don't keep any profit we just consistently reinvest in the business to grow as aggressively as possible to our entire YouTube is on decline our entire engagement everywhere for whatever [ __ ] reason is on decline which is crazy to me on Instagram is great on Facebook it's much better on email if we're getting good engagement but YouTube has been our primary source we've gotten everything from and then YouTube is just choking us and that's been the biggest problem so like if we can get some smart and brains on our side figure it out it's like that would be the most unbelievable day on the planet but for the new people who are coming in like this is what I'm talking about right like 13 million views we've been consistent we've never dropped off the map like I've never gone away like there's so many other people to like come and then they'll like work for a month and then then like walk off then they promise that they're gonna come back and then they come back for like a week and then they go away we've never went on what we've been super consistent and but this is what YouTube is doing this is what's happening this is like this year okay 2019 has been our most consistent year and this was the trend consistent videos and so this is the thing that's been really confusing me and my team and really confusing us you go too deep you can also work on smaller scale projects usually smaller game development tutorials go higher sure we can work on yeah that actually makes somewhat that that is actually not that's actually pretty smart because that kind of makes sense so we we went a little deep on this project right so we got less of you we got a decent amount of views build a Python Craigslist web scraping clone but then one word rebuilt a tictactoe app where was it tictactoe app that did get 38,000 views and it's growing so maybe there's something to that you're right I gotta look into that thanks Anna do you regret moving to San Francisco absolutely I'm not in San Francisco I'm actually in Los Angeles and don't regret it at all teach web scraping yeah I can definitely teach that like it's fun to me I can teach it live and then with this setup we'll just be [ __ ] a little bit like all right guys let's jump into the code I'll open up the coding ever you know it would be actually really fun yeah what's dev is my friend Tenzin he literally started his YouTube channel because I told him to start and then we started working together on you know videos so yeah he's he's awesome he's been off the map he recently just got back on and I hope that he stays consistent and he keeps going because that channel has a lot of potential but yeah that's you know yeah I know what stuff is he's my best friend I think it's a mass John Parker says I think it's a mass traffic that has been driven to your content from the ads this might have activated a bot protocol meaning to limit the amount of engaging that page will get hmm I don't know if I believe that Frankie do you have any counter example of somebody running ads and they're growing dan Locke probably runs YouTube ads right he runs YouTube ads right for sure and he's one of the fastest growing channels right so damn yeah look and he's running YouTube ads too right so yeah these people are growing really fast if you look at Dan Locke's Channel that video that got 5 million views I'm sure he was running ads to it like crazy right and and so his channel is like growing really really fast so I don't think it's the ads I gotta be honest I don't think is in yet duplicate content where everything is original on our page so again with duplicate content I'm not so sure Michael just says upload daily you're doing fine okay yeah we can definitely try that I think I'll go live for sure every day seven days a week and then see how that does when we did go live when we did put a YouTube video every day we were doing pretty pretty well yeah so linked in live that's I actually didn't even know there was linked in live until just recently so I'm using the software that allows me to live stream on Facebook and YouTube so I'll try to do both I'll push there as well hunker says I think you should get into other technologies as well not just Python now only those people come to your channel who search about Python I agree but I feel like it's niche enough you know where it makes sense it's not too huge but I can definitely I thought about it I can definitely teach JavaScript I feel like I could teach you really really well you know like um I I've been a teacher my whole life and I relate with people a lot so like I could I could teach it really well I feel like but I never stepped into it so maybe that could be something for me to look into with JavaScript and yeah teaching something else maybe I could try I could try that Pardons channel is only Python as much as a lot for but that's not as widespread sadly also maybe emerging technologies yeah machine learning web applications if any of you guys is good at machine learning please reach out to me because I'm an idiot and machine learning but what I'm good at is explaining things in a way that like majority of the people can understand so if you can teach me and I'm slow in learning if you can teach me machine learning I will teach it on this channel and and then yes we get any students I would happily send them your way and then you can do oneonone with them or whatever ok new to game development it's you guys cool and want to be a Python think you need importance I think you need a business course that teaches you how to diversify your tools platforms my income streams I think YouTube slowly on some scores or its mission of who they want and don't want yeah so we are trying to diversify your right we're trying to diversify on both Facebook and and Instagram and then our email list and we are now looking into paid traffic as well to grow I mean everybody who's big and doing really well they're running paid traffic you know so we're working on that as well okay Josh of Lewy sponsored other coding sites because if you do okay Vidia is about framework concepts you know Django just another framework such as MVC middleware out someone explaining these things is so hard to find okay yeah I can talk about the model of you you know MVC the Model View controller and middleware and routes yeah I could talk about that yeah my ol P course just closed if you didn't see it or whatever like DM me if you have a good reason like we can I can talk to you but just DM me on Instagram ayan replied a lot of people later like another thing that we're trying to do is doing coding boot camps in person I we reran a boot camp just recently we had four people from the clever programmer students who flew in he had a software developer of 34 years of experience flying from Florida we had another student who flew in from Hong Kong we had another student who flew in from New Mexico right Ben and then Donny had came from San Francisco and yeah they're killing it at their development jobs and then the boot camp for them was more around how to create a personal brand as a developer so that's something that I'm also interested in it that's also something that would help out the business cash flow and something I believe we can really really help people in so that's another one of those areas we're looking to to provide for people like a threeday inperson you and I hash it out bootcamp or on coding personal brand and you getting clients you know cuz that's a skill that we have down on our team that's a skill that I have down and I could be good too John says I think you should keep going as you aren't Aamir contents again and although I'm nowhere near becoming a freeman I've still benefited from your channel okay that's really good I'll do that sam says talk about money it's part of the algorithm okay mmm Naveed please message me on instagram have a join button on youtube sure thank that could be cool I love her content thank you so super John later this Isabelle says that's actually when the project is supposed to be working on letters at now I think we should do it where they're kind of a need now yeah it kind of is I think we need to do something fast python is literally your trademark like seriously but you know professionally professionally usually don't jump over Python and beginners can't usually sync with all the difficulties seeker says have you tried diversifying your content like vlogs or something more lighthearted yeah we have we have a lot of vlogs that went to die like saws and worked on like crazy you spend some of them weeks months working on and then just get like almost very little views very little engagement they don't get promoted by YouTube and so we couldn't get that to work and then we kind of have to stop the vlogs some lighthearted stuff that actually you know doing not so bad is this recent video I made where okay I think my computer's too slow right now so I'm gonna let that go but this recent video I made with my girlfriend where I'm teaching her to code for the first time that one did well but I feel like even that just capped out at 7,000 views 8,000 views so it's doing well but like YouTube is just choking it now okay John Parker says I'm gonna message you an Instagram I have a few suggestions and tips that could help this stop this mass reduction yeah I would really really appreciate that we're posting really good content on Instagram we're growing on Instagram as well so I'll share my screen real quick with you guys so the Instagram this is our Instagram clever cause it's my Instagram and we have pretty good content on here like really valuable content all stuff for developers for example today I posted this the other day coded is not hard you just have to stop you little [ __ ] but in five hours a day put in 10 hours a day might catch you if you can do that the results I'll just get in five years in only three months oh that [ __ ] is lip right so you could use a little kick in the ass yeah but please message me collab with code grid you want to write this down frankly code grid I don't know who that is I did Sam yeah I talk about topics like imposter syndrome and all that stuff but it just goes to die like some of the stuff will I went the deepest and it's like one of the most thoughtprovoking content on personal development and it's awesome like it's my I love it we have people going to and people consume it and we have insanely high like to dislike ratios like 99.9% likes and like high watch times but then it gets like no view is like two thousand three thousand views and it just dies off and some of that content like I really really believe in but YouTube is like nope nope and so then you know like I want to be like Gary Vee and go permanently but then there's the practicality of actually running this business and then if this dies then like everything dies and then the team can't work together and so then the consistent content can come out and then I have to go back to Chicago and live with my parents or I have to freelance or basically whatever the solution is right this it's going to be something where it's really hard to do the YouTube and the stuff that I really love to do right it would be more than then like my next pivot is not gonna be probably even coding it'll be like business because I understand business well and I have worked with a lot of people and I've helped them with their funnels and we help just this person do a product launch and he generated over ten thousand dollars from that product launch and now he can just rinse and repeat like what's dev for tenzin you know how I helped him with the jab jab JavaScript product and then we launched that product and then he generated a lot of revenue from it and he does the same types of launches that I've done and my brother the cause man you know I've helped him like do the same thing so then I would just go into business field and then charge a lot for it but this is something that I really really enjoys I don't want it to go away I wanted to stay and want it to be the main thing that we actually do emporia says i think you need some recurring income sources and only a specific amount invested into the business while some money goes to other income streams like buying online businesses that is a great point I love that only thing is I hate doing online coaching like I don't like it I don't I enjoy it when I'm there like I love it when I'm on a call and then we get going we get deep into like topics but I just don't like the feeling it's very cold when I'm speaking to somebody / zoom I love in person like in person so one of the things we are thinking about is like doing monthly boot camps here in LA but I don't know the demand for it from our audience like do people want to actually fly in and do it in person do people want to do virtual boot camps but I really prefer three to seven intense days like you know it could be a thousand two thousand dollars and then you get seven days you know and it's only three to five people so you want to do personal brand you want to learn how to get clients you want to take your coding skills so like next next next level that I would love to do in person for five to seven days straight that sounds like much more fun to me and it sounds like something that will be a recurring income stream okay ai is a good topic for sure yeah AI am Sam you went say I'm actually DM you and Instagram I think AI might be a good thing to talk about why I'm said I think you should focus more in tutorial series and go long term instead of trying to only trendy videos good point except we executed a series of 31 videos over the course of 31 days which took the entire team's time doing nothing else but that and it was one of the worst things that has ever happened to the channel it was like collectively collectively all 30 of those videos probably didn't even get more than 50,000 or 40,000 views and so with that much time spent and effort spent and money spent and like intellectual property spent on creating something and then it doesn't do any almost anything that's a huge huge huge hit so that we did try tutorial series but it's a very questionable how it's doing a lot of YouTube and social media I see it as like how good are you at like countering right like it's not just you're not just like punching a bag you're it's more like right like about like your there's a lot of countering that you're doing so counter punching is what I think makes you good at this not like one plan just execute it forever because you never know what's gonna hit a nerve you never know what piece of content like how people are gonna react like I made a video by most programmers were broke right that video I just expected to do regular but it's actually one of the highest performing videos and it just did so well it we struck a nerve and people were seeing it and they were going crazy and they loved it but you just never really know what's gonna hit a nerve people are saying check your DM okay I'll check my DM on my Instagram okay I'm John Parker from the livestream I'll talk to you after the stream it's awesome okay that's awesome love it okay just sorry about you okay another person okay so thank you guys yeah we're getting a bunch of messages from Instagram and I'm trying to respond to them hey William Kirk says hey bro when can I start working for you guys with Python I'm ready to fly out and start career yeah if if any of you guys are interested in like taking your coding skills and you want to take your like getting clients skills to the next level and you want up flying and work with our team that's [ __ ] awesome like we just want to be around likeminded people and everywhere everybody's growing like we're going to the gym we're [ __ ] going out having a good time but most importantly we're creating content and staying super focused on what we do that is my zone of genius and everybody who's on the team that's Arizona of genius like as a team in the mornings we go to the gym then we come back and then we just put and work and we just produce content like for the rest of the day and like really fun engaging things and a lot of like strategy takes place and team meetings take place and so yeah if that's one of the things like you want to increase your coding skills and then you want to work for us like cool like flyin that would be awesome I'm down write and published articles on medium to get your name out there for sure that's another thing we can do just takes more time and energy and effort but we're definitely now if I probably need like more handson people I'm planning to rock the coding world awesome Billiam I even remember the message you sent on the chat gained 20 pounds of muscle I make videos about it yeah definitely yeah let me just quickly gain 20 pounds of muscle in four years yeah see what's trending on Google and YouTube and curate your content based on these trends if you want to find any good topics let me know and then maybe I'll make some videos around that but you know I sometimes I have this weird feeling around creating content around these trendy topics I just feel gross I don't know why like I want to talk tell people the truth and I want to talk about what people really could use help with instead of just trendy videos like to me it feels really Hollow I'm not interested in that but that's what has to be done to grow the channel to a point where it's not time then cool I'm I might just do it yeah Kevin Roman exactly I love this video Sam says where do you work as a developer yeah now my whole thing is this clever programmer it's everything for me but before this I was doing a lot of freelancing and teaching coding so between these two platforms why is that and take lessons I was making about 80 to 90 thousand dollars a year and then if you added coding freelancing on top of that I was making over 110 thousand dollars a year while I was going to Oakland Community College you know as a as a college student Joshua flew grew and you followed a developer from a bootcamp for a weekly catchup okay that's pretty smart too how's your podcast going we got to put out more podcasts I'm currently learning data science why don't you teach about it because your teaching skills just damn I would love to teach about it I just don't know much about machine learning and data science myself so if I had somebody teach me then I could teach it really well in a way that's relatable for people our bana says it's funny because I found this on the recommended list boom YouTube algorithm hacked so I guess the way that you guys could help is like literally don't log off this live stream I think that way you guys could help even more than like shirts and and buying stuff like if I go live you just click on that video you just let that [ __ ] thing play you two will be like man now watch time is high recommend recommend recommend I think that's how it works right that's how it works you have to promote your love for YouTube they don't like any negative talk well oh [ __ ] you now I'm kidding I love YouTube they're allowing me to put my stuff out for free I am NOT going to complain I'm saying that I'm losing the game with the current strategy we have which you know who knows why because the rules aren't clear but I'm willing to keep going and figure it out you should not post too often that's how most channels I've seen dyed dyed Cavalli this is what I'm talking about I'm not posting too often but garyvee is growing dan lock is growing with daily videos Joshua fluke is growing with daily videos Grant Cardone is growing with daily videos there's magic behind daily videos and also live streams these guys are doing a lot of live streams because I think they figured out that that's what grows the watch time the most of Joshua fluke if you're watching this I'd love to do a collab with you tech lead let's do a collab John what says Nicole matech right let's do a [ __ ] collab and we'll make it really easy for you guys my team will fly in and we'll create some [ __ ] epic content together I'd still want my channel to die that's it is that too much to ask for he'll stay PP post a video every week that's how Facebook post work okay yeah okay let's see I don't watch okay Michael Hudson says I don't watch for sponsors okay cool I got it got it okay William Kirk says YouTube won't put all 31 videos and they recommended tap for sure it won't but it'll put one you know that's that I think beauty about like making multiple pieces of content because then you'll start to see like what sticks hey William Kirk since I'm a young artist making alternative music how can i code a music video app on YouTube look up Berlin credit the final showdown it's epic and would like to collapse for a project is that this it before my videos get that you get the copyrighted push to my face and shuts down damn Kirk that seems pretty dope homey I got to watch more of it yeah so code a music video app that's not that hard like just learn basic Django stuff is he saying something I don't understand Frankie okay I'll go read that but yeah it's just learned up just watch my last video actually watch my last video on or one of my last live streams where I coated up a whole project for three hours and there's a full like blown full stack web application you'll learn a lot from it John Parker says I would totally joined this boot camp but I live in London so I'd give pain to slightly so this is the thing so I get that and then what we were thinking what should we do a virtual boot camp with people so it's like long sessions on the daily but it's virtual so then you could actually do it from the comfort of your home and so that was another one of the ideas we had but that makes sense John yeah alex says maybe doing some realworld project maybe a pickup opensource project step by step it should be hot yeah that's that's pretty good yes sir he says I hate that Jim five times a week bro hell yeah modern games try something different AI is good cool feel about machine learning yep you learning out design episodes just like that one oh machine learning I have to design epic shirts does somebody want to make that app that would be awesome will promote your app yeah I'd love to do this too if you guys make apps you guys can submit them in and then I'll do a video on them right so for example Shane and Eddie and all you guys like if you make some kind of app I'd love to like break down the app and like do a video reviewed video you know of your app and like react to it and give some feedback I started YouTube document the hackathon yep smart Eddie document everything that you're doing my man Sam I love their suggestions my man up templates up templates if you want to help me out gain 20 pounds of muscle my friend there would be a lot I'd be happy to do for your business that's all I'm gonna say because that's a that's a very important part of my life yeah Shanta is all about live streaming these days and you know you know what I kind of agree Sir Roger of all yeah he's awesome I met him a few times I would love to meet him up yeah demonstrations yep they just containing swearing I know said impacts of results I don't think so I don't think so because I just recently watched a video that was called my brain is [ __ ] or why your brain is [ __ ] and that videos growing and it's on people's recommend it and it's actually doing really really well so and Gary Vee swears a lot if you haven't heard him swear so I don't think Phillip that it has to do with swearing I could be wrong maybe sponsorships Kevin Roman that's a pretty cool idea I make videos of you paying people on Fiverr to make websites or stuff like that for you and I could review them too yeah I've done a rap video I think we'll we can go all out on the rap for you coding all day man no I'm saying I haven't totally why did you damn long reaction videos yep John Parker says I don't know what the hell has happened I watched a channel live yesterday 100k subs but 400 live active viewers there's something definitely wrong yes there's something definitely wrong so one one is wrong and we can complain the other is maybe they're going live much more often but people are figuring out really smart ways to hack the algorithm I have one of my friends who'll get three and a half thousand people live at once and in one hour live stream after his stream is over he'll have 500,000 views in one hour and he's like it's simple like he goes in the first one or two minutes maybe set something up that's supposed to be super shocking that you didn't expect it was gonna happen and so he's like you're playing a video game and then he's like few minutes in or two minutes in you do something shocking like all what the [ __ ] look this wasn't supposed to happen you like freaked out and you make it look realistic so people who are watching and actually believe that he goes when those people stay and don't leave right if they don't leave then Facebook goes and YouTube goes this must be good let me recommend this to other people then when those people come in and they're seeing something shocking happening then they stay for a little bit then it'll like send it 200 more people will dump hundreds into the livestream there's 50 more people then 200 more people that wants 200 new people and so it's very possible you can go from like having 10 people to like 1,000 2,000 or even 3,000 people at once you know and one of my friends said like also be playing a game like fortnight while answering coding questions because he goes people love stuff when it's moving on the screen and like they love the movement and they want to stay for for that just to watch that and answer questions so I'll try like playing some games and then also answering questions too thank you yeah 69 viewers is actually Phillip yeah there are a lot of great ideas being discussed here my man I'm pretty excited about that too MNM Naveed send me an email at support at clever programmer comment my team will respond to your request if we have room available then we can help you enroll yeah there's a lot of amazing ideas coming here you guys after a bootcamp scenario Joshua says are you able to assist with job placement so right now we're not doing the type of boot camps where we're assisting with job placement but we're doing boot camps we're helping they literally apply two platforms like up work and get jobs and why is that and take lessons and like really start crushing with freelancing cuz me personally I'm all about like not having a ninetofive and being able to work remotely and being able to like charge and make an income that like I like and work on my own time and so that's the thing that I would want to help people do when I'm working with them in a coding boot camp just like get freelance and clients you know for some people getting extra five hundred thousand dollars a month is a big deal some other people it might feel like 2,000 or 3,000 or 5,000 dollars a month and those are those numbers we can definitely help people skill if we're working with them in person and then also like over the course of like six months a year because that's realistically how long it takes Thank You jerod you are more amazing Emanuel yes 69 tours which is awesome it's great Cold War's John Parker says made the person I was watching focused on a very narrow topic and uploads at random times I think that I'll gonna slagged is something yeah it might have flagged me as something but I don't know what I wish it told me I really wish it told me yeah so yeah guys like that's what I wanted to share with you guys that's kind of what's been on my mind and I definitely think that I'm gonna be doing a lot more of this like daily type of live streams and just getting really real with you guys on whatever is on my mind or whatever is like a thing that I really really believe in and I want to be sharing those ideas with you guys I love this community I love you guys for jumping on thank you like the biggest way you helped out here is just by even staying here and like saying a comment you know thank you seeker for sending in you know seven dollars like that's [ __ ] awesome but I just love the fact that you guys stayed here and just engaged and this is a community that gives me oxygen like speaking with you guys is what actually gives me oxygen and keeps me really really excited so yeah I'd love to come down do it on a daily basis have a chat with you guys and then if you guys ever come down here and if any of you guys want to work here and bigger than for a trade of a skill but you want to learn I don't know coding and you want to learn that like definitely let me know we can work something out but yeah guys thank you so much for being here thank you Sam yeah today's livestream was really really fun my man Pawan says Todd you're the best thank you my man the whole internet van op alized Google is a world leader no one notices but like the cancer they can't get rid of yeah and then it's the game with we need to learn how to play right like Channel like me that's gonna die off pretty soon if I don't you know figure it out like literally it's a race against the clock like like I know what this means I know how dangerous this [ __ ] is like these trends don't go away right once we had a high upward trend we just had a permanently going up but then now there's really getting it down I mean this shit's not going away and like a month later or a month later after that is gonna be going to some terrible number of views right like for example even here if i refresh this like 8,000 views 9,000 used 5,000 views and like the number of views had been like consistently dropping and the average subscribers went from 400 to like 140 so there's something something wrong and I'm just trying my best to save the channel to make sure it doesn't die to make sure we can keep creating content for you guys yeah Phillip I would love that yeah if you added French subtitles that would be really really great yeah you can you can send us our key for it Frankie I think the light went off yeah I I think that I think somebody told me like I should add Hindi like subtitles on my videos because in India like they're really popular so it might pick up steam there too and so with those types of contributions we could really really use help too yeah I just hope I don't this channel doesn't get banned or stop you know John Parker I'm not sure how long will I'll be streaming for I was thinking about kind of just ending it soon but in the next few days like I do want to be streaming with you guys for a longer period of time and just like engaging in these types of like really thoughtful discussions because when I don't have anybody talking back it just feels like what like what the [ __ ] am I doing here like it just feels all useless but this actually feels like a lot of fun because okay I'm actually getting to you know speak to somebody out there and there's there's purpose to this arghya doesn't teach me to code here in Hawaii and I'll sponsor you and your girlfriend to fly to Mahayana working vacation that could be fun yeah the DM me on Instagram you guys worked really hard this year I can see it sam says yet thank you man yeah we were we worked our ass off bro like we were consistent like I've moved never been this consistent and then to see like it's just really painful you know when you put in so much effort and then to see it just like for what ever reason just like declining this is a whole channel like that just doesn't make sense in all of these videos right right this is what March March March March March April March March March March March March April April April April April April May May June June June June June July's Elijah Elijah Elijah Elijah Elijah July August August August August so it's like super consistent with multiple videos you know multiple multiple like high quality videos that take us a long time to make edit and then just further not do anything is like [ __ ] kasi and coffee daily podcast coffee with kasi yeah that could be fun you know I'll do a daily podcast I'll go live I'll have Aaron sitting with me with us and then we'll chat with you guys and we'll talk about why this [ __ ] channel is dying like you know or maybe somehow improve this channel and make it survive okay it doesn't matter yeah mmm Naveed please send an email at support at clever programmer calm bro please we will take care of you it is it called exactly that community contributions yep WMA is a good idea I can add persian CC to your videos oh my goodness that would be amazing with just these CCS our videos can go like actually have a chance in all these other countries and cities and people who speak these different languages so that would be amazing Croft if you can do that I would love it if somebody can add Hindi or you know any any CCS that you can add closed captions or be awesome okay you know there's something good in John says I don't think channel will die you have active fans including me thank you yeah I have tons of questions keeping up your channels are the first ones that appeared on my journey to becoming a developer yeah guys thank you guys I really appreciate you I'm gonna keep going I'm not giving up anytime soon [ __ ] I just don't give up I'm like a cockroach you know when the world is gonna hit nuclear like they're still gonna be surviving you know but like it just throws you off and it's a little disheartening when you're doing so much and I just don't want to lose my team members and I just don't want to like I don't want to keep the trend going like yeah I don't want to lose you guys you know that we've build this community and works so hard like to me it's now beyond money because I know how to make money like I know there are multiple businesses that I could help and charge them two to five thousand dollars a month and we'll probably make two to three times the income that we're making from clever programmer but this is what I really really believe in this is what really really excites me so that's what I just want to keep it going forever like in perpetuity and now there's a lot of problemsolving that's gonna be needing to take place but I just wanted to bring you guys in on it so you knew what was going on but like within the team we're gonna be doing a lot of brainstorming daily meet our daily meetings revolve around this like how can you actually survive this like downhill trend we have but in your life you're gonna face these things right like it's not just me like I'm sure you guys have these crazy things happen to you in life where you're down and you are trying you're doing the right thing but you just keep getting [ __ ] over and what you do in those times is what really really matters right so what our team does and this time is what really matters like what I do and how I show up at this time is what really matters not when not when like you know [ __ ] where's that here whoops go to the main page please write not when we're king of the hill and [ __ ] everything is lovely and like the gross is just insane and no matter what video we drop it just goes viral like those it doesn't matter what I do in those days but what matters is like how I react now so you know sometimes it's disheartening sometimes you like man should I just [ __ ] go into a fetal position and just crumble and just kind of like close my eyes and just let it die off and do something else and there's a lot of insecurity that takes place you're like you know amaya fraud is this why this is happening like what the [ __ ] what's the reason but this is the time where we're not gonna stop this is the time where we're just gonna keep going and coming up with strategic like not just work harder but like let's just work harder but work smarter you know and if we keep focusing on this I think we'll come out of it and I think it'll be really cool for you guys to be in on it as we come out of it you know I think that's gonna be really exciting and I want to just do this for seven days straight livestream every day and see what comes of it because if the channel comes kind of back and starts surviving again oh man we're back in business baby I think a lot of yours are like me it's nice to hear feedback from who mate but more especially people are trying to make insuring improvement yep at least try just don't post for a month and then post a great video just one but make it awesome you'll know you're back then keep posting once a week not too often our Banias that scares me to not post for a whole month especially right now I think you have something real good keep it up I will it was you who made me realise how great part of the work is about relation they're building them with the community I'm sure things will pick up again thank you if you decide to do this boot camp where will it be held state city cost and how soon please I'm thinking to do this in LA I'm trying to make this as like easy and like dead brain as possible because meeting with people humans in person working with them one one over the course of three five seven days is one of the most transformative [ __ ] amazing experiences and it this it's actually what gives me oxygen inspires me so like I'm down to get it started like tomorrow like I don't have a date on it you can come tomorrow we can do it LA that's where we're located so Hollywood I'm literally in the middle of Hollywood if you want to do it physically then yeah flying into Hollywood we just had a bunch of developers fly in from Hong Kong Florida like New Mexico San Francisco so you can come into LA Hollywood and then we can do this boot camp and I don't know the price point of it yet depends on like the market but right now I'm thinking between one to three thousand one to three thousand dollars for like three to seven days you know kind of thinking I think that's that's gonna be like a good price range for it because it's a big time investment and then right now it's gonna be even a good opportunity for a lot of people because we might not have a lot of people jump on board right now because we don't have any documentation of it we haven't really put out videos where we're teaching people in person so people are gonna be skeptical so when people jump on instead of it being like 10 people in a group it'll be like one person or two people you know so then no matter how much you pay you're gonna get like a really big bang for your buck because you're gonna get me Aaron Frankie or entire [ __ ] team and then like all the developers that were connected to and then like the part of community that we have curated all of them you know free you so all of that help will just go directly to you and then as it begins to expand over the next three months six months year because we're gonna put that content on YouTube so people could watch it and then I think we would expect it to have like it would be three to five thousand dollars and then we'll probably have five people coming in at a time it's YouTube is jealous of your success you're doing amazing man yeah man I'm not gonna go down without a fight for sure Emanuel for sure yeah I think you just have to wait it out until the algorithm resets you I don't think that will be long but never give up you're not a fraud you're the only person who's taught me to program thank you John I'm gonna keep going my man and uh I won't give up thank you for that I appreciate it you just see the behind the scenes like one quarter learning coding and traveling with Kazi and coding team yeah William fly it and we're gonna [ __ ] shoot videos my man yeah like yeah make it happen send me a damn let's [ __ ] do this if you're serious about it like actually DM me on Instagram and then let's [ __ ] do this okay we'll document your journey I'll teach you how to code we'll make videos on it and then we'll put it out there for people to see okay um okay guys I think this is literally gonna be its now I love you guys thank you so much for so much for watching I love your face this is Kazi as always I'll see you in the next livestream damn I'm having way too much fun with this [ __ ] feature
