i'll tell you because here in this one i'll do a little bit more broad side of things you know and this one was going to be very deep down and we'll talk just how you can do it and not only that we're

just move on okay cool do it man let's go ahead and do it let's go ahead and move on so we got all this amazing project guys so what makes a six sticker developer that is the question daniel what makes a 65 developer well there's lots of things but it's gonna boil down to just a few things right because when we're trying to become the six figure developer we have that goal and we set it out in front of us so that we can hit it you're going to want to work on specific skill sets whether technical or soft skills and you're going to want to develop yourself as a person to be able to get to that point of being a six figure developer yes yes yes so guys let's let's check it out so hello i like money i mean of course everybody likes money crusher crab loves money very much okay who doesn't love money you know we always say a lot mine does not make us happy and at some points it does but not having mine does not make us happy either so so you have to be careful with that exactly so as you do want to make more money you need to make sure you have that roadmap right you want to make sure that you have the goal set up in front of you the right one so that you could work closer and closer to achieving it day and day again and that's why nas is going to break down his experience so you can have that road map and then we're going to just dive deep into becoming six figures guys very important that's going to smash that like button for the youtube algorithm as you know we have done an amazing job i would say so the past four days as the day five so i would appreciate that if you guys just smash it if you just go ahead and share this video with everybody else just again the more people the more people view it the more people know about it the better that way we get to share the knowledge that we currently have with the more people again let's go ahead and get to 200 likes we are currently at 147 i never get 200 really quickly all right so how i made 300k as a javascript developer in three years myself guys hi my 300k and i how i made 300k and how i also got a tesla so there's that part too i can actually use that now you got to add that part man yeah exactly i recently got a tesla as well so that's been amazing too so guys check this out and again i'm not saying this guys just to like brag or anything like that my that's not my goal i'm here to teach i'm here to teach you i'm head to inspire that is my goal that's our goal of everybody daniel and everybody here at clever programmer okay we just want to show you what's possible look at this this is one of the things that i went through and when i kind of got started guys you know i started in the same shoes as you are which is not knowing much i knew some basic maybe html css and that's pretty much it but as i kind of work through you know this is one i want to show you some of the things that i got this is a 19 per hour uh internship that i had at a company called urban science and they kind of given the internship after i worked at another company for a startup company completely for free for literally like you know like a year and a half which has been insane okay this is a 65k after i did so well at this job we're literally i'm not kidding bro at this job i like i exceeded expectations like i got like crazy and what did you do to be able to do that like what do what did i do that's a question so here's what i did like not only i did the project yes i did the project i did um see i did the project i created projects right for them with them right but also i use i worked really fast and part one actually is i went about beyond to include more features i went above and beyond above and beyond beyond to include more features to include include more features not kidding what actually happened guys it was insane what actually happened here is they have this project every intern had a project to do i did it really fast no problem they're like holy [ __ ] how to do this so fast and then what i do is i end up taking a machine learning course a machine learning course of course because i apply machine i have found out that i can apply machine learning to their problem and what i did is i basically created machine learning algorithm that predicted how many leads they'll get in the next few years wow that is huge like prediction like predicting leads and when they saw that they're like holy [ __ ] you know everybody else is kind of doing the projects that they've been told to do i went outside the box and there's something different and that was blew their mind and the other day i got a chance to talk with their head machine learning uh machine learning guy and after he saw this go talk with him he offered the job to beat his team right away like because he loved the the intention so far and then that's when i got offered the 65 k right here right here that's what happens when you just offer value right when you bring value to the table when you build your skill sets when you learn new things that are applicable to the job to adding value to a business or company yes you get these amazing offers yes and the crazy thing is again this was i didn't even finish college like college is not the reason why i'm here because it's not the reason why i got this or why i got this but the reason why i got this is because i was very proactive i was very bold like being bold is big guys being bold is very big okay and being able to be risky and be risky with what you want to do and being [ __ ] like being so damn on the line in terms of what you want to do in your life okay that's the most important thing if you just kind of stand around waiting for things to happen they won't happen i'm sorry but if you be bold and if you go towards it like a bowl that's when change gets created okay awesome let's move on there's another company this is uh actually i had did not go with this company when they offered me this money because this other company offered me this money so by the way and again this was a oneday interview and they love what i end up doing and they offer me uh this is again college is not even finished yet so they offered me 70k right after that so that was really cool uh again this is a company after when i just started doing freelancing i worked for com with the company called approved me when i did freelancing that was a lot of fun i got to build one of the biggest react.js projects this whole project was in react.js pro wow and it had millions of millions of lines of code millions of lines of code it was in thai script react gs redux all the stuff you guys learned here learned here this is teaching from like our our knowledge from our real world experience to you right this is real word world stuff i'm not kidding i'm not kidding okay and this was a fun project this project actually is still going on one of my friends is still working with them but of course i'm not because i'm so focused with you guys okay awesome so another project i worked with something called cover me really amazing guys again these guys paid about five thousand five thousand dollars oh just so you know these guys paid around twenty thousand dollars but that's only for about a month and a half so so that was pretty good you know that was pretty good so um uh discovered me another project do they pay 5k not for the design but they paid 5k honestly just for a software requirements document which by the way is something we teach how to do in profit javascript again you will have the early bird price on sunday so make sure you go there okay but they literally just paid me for a requirements document for 5k just to build this like to put build requirements out can you believe that bro that is huge that's insane that's crazy yeah so and so like like like i know you're like like yes you did all this stuff but how did you do it now it's like how did they happen well it didn't happen overnight and didn't happen easy and it was not easy and it took a lot of sweat and tears okay but how did it happen it's a good question well so again this is me you guys know um just a regular guy just like you are you guys are but i'm very i love my work and i'm very hard working that's the one thing that i can tell about myself okay um yeah i gotta get a chance to interview companies like google khan academy squarespace this is a lot of fun these guys actually flew me out to california for free they gave me a really nice hotel and uh paid for everything pretty much that was a lot of fun safety with valentin another great company again flew me out to california literally the hotel pro apparently was 500 per night and i didn't pay for anything nice that was insane that's amazing that was a lot of fun yeah and i got a chance to interview all these companies and so yeah that's kind of about me uh what i end up doing is when i started guys um the process was really cool because i started i realized that college was no good unfortunately college college college college will not not will not get you to get you the real real world experience i'm saying just college i'm not saying college is uh unnecessary i'm not saying any of those things um i'm not get you the real world experience periods i know i have a horrible typing that's okay though uh um experience hold on here's a great coder trust me experience right there he has a lot of typos he's a great character right so the way i kind of found that out is because i was learning a lot of theory as i'm sure you know too right like you learn a lot of theories well in college correct yep and how did you how do you think that kind of helped you out tell me like do you think that something will really push you in in the real world tell me i mean most of what really helped me was what i did on the side which were like the practical uh projects that i would build right the mobile applications or the web applications yes correct and and so and so what did you realize with with theory in terms of what else do you need besides theory tell me what do you mean by that is anything else you realize that you need did you realize that you need anything something else besides theory tell me um you need practical application you build skills you need to build portfolios right you build projects that are going to be able to help you to get to where you want to go again correct at the end of the day it's about having the skill of being able to build an amazing project by yourself right i'm figuring it out by yourself now i don't mean you have to code every single line i don't mean you have to memorize what every single line of code the function not so if you could use google and youtube to help you out you're going to be able to solve a problem not just memorize lines of codes and write them for your tests and homework assignments correct so guys do this so uh i kind of and so what i end up doing is i actually end up going ahead and joining a startup company right here this is called uh trendella it's really fun these guys are amazing they're still one of my user friends steve here he just got married which is insane steve congrats uh now she's yeah so another one of my friends case and this is me as you guys can see this is robert this guy is doing amazing he's working the company right now he's used epic stuff in terms of coding he loves it but together as four people like we were working on this app that was basically bringing clothing together into one application from all these different applications and i'll show you how exactly how it looks like but i came up to them and said hey guys i'm ready to work for free i'm ready to work for free because i just want the experience i realize that college is not going to get me there and so like you know what let's do it they give me a task to do which is to build a python scraper and granted i literally went home and i i you know what i you know what i typed into google what'd you type i tell you what is python what is it literally that's the first thing i type like what is python because they told me to the python script like what the [ __ ] is python you know what i mean so uh at that point kind of what happened is i was like okay great so i found out what python is i found out how to do scraping and i end up doing business creeper and they brought me on to work with them i work with them for about a year for free completely but that year is what changed my whole life it's the reason why i'm here today with you guys because that knowledge that i got by being bold by investing in myself that is what got me to where i am today and there's still so much further that we can all go between daniel between me everybody here on the team and and you of course and you as well right there's so many possibilities you guys can there's out you just need to take them and be bold and take some risks and that's pretty much it okay and of course work hard awesome let's go on this is the app you build called trandala pretty cool app i would say so right it's a beautiful app it's a beautiful app would you swipe right or swipe left swipe right to like do you swipe left one just like on that one did you swipe right or swipe right in this one all right that was cool that was cool right did you like it yeah i don't sweat i think it's pretty good i think we should buy this bro oh dude it's 100 bucks never mind oh come on bro awesome this is the service.com company that i worked with one of the things i did with them is i rebuilt the whole application guys and one key factor i will give here for you is here it's about um i'll just say this take an issue please take initiative right this is a very important aspect just in life in general especially in coding as well if you take initiative you are someone who's going to be respected very much in coding space or just in real in what life space you know what i mean if you don't wait for things just to happen you just you just do it you're like no i'm gonna get this i want to do this this is what i want to do i'll talk with a friend uh with a peter j because of the student linda and she's so focused on becoming foster she's like i want to do i want to get it done and she's doing amazing i'm so pumped for her to be our student like seriously okay up next let's go ahead take a next okay i realize that service.com this this company here i hit in my job why why did you why did i hit my job i don't know you tell me bro i don't know why i would tell you this bro so here's the and i was like you know what i hate my job but that's it i want to try something different and what is that different do you think i i wanted you wanted to go out on your own yes i want to do star freelancing exactly and i was like peace out guys and he was crazy no it's crazy happened what my uh employer said to me he's like set me down he's like and i'll and i'll just you know close your ears if you have to but he's literally set me down and he said hey nas i'm gonna tell you this as a as a father as an employer as a financial advisor and as a friend you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] nuts you're [ __ ] nuts and you're [ __ ] and i'm not kidding they this was said this was actually said to me right because i quit at the time when the company was going up right uh but i was not happy you know again being bold okay me being bold taking initiative right and you know what and end up working out pretty well yes i quit but look at this and i started doing freelancing i decided i was like you know what i like this i really took a lot of initiative in terms of my you know my appearance in terms of who i am as a person my confidence and i started to build my account start to build my my freelancing kind of business on the side as well and that's what kind of got me you know to where i am even today and so oh that's a cool picture bro look at this bro that's in the same picture that's so good i'm jealous wait wait wait you guys this is in detroit guys shout out to detroit if anybody here from detroit guys anybody here on detroit hey if you guys are let us know i think that'd be awesome cool so yeah detroit that was all amazing so now let's let's do this okay what do we do next daniel tell me well next we're going to make this about you you already heard nasa's story you already heard what he did but now we're going to turn the tables and make it about you so take out your pen take out your paper because we're going to start to figure out your goals to help you to get to where you want to go so it's all going to start with just figuring out your financial goal and what that is going to look like exactly so let's do this right now what is your plan right of course let's figure out your income goals that's the first thing because if you get if you don't write this kind of stuff down it's not going to be helpful for you at whatsoever does that do you make sense so how much income do you want to make per month in the comments below right now guys how much income do you want to make per month let us know right now okay three thousand don't be like oh crazy i'm like i wanna make a million per month right now okay let's be real realistic okay let's not let's actually be your list in terms of what you want to make and what that will cover right now so you can go like grow your career as a developer yeah i mean you could build up to the million later after you build a cool business but you need to build some skills first so first let's get you to those milestones that are gonna be in your realm of doing within this next year 2021. so let's say let's say this for example everybody's saying like 3k 5k 5k that's not bad so 5k that's really reasonable one guy said 100k per month okay that's not unreasonable i mean if you're a complete pro you're building your sas company like you have all these crazy skills yes you could do that but if you're not there then so five keep a month how much is that per year six sixty thousand that's 60k per year that was not bad but would you say that for a beginner completely that's amazing that's amazing for a complete beginner bro that is an amazing salary guys most people cannot like most people are it's really hard for them to make that kind of money you know what i mean because you also have to keep in mind this is just your first year starting off entry level after that it's just going to skyrocket as you get better as you learn more skills as you understand what you have to do there's probably going to be raises are going to happen you can move to better companies they're going to pay you way more than what you're what they're currently paying exactly okay so now that you know like your 5k per month okay let's now let's talk about expenses okay what are your personal expenses how much how many expenses do you have right now okay that because your course you need to cover your expenses is very important okay you cannot just be on to your expense if you're under your expenses then you're losing money that's not good okay so what are your expenses for example let's let's how much expenses let's just have an example okay let's just say maybe it's 2k per month how about that maybe it's 2k per month maybe this is includes for example rent maybe it might include for example some food and so forth does it include a tesla bro i mean these are not my expenses [Laughter] these are not my expenses all right my sizes are this there's a little bit more but let's just say uh you know for a person how many expenses would you say okay how about this let's just say fine 3k how about that two keep a month okay yeah i think if maybe you have a family this is something that might be and you're living below your means you're not spending like crazy that sounds about right yeah so what identify what it means for you to be rich okay what does it mean for you to be happy with yourself right because because guys it's not just about money money great it will get you what you want you can go on vacation you can you know spend money for yourself for your family for other members of the family that's always the best part right but what makes you feel welcome and so the way i see it is like if it means for you to be rich is like okay at least maybe you have maybe let's say a thousand you can save per month or two thousand you can save a month would you say that's like let's say maybe say a thousand per month is kind of like a good goal would you say that that sounds good great just just like savings okay so save a thousand 1k 1k per month and keep in mind make sense okay cool 10 specific reasons why you need to make more money income exactly because you need to understand your why because once you understand your expenses once you identify what your rich is whether it's going to be just money whether it's going to be time freedom right you want to be just working 20 hours a week or you're going to want remote work at a fulltime job with amazing benefits whatever that is next you need to know is your why so that's why you say write 10 specific reasons because 10 is going to challenge you a bit it's going to be a little bit hard but if you could sit down and write down 1 through 10 and write a specific reason as to why you want these things it's going to solidify in your head and your purpose and you're gonna have a fuel to get you there correct maybe for example you want freedom right maybe you want to be challenged okay maybe you want to be for example you want to have more time for family right so maybe more time for family time for family maybe you want amazing benefits that big tech companies give out yeah maybe you want amazing benefits who know amazing benefits maybe you just want to work with an amazing team right maybe you just want to love people yeah work with amazing people right with busy people all these are are great reasons for why you want to make more income right amazing people because like it or not if you're going to make more income you're going to be working with amazing people probably like that's honestly that simple right if you're gonna be more in my income those people are also going towards your goal they're also working just as hard as you are right so they're most likely have the same driving goals as you do right so always consider that okay cool so we got that portion now let's ask the question would you in that case freelance or would you full time what do you think like what what do you what what did you select i mean it's really going to be depending on anyone's personal preference right because we we talked about this in day one we want to talk about the opportunity and we broke down the pros and cons of freelancing the pros and cons of fulltime and it's not exhaustive but again we just want to give you guys that perspective so that you could choose for yourself so i think in the end it's about that selfawareness of what you actually want yeah so let's talk about a little bit of uh benefits of freelancing will benefit from fulltime let's show you that okay let's do that right now okay so okay just a few things let's do freelancing right now so freelancing benefits what are some benefits of freelancer tell me so freelancing flexibility on your hours that i think that's a big one that people like billion hours okay what else um you get to choose your clients get to choose your clients that's a positive and you get to choose your clients so a little more context right it's positive because if you do have a lot of clients coming to you you kind of get to choose the ones you're more excited about right and it would be a negative because you have to go figure out how to get your clients right you have to develop some marketing skills you have to develop some selling skills to be able to sell your services to clients that is correct yes okay up next what else is a positive um freelancing let's see man i would say income wise there's a lot of room for growth a lot of room for growth that's true a lot of room for growth you're only limited by how much you want to work right if you want to work less time then obviously you're not going to be making like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars right yes but you do give yourself more time during the week but on the contrary guys because of there's a lot of room to growth when you first start out you're going to be making bad [ __ ] money i'm not gonna lie like you're gonna be making very little money initially as you started out because you don't have any any clients right now and you have zero trust that's the big issue you have zero trust right now you see what i mean but as you build those up it'll start to snowball over time right so that if you're going as freelancer for a couple years you'll have more clients you'll have more portfolios they'll show your work and people are going to want to work with you people are going to be talking about you through referrals and could build up your client base like that little by little but it is a longterm process that's not easy but you can do it yeah now how about fulltime fulltime well if you have a nice uh if you work at a big tech company you're probably surrounded or what are you gonna put that your paycheck uh yeah you could do steady paycheck yeah your paycheck nice benefits all the cool stuff that those give you right yesterday paycheck amazing benefits right i think the cool thing is amazing people right because yeah if you work at google you can be next to amazing software engineers they're going to be sitting right next to you right yes you're going to get to learn from them you're going to get to work with them and they're going to be the ones that get to review your coding you're going to get to review their coding your skills are just going to blast off after yeah so you get to have many mentors right because as a freelancer you're kind of working more so by yourself that's the issue right you're kind of there you know it's more by yourself you have to figure it out you have to be the man you have to be the project manager project manager the client manager the developer you've got like 10 different hats right um while with a photo you kind of get to focus a little more right in your case just being a developer and that's kind of for some for a lot of people that's a big benefit huge benefit right they don't want to focus on all these different things right they just want to focus on one thing which is becoming a developer and learning the most skills exactly and that's what comes down to you being selfaware of what you want to do and what will make you happy when you're working yes correct so let us know in the comments below guys what do you think you want to be freelance or fulltime or even both yeah here's the thing i did both i did both right i did both right there's nothing wrong with doing that i actually i started out yes i did start out initially with i started out with full time correct i tried that i liked it there are some things that i didn't like but and i want to try freelancing and then i went to freelancing it's as simple as that guys that's pretty much it right as you develop the skill you're gonna have more options on what you want to do yes exactly and as i said guys you will be able to go ahead as you keep going you will be able to yourself figure out okay what do i do what do i watch right um what do i learn and so forth and you just be able to kind of you know pave your own path if your own path okay cool awesome moving on so let's break it down let's break it down guys what i need you to do right now is go to the next slide now is dance okay nevermind no no not not yet we'll dance later forget about everything we just talked about forget about your goals because those are nice those are amazing those can fuel you but what you need to do is you need to make sure you focus on the process and you're doing the small steps that are going to take you and get you closer to there because it's nice to think about the 5k a month yeah it's nice to think about the tesla on your driveway but if you're thinking about those things you're not going to enjoy the process and the steps that you have to do to be able to get there correct yes the process is always one of the most important things and just enjoying what you do like you know do you enjoy what you do i enjoy what i do do i enjoy what i do definitely nas enjoys what i love what i do i get to teach you guys and we get to dance and we get to dance like it's the best job in the world you know what i mean ever and so that came first before anything else and that is what brought everything else exactly so let's break this process down for you guys what are the five stages of making a hundred thousand dollars a year nas so your first stage is earning what your first what your first ten to a hundred dollars so how might this come about that might tell me well there's different ways but first if you get to this point congratulations yes because this is huge people downplayed but this is so cool like someone paid you 10. you just did it ten dollars for what for your knowledge so way that this is possible especially if you're starting off is through tutoring right because when you're tutoring you don't have to become a full master of javascript or whatever it is that you're going to tutor you just have to be two steps ahead of the person and someone would be willing to pay for an hour of your time correct to be able to get to that by the way guys really quick if somebody is asking when will we announce the winners most likely we'll announce the winners on sunday so make sure you are there in the webinar guys really important case click the link below the description for the webinar that's when we will announce the winners okay really really really important okay so stay tuned for that cool awesome all right let's go ahead and keep going all right so next thing after you've done that what else is next tell me now you're gonna try to bump that up and try to get to your first thousand dollars per month yes right now again i do also want to add the caveat we're gonna dive deeper into probably more of the freelancing route in this case because if you do go the job route it would take a different path but we're also going to dive deep into that once we talk about the freelancing path so make sure you're paying attention to this right then once you get to 1000 you're maybe potentially looking at five to ten thousand dollars per month which is that is you're ready that's it you're in a career path you're growing you are pretty probably very happy with what you're making and you're just loving what you do and you're loving use the money that you have exactly and then now being consistent step four is you're able to do that for a whole year so that you make that 5k per year and then step five is you just build on those skills investing yourself invest in mentors go to conferences and get to the hundred thousand dollars per year correct correct correct okay let's go and focus that that camera right there beautiful thank you all right it's fine okay cool awesome so guys you can see the breakdown is pretty simple right right here right just i mean i know it's it's kind of like simple it's like what the heck i mean but let's go a little bit deeper okay so when you go ahead and start out with kind of um you know learning right there's we like to call this the pyramid of wealth right the modern javascript developer pyramid of wealth it's a simple simple process that you can just simply follow and well let's check it out so initially when you start out what's going to happen daniel when you start out you just have to learn the right skill sets you have to pick out something start learning at it start to master those things or start the process of mastering those things it's probably going to suck a little bit but that's how you start with everything right of course you have to suck a little bit initially to learn we all sucked yeah we all did too yeah i did not know how to write an html tag yeah you know i mean i didn't even know what ram was on the computer when i first started i didn't know what a semicolon was perfect you know what i mean so you kind of you can start out with that awesome so initially of course guys you have to start out with just simply learning so you learn what you need to learn right knowledge is one of the most valuable things you can have yo victor diaz just dropped a 20 donation victory thank you so much man he says my total respect for you giving all the wisdom away for free you guys rock thank you victor you rock man thank you so much thank you everyone who supports and loves this community yeah you guys are amazing whoa thank you i mean that's what's a semicolon don't worry that was knowledge when he started too awesome all right let's keep going guys cool so that was part one right it's always learned right that's that's part one you wanna always get the skills first once you get the skills then you potentially coach right so you can coach other people at this point now now as a coach what can you expect to be coaching tell me you're probably going to want to coach what you just learned right so as you dove into javascript then you're going to want to teach people how to start to use javascript how do they write a function how do they make a class how do they do anything right right and so the thing is the really cool part about this is that you can actually coach others you don't have to be a pro with your coach you see what i mean so like for example if you think about this right let's say this is a timeline and let's say this right here is one two three four and so on these are levels like this is one level one level two level three level four right and when you start out guys you start out where you start out with this level right here level one okay yes sir level one this is you you know the zip nada you're learning how to make a variable zip like you know nothing right level two maybe you know basics right so you know basics at some point right that's basics well check this out because you're here level two who do you think could teach now at this point tell me you could teach the people in the levels under you so people in level one exactly you're suitable to help them out to get to where you're at which is level exactly guys we literally have students who want this through this reaction challenge they apply the same techniques we told them here and they literally started to earn money in the in in the next week or two as a coach as a coach teaching other people is one great example he was coaching literally within a week by the sunday webinar in the last challenge he has already earned earned more than a hundred dollars oh my god that is amazing so you got past level one basically yeah now yeah level three maybe you know some projects right so maybe you build some projects you have some good confidence right so you know you know that at this point what can you teach do you think you could teach level one and now you're here you can teach this and you can teach this also right exactly the possibilities are endless and it goes on and on and on and on go ahead and here's the cool thing as you're teaching these things you're reinforcing what you're learning and getting i think jesse jesse says when you're teaching you get to learn it twice yeah right exactly you get to learn twice so that's probably one of the best things let's go ahead but the thing is you know you don't have to worry about level tense when you get to too good it's actually not good for like level 10 to teach all the way level one because level 10 right they are for example they might be like at this point too good like as as in they don't see from perspective of a beginner but because you see it from perspective a beginner that's where things are different and so it's actually easier for you as it began to teach other beginners you understand that exactly so don't be scared of level 10 because you're probably a better teacher yes if you're on level three or level four because you just went through that awesome so let's okay so we went to the coaching side oh sure yeah so actually what we're gonna do is we're gonna quickly go through a couple of slides to break it down to help you get to your first you know couple thousand dollars a month if you want to go down this road let's do it okay so let's talk about your stream of income in the first one or three months where you're learning javascript coding okay okay it only applies if you are working hard extremely hard guys of course really important where you know if you're not working hard and what what are you doing what are you doing i think you shouldn't be here sorry like without working hard at work you can't really get nowhere like yeah you know what i mean like yeah and the second thing is you just have to remember you want to teach a person just one or two steps behind you yes correct this exact thing that we're about to get so you can make money through teaching code let's set your hourly rate okay for example let's think about this let's say you already said you started 15 per hour that's pretty good it's awesome that's pretty good okay and especially if you for example actually in another country you still said that it's not really great yes may they be for example you're in pakistan or anywhere everywhere else that's like some besides us that's still pretty good that's really good money great money right okay so usually people we you have let's say four weekly coaching calls okay maybe you have four people you have four weekend coaching calls let's say you know you have four weekly coaching calls meaning you have one coaching call per week in one month you mean how much sixty dollars oh sixty what one per week okay got you yes yes yes yes yes yes you made 60 bucks okay that's right there that already is your one two hundred dollar income guys right there okay you already crossed your 100 one to one uh ten two hundred dollar income right there that's your first crossing point okay and all you need is just simply one person you need to find that one person that's it that's it and finally one person is actually not that hard with the amount of demand that there is right now for coding okay up next so let's talk about how we can find these students well what you just need to find is 50 to 100 qualified people yes if you just have a 5 conversion rate you'll be getting 2 to 5 students a week yes so if you think about this right so let's think about what five percent conversion rate five percent conversion conversion rate what does that mean daniel that means if you get a hundred people to talk to you five of them are gonna become clients to talk to talk talk five five are clients now how much is it how hard is it to talk to 100 people well it's really not that hard if we go to the next slide where we could show you exactly where we can find them look at this but before we even go there guys right if you think about this five let's say five our clients okay you're looking at potential income of 120 to 100 right and 300 per month now guys i just want to reemphasize this some people look at these numbers and laugh at them or say like that's not enough yeah but guys if you're getting started in the freelancing world if you're getting someone to pay you fifteen dollars for one session for you to teach for one hour for one hour for you to teach them something you are developing an incredible skill at this point that's only gonna help you to increase this further time and time again to where potentially your one hour can be worth like nauseous which is 250 yes dollars i now charge i now charge people who want to just probably do private coaching i charge 250 dollars per hour guys and that is not a joke and that's because i can show you the proof exactly that's because nas has built up the skill over time but he started somewhere he started actually he didn't even start here he started for free he told you he worked for free for an entire year and a half guys because he understands that you just need to build the skill over time so yeah 120 to 300 a month is amazing it's just nas didn't even do that i know you just need to be a little [ __ ] my my per month was zero per month that's how i started guys right there zero per month let me show you zero per month guys what and by the way guys we'll go go ahead and finish up and then we'll we'll give you a shout out zero month guys guys i think again guys i just want to show you we have one another domain donation which is amazing thank you so much the rich programmer mr frank himself ramos so much man awesome video finding great ways to make a living writing code let's go frank thank you so much for the 4.99 donation i was like 4.99 you know not five or forty nine we're going to be firefighting no i'm messing with you frank thank you so much man we appreciate your support and your love for the community man yeah always always awesome guys okay cool so now let's talk about case you've understood that it's possible and it wouldn't be cool to just make 300 extra per month like that's that's still pretty good amount of cash amazing like you could you know towards the car towards anything towards maybe not tesla but towards the regardless anything else you know what i mean amazing but where to find students now let's talk about this okay where do you find now students okay five students well there's many places guys to find people for you okay uh well if you think about funny people there's one thing to think about that's not the gary vee always says it's attention wherever there is attention guys if there's a tension that's where you go looking for it make sense good because here's the thing now where is attention facebook groups and stage number one instagram attention number two why is that intention number three right why isn't this is where you can actually apply as a teacher and just literally find clients like that take lessons another attention okay linkedin you have hundreds of people who are looking to learn to become programmers guys i'm not kidding craigslist put up your craigslist ad fiverr oh fire probably the best place to start you start out with literally five dollars that's your first starting point there's hundreds of people looking for you right but these facebook groups this is where some of our students actually found their students rishi one of the guys who was maybe even a chat but he's actually working with us right now he started off by finding people through instagram through facebook groups literally he just called cold called he went to you know what he did what'd he do he went to coding coding facebook groups like right now guys right now if you guys have time i mean still stay on this live call but find a facebook go to facebook.com and do type in javascript group like javascript for example javascript group right there right this will give you a humongous javascript of people who are interested in javascript boom right there it's so simple you go there you start helping people out you reach out to them directly you say hey i see what you're doing this is amazing it by the way if you're interested in potentially getting learning more javascript i myself am a teacher and i love to teach and would love to teach you as well again if you're interested let's get on a call literally just say that and you're done make sense makes sense and then you and then you close them exactly so i've gotten 100 people from all these different spots the next thing is over time as you build your skill you're just gonna want to learn how to increase your charges exactly right so when you first start out you might be making what you might be making what 15 per hour 15 per hour 15 per hour let me see 15 per hour right there okay that might be starting rate but again as you get better your price increases guys okay as you get better as you get more clients your price increases dramatically so you might be going from 15 per hour to now let's say at this point you might be going towards uh let me get the brush tool here you know you are going towards what 15 to 25 per hour within three months actually probably been faster like literally guys when you have your first client your second client might be 25 per hour literally right there that's what i've been told a lot of times 25 per hour your first client just to get from the door for 50 per hour your next client increase the price of 25 per hour done you're done pro tip do group coaches instead of individual coaching charge more pro clients yes so this is actually one time of the rishi we should probably talk to rishi about this because that's really cool this is what he does so so well is he started out with doing group coaching with people and so he'd be able to actually make about 2k per month or one i think 1k or 2k per month just on group coaching right you put everybody into this humongous group right and the coach all of them that's cool because you have one hour you're spending right on 10 20 different people who paid you the same amount of money that's huge man right you're making your time worth it even more i mean think about this right let's say you have 10 people on the group coaching let's say they paid you 15 per hour so it's 15 per 15 people okay they paid you how let's say 15 10 people that's 150 okay 150 let me see uh 150 bucks right guys this is real stuff 150 bucks okay for one session for one session now and you get them on a group coaching call and now one hour is how much one hour is not equal to what one hour is equal to what now 150. 150 bro guys like this just literally insane yes and guys the reason we're teaching this it doesn't matter if you want to go full time or doesn't matter if you want to go freelancing this is something that anyone can pick up as they're starting out can start to generate an extra side income while learning how to code and examine how to master exactly the skills awesome you're well on your way to making your first hundred dollars with code from there pretty much awesome so like i said we did coaching we did that your next step is what you could go into freelancing and this is the path that you want to go into again and this depends guys freelancing there's two different there's three different paths right you can do freelancing you can do things like fulltime potential right it depends on you right a lot of people will start out with full time right away before they begin to freelance so it really depends on what you can do on which you're able to keep evolve okay make sense good so we have freelance and that's part one okay now there's a freelancer that might require you a few months for you to know just a little bit because if you know zero it might be a little bit hard okay okay so we have and that's where you for example you might be making you know an income of 5k per month that's when you've got your 5k per month okay exactly and again these are just different things that you could start to learn on the side to build these different incomes as well awesome so you can make money through freelancing skills of course translate to what translate to hourly rates right there transit to income pretty simple stuff makes sense cool so you can charge more for freelancing games of course now your hourly rate might be here what 30 to 50 per hour but you might have more hours you might not be doing 40 hours or 20 hours per week let's say for example right so let's say that's 20 hours per week 20 hours per week per week how much is that per week if you make it let's say 30 30 bucks 30 uh 600 that's 600 600 per week you might be making right there right and how much is that per uh per month so now 2 000 2 000 2 400 per month and that is a pretty damn good salary i would say so and guys if you remember what nas showed you right now we said like if you're level one level two level three all the way to level ten yes once you start to get to those higher levels you can graduate from tutoring and start to pick up these contracts that might pay your hourly rate a little bit more as well yes and again this is where you guys get to build things like okay like projects websites small applications like chrome extensions wordpress sites who knows all those things this is where this is how you get started okay next up so where to find clients find clients on freelancing sites like for example there's like upwork upwork like for example freelancer freelancer right there but most importantly you know where to fight clients most importantly bro i was assuming probably in the facebook groups as well and just yes facebook groups but also also something nas did a lot what is it it's actually through people you know it's for people you know that's part one so through people you know so through connections so connections are very important here guys connections go ahead and ask friends your family ask your friends at your front hand like hey guys you but do you know anybody who needs help right but once you got that then conferences right there go to conferences meet people network this is actually how i got my first gig as a freelancer this is how i got paid my first i think i got paid nine thousand dollars for a project wow yes as my first gig so that was pretty damn good i would say so i mean i worked like my ass off for this honestly but but still right conferences one of the most important things to get the best why do you think they exist it's because of people who make money on there right so learn how to write good proposals take time to identify uh what's the code that was interesting that was not good all right take time to find identify clients potential requirements and so forth okay awesome so make your clients search for you really important guys of course you don't want to just be reaching out to clients always you want them to reach out to you as well and this is where social media comes in so so important guys okay social media right social media is they call inbound basically people find you they see that you're good and they come to you and if they come to you then what can they do what can you do they can hire you they can hire you but most importantly you can charge more you can charge more yes you can charge more so choose platforms okay you enjoy for example made that be linkedin facebook uh instagram and so forth create a good profile okay get a decent headshot okay be clean remember how you had that clean headshot of me for example why do you think i did those i paid 250 for those headshots because again if you're clean if you look good if you're clean like it or not i'm sorry it's like if you got a certain thai people will believe you more than if you're just like i don't know just random you know what i mean exactly i'm sorry you can judge me whatever you want but that's just the truth of the world okay so let's get into some tips guys that will help you to do this if you want to do so yes here we have rachel james an amazing amazing freelancer look at this profile like look how clean it is virtual assistant internet beautiful picture rachel was always amazing if she's not watching this i'm i'm gonna be sad but beautiful pictures but she brand herself amazingly look she even has her book me link over there yes right there her email right her linkedin website everything easy is it for someone who maybe has an online business to come and be like oh wow rachel this looks amazing i need to reach out like there's even a book now button right there yeah look at this right look at that guys guys like it does not get better right social media is your friend exactly so if you know what to do on social media guys it's very simple just start by documenting your journey as a developer that's why it's so important guys as you're going through this platform right as you're going through this coding you should be documenting what you're doing documenting put it in your instagram post your slackload everything you're learning put it up on there make it clean make it good that's how i got started is how do you think i found qazi through social media social media i was documenting my journey found him through that he found me through there as well we got together we decided to work together and then boom voila we're here now like it's crazy what social media does for you how do you think this guy was found i was found well yeah we found each other through social media and then at a live event at a conference at a conference conferences social media the proof is in the pudding which is right here this is the pudding right there right here right here we are putting we're at the puddings okay chocolate pudding awesome yes so even a failure so again yes guys okay document your journey even even when things go bad if you something feel you're like did this did that not work something went bad it's okay documented that too really important guys so again and let's go and create a system for finding clients okay you're ready to take on your journey become a freelancer that's crazy to find plans you ready bro let's do it how do you do it well you want to make sure as you're creating these systems you make sure that you're working on platforms like upwork and people per hour you're able to go through even some directories facebook groups slacking news but if you have this system of daily actions you could take every single day you're gonna again fall in love with the process and not the results similar to what i talked about before you kind of create like the action steps that you need to do today so you could be successful in a year from now yes correct go ahead take a note of know a piece of pen and paper guys very important guys and just list them down for yourself but we'll tell you exactly how to do it as well check this out creative system for finding clients look at this here's your system right here would you spread out your specific thing your specific like whatever might be maybe it's using spreadsheets uh you know google google slides whatever it might be trello word whatever it might be right split this up into two into six categories one natural clients okay conversations you're having with people outreach emails called booked right with people followup and client right so this is the stepbystep process to get from someone from potential clients to becoming a full client right there make sense okay create this for yourself make sure you you keep track of everything that you're doing as you're talking to people at conferences as you're talking people through facebook groups keep track of it okay don't just let it kind of hang there very important all right cool awesome it's gonna keep going and of course go to conferences you guys know the importance of this at this point right here like this what conference is this daniel this uh i'm actually not quite sure google google a conference oh yeah google conference actually my friend went there once dope isn't this the ceo of microsoft no google yeah but that guy that google specific presenter he's the ceo of google google yeah right yeah i don't know yeah yeah he's the ceo cool yeah yeah i forgot what his name was but uh yeah seo google that's correct yeah yeah so this is at google i o i think is the yeah sander sunder i don't know how to say that [Laughter] i'm sorry but apparently he's the boss so we listen to the boss okay and mish again blaka what i literally do guys because of course we talk with a lot of students as well right uh for you know our programs right and so forth like that i have booked out for example every single morning between 9 a.m to 12 p.m pc guys is where i have calls as well so for example for you guys you can do the same thing right lock out your calendar time daily where you do call maybe it's 8 amp pst to 12 pm pst where you do follow up look for new opportunities to add and place it to meet new potential new people for example wanna create a place great place to meet new people is nowhere let me show you meetups.com meetups.com amazing place oh that's not okay never mind hold on i don't know what happened there do we have do we have internet i think god i think yeah we're good yeah i'm doing meetups right there so meet up oh it's meetup.com my bad meetup.com so literally go ahead like for example taipan uh let me just think about this camera yes we're coming to beverly hills we'll say have encoding or let's just say uh yeah let's say coding for example okay right there right ladies learn code developer show and tell right this is where you meet people this is where you meet people around write coding and so forth but let's say for example you want to do more business type business type things for example maybe you want to do app development for example app development development who knew right app development right video game for example tutorial right developer show and tell all these different things is where lightning talks for example see tech happy hour right there look at this beautiful go somewhere like this this is a tech happy hour right find people around this is a hacker dojo the public group guys get into this meet people right very important and that's pretty much it and this is how you get to network and this is how you get clients it's just you know i mean it's not simple of course but it's doable all right let's go ahead and do this next step guys we are currently at 254 lives can we get to 400 likes let's go let's go okay good that's a change a good change in pace all right so how to find a job now how do you make money through a job that's a question okay hi my three job well again to find a job you want to look for opportunities for different places like linkedin like you know your favorite companies like india and so forth write a nice resume i will and the rice resident may mean clean resume okay a clean resume please a clean resume okay yours needs to be clean you might have a header at the top that says your name you have your this part might be your experiences or your projects next part might be your experiences and find the last part might be your references right here okay so guys go ahead and i just wanted to add guys what you'll notice is everything we talked about is universal if you want to be a freelancer or if you want to get a job all these things apply you could make money tutoring and helping people learning how to program you could find the right networks at conferences like even if you're looking for a job there's probably recruiters are going to be there's gonna be other software engineers of big tech companies that are like the google io conference right if you schedule your time properly if you schedule daily actions whether it's like hey i gotta learn how to code this stuff or hey i gotta reach out to these people you're gonna be successful so everything we've talked about here is gonna apply to you whether you're trying to make six figures as a freelancer or through a fulltime job exactly and really important i just i kind of thought about this one amazing way to find people as well is actually nowhere hackathons oh that is huge yeah networking opportunity amazing networking opportunity guys this is where you find people who are not only developers but potential startup companies who want to hire you for example uh businesses freelancers right people this is the probably on the best networking solutions like for you honestly find a hackathon near you and go there dina one of our students is one to a hackathon want the hackathon and guess what she now has a job as a react.js developer amazing like done you know what i mean and by the way we just got a great question now that i think you're gonna like they said how do we address not having any experience or any relevant experience on a resume well if you don't experience then what you have is pretty simple guys what you have is something called projects guys this is where you put down your projects okay everything that you've done right so for example you see how this section right here this blue section this blue section is only mainly for projects this is the only way we will showcase people that hey this is what i can do this is what i did that's what i left to do so what is a great example of a project i mean what do you think well definitely what we did in the past three days we were able to build an amazing slack clone these are the projects that you could start to learn and you can put on your portfolio exactly so slack clone maybe like for example whatsapp clone but really important guys is don't just build them and copy them i would say build them but also add your own features right add your own features right and then once you're adding your own features can i give you a really small piece of advice this is what our students this is what our students at pwg do they build what they have in our course and then they rebuild it by themselves by themselves again again by themselves fully man fully by themselves that is how you're actually learning it yeah they don't watch the video they don't watch the tutorial know nothing they just rebuild it this is how you probably will learn the most and so you put that on your portfolio you put that on your projects and that's how people see you put yourself out on social media and you should you will you will get the opportunity that you want okay up next okay let's go and move on so really quickly guys as you said uh write a cover letter prepare your interview guys do mock interviews with your friends right around you don't just go into an interview just being fully blank do mock interviews with people around you and negotiate yourself this is gonna happen probably later on when you first get the interview or when you actually get the job so don't worry about this part so much right now this is not the most important part your most important part is just to get the job yes so guys this is the road map to become a web developer specifically a six figure developer because if we look at how much a web developer makes on average you'll notice that it's above six figures right especially if you just go on indeed or anywhere you can look up these jobs with front of developer react js javascript developer what we just learned in these last couple days and this road map that we built out for you guys could be either through just doing your own thing trying to be a freelancer trying to find a fulltime job as we showed you the tips you want to do or even both at the same time guys now this opportunity is amazing right now like i mean it's so amazing guys i mean if you go for example to indeed.com guys indeed.com okay let's just think about this let's say you type in javascript java uh let's just say javascript javascript right there right and i mean you're looking for sony opportunities potentially right there it's it's insane so let's go and find jobs right now so technical project lead right there right senior foster developer full stack node.js javascript developer right there right there easy apply right so remote jobs and that's the cool part right now guys is a lot of these are remote by the way nas how many responses did we just get on this how many results did we just get on this and what on this search scroll up to the top 61 000 jobs are available right now 61 000 jobs that scared me dude 61 000 jobs guys are available right now indeed and you type in javascript right there you have 61 000 opportunities and guess what next week there's probably gonna be tens of thousands more opportunities yes they're just always coming in and always growing i literally when i when i researched this like literally two months ago when we did a top five program languages video on youtube it was 50 000 jobs and it's just growing this was only two months ago this is now 61 000 jobs and the crazy thing is it's only 10 000 more a lot of those are probably new so it's probably like 40 000. look at this guys also developer urgently hiring easy apply 100 to 130k per year they want to throw money at you right now they're just grabbing the money and throwing it at you if you have the skills yes yes now granted i'm not gonna like [ __ ] you saying that you're gonna be making this right away okay you need to learn things like for example right aws my javascript look at this javascript look at this right there boom boom right bro look at this it's good it's come from awesome just react okay now again and just to be mindful you don't have to know everything in ten hun here you need to know at least one thing that's on here okay a lot of these job postings that will have aws they have like 20 different technologies they're just doing it to screw you off the purpose of that is to scare people off who are not capable of learning something like this that's the whole goal so when you see something like this and you're like okay well i don't know this i don't know this i know this i know a little of this me but i don't know this it's okay still apply you literally you will not be hurt if you just simply apply guys okay you will not be hurt at all the only thing you're doing is just spending more time exactly guys you know what i mean awesome so let's go ahead and again you will not be making this this amount of money right away it might take you some time but you might be looking at making you know 70 80k yeah per year depending exactly there's nothing wrong with starting at that 60 000 year and building up to this over time yes because again if this is something that you're trying to do if you're trying to do a career transition or this is the first career trying to start yeah this is a lifelong process it's a lifelong process if you can earn 60 000 the next year 70 80 and it takes you a couple years to get to the six figures but then for the rest of your life the next 20 to 30 years you're gonna be earning six figures is that not worth it it's all worth it man it's so worth it guys most of all just enjoy the process please love what you do be positive the world is amazing the world is great as long as you make it that way like it's so simple i i can't make it anywhere else right you know if a lot of you guys you might be struggling i understand you're always struggle maybe you have a career that you don't like maybe you know and so forth but that's okay listen there is a bright side at the end of this you just have to take the right strategies you have to take the right initiative and say that's it i am done i'm ready to move on it's behind me now let's just keep going forward i will work hard because i want a better living for myself that's it exactly guys i mean nods couldn't have said it better so now what we want to tell you guys is how you could take it a step further we

to have to be there and of course really important go ahead and we'll have homework for you we'll go ahead as one important homework that we have for you which we want you guys that is your homework your homework is to register for the webinar that is your homework so mozambique just asked a question he said daniel what kind of projects can i do to integrate data structures like search and sort cues and trees well that's a good question it's actually something we do in our program yes that is a great talk about it for a second yeah we should definitely talk about it so this is a great question because very often i remember when i was in university yes we would do all these crazy algorithm data structures but i never really saw a purpose to them and it wasn't until when i got to the interview questions where they kind of added a purpose to it right yeah so a specific one was when i was google when i was interviewing with google they asked me hey i want you to create an autocomplete so imagine you have a search bar you're typing something in and then there's an auto complete that comes out from that what are you gonna do i was like oh my god what am i gonna do so i like start trying to think of these solutions and i ended up coming and modeling a solution that i didn't know about but it's called the try right and what this try is it's a form of a tree that allows you to search through basically different words that you put into the tree structure and it optimizes it so it doesn't take too long especially if you have millions of words inside of the tree yeah it's really cool it's something we do with our students sorry yeah so i'll just say well now he's going to say while he finishes chewing and drinking but this is what we decided we're like guys let's take this project and put it into our full stack mastery bootcamp yes guys yes and that is one of the projects out one of the hundreds of projects they're gonna build because these are the things that you have to build and learn so you understand them and you understand how they work and how they're applicable it's so much fun and because you get to apply the real world the scenario of something like this you get to learn so much and of course guys these are really it's a meal great question by the way it's a really important topic that you you guys need to focus on okay stop working so much and just being fancy with all your projects do the projects yes but also focus on the fundamentals and the basics focus on those i cannot stress this enough if you don't focus on fundamentals and the basics which by the way is something we focus on very much in pwj and focus mastery as well you will not get the job i'm sorry because when you go to the job what do you think they're testing you for it's pretty simple they are testing you for your problem solving skills and your algorithm skills that's it they're not going to ask you hey can you write me for example a react.js component app or whatever might be right the com the reality is apps is what gets you to the interview right that's your portfolio they see it it's nice okay interesting person let's talk to them when you talk to them they're going to talk to you about what your fundamentals your problem solving how good are you at being able to step outside the box and find a solution to a problem he's really good at finding social to a problem like too good i'm mad at him sometimes yeah literally you know what i mean so that's just one example right so please follow this so yes muslim that's a great question so try is one great another one another one might be for example uh um undo for example um the undo section for example when you do undo that actually has to do with stacks you have to create two stacks the the undo functionality on your computer on like a text editor or anything like that yes exactly so that hopefully that answers your question so before we dive into the questions we also forgot to mention guys there's one final homework assignment for you guys yes what is it we need you to we're gonna send you guys a link to a questionnaire so that we can help you to get closer and build that road map for you guys so i'm on it if you're here i don't know if you could just drop the link in the chat box in the youtube one if not just send them my way and i could also drop it in there but make sure you hit that link and do that homework assignment there's a couple of questions that we have for you they're going to help say he said anyway here let me see um i saw some people saying they completed the homework i don't know if he dropped it in there though yeah yeah yeah let me see let me see so the homework is for you guys is simple guys okay what is the

and do the thing hold on hey so question guys question how often will there will they do bonus training for you in a situation just like that so she's she's referring to if you apply to a job that wants you to have like aws php like all these different things yeah like and you only have one or two of those five requested they will give you the all the training they need because they are investing in you yes it is good for them it is good for them to invest in you because they want to keep you there for a long time and so for them you your value is a lot more than what they're paying you exactly you see what i mean and so they will invest you they will keep the trade necessary because if you're already there there you put the energy dirty put the time into you yeah at this point all you need to do is just put in no some more knowledge to you that's it they're already committing 60 70 80 100 000 a year to you they'll be more than happy to train you with whatever they need hey so adrian i hope that answers your question because in reality that stops a lot of people from applying but don't let it stop you oh my god one of our students from the full stack mastery boot camp just donated 15 thank you so much on but then he says when is the hexa that's good and um you know the you know the answer that on i'm sure you know accessible come on i'm not saying the number no i am not saying that number it's a special number for us in the community all right fine it's 50 oh yeah i also realized he also donated 15 dollars yeah i didn't get that part at first oh let's go on where's this question coming from oh my god that's amazing that's funny that's all 15. but wait yes the what's happening well of f that is 15 yes guys yes it is let's go oh god that's so funny though oh my gosh that's actually a really big thing that we have in our first time mastery we have a we have a lot of fun just in pwg and it feels like mastery course everywhere it's amazing we enjoy it we enjoy it so much this is why we get to do what we do is because again a lot of it because of you guys you guys are amazing thank you all so much for being such amazing students and just amazing people in general uh like always love you all so much uh cool how to name your robot friday what does that make sense huh what is that question let me see i don't know five more we get the dance oh look at this five more we get to dance i don't know what she's talking about we already danced what are these guys we already did that's already happened uh i'm having entirely too much fun with you people we're having too much fun with you that's good to hear okay any more questions guys so sharier asked um how any tips on how to improve data structures and algorithm skills where uh probably just a couple more up oh my gosh are you the most up to date yeah it is all right it wasn't that far up what web app do you think i have to build to impress potential employees with react gs well for one i mean the slack loan here that you just built is amazing so make sure it's clean and make sure it's nice that's part one um yeah i mean it's pretty much any big project that that includes a lot of you know different parts so like for example react gs for example my includes components right style components right anything that may be a little more difficult than just normal that should be always your goal right and you don't just want to do just like for example you know one project do a few projects do a project with one page for example a full stack app with slot clone right include login right that's a big thing that people look for is can you can you put a login functionality right maybe from scratch even and so forth right can you do that um that's always something you want to look for is what features can i include in a project so login logout right maybe live time chat application more pages for example maybe for slack loan guys one thing you can add is a profile page so when you click on your profile you can actually view your own profile so that's one thing i recommend for you guys that's a really big thing that you know that a lot of employers might like right so that's one thing you might want to add and that could be bonus points for you for you'll be able to win the 15k full stack mastery boot camp of course awesome all right let's see any other questions i'll take just a couple more guys drop them below drop the fire nozz beginners then mike tyson come with coding oh you know it hi tyson let's go we're gonna miss you guys we're gonna miss you guys as well guys but we're not done yet guys sunday sunday sunday sunday sunday i want to see you guys on sunday everybody should have joined this sunday guys really really important learn the basics on the

it's a good question okay that's a good question here what do you think is it valuable to learn how to sort data structures without the use of methods methods yeah i think it's important to at least know the fastest most optimal ways of is it sorting or yeah of sorting a specific data structure like an array right so in this case if you're going to be doing sorting you could either learn quick sort or merge sort those have both the same big o notation of n login which is the most optimal for sorting you just have to know one of those yes i mean you also can know that you can have a dot sort function that helps you out and does it for you but if you just know the implementation you at least understand how the inner workings of the dot sort function work you don't have to go crazy you don't have to go learn bubble sort and all these other ones but as long as you know the important ones yes and again guys let me just jump back to here really quickly here the link down below will be
