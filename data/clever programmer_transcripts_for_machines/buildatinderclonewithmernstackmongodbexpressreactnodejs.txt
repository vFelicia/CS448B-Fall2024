tinder clone like this okay yeah and while this gets started david what is the backing going to consist of today so the back end today we are going to be using uh for the database bank and we will be using uh node.js which is a backend java javascript frame framework and we will also be using express.js which is his server side uh javascript we will also use mongoose which we will use to connect to mongodb and it will make our connection super easy and painless and i think that's pretty much it nice okay so we've got the back end today the back end consists of mongodb express and mongoose right exactly oh and of course we will use heroku to host our backend right nice okay and guys i want to reassure you all that this is a beginnerfriendly tutorial um and you can definitely follow along so don't worry if you're new to coding just go ahead follow along you can pretty much do this at your own pace it's going to be prerecorded it's going to be recorded sorry it's not prerecorded um so take it at your own pace okay doesn't matter if you get stuck doesn't matter if you freak out it's all good okay now oh exactly uh for the back end this is a very beginner friendly um build and if you are a beginner for backhand this is the video to watch uh and after all the other ones exactly go on awesome vikas curry says i was getting many projects but i don't take them because of lack of knowledge now recently i completed 3 000 of crypto exchange projects from pakistan thank you so much you are welcome vickers nice amazing dude and we are going to add that to that count that we have we have we have a big count going on right now we also have half a thousand people on this live stream that's insane thank you so much guys that is insane support you guys show us right so david we've got the app pretty much built at this point so once it gets to this point at the bottom guys you should see a message saying happy hacking hey the greatest ever in the chat what's up dude nice awesome okay now david are we deploying the front end how are we deploying the front end definitely we will be deploying it to firebase if i'm not mistaken okay so in that case while this is getting set up um so it says happy hacking right now uh what we can actually do is we can quickly swap over to firebase and for anyone who's new i just want to re like quickly give a shout out that we have actually released our profit with javascript course the early bird price is limited until sunday where i personally will be increasing that price okay and once it goes up it does not come back down

away from the project limit oh damn okay oh we built so many clones of them you'd think they'd give us unlimited access but it's all good so good so guys this is going to go ahead and create a backend no no not create a backend so it's going to create firebase for us now what i want to tell you guys is this is only going to be used today to host the app so i know many people freak out when i usually say that we're using firebase but it's only to host the front end okay so we've done that that's all we needed to do for the front end thank you so much vayum desai for that 20 rupees super chat appreciate that dude now what we're going to go ahead and do um so somebody actually said uh react is not included in the modules of profit of javascript i would like to clear that up yes it is guys we have a huge number of modules on the way we have a couple we have a ton of coaching calls in there at the moment so this includes 15 javascript training modules and we have a bunch of react modules react projects are in the works we have so much stuff in there guys it is literally going to be a game changer salman khazi says super chat uh sunny you are saving our future thank you so much it's not just me dude it's the whole of team cp and just to shout guys you're going to be able to get access to all of these amazing projects um inside of pwj nice yeah exactly guys and then don't worry about uh react not being in the uh modules just yet because we are working on that uh to put as much uh project projects and modules into practical javascript as possible just it's kind of like just to clear that out we do have modules on react we do have modules on react guys don't worry we have modules on react all right guys let's go ahead and carry on right so now guys jumping back to the code let's go ahead and go back to the code um give me one second guys i'm just checking out something right so let's go ahead and check this out now so once you get the terminal up and running right and it says happy hacking so if you see this message that's a great deal what you're going to do is cd into the correct uh photos in this case tinder clone and then we're going to do ls and then in here what we're going to say is npm start now i'm going to pop this over to one side of the screen and go ahead and grab this local host and chuck it back over on this side oh computer starting to feel this stress now it says something's not running on my logos oh yeah okay i'm gonna go ahead and actually run this on localhost 3001 so let's go ahead this is the app that we have running at the moment and this is the one that we have here so i'm glad you guys are actually liking the background music so some people are saying they don't like it some people are saying they do let us know in the comments if you'd like it if not maybe i can turn it off but i think let's give it a try guys something different something new and we have a lot of people on this on this live stream right now so i think it's doing pretty good i think it's doing pretty good right so if you get to this page right now well done this is your starting point i'm going to go ahead and delete this test.js we don't actually need that but let's go ahead and jump into the tinder clone so jumping in we have the source over here guys now what we're going to do is we have a few files here right we're going to go ahead and change the we're going to go ahead and delete some of the uh filesys we don't need app.test.js we do not need logo.svg and we do not need setup test.js okay so let's go ahead and get rid of it so oh i'm glad you guys are liking the music that's thick dude we found some music that everyone likes okay let's go ahead and delete that and makes a nice background right exactly so some people are saying less beats i'm going to give give this a try guys we can go really really instrumental and go like the sentimental work right this is like the sort of yeah yeah one day we were like just chilling out with some music exactly this is like the you know this is the quiet chill vibe right now um let's go ahead and my computer is freezing god damn it okay let's go ahead and see so somebody says while this is loading guys how do i pay installments for the course so if you go to a checkout page you should see the option to go ahead and pay an installment thank you alot kumar malik for that lovely super chat donation appreciate you dude thank you so much so now somebody said david has an echo um we will check on that i think this is i think it's okay for now guys but um flitchiko says this is too chill god damn it let's go ahead guys i like this music more i think i like this one more let's go all right so also the winners of the react challenge we will be announcing very soon guys do not worry um let's just hope that this kicks out of its freezing right now god damn it always on the live streams it seems to happen okay failed to delete using the trash okay okay it's not nice anyway inside of app.js guys what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go ahead and hide the terminal now what we're going to do is go ahead and delete the header boom get rid of that delete the logo there we go save and then we'll get to this point there's an empty page and inside of here i'm going to write a h1 tag this is going to say let's build the man tinder clone guys save it and you should see everything centered right now everything being centered isn't it's not actually what we want we don't really want everything to be completely centered thank you saket suman for that donation appreciate you dude all right um thank you g says i wish we could pay pwj monthly guys honestly pay once right now and you will like i'm telling you you'll make that money back it's it's it's ridiculously underpriced i'm and this is my own opinion coming right out now like that cost is so jampacked with value it is insane like you're going to if you consider it like an investment in yourself think of it that way and there are an amount of people that have landed six figure contracts i mean i the fact i even have to say that and people are getting confused like dude it's just insane like this is this this course is underpriced and you can make sure like grab that deal before it goes okay exactly guys like like i i even see people people get getting paid after two weeks so yeah you will start earning back pretty soon exactly exactly so now guys inside of the class what we're going to go ahead and do is we're going to change this to a lowercase a because we we are pretty much following something called the uh bem class convent like naming convention so this is a really handy way of styling stuff up that will actually go ahead and means that a lot of the stars won't get applied so we're gonna go to app.css do command a and hit delete on everything so it's all gone then we're gonna go into index.css go over here and we're gonna go ahead and say target everything and do a margin of zero and this will go ahead and remove that top gap so you see if i undo that we get that little top gap over here so there we go we get this right here okay now uh imar dahan says it is more than worth it and future code says the more it costs the more you'll be invested in it do the course exactly i could not agree more with elizabeth right there like she is exactly on the ball with that one um guys like you heard her and it's true like if you go ahead and invest in yourself like we all can go out to buy a fancy dinner we can all go out to buy like a movie ticket but when the hell is it you're actually gonna wake up and invest in yourself guys like just it really like it's like guys there's a passion for this stuff and like we're putting a heart and soul into this and we're doing this for you guys so now we have the man tender comb right here guys so now what we're gonna do is go back to our code app.js and we're gonna mask everything out so the app consists of a few different things at the top we have a header okay so let's go ahead we have this header right here and and then in the middle of it we have a we have the tinder cards as over here we have the tinder cards and then we have this stuff over here so this stuff over here is the swipe buttons right so let's go ahead and mask out so over here we have the header so i always like to mask this stuff out david do you find it helps when we mask things up yeah yeah definitely i mean when you plan your application or whatever you're trying to build uh at the very beginning it's gonna give you a quick overview and you can you can code a lot faster because you know what are you going to build right exactly dude and like especially if you ever get stuck it's going to really allow you to come back and sort of realign with yourself and sort of carry on and get it done right exactly so that's what we've done here we've masked it out and everything looks pretty good at this point now what we're going to do is uh priyanshi says it does sunny thank you so much dude yeah glad it helps you so let's go ahead and build the header component so this lovely top bit right here so jumping back into the code we've got header.js and then we're going to use our lovely little snippets trick so rfce boom and then here we're going to save a lifesaver yeah exactly dude class name of header and just to show you guys that little snippet thing is if you go into extensions and type in es7 it should be the first one that pops up it's this thing right here so es7 react redux graphql react name snippets i mean this thing's packed with snippets but like the ones that we use are rfce and it is insane like it really does help you speed up your development um oops i'll open that okay let's go ahead and go back so now what we do is every time we create uh joshua thomas says sunny i'm still pumped that's what i'm talking about dude that's the energy we need in this in this team that's that nice all right we still have a half a third half a thousand people in this live stream right now if you're excited smash the thumbs up button for david because david is back david is here to stay and david is ready to absolutely crush and bring the value with the man stack builds exactly and smash it for sonny as well because he is here after the challenge crushing it like a hero thank you dude appreciate that so here we have the importing the header.css it's going to freak out because we need to go ahead and build the header.css file and then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and go here and everything oh no this has to be the directory like that there we go now we're gonna go ahead and import so make sure it works we're gonna say header like so auto import love that little trick right here we can see it like this and then we have save it and let's go back to this let's say h2 i am a header like this oops okay not like that but here we go i am the header so there we go we've got the header component right there so let's go ahead and get rid of our h1 now because we just want the header component on there so there we go we have the header now we're going to transform the header into this beautiful thing over here right so to go ahead and do that and we actually just had someone join we had frankie add jomo so if you're in the chat right now then that is awesome dude let us know in the chat if that was you because i love seeing people join on this live stream that is awesome exactly and welcome to the community hey welcome to the community dude all right so for the header.js um and guys this is a team that shows up like every time we show up like david shows up for you guys like i said to david i was like david i know we just finished the challenge but like and david was like saying say no more three months stack build and i was like damn dude let's go like straight after a challenge this girl guys i was like screw it let's do it let's let's go so we're going to keep on dropping the value for you guys because that's what we're here for we want to change lives we want to hit 5 000 jobs at the end of 2020. guys we're coming in blazing hot exactly guys blazing hot right so for the header component now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and we're going to go ahead and we want a few things we want the icon so we want the tinder icon and we have these two icons on the left and right thank you tj for that donation dope dude oh thank you appreciate that so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna go ahead and actually install material ui so material ui is going to be used in today's build um and we're going to be using it uh i need to hide the oh no there we go okay we're going to be using it to install all the sort of icons that we're going to be using so everything that you see so all of this stuff a big donation by harpreet singh says whenever i make these builds it doubles the confidence thanks to cp team fully pumped for a man stack build today that's insane and we love and appreciate you talking about exactly thank you dude nice nice um veteran says why not build classbased components because that's old stuff dude like you want to make sure you stay ahead of the trend functional components are new they're more efficient so that's why we use them so now to get these icons we're going to use material ui to go ahead and install it you need to go down here to npm install material ui core you just want to copy that open up your terminal i like to add a new terminal so that we can go ahead and get that started so here make sure you're in the correct one before oops and uh oops okay there we go and i'm gonna do mpmi oh i've actually double installed it there we go npm install material ui call okay now why that's happening we're gonna go ahead and um let's go ahead and do uh future code says companies hire people who do who using functional components aim into that elizabeth like i agree with you like uh i went i once joined the company and i couldn't believe you wanna by the way guys just carry on uh you wanna click on icons at the top and search that go here i joined the company and the senior developers didn't know what functional components were i was like what the hell is going on i was like this is not right something is wrong here like you know like it's not like we should we need to like we need to push cutting edge stuff and that's what we're here for guys next step is you want to go ahead and install material ui icons so here we're going to go ahead and do npm install material ui icons you need to do both the core and the icons while that's loading i want you guys to go over to this link over here so where it says you can search the full list of these icons and i've clicked that and this is how we find all of i love it when people do this by the way um oops not that one sorry uh this one where it says like they actually dropped the code snippet and that cool david yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks andrew thanks angie yes that's dope dude right yeah so now somehow some community here exactly so guys once you're here you want to make sure you want to make sure that here you could like if you need like let's go ahead and say we want this icon so this person or profile so i can actually go ahead and type in profile and you can see look i've got loads to choose from i click it and it gives me the importing code and then we pretty much just use that as a component so that's all we need to go ahead and do at this point you can see at the bottom of our terminal it says completed so we can carry on with the build so now we can go ahead and um yeah i'm just reading the comments some people are funny all right so now we can go ahead and at 600 people in this uh live stream now thank you so much guys i appreciate you all um yeah so let's go ahead and now we have the header guys we're gonna go ahead and first we're gonna introduce a um so we're gonna introduce a person icon so let's go ahead and import it at the top so personal icon like so plus an icon there we go save it and we need to use it so let's go ahead and pop it in and this is how you use it guys it says person icon and you want to go ahead and do that and then you can see it jumps in there it's very small but it's go ahead it actually loaded in there that's the icon that we got from material ui so super simple yep exactly shylish says how's your huff now sunny getting better dude thank you for asking um the co the cough is still here but we'll we'll get through it now um i'm going to go ahead and replace this line of code with the following so we're going to use a prop which is font size of large and we're going to give it a class name of header icon um and you can see now it should grow a little bit this gets a little bit bigger and that helps us with the styling of this and also guys you notice that the one over here is actually a button it's clickable it has this nice ripple effect right so to get this ripple effect what we need to do is we can actually use something called the icon button right now i combine we import it like this and we go ahead and we just wrap our button in it so we go ahead and do this oops and we basically go down here we cut paste boom and now this right here turns into a clickable icon so just like that we've we've upgraded this to be so that's so clean that's dope right super powerful super power super simple like that's what's nice but it's really clean and simple um so that's really nice now guys what we're gonna do is we're gonna have the image so the image i'm going to go ahead and pop in next and i'm going to pop the image here and this has got a class name of header logo here's the source this is just a picture of tinder all right now um oat we can leave blank so let's go ahead and save it uh oh the greatest ever says just sent the client an email i hope all goes well good luck dude um oops what have i done here let me go ahead and fix that there we go sorry guys there you go okay so now you can see we have the tinder logo but it's huge right uh david they're asking for your instagram profile guys if you enjoy the content here is our instagram tag so make sure you go and follow us right now other side on the other side make sure you go ahead and shoot a story so literally go pick up your phone right now shoot an instagram story tag myself and david and let us know we can have a conversation on instagram right so go ahead and check it out that's it dude it's literally the easiest way is just to point down and learn it i just now i'm pointing at the mic and it's literally there so you get used to it yeah it's super hard nice right so now what we're going to do is for the header logo i'm just going to quickly style this one because we without like we can't even see anything with all this on the screen so we're gonna go into header.css and i'm gonna go ahead and say header underscore underscore logo like this and then i'm gonna go ahead and say object fit contain this will keep the aspect ratio and then i'm going to say height of 40 pixels save it boom there we go now it's nice and small really simple really easy right now at the top of the screen we want to lay things out a little differently so i'm going to go back in i'm going to get rid of that i am a header because we know it's a header now and what we're going to do is we're going to go into the header container so this is the main div we're going to say display flex right now flex is cool it allows us to do many things firstly i'm going to align item center now that will actually go ahead and center everything so you see now the tinder icon is now centered with the rest of the page i'm going to also make this a bit bigger there we go nice and then what we're going to do is um heartbreaking says hey sonny sometimes teachers react redux as well you've got a dude we've got the context api in many videos but i will be happy to drop a video on redux and we can maybe use some redux that's cool all right all right so i'm gonna head ahead and say justify content space between and now you can see whoa okay that just flew off somewhere else where the hell did that go oh cause i'm zoomed out yeah i'm zoomed out i'm zoomed in there we go um so now if you see a space between so what it's done is they found the two children and just spaced them apart right so if i had a third in we should see an equal spacing like this right so what we can do now is actually go ahead and i'm actually going to go ahead and say this should have a z index of 100 because i want this to like always be at the top in case we have a long page i'm also going to give this a border bottom and this border box will be very subtle it's going to be a light gray right now somebody says hi sunny uh uh how are you i just registered myself in pwg i can't see the name of that person by the way sorry about that but it says uh i received a receipt um what do i do next you should receive a email a confirmation and then you can actually go ahead and join the slack and join the program um so you should just keep an eye out in your in all of your photos and everything and all of your spam and everything like that and check it out and it should be on its way to you also welcome to the family hey welcome to the family is that dude nice yeah um let's go ahead and check guys for all of those of you who are watching i just want to shout out and say profitable javascript is now live we now have released our flagship product and this thing is insane it has an early bird price which is going to go up this sunday and guys once it goes up this sunday it's going to be a hundred dollars more right the price is gonna go back it never comes back down and then in 12 days we shut the doors like we completely are shutting the doors and this program enrollment will close because we want to keep this a tightknit community we don't want to spam it with lowquality uh people so we pretty much just want to have the best and the more the people who want to take their learning to that next level inside this community so we just got another person joined that is carlin mcdonald if you're in the chat let us know we appreciate and love all of you guys right yeah welcome dude um so now what we're going to do is we're going to jump back over to the code right so now let's so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and i got a funny text message from everyone so now okay so now let's go ahead and go to header.js yash says hey sonny the entire cp team is good and best work put up uh thank you i have one question how can we show an animation before starting or login into any particular app i can show you that in a different build today we're going to focus on the crunch and the crucial stuff okay so after introducing the image we're going to go ahead and say uh somebody says their birthday discount dude it's my birthday this month and i don't get a discount so the discount you're getting is literally guys if you get this product for less than a thousand pounds anywhere just grab the dashboard already yeah because like after 12 days it closes and when it reopens that thing is gonna be more than a thousand pounds so i'm not joking when i say that like uh i personally am doing that with kazi and we're gonna up that price so because that program is is just insane so make sure you don't mess about because we're not joking it's going to close and it's not coming back so yeah so we're going to introduce the final icon forum icon and david just jump in if you ever want to talk yeah i actually want to address one question uh autonomous uh asks how can i change my terminal style and that is something called oh my zsh right so it's basically making your whole uh terminal super easy to use and and lights up everything and if you're in a coffee and coding it makes you look cool exactly dude right yeah yeah so oh my zsh just like david said that's going to be something which is going to help you with your terminal and it's really good because it shows you your github as well your active branch so now right now you can see if i pull it up it will actually say we're on the master branch so very very handy tool especially when you're um getting things started uh okay now so somebody says can you explain to me why i should join profit with javascript on the net there's so much free content that we can learn whatever we want key to success uh success there is to write code right now dude that's an excellent question right excellent excellent question what i want to say to you it piotr is inside yes there's a lot of free content but you can get stuck on things like tutorial hell you can get stuck into like not understanding how to land clients not how to do that sort of stuff hey my girlfriend my beautiful girlfriend is in the chat that one everyone dropped some love for her what's up um yeah so that was a really awesome question uh by piotree um so i'm going to bring him back for a sec peter all right so just to answer your question dude inside of profit with javascript we actually have a ton of additional things that you're not going to find online right so we have react weekly training calls so you can see like we have weekly training calls i actually hold this myself every single tuesday i am there i'm gonna be holding that call um tomorrow dave is gonna be helping me out with that call and then we also have nars nars actually shows up i think it's once a week as well and we have success coaches so these are dedicated success coaches guys and they're gonna give you personalized video feedback on every piece of work now i can't stress that enough like can you tell me dude like are you going to get personalized video feedback on if you go to stack overflow and copy some code i mean i don't think you're going to have video feedback i mean you're probably gonna get um oh my god it says i'm a huge sunny fan i would expect that she is um hey cory's in the house what's up dude cory is killing him inside of pwj right now i actually coach corey he is absolute boss um yeah but guys you're not gonna get personalized video feedback on stack overflow you're just not gonna get it right you're not gonna get they're not gonna teach you how to go ahead and take that skill set that you've learned and then go ahead and make money with it now you can pretty much go ahead and not take my advice on this like you can pretty much ignore everything i have to say there's no hard feelings but like just to show you guys we have some incredible builds right we have some incredible builds each one of these builds we take to the next level inside the course we go ahead and just like you guys if you're a part of the amazon challenge we went ahead and took that to the next level and we introduced ecommerce functionality so absolutely crushed you're going to learn all of this stuff all of these high massive tech stacks are going to be included inside and guys you have awesome people inside this community you have kazi he's a six figure freelance coach he's gonna absolutely tell you all the tips and tricks you have nars nazis is going to literally tell you how to land that dream javascript job you have me and i think i'm pretty cool dude like i hope i am yeah so you guys have access to me but literally you can go ahead and chat to me inside of slack it's easy it's simple you can pretty much just message me straight off the bat now frank here's some success stories guys so frank literally sixfigure consulting project for sonos he just built the spotify clone he's part of the community frank is always going ahead and crushing it inside of pwj and yeah i just want to shout that out we have jen jen lost her job due to clover 19. she pretty much went ahead and doubled her salary and now guys like give it up for jen in the comments right within yeah david within one week dude she went from a 45k job to 90k so imagine losing your job guys and then going back to your employer and saying hey i just got a job that paid me double like i think at that point everyone will be like i think jen deserves like a huge round of applause for that right like she crashed killed it like a boss exactly she absolutely crushed it she crushed it now this video will be saved for anyone who wants to watch this later on but yeah like i'm saying guys pretty much this price goes up on sunday not gonna say again join now if you're on the fence you will not get the price that you're seeing now ever again once it goes up it goes up it's never coming back down don't miss out now back to the code so what we have now is we have the forum icon so i went ahead and imported at the top and what we're going to do is we're going to use it underneath so i'm going to go here and say forum icon like so and again guys i want to stress like remember we had flexbox at the top so now you can see it automatically space between right that's awesome somebody says do you guys teach typescript in pwj dude because you asked that question i will be introducing a typescript module that is my promise to you guys i love coding in typescript i will go ahead and introduce a javascript uh typescript module so there you go that's how dynamic we are guys like tell me any course on udemy that's going to listen to you and do that exactly this course is like yeah yeah this course is like tesla yeah why do you buy a tesla instead of any other cars because it's evolving right exactly i like that dude i like that here we have cory says if you guys are on the fence jump in you'll be no worse off exactly guys make sure you definitely go ahead and jump in right so let's go ahead and carry on with the coding okay so let's go ahead and see now we've got forum icon over here i'm going to go ahead and add the following to this so we're going to say from icons font size large class name header icon and now you can see we have a bit of a larger size but remember guys this is not a button so i want to make this a button so i'm going to say icon button as such so there's the icon button wrap it in that like this save it and there we go now it's a button all right so that's really cool and we get the cool animation right yep we get that lovely little flickery you know that juicy ripple right i get that now yep corey good shot he says can you guys recap on what you've done so far so for people who have just joined yes dude so what we're doing right now is we're adding the header to the tinder clone so this is what we're going for right now we're going to actually build it up until this point and then we're going to power it with a full stack back end so we're actually going to go ahead and pull these cards from a from where david from mongodb we will be using mongodb with an express js application hosted on heroku exactly yep hosted on heroku this thing is going to be insane guys keep watching if you're excited and if you like the man stack builds smash the thumbs up button for david because he's going to keep bringing the fire right nikhil says the kill says no prerequisites for pwj right like knowing html css code or things like that dude i have not had an amazing thing to say to you it is built for people who have no experience right so you don't have to know anything you've never coded a line before in your life no you're perfect welcome to the community don't even hesitate 30day moneyback guarantee go ahead and jump in dude exactly and you can ask any success coach to help you out by the way exactly exactly so now we have the header like such we're going to go ahead and finish the styling on the header so i'm going to go ahead and for the icons so these icons right here let me go ahead and my css file boom boom boom and say padding 20 pixels ammo says what's the duration of the program i'm interested a lot but i don't find much time to attend and practice coding right dude let's see the thing you can go on your own pace yeah right exactly you can go in there you can go in at your own david go go for it yep yeah so there are like prerecorded videos uh you can go with your own with your own pace on those videos and there are also weekly coaching calls with sunny with nas with success coaches and if you if you want to attend you can attend them live or they will be recording and you can rewatch them so it's all full on demand just like netflix it just gives you more value exactly guys fine now nikhil says i wish it was welcome to the community dude it's open the doors are open right now like the doors are open right now and it's only open for 12 days right so literally join in and jump in sydney smith actually joined you guys still cannot believe how much value you've given to community my skills have been improved already so much i can't thank you guys enough you're welcome sydney i love that and appreciate that dude um yeah and now i see so ammo says what's the duration of the program uh okay dude so you have as much time as you need to do that course right now obviously it's going to depend on how much work you put in nobody is ever going to give you a shortcut to making like 100k a year but we show you the way to do it now it's up to you to point 110 but if you put in 110 we will match you with 5 000 right and we're going to take you and literally carry you to the end line right so one thing i will say is there is no duration of the program it's literally down to how much hard work you're paying but there is a duration to that price that is available right now and that ends on sunday and when it literally when it goes up that that is not coming back comes back right so exactly exactly all right now guys we're going to go ahead and jump out right so back to the code um janith says will i be able to join the community now yeah sure go ahead join us with javascript that is the link in the description exactly link in the description don't miss out right so we've done with the header component so that's pretty good i guess we just finished the header component that's nice so now let's go back to app.js corey says they ain't lying exactly exactly did we ain't playing around once our price goes up it's not coming back down like i promise you that i promise you that right now we're going to build the juicy part the tinder cards right so tinder cards are pretty much all the functionality we saw all of this stuff right all of this stuff you see right here how do we go ahead and build that so rosham john says why are they building um tinder again because today we're powering it with demand stack right it's gonna be powered with demand stack and it's going to be we're going to show you guys how to build an express server on the back end and deploy it to heroku okay so we are taking it to the next level exactly guys taking it to the next level right so to get this next level uh to get this next uh section built the tinder cards we're gonna go ahead and create a component called tinder cards so i'm gonna go ahead and say tinder cards.js like this i'm gonna go in here and say rfce boom and then in the div i'm going to say class name i'm going to say tinder cards tinder cards like so i'm going to go ahead and say import i'm going to say tinder cards dot css saw a question by the way uh from my cube technical uh are backend developers eligible for pwj 100 dude see you inside right and yeah 100 we teach you guys not just frontend development we teach you guys node.js back in development firebase all that good juicy stuff uh all of that is inside right right um do you have a roadmap for pwj right yes it is in the check the link in the description everything that you need to know is inside of that page so link in the description how many times a month is the live course we have up to three or four coaching uh three and four coaching calls a week right so three to four coaching calls a week all right now tell me if that's not enough but like i mean that would tire me out right so you have the live builds on youtube you have the coaching calls on on on in pwj and the coaching calls are different guys so like right now you guys are writing messages to us but the coaching calls are zoom cool so literally like me and david are talking right now imagine you're on that call and i can literally say to you like hey dude explain to me what's wrong with your code run me through what's wrong with your code and we can go ahead and fix it together right so that's awesome um right so once we've got the tinder cards set up what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and install a package so we're going to install something called react tinder card so i'm going to go ahead and what there is a package like that yeah dude there's packages like that oh my god so mpmi i'm going to say react tinder card nice um there we go so right the link in the description keeps loading is it live uh let me go ahead and double check that for you guys i'm going ahead and pulling out right now seems to load for me guys so the link in the description is live this is the page you'll reach when you get to it go ahead and check it out and you can pretty much make your way through you can see what we offer you can see proof in the pudding with the testimonials and what people have literally gone ahead and said about the course uh also i can see um does cp have a slack group for everyone yes dude we have an insane slack community let me go ahead and actually show you right now i mean that's a pretty cool thing right let's go ahead and show you right now what the slack community is like so guys you can see if i go ahead and pull this open right now this is the slack community right now so let me go ahead and pop open on let's go ahead and say introduce yourself let's go and look check out profit with javascript so guys let me go ahead and show you guys we have 1700 students 1700 students right so you guys can see at the top right here we have 1700 students and that number is only growing like it's insane guys like this is the kind of community that we're talking about look look somebody had a problem like not like if i literally scroll you've got people dropping their sort of like troubles you've got people dropping their like struggles you've got people replying to them saying like no worries i can pretty much help you out um like this you can actually uh check one of the module channels we have separate channels for each module oh nice awesome dude yeah let's go ahead and show that for example here like seven says he found something awesome with tss garden went ahead and shared it you can see the community went crazy you can see all these responses you've got people replying to it you've got people dropping this fire and this value if you think we're handy and we're useful guys bloody hell go check out the community the community is insane and that's only available in profit javascript now with that said let's absolutely crush this build because i think we should go ahead and finish up on this bill guys let's go ahead and crush this um if you're on the fence then yeah you know i think it speaks for itself the value will speak for itself once you're in 30 day money back guarantee don't be silly and avoid that saving right now so for the tinder cards we're going to go ahead and do the following so we need some state we need some state and right now the state is going to keep track of who these people are so we've got jeff we've got ellen we've got sandra right all these people right now let's go ahead and store them in the state right so we're going to go ahead and say const and here i'm going to say const i'm going to say people and then i'm going to say set people equals use state oops you stay and i need to import this so this needs to be imported from react so at the top here i'm going to go ahead and say use state so i'm going to go ahead and initialize this with an empty array so this is how you write a variable in javascript in uh react sorry in react react right now what we can do is uh we're going to inside of tinder cards we're just going to pretty much and actually you know let's not initialize this with the empty value we're going to say each of these cards is going to have a name so let's go ahead and say the first one we'll name this case let's say elon musk right and then he's going to have a url and that url is going to be for his image so like his profile picture right so somebody said can you share this slack link here you need to be a part of the profit with javascript andrew says have my volume 100 and can barely hear anything i will go ahead and turn the background music a little bit down hopefully that's a bit effort you did so a few people say that i can hear really good um but i turned it down a little bit if you did so here we're going to go ahead and we've got the url so i'm going to grab this is just elon musk's picture of elon musk and then inside of our app what i can do then is i can say with jsx with squiggly brackets i can say people.map i can say for every single person i want to render out the following and here if i do h1 and i was to say person dot name now guys you should be able to see we need to render out the cards so let's go ahead and actually render them out i'm going to say tinder cards auto import boom import at the top save it now we can see elon musk right so you can see um which is awesome so let's go ahead and actually drop another name here so let's go ahead and drop someone else let's say jeff bezos jeff bezos and for jeff this picture will do so jeffy you must type his name exactly jeff reached out to us earlier he said you know make sure you don't put an ugly picture of me so we found a picture and then there you see we've got elon musk and jeff bezos right now for this uh oh somebody said that's probably wrong yeah there we go yeah my bad sorry jeff [Laughter] now what we're gonna do guys for the tinder card right so here we've got the tinder card attend the cards container but what i'm going to actually create another container inside and this one's going to have it's going to say tinder cards um it's going to be tinder cards oops i'm just going to underscore card container this is going to contain all the cards so i'm actually going to go here grab this stuff actually you know for now i'm going to leave it i'm going to say i'll grab it all let's go ahead and chuck it here save boom there we go and now inside of here rather than saying h1 what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to say render a tinder card oops render a tinder card right now this is what we installed earlier so this is a card um and we need to import this from react tinder card so let's go to the top and we're going to say import tinder card from react in the card we installed that not long ago uh and then what we're going to go ahead and do is we're going to go ahead and say um we're going to give this a few things so here's a couple of other properties we're going to give it so i'm going to say tinder card and i'm going to say class name is swipe right we can ignore that for now so we're going to use that later on the key is character name so it's not a great key but it's going to do for now prevent swipe we don't want to swipe up and down so in this case you see i can't i can't actually swipe up in there it doesn't actually let me but if i go left it lets me uh on swipe we're gonna pretty much fire off a function called swiped and on card left screen we have a function called out of frame so this is gonna help you guys out um somebody says i hope i can get a job in 12 days so that i can pay for pwj even if i can't get now once i get a job i'm definitely going to take the course dude my advice for you is either a borrow the money from a friend because that's going to help you out or b use the paypal option when you're paying paypal actually allow you to pay with six months of installments if you use paypal credit stressed oh uh it caught a little bit zero percent interest exactly david yeah whoops yeah yeah so that will actually help you out a lot so now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our tinder cards and here we're going to fix it so we've got a few euros here this is character.name this should be person it's gonna say person like so and then swiped in our frame of functions that we need to go ahead and create so here i'm gonna say um i'm gonna create two functions one called con swiped and one is out of frame so you can see i've just popped them in here one just says somebody left the screen one says removing the name to delete this takes two arguments direction name delete and then set last direction right so here we don't actually need this to be honest we don't actually need this at this point but this is just gonna help us later on with understanding what's going on so right now we're gonna have console log removing and then this one's gonna say somebody left screen and what we see here i can show you guys if we open the inspector and make this full screen as i swipe it says removing elon musk elon musk left the screen removing jeff jeff left the screen it's kind of fun it's nice it's kind of cool right so that works pretty cool now um so just karen sandy says is the course for absolute beginners 100 percent hey same time dude yeah 100. 100 yeah you can pretty much do that um so nikhil says how do we do the paperwork paypal one actually anyone has any clue if you go ahead and hit the pay with paypal option and then when paypal pops up if it's available it will say paypal credit and you i've used paypal credit myself it's really really cool zero percent interest so if you want to split a payment you can go ahead and use paypal credit um so tinder card um inside of the tinder card here we're going to go ahead and add the following so i'm going to add a div all right and then the div is going to have a background image and i'm going to explain this code right here so we're going to change from this to person but what we're doing here essentially we have a div we have a h3 which says person name inside of it and the div is just going to have a class name of a card and the style here has a background image and it's you hear what we're doing is we're actually rendering a piece of text we're just saying that the url is the following and here i could actually use string interpolation instead so i could go ahead and do this this would be a lot cleaner is this the um inline styling yeah this is am i right yep nice exactly this is inline styling and it's going to help you guys out a lot for this for this use case right now i'm a boss says they teach a lot for a low amount of money i can't agree more dude like i think the price is way undervalued right now which is why i personally will be throwing that price up on sunday so make sure and i'll make sure that yeah and exactly make sure you uh go ahead and check it out but nikhil says don't have if you don't have paper credit honestly just use this maybe the three month payment plan but again guys just like do it your own at your own decision like not here to force anyone to join but if you want to grab that offer it's 12 days so what we're going to do now is tinder cards we're going to go ahead and style this right so let's go ahead and do tindercards.css and this is where the sort of styling magic happens so tinder card tinder cards here so firstly for the card itself so i'm going to say target the card and then we're going to say position relative background color of white so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in first and you see nothing really changes yet okay then we're going to say a width of 600 pixels padding of 20 pixels max width 85 view it right so let's go ahead and pop that in okay we've got something showing now and then i'm going to do a height of 50 view height which means 50 of the screen real estate okay it's pretty cool but this is not elon musk this is definitely uh i need to go ahead and grab elon musk there we go that's sandra bullock smash the like button if you like chandra bullock there you go nice you got it uh dead elon there we go oh yeah nice um so now what we're gonna do right so we have the height of 50 pixels yep and then what we're gonna say is add a box shadow so this box shadow you can pretty much go ahead and copy it's just gonna add a nice little subtle box shadow behind and then we're gonna say border radius 20 pixels background size cover background position center this should send to those images so that they're inside full frame there we go that's really nice really clean now what we're going to say is the card container right we're going to target the card container tinder tinder cards card container we'll say display flex justify the content in the center and the margin top from the top should be 10 view height save it and there we go all right so now it's somewhat looking okay right somewhat okay then we're going to target the swipe element which is actually the tinder cards and we're going to say position absolute now that's where some magic actually came in you see that right it's because they're absolutely positioned and they're basically on top of each other now right so this one's actually on top and then what we're going to say is card content has a width and height of 100 save that okay then we're going to go ahead and say card the h3 inside of the card has a position of absolute bottom 0 margin 10 pixels and a color of white and this means jeff bezos now pops up on the bottom over there elon musk is now over there that's really clean and then for info text i don't think we actually use the info text do we um no we don't have any vertex there we go nice um what we're going to do at the end is yeah that's it we have the swipeable cards dude smooth awesome awesome so now what we can do is super clean um yeah um so hajjot singh says once we paid then the classes are free for a lifetime or for some period so i think we actually lost david oh damn it maybe there's a connection issue he'll rejoin in just a sec but guys um yeah to answer your question harjo once you pay for a class once you're actually inside a pwj the whole thing is actually completely included for life so it's going to be there for life everything is going to be completely there for you to access and take your time with even the coaching calls are recorded and then we upload them afterwards so that you can actually go ahead and see them whenever you want so if anything the course is constantly getting added to you as opposed to actually taking anything away from you so it's going to be full of value right now we've lost david he says he froze um hopefully he'll jump on in a sec if he doesn't it's okay but let's go ahead and um he should be joining soon um uh he can just call back david just call back if you're able to see this um and then you can guys jump on that's okay all right now um there we go so now what we're gonna do is we're pretty much gonna we have this so this is awesome everything works as we expected to um and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna basically go ahead and do hey my girlfriend says papa react guys smash the like button if you like the name pop react i think it's stuck pretty well now um and also go ahead and give her some huge love on instagram she's doing some huge stuff right now with her dancing career and would you swipe right on me hell yeah i'll try buying you that's how we actually met guys fun fact for you oh that's how we met we actually swiped right on demo yeah awesome um so let's go ahead and check it out so now guys we want to build the bottom which is this bit right here right juwan says are you okay sonny you look tired today we love you i'm good dude i'm pumped right i'm pumped i know we just ran an absolute massive challenge but the value does not stop going we're gonna keep bringing the fire with you guys um so the next bit right now app.js let's go ahead and build those swipe buttons okay so at the bottom of the page we have swipe buttons over here so i'm going to go ahead and add that end for our build because right now our build doesn't have it so i'm going to go ahead and do the following so say swipe buttons and then i'm going to copy this do this and save and you see it freaks out because we don't have that file so swipe buttons.js boom um but new paragraphs just saying that i'm going to pay for the course but i'm interested in the course i would highly recommend it if you can somewhere or another like just all i will say to that is make sure you take full advantage of discounted price while it's available that's all i can say to you dude because after 12 days the price will go up um so yeah and that's the way we have to do it so that we keep the quality of everyone inside the pwj top notch okay now here i'm going to go ahead and import the correct css file this is going to say swipe buttons dot css and save and it's going to freak out again because it doesn't have a css file so let's go ahead and create that um oh dude i love this look shazeeb saleem says sunny is anywhere i can take direct classes from you because i love the way you teach and your coding concepts a huge love for me bro keep it up um actually that's a very good question so i run coaching calls on every single tuesday i run coaching course um inside the course so you can actually be on there and you can actually learn on those coaching culturals directly with me now i do oneonone coaching feel free to reach out to me whether it's instagram or whether it's on the course um yeah and you can do that nice so now on swipe buttons.js i'm actually going to go ahead and let me go ahead and say uh to david where you are where are you ah there we go so now inside of app.js i'm going to go ahead and say import um swipe buttons so import swipe buttons from swipe buttons there we go save it and that should stop it from freaking out okay now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and um build out this component all right my government says get coaching calls with sonny you won't go with gray and guys honestly like i'm not joking like the people who have actually jumped on those coaching calls have got insane results so like yeah you heard her now we've got a few questions here let's go ahead and answer them quickly before we carry around we've got um oh david's jumped in let's go ahead and answer the call david is back hey what's up david yo nice dude what's up um let's go ahead and check this on the screen there we go nice now uh so so now what we're going to do is guys i'm just going to answer those questions that you asked we've got um how much will it go up guys it goes up by a hundred dollars after this sunday and then it goes up uh then the doors close after 12 days so like really really can't stress enough um and beyond that i'm gonna pretty much carry on coding because let's just drop some more value guys for you guys okay now i'm gonna turn the volume a little bit down because i've seen a few people saying it's gonna be a little bit distracting um yeah give me one sec david i'll share the screen with you there we go awesome dude can you see it all right so now um okay so now what we're going to do is uh yeah so loads of people asking what the link is guys link is in the description like literally first link in the description go ahead and check it out and you guys can pretty much see what we're talking about right now we've got the swipe buttons we're gonna build next so swipe buttons over here let's go ahead and at the bottom of the page let's go ahead and add that in so somebody says uh my government has any of the challenges influenced during coding she's actually a badass dude in coding like i thought i would i will be teaching her fullon react and redux and i'm just gonna overload her with that stuff she's gonna be my righthand man and these uh on these uh on these coding calls uh i'll be awesome david we're gonna have to make room all right let's go so we've got the we're gonna do a bunch of imports over here and then remember guys we wrap the buttons in icon button so what i'm going to do now is actually pop out an entire snippet here of all of these icons wrapped in icon buttons all right now what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to go ahead and say um i'm gonna get rid of this on click because we don't care about that too much to be honest i'm gonna go ahead and say doom doom doom doom get rid of that and then here swipe buttons repeat is the class name and we've got font size of large and now you can see nothing's over here right so you've got each one has its own style it has left star right lightning so that way we can go ahead and style them right as we need to um right now why do i feel after pw get uh guess full the youtube video builds will stop coming dude that's insane that is never gonna happen dude i've literally dropped the fire before this stuff like literally before we open the doors so don't stress we will keep bringing the value okay now muhammad ishaq says i'm leaving bro and asked for my question dude like we got we got so many questions like if it gets buried chill all right so now what we're going to do next is we're going to go ahead and um style this stuff so here we've got everything appropriately named with the classes and we're going to go ahead and do the following swipe buttons and also guys keep it positive in the chat right there's no room for negativity here if you'd literally talk negative i'm gonna block you so let's keep it positive so swipe buttons let's go ahead and say dot swipe buttons um and then here for the buttons i'm gonna say position fixed bottom of 10 view height so it's bottom from the top um it's going to be 10 view height away from the bottom then we're going to say display flex width of 100 and justify content to space evenly now you can see it comes to the bottom really nicely so smash the thumbs up button if that was clean because that adds things really nicely now you can see it does look very clean and then we're going to say for the large buttons we're going to go ahead and say padding of 200 pixels um i think we don't actually need that because we don't actually use large anymore yep so we don't actually need that one let me get rid of that um okay this is awesome dude so hajjot singh says sun you have zero knowledge about all of this stuff i don't know anything about all of this should i enroll in this i'm a little afraid i don't know how to enroll because it's you say it's a hundred dollars but it shows 597 no dude it's actually a discount of a hundred dollars so after sunday that price goes to seven hundred dollars so it'll be 6.97 um and that's what we're trying to say there and i would recommend if you if you have no coding experience then you definitely go ahead and join okay now i just saw somebody else joined uh we have vino djy9 i think if you join then let us know that's awesome uh welcome nice welcome dude nice yeah um so it's a hundred dollar discount until sunday and then the price goes up and it doesn't come back down so i hope that cleared that up for you um so now what we're going to do guys is we're going to target all of the material ui buttons and the way we're going to do that is we say swipe buttons and we say all of the material ui icon buttons root and this is the class name that gets given to it when it joins up but when it goes ahead and um adds it to the file so there you go we can actually add a box shadow and we added a background color of white and you get this nice hovering effect okay now uh pratya yeah this is awesome pratya's head took it for 497 yesterday exactly dude pratya is going ahead and validating what i'm saying right now because yesterday the price was 4.97 we weren't joking when we said it goes up it literally went up but at the end of that live stream like we promised now it's 5.97 after sunday it goes up again and i'm not joking it's not gonna come back down guys so don't mess around don't miss out and i'm saying this because i care guys like i want you guys to value from the amount of love and respect that we put into that course um it's gonna change your life right now for the rest of the um classes i want different colors so i went ahead and done is basically targeted the rest of them so this is what i just copied in right here and you can pause and you can pretty much copy this code out and we've added three view width height three view it to each of them a padding and we've changed the colors so you see and then we've got each of these individual colors and now it gets a lovely tinder refill okay so it's got that nice little tinder feel to it nice everything looks pretty clean okay so that's super like jeff bezos yeah that's super like jeff bezos dude that's awesome right now at this point rather than pulling right so right now this this ui is hard coded okay so it's hard coded so if we actually go back to tinder cards we can see that i've hard coded the values here we have elon musk we have jeff bezos but everything is not you know i want this to be qui like this is not so wono jung says i took it 597 today but no regrets let's go dude that's what i'm talking about welcome to the family wow appreciate you joining and i look forward to seeing you in those coaching calls that is insane happy birthday my hush as well it says his birthday today well happy birthday dude birthday go ahead and join pwj and we'll celebrate nice yeah i also want to address one more comment uh ashutosh says i started angular today and now i love react even more i love that comment dude that's insane that's literally yeah uh oh patia says i think last time it went up 2000 dude i'm telling you this price is going up like this course is way under price right now and like i personally am going to like bloody bump this price up because it it literally it's not fair on the people in the community that they're not getting that like honestly we like to keep it high quality people inside right so invest in yourself and make sure you go and do that right so uh link is in the description if you're confused about that so now with that said uh bishop says hi johnny i joined uh sunny i joined pwj essay looking forward to seeing you and coaching us hey dude what's up welcome welcome to welcome to the family bro nice david will be helping me with tomorrow's coaching call and yeah that's awesome dude thank you so much right so now what we're gonna do is david i think at this point right let's go ahead we can go and build a back end dude and let's pull this from the back end right um so deb yeah dude right so everyone if you need to grab your water this is what i promise you it's water um stretch out get ready for this and let's go ahead and david what run run everyone through so we have 400 people watching right now let everyone know what we're going to be doing okay so now we will be creating a node.js application um and we will create a server an express server which will connect to mongodb grab all the data that is currently hard coded and you can see it on your screen and we will be putting that data into a mongodb database and we will pull it back and that's the thing that we will be rendering out right right right who's ready yeah drop a comment who's excited dude if you're ready drop a comment exactly a roop just dropped a donation thank you so much dude you've got a right to jobs including the amazon clown in my portfolio i got a reply from the recruiter hey maybe would get the interview call soon dude love that let us know how that goes and yeah we appreciate you also marcin goes backhand yes exactly amazing hey samuel just joined he said see you guys tomorrow in pwj excited to join the team nice dude welcome welcome bro insane okay right so with that said david run me through it what are we doing okay so first up we will need a brand new folder uh we will be wrapping our application into a completely different folder and that's the one that we will be uploading right okay so if you could go ahead and just create a new folder called i don't know um tinder backend right so let me go ahead and check right now i've got tinder clone right here so i'm going to create a folder and this is outside so meet hey what's up dude he says yeah the super chat for this amazing community we have made together sameed guys is insane he is based in boston he landed a sixfigure job as a developer and it's just what i'm saying yeah and that was for a company called mathworks um so insane stuff bro good to see you and appreciate your donation hamito gaming says hello sunny me too i've joined the course two days ago i'm really excited and look forward to it insane love that uh welcome to the family himito and if anyone else wants to join david where can they go to the description and just click the very first link exactly link in the description hit it go ahead and join and i will see you in the course um nice exactly so what are we doing david so we've got the two folders here so i'm going to go ahead and create a photo what should i call it um tinder backhand i think it's in the background it's very descriptive right so we have the tender backhand and i'm in the terminal right now i'm gonna make sure everyone can see this and he goes uh you should be changing your uh folder to the tinder backend nice summit thank you so much dude nice um preparing for react.js interview and your team helping out a lot guys i'm sorry i keep interrupting with this stuff but like it's insane like it really really is cool to see you guys are actually benefiting from the stuff we bring and if you guys are loving it all we do is appreciate if you can just smash the like button right we're almost near a thousand i think we can break it today let's carry on so david yeah you said we need to be in the correct directory right so right now i see we're inside of tinder clone so we're going to do cd dot dot and that should take us up a level if i do ls now we see two folders so where do i need to go so now you need to type in cd and copy paste in their backend all right so tinder backend exactly that will put you in the correct folder okay nice and if you want to turn on git version control you can just go ahead and type and get in it okay so that will actually go ahead and initialize git okay exactly we will need it uh later by the way okay and now you can go ahead and type in mpm init it's going to throw you a couple of questions uh regarding your node.js application right so uh just such as so guys yeah what's that mpm init right exactly all right so noncapitals so it shouldn't mean capitals with some screaming at you guys npm in it and that will go ahead and set up your package.json and get everything set up so npm and you can see when we do that what happens you see a lot of questions and and all those stuff that i've never ever read yeah so now i can go ahead and hit enter right in the background is pretty good let's go ahead and do that version one okay enter um description if you want to go ahead and type in something uh you can go uh for entry point we usually do uh server.js okay so server.js not index.js right server.js okay exactly um test command you can skip that yep then guys just want to stress out that point right here we have server dot js so we wrote that we said server oops server dot js okay you want to type that in when it comes up and that's very important um nice let's carry on david test come on exactly uh you can just go and and hit return a couple of times until author comes up and you can type in your name if you want to but it's not necessary and it's gonna ask if it's okay you can just go ahead and hit yes okay so i can just hit enter yeah exactly exactly and let's go ahead and check yeah oh nice we got this package.json okay exactly and that created uh a package.json for us okay now under uh main server.js you can type in type module so that it will elevate the whole thing to es6 ver es6 type of code right so let's just explain very clearly what we're doing here so guys whenever you're coding on the back end right whenever you're doing node.js you need to remember that things like import so stuff like that we're used to this kind of syntax importing this is es6 right this is like a latest sort of javascript sort of stuff now in order to get that on node.js node.js by default doesn't have support for like um import and things like that you have to write const a variable name and then you have to write equals require but we don't want to do that we want to have that nice syntax that juicy syntax so how do we go ahead and add that david so here what do i do you can just type in uh type type exactly and we're doing type oops type and column and module module there we go exactly and just a comma and one thing you need to add uh is actually right under uh right in the script okay that you want to add a start script right okay so i'm gonna add a start script yup and that's going to be node space server.js nice okay so we've got node space server.js we added this line in here and we added this one here type module okay exactly save on that nice now what i'm going to do guys is let's go ahead and create that server.js right of course nice so is this our server david is this where our whole backend is going to be exactly this is the only file i mean not only but this is where all the logic will go okay we will need one more file but this is where all the logic goes so first up uh we need to install a couple of dependencies right okay so let's open up our terminal go ahead and let's type in npm i or npm install and let's type in express and mongoose express space mongoose that will install both express and mongoose right exactly yeah yeah and we can just wait a little while it sets itself up but in the meantime we can go ahead and create our mongodb database so if we want to do that uh let's go to um mongodb.com okay so i'm gonna go over to mongodb.com also guys if you haven't seen we have the early bird special pricing um we launched proper javascript yesterday and the price went up yesterday so today it's only going to be available at the special price you see at right now so the early bird special price it goes up on sunday it does not come back down it goes up on sunday won't come back down and in 12 days time the doors to profit with javascript close okay so once they close it's going to be closed forever you guys won't be able to get back in after that so don't miss out save yourself some money and really go ahead and join now ankit raj went ahead and joined he says sup sunny i heard a lot about pwj and i thought i can't find any reason not to join the course to be honest i'm really excited to be with you guys over in bwj hey welcome to the community oh welcome nice love that way david what are we doing okay so now we are going to mongodb.com okay and essentially it means that our database is going to be hosted online by default we don't have to worry about hosting our database and stuff like that and you can just go ahead and sign in or in the right in the middle if you don't have an account you can just go ahead and hit start free okay so i'm gonna click on sign in yeah and i'm going to log in because i've actually created an account so you guys can just hit sign in and it's free to do that i'm going to go ahead and jump into my account i think i use this one where was he oh no it wasn't that one um let's go ahead and try my other one karin 87 yes once the door is closed it's not going to open up again for a few months um and it's we do that so that we keep the quality of the students high and we only bring in the people that want to learn and want to invest in their future okay so that's why we do that with profit javascript also if you find the course for anything less than a thousand dollars jump and buy it dude because that is a still it will go up over that very shortly so the early bird special price is only temporarily it goes until sunday sunday we increase the price and then in 12 days we close the doors to the program right so mongodb david what am i seeing here exactly so currently you are seeing one of our earlier projects but we will create a brand new one so up at the top on the left side uh there is that little drop down if you click yeah that's the one and you can go ahead and just hit create new project go ahead right uh that will set up a completely new project uh i think we got calvin just dropped a donation thank you dude whoa thank you david what do you say so i love the sony david duo keep these builds coming we appreciate them i tuned in to show some love and support still working on the amazon clone dude go ahead finish that up you can crush it let's go and we appreciate you thank you so much i always see you in all the streams so love that you show up every time dude also somebody says why mongodb and not firebase so we actually do build do we've done this build in firebase today we're showing you how to power the entire thing using the man stack so really really go ahead and check it out yeah what we're doing now trying to keep add you as much value as possible so we currently just uh gonna go ahead and name the project somehow uh we can go ahead and say it in the clone yeah that's perfect and now let's go ahead and hit next this is where you could add the new members if you're working in a team um yep you can add add them at your team but we're so it's only you so you can just go ahead and hit uh create project right yep okay okay so create project so exactly it's gonna circle a bit and it's gonna load um once it's done hit the build a cluster yeah right in the middle okay build a cluster yeah yes um and you can just go with the free version okay we don't need any more anything more than that and you can leave everything just the way it is right so it's perfectly set up we don't need anything more than that uh you can just go ahead and hit the build cluster create cluster i can see because of the banner in the bottom right oh nice dude singh says my father too is watching your video i'm insisting him to join the course i really want to sunny study with you guys um what i will say to that is if you're watching this right now jojo's dad hey nice to meet you nice to see you dude and one thing i'll say is that price that we're offering right now is an absolute still it's an offer which is only available until sunday there is a huge amount of value inside that course and once it goes up on sunday we're not going to reduce that price ever again right so it's not going to come back down and then in 12 days time guys we're actually going to close the doors which means that the actual opportunities to join will no longer be available so please please please for your own benefit save yourself a couple of dollars right now and hit the link in the description and join if you're on the fence right um we saw somebody say um edwin ceram says can i pay for bwgs installments yes dude you can completely 100 you can do that right um and let's go ahead and check this out so now what we're going to do here david uh nothing we can leave everything just the way it is okay um it's free so you can just go ahead and hit the green button in the in down there okay so create cluster exactly yeah yeah and it's gonna take a couple of minutes uh usually more than three so we don't have to worry about it for now we can go back and create our very first api endpoint let's do it who's excited guys drop a comment smash the thumbs up button guys if you're excited for that right exactly with that said guys what we're going to do now david so now we are going to import our express package which we have just installed right before uh creating our database so let's go ahead and type in import express from express and mongoose from mongoose exactly and now actually let's line up how our application is going to look like so we will uh add a couple of comments okay so the first one is going to be app.config nice then we will add the middle layers right yep okay and then we will configure the database so dbconfig then api endpoints and we will add a listener dbconfig api endpoints and listener listener okay so this is that same technique that we do earlier um and david i just brought a question on for you um somebody actually asked you david started coding in march how did he become so good wow david go ahead and tell them well i put in crazy amount of hours like there were several nights where i was up till like 4 00 a.m or or so so yeah i i was working crazy hard to get this far right no that's the only way it works did you join david uh pwj in the court like were you part of pwj or not exactly i joined the after the very very first um challenge back in april or march um and i actually missed out on the deal so it went a hundred dollars up before i joined okay yeah now that same mistake have you made back the money that you that you used yes definitely okay definitely all right dope dude goes up on sunday i'm just i'm just replying to a comment there we go oh okay that's harjo thing says uh one thing i want to ask can i join this tomorrow or is it compulsory to join now no dude as long as you join before sunday there's no rush like isn't just sunday that price goes up it won't come back down so something to bear in mind um okay so now we've got the app config now david how do i do this now we need to actually create an instance so we can do that by typing in const app equals express okay and two brackets okay so that will actually create our instance and next line we need to uh define the port where our application is going to listen so we need to type in poor const port equals process dot environment dot once yeah what's up yep so so i'm just going to pop that in there so we're going to say cons por equals processor environment report or running it on 8001 right exactly right yeah i just want to mention um edwin saram says i want to join asap uh how do i pay the storm is dude just go hit the link in the description scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see this option here to pay with a payment plan just go ahead and hit that join now on the payment plan option and that's how you go ahead and pay an installment dude so yeah hopefully that helps let's carry on dude yeah let's carry on so we will now go ahead and define our very first api endpoint uh for now we don't need to worry about middlewares and dbconfig so we can just go ahead and type in um under api endpoints uh app.get okay so here going to say um wait an api endpoints right so here yeah yeah okay so we will yeah we will do app again and yeah and we're just going to go with a slash because this is going to be the root uh or the base url actually and we will have a callback function with a request and a response parameter and let's just create a an arrow function which will set the result or response status of 200 response status is 200 which means okay which means okay and we will just going to send hello world right hello world hello hello clever programmers hey let's do that dude hello clever programs that way you know it's working exactly okay it's going to be super helpful later on and now we need to add the listener okay um which which is literally just one line of code we will uh say app dot listen yup so app.net yeah and open up a bracket yeah um which would say port and it will have another uh callback function and we just want a console.log listening on localhost and the board and actually use backtext because we will use uh string concatenation okay so listening on localhost of course we're going to use our port right yes that's correct okay and that is pretty much it it should be now working so if you go ahead and uh start up our application using nodemon okay uh it's actually an another mpm uh package so guys if you don't have it you can just go ahead and install it by typing in mpm install node mod sudo npm install oh yeah except exactly that's g node mod that's correct because we want to install it globally yeah which means that it doesn't matter what project you're in nodemon is basically like a tool that you're going to be running on your terminal so we want to install it globally for everything for any project that you want to have so you're going to have to run this command right here i'm actually going to go ahead and double check that i've done it so i'll do it for you guys as well i'm not sure what's happening in this computer there we go so i think this is with this pseudo and sg it will install globally so you don't have to worry about it ever right yep nice okay so now how do i get this thing started david so uh so now let's go ahead and type in uh nodemon server.js and it should be up and running okay and you can see here guys this is actually saying the esm module loader is experimental that's because we added that es6 functionality over here and then where it says listening on localhost 8001 is when we actually did this over here right exactly nice exactly all right so now we have our very first api endpoint uh let's go ahead and let's connect to our database so if we can go back to mongodb.com i think it's always good to show them that it's actually running oh that is correct yeah so we actually have like so now we have it running yeah you can go ahead and type in localhost 801 okay so localhost 8001 is what we chose to run it on oops 8001 and if we do this by default it will go to the forward slash route so let's go ahead and hit enter hey there we go dude nice there we go exactly nice nice yeah so now our health check api is working awesome dude so with that done now let's go ahead and let's connect to our database okay all right and what do we do now so we now go to mongodb.com back to our database hopefully our cluster is now built up and is working yep yeah there we go and on the left hand side yep on the left hand side there is a database access and a network access button okay uh so let's go with the database access first okay so let me go ahead and click on database access there we go yeah exactly and now we will just create a database user so just go ahead and type hit the green button in the middle okay add new database user done and all you need to worry about is the two uh text box in the middle so let's actually add the name which we can call uh i don't know tinder client or admin it's called admin yeah okay and you can go ahead and auto generate a secure password right i'm going to show you guys because we don't really care at this point for this one so we're going to have this but make sure you copy this copy this guy because once you lose this you can't get it back exactly and this is the only time that you will see it so make sure to save it in somewhere safe and let's just go ahead and add the user with the green button down there okay add user let's do it boom we have a user nice there we go and now let's go to network access okay okay and add an ip address uh to the allow list okay uh let's actually allow uh access from anywhere we don't want to mess around with uh anything else and let's just confirm it done now guys that's not something you want to do in like a professional environment we're just doing that because we're demoing this so it's going to be something which we just don't want we want to demo it right now so we don't really care about the security but something to note do not do that in professional environments yeah and and actually drop it in the comments if you're interested how to secure stuff like this um if there is interest we can definitely do a video on it exactly right yeah okay now let's go back to clusters on the upper lefthand side okay um clusters on the lefthand side do yep um and under the connect button yep now we should be did you click it oh you said okay yeah yeah just go ahead and yeah sorry uh just click it and in the middle uh we want to connect our application so just go ahead and click the middle one and that is the that is going to be the link or or the connection url which we will be using to connect to our database now actually uh notice that there is the password right in the middle of your screen that's where you will have to uh paste in the password that you just copied and the other one is db name that's where you will hard code and and define what you want to call your database right right so at this point guys copy this okay go to your code go up to app config over here right const and do this right now right connection url and just paste it as a uh do back yeah and then here where we have password go ahead and that one that we copied earlier go ahead and chuck that here so i'm gonna go ahead and do this you don't have to do it like oh yeah so i mean you don't have to yeah sorry what am i doing yeah oops yeah too much too much gets carried away you know yeah yeah and what about this david tired yeah what about this one david um we can call it tinderdb or some something whatever so this one this is actually the database name and this will actually create a database based on what we add here so let's call this one uh tinder db well let's just do intended db like this okay yeah that's right and now let's go to app uh sorry config and that is where we will actually uh connect to our database right okay so let's type in uh mongoose.connect um mongoose.connect uh okay and connect mongoose.connect and inside the brackets that's where you add the connection url right and actually add the comma right after connection url and we need to pass in a couple of parameters to our connection uh if you could just copy paste them in yeah so these are actually parameters that are used uh to make our connection very smooth uh this is just because mangoes is under development and constant evolvation so that's why we need uh we need to add these okay all right um with that done um let's go ahead and create our uh database schema okay right so a database schema is like a model right yeah exactly uh so we need to like create a new folder okay so what do we need do we need the photo can we just do it here oh we can just do it right there okay so let's create a screen for a file what's this one going to be called uh db cards okay db cards all right this can be a js file and this is basically gonna outline the structure of the the the cards inside the database right the tinder cards exactly exactly and now let's import mongoose once again and we will be creating a new card schema so let's type in const card schema equals mongoose ducks language dot schema go ahead and i'll pop a snippet in here guys so we have the card schema right here and we've been saying mongoose schema and we're passing in this is a structure right here right exactly this is how our database uh fields are gonna be built up right yeah and now let's go ahead and export default uh this whole thing right all this stuff oh nice we actually got a um this is awesome dude victor bravo says i like victor brother he goes to donation and he goes uh angler dev here just passing by and loving react hey i love that dude thanks for watching that's insane thank you corey also jumped back in he said dedicated appreciate you guys keep the energy up that grind heart you guys are changing the world one programmer at a time that's what we're talking about dude whoa that's exactly the kind of energy love you corey all right let's go ahead and so image url okay exactly and now just let's go and and export uh the whole schema so export default uh mangostop model and this is where we would define the collection name so okay uh remember if you're coming from a sql database a sql background um there is something called tables now this is the exact same thing uh it's just called collections right now okay so i wouldn't say it's the same thing guys uh so in sql you have tables and that sort of structure right and in nosql you have this collection uh document collection document so that's just to sort of simplify so let's quickly draw it down here so in no in nosql you pretty much have this collection uh document and collection then you have an array of documents right and then you have an array and then that can that can also have a collection of its own and that can have an array of documents and basically the pattern goes on right you can keep on doing this right that's this is a nosql database this one this structure right try not to confuse it with sql it's a very very different outline and and i'd just completely separate the two that will help you out when it comes to building this uh ashavia oh nice dude we got a donation whoa thank you and check it out whoa amazing love the value uh yes because just a few damn sonny how are you feeling today hey he says love the body that we added in the skills in just a few days time thank you dude uh how are you feeling today yeah i'm feeling a little bit better still a little bit rough but we'll get there dude with you guys energy it's it's it's impossible to not get better dude so let's keep going strong nice nice okay so let's pop in uh some kind of collection name that you want to call it i called it i actually personally like cards okay so this cards cards and we need to pass in the card schema right after okay so i do cards like this right exactly and with that done we pretty much have our uh database structure built up okay and now let's go back and actually create our first uh endpoint that will actually add the data into our database right okay so we need to type in app.post and post is a uploading method okay for apis we have different yeah exactly requests right we have get we have posts we have put update all those ones right yeah exactly good so let's go and type in up that post okay yep and let's define an endpoint which could like i don't know uh tinder cards okay or just cards yep yep and it will have a callback function with a request on the response parameter okay so we've got a request and a response response yep and first up we want to save the uh request body into a variable right so let's type in cod db cards or db card so we can say const db card equals request request the body okay exactly and before we go any further let's go up and import our database structure so let's type in import cards from uh from db cards there we go exactly go ahead okay now let's go down there and type in cards.create so that will and that is going to be a function that creates the creates a new document right so cars are create we pass in db card okay and this will have a callback function with an error and the data um parameters right and now we want to handle the errors so if there is an error okay uh we will say response that status uh set to 500 which means internal server error and and we send the error back right yep else we will say response dot status 201 which means uh created okay right so that means we successfully created our uh stuff and we just send back the data okay what we just created right yep okay and to actually see that it uh does work we need to define another endpoint which will uh download the data from the database so let's actually create another endpoint okay so post usually to push information into into our database and get is to get the information right exactly so we will type in app.gap okay that means downloading data right um the endpoint could be the same the cards there we go yeah okay all right and it's gonna be almost the exact same so you can just uh copy paste like almost everything okay um request response there we go and yeah that part and what we need to change there are two pieces of stuff that we need to change the first is cards uh we do not want to create a new card we want to find a card right and we do not need the db card right there right after okay and we can just delete that and leave it right there and the other thing we want to change is the response status upon success and we want to send set that to 200. right so with this we will be retrieving every single thing uh from that collection from the database that we just created right okay so now we can actually open up a postman if you want to and check out all these stuff nice before we do that luis pedro just come flying in five pounds super chat you guys do an excellent job keep it going i am a reactive uh github louise the dev everyone go ahead and check him out he says all the best thank you so much guys uh thank you you say that david what's up anything to say to that oh great job and thank you so much yeah thank you so much go ahead and follow him yeah go ahead and check him out louise the dev exactly nice yeah and also i see in the chat a lot of you guys are saying um can't pay this much in one go i really want to join is there help and there's not a helpline guys but there is an email there's an email you can actually go ahead and email but what i'm trying to tell you guys is the price that we're offering right now is a offer which means that it's not permanent it means on um it's a funny comment um i did well and then i it's an offer which means that on sunday the price goes up okay if you want to do um split payments and this and that everything is on the page link is in the description go ahead and check it out but beyond that guys um yeah i i can't really say much more than that so let's go ahead and carry on exactly let's go so let's open up a postman to check out our uh api if they are working correctly right now to show you guys quickly postman is something where you would that you can use to actually interact with servers back in sort of stuff so go ahead download postman it is a excellent tool for when you're creating backend servers and stuff it's free you can do that go ahead and download it and then let's go ahead and open postman right so it's just loading up right now it should be on our screen in just a second there we go nice awesome so once it's open okay uh we can pretty much just type in the whole uh url that we just created so what we will be doing is uh let's just type in uh localhost https let's test it first so let's go ahead and hit send okay and we should see hello clever programmers so that works there we go that's your sanity that means that you're at the right place everything's good exactly and now we can add the endpoint which is slash tinder slash cards right okay and before we go any further let's uh no it's not going to work i mean yeah it's retrieved that there is nothing in the database okay it's actually working yeah it's just showing nothing because there we have a pretty empty uh database but to actually add data into the database we need to set the method to post right yeah and we need to add a body which is just right under the url over here okay exactly yeah and just uh hit raw in the middle and on the right hand side let's actually uh yeah change it to json because we will be adding the italian json format so now um you can go ahead and copy paste the hardcoded uh thing from our code okay also i just want to see alexandra's tuition says why not use the rest vs code extension dude i didn't know there was one i didn't know either yeah let's go check that wait rest um vs rest client is that the one rest api let's go ahead and check this one this has a million down oh damn dude okay it's pretty cool i would definitely go ahead and check this out afterwards with david and we if it's good we can go ahead and show you guys how to use that that's awesome thank you for that yeah definitely yeah nice um david also i want to mention um before we do any of this stuff we forgot to add something very important ah that's true i always forget it so let's go back to middlewares that was actually naveen naveen ts actually pointed that out thank you dude yeah oh great job thank you so we need to add the middleware um which is app.use okay and in the brackets we would just add express dot json okay right right okay nice oh nice it's only so dope it's like having postman already in react oh sure i'm going to check that out guys 100 i checked out um oh nice okay so you can just go ahead and copy paste the uh hardcoded thing we have in our front and right uh yeah i actually want to add one thing here guys we want to add cause to our application so of course that's just later down the road but okay uh yeah but we might as well i think we should add it now no okay yeah we can we can add it definitely so let's go ahead cut our app here and then let's go ahead and do mpmi so i'm going to go ahead and make sure that's visible for you guys mpi cores and guys cause is basically adding headers to every request right and it's basically a security prerequisite especially when you have things deployed online so what we're going to do at the top is we're going to have import cause from cause so import cause from cause cause like that and then what we're gonna do is here we're gonna go ahead and say app dot use course like this and that will actually go ahead and do everything that we need and then we need to make sure we start our app again nodemon server.js just make sure you do that and that will actually get everything up and running again exactly yeah all right so now we can can we go ahead and add everything yep okay so let's copy paste the hardcoded elon mask in here so i'm just gonna go grab that from our code so tinder cards let's grab this stuff right here yeah and let's actually make sure that we use the exact same field names right so name and i don't remember what we defined in our uh deep cards.js file right so this is actually this is something which we could do man like i don't think we should make it matches as such let's go with this right now and then what we can do is oh it should match so it should match yeah what am i saying it should yeah it should match yeah because i was going to say we would pull in okay now it should be url image i think so inside of db cause it was this one image url right yeah so this one should be image url image url and also guys this has to be add the double quotes yep double quote it up there we go there we go and this was just freaking out nice um let's actually click beautify oh it's because the comma at the very end of the link i think um uh of elon musk's photo link um boom that i think so um i think it's maybe because we haven't we need an array outside of this yeah could be there we go there we go guys that's nice this is not going to be an array there we go okay okay cool and let's hit send and see what we got now this should be pushing this into the db so these two things into db right yeah exactly send let's see what we got there we go nice so you can see here guys it says status 201 created if that says 500 then everything just blew up no i'm joking it just went wrong don't freak out just debug it and you can figure out um but yeah 201 everything was added david how can we test that we this is actually in the db now we just need to uh change the method back to get okay and we can completely forget about the body uh because get requests do not have uh oops i'm sorry uh get because requests do not have body you can leave it there if you want to it will be totally ignored okay and just go ahead and hit send once again boom and nice dude it says 200 okay and we've got those two fields we've got the name imagery that's perfect dude exactly let's go ahead and hook it up to our front end guys i think david deserves a round of applause for that like he absolutely crushed that guys amazing job dude amazing job smash the like button if you learned something new right thank you nice and everyone's saying bring on the air horn let's go carry on okay now let's go ahead and hook it up to our front end okay all right so tinder cards where do i go david yep um just right under the uh use date that you defined right okay so you can just i don't know we could actually do it with an axios right so let's go ahead and add a new package so npm install axios if we could run it in the terminal okay make sure you're in the correct terminal so let's go back to our frontend terminal right ahead and we can cut the server right now and let's go ahead and see it says tinder clone to prove that you guys are in the right one and then we're gonna do mpmi axios right exactly yeah and once it's done we will be creating a an axios instance it's basically axios is basically a package that will make http requests super simple right so we create an axios.js right exactly let's go ahead and create an axios.js okay and in the axios.js we will import the axios from axios done done and let's create a instance uh by saying const instance equals axios.create nice oops axios.create nice yup and in there we want to add the parameters and we will only use the base url okay parameter which will be localhost 8001. all right so make sure your http for central just localhost uh 8001. so that's our local right exactly yeah yeah and let's export it okay oh nice my dudes just said hey i just got into pwj let's crush over there guys welcome brother oh nice welcome awesome nice awesome all right um so let's go back okay uh you're just exporting okay uh now let's go back to our tinder cards um okay dot js file yup can i get rid of this now um hardcoded stuff completely completely we will not use that anymore we should just maybe make this an empty array to begin with right yeah exactly that's that's perfect okay and right under that uh we will do something called a use effect okay use effect which is if you're coming from a classbased uh background uh it's actually the component that mount right right so it's actually uh oh we just got another person in pwj nice dude uh he goes jc techdev i just jumped into pwd it's fun nice dude welcome to the community link in the description if you want to be just like this guy come on and join in nice right so uh yeah so use effect guys for those of you guys who aren't familiar with this uh you want to add these empty brackets in here they're very important it means that what this essentially does is when tinder cards loads when the tinder cards component loads it'll run this piece of code once and not run it again okay now this is important because if you add anything inside of these square brackets say for example add name in whenever the variable name changes it's actually going to refire this code so it's a very important snippet of code it's a it's a hook which means we need to import it from react so let's go ahead and import boom and then carry on david what are we doing now yeah and actually inside there we will be creating an async function okay so if you could add the async up there or right there okay okay um and we will call it fetch data right uh and inside there we will create a request or or actually it's going to be a variable so const request uh equals evade excels.get so i need to import uh do i need to import the module axis or our local axios the local that you just created so it will be the uh dot forward slash axios one yeah exactly make sure to uh add the full uh dot forward slash uh right before it because if you don't do it it will import the x uh the module and the whole application is gonna crash and freak out yeah so this is very important guys so right here this here is going to be the reason why a lot of people probably bug out um this right here you need that dot forward slash okay exactly whoa thank you thank you antonio cortez thank you so much so await and we will say uh axios.get okay and now we will need to call our endpoint right so forward slash tinder slash cards okay and that's because the base url was already set up inside of axios.js right exactly yeah that's right and we will just need to set the set people to request that data okay so set people so this variable right here let's set that to whatever the request.data comes back as okay exactly and then we need to actually go ahead and say uh fetch the data yeah nice and david this is actually how we if you ever need to do an async function inside of a user effect this is the pattern that everyone actually has to do and it's very very powerful guys um so make sure you do this if you if you ever have any kind of async work inside of a use effect yeah exactly right and because it's added to the uh to the people actually it should be working oh nice that's it out no dude let's go okay so um let's go ahead and refresh uh oh okay one sec this is actually am i running it on okay i'm not running it so this might be npm npm stop boom yeah that's not a bad thing yeah i think we actually should be running it on 3 000 maybe i'm running on 3001 um we'll see anyway here yep so i'm already running something on the 3000 i'm going to go ahead and run on 3001 let's go ahead and wait for it tense suspense squares suspense will the development server start oh man god damn it hey let's go but david what is happening hold on oh damn it oh damn right what's going on there are two cards which is good okay so we've got the cards let's debug this dude let's go all right so first thing you should do guys is actually go ahead and console log your people right because we want to see what's inside of the variable so let's go ahead and check it out i'm going to go f12 open the inspector hopefully we can find this bug dude open up the array okay this is what we saw came back from the db this is pretty good right you know what the issue is oh maybe let's go back to our front end let's go ahead let's go see where we render it out we've got um person dot url oh i see dude is it there we go this right here should be image url right that's it nice okay so if i change this to image u r o now guys this is the moment of truth now guys do you think this will work let us know in the comments right now all right let us know in the comments right now do you think this is going to work as soon as i hit save it's pretty tense like yeah like i don't know man this is like the final step everything counts on this david how confident do you feel right now that this is gonna work i don't know man with this background music it gets quite tense right even i'm like oh god damn it is it gonna work so everyone's saying no no someone says yes all right guys i'm gonna hit save let's go let's refresh hey hey apparently i'm jeff bezos but let's go let's go guys i'm gonna swipe right on myself right here hey we got elon musk kazi in the house david done that didn't you oh right that was actually on the oh nice dude hey that's awesome guys smash the thumbs up button if that was pretty fun i think that was pretty fun dude we've got elon musk and we've got i didn't mean to swipe right on kazi there [Laughter] there we go guys that was insane that was awesome stuff david do you want to give them a summary of what just happened so basically what happened uh super quickly is that we will we were rendering out the wrong uh we were trying to get the data from the uh url field but since there is no url field uh it didn't work yeah but then when we changed it to img url uh it started working because there is a field like that yeah and we needed to use img url uh because we defined it it uh in the database structure but if you want to go ahead and redefine uh the url yeah and reload the data into your database it will uh go ahead and work with the url right nice uh so we just needed to match the field names let's show them that we're not lying right let's go to the actual db let's go over here let's close this up let's go to collections which is where our database stuff lives um it's loading the databases right here so you've got tinder db which is that database that we told you guys about so we have the two objects collection nice and let's go ahead and actually copy the image url no no no no you can just rewrite the name i think oh can we i think so i was just going to check that the image okay so we've got kaizi's image nice let's go ahead and actually yeah you're right dude let's go ahead and change this to rafa khazi yep and on the right hand side you can uh oh that's all that experience is a terrible dude what the hell oh right we're in the way as well let me go ahead and hide us there we go update dude that's in that's horrible what the hell man this is why firebase i like five hit right you can do it with firebase as well yeah and it works the same so here what am i going to do i'm going to go ahead and hit instead of jeff bezos i am sunny sango aka sunny boy aka papa react smash the thumbs up button pop up react there we go um hit that save oh god damn i have to click that update button weirdly placed over there right now if i go back to our code over here and i refresh hey dude sunny saying there we go okay papa react and then if we go ahead and swipe right we got rafikaze let's go guys that's awesome i love that david that was really really cool uh guys if you found that was interesting if you found that you learned something new we actually went ahead and built out a full mann stack build and we're going to show you guys how to deploy all of this stuff right now so if you're excited for that smash the thumbs up if you've been watching and you're enjoying the content so far david let's go ahead and deploy this on uh the back end on heroku and the front end on firebase let's go so with that said uh let's go to heroku.com okay so i'm going to heroku right now and this is to deploy the node.js back in right that is correct okay and you can just go and hit hit the first one and you can sign up just like this or you can go ahead and log in if you already have an account nice i apparently do nice okay and it's going to take a little time to load i think you have hey david checkpoint hello nice dude we got hungry in the house hey let's go nice okay so the thing is uh you reached five builds on heroku that means you would need to add your credit card which i think you don't want to do when you're live so you can just delete one of the uh builds settings settings and um down there yeah boom okay you're getting punched right let's go ahead and just like completely just like boom everything's gone right thanks carry on david okay now let's hit the new button upright yep and create a new app there we go um let's just i don't know tinder clone is the perfect name uh i guess it's a tinder backend right oh yeah that's correct yeah so tinder back in the united states create the app yeah create the app okay and okay so down there we actually see a couple of uh commands that we can use to uh push our stuff to heroku okay uh or we could go the boring way which is connecting to our github and it's gonna do it for us for us but let's just not do it because we are become backend developers and we like to use terminal right okay so let's open up the terminal which we are using to uh act on the back end right okay so that's number two and oh let me go ahead and drop this sound a bit there we go and then come here so i'm gonna cancel that server with ctrl c and now we've got the terminal down here i'm just gonna make sure it's visible for you guys and what am i doing david so now uh i think you already signed into heroku uh it's gonna be the if you haven't it's gonna be the exact same stuff with uh as with firebase so it's gonna open up a browser window and you can just go ahead and sign in you're getting echo i'm going to turn your voice a little bit down maybe um oh sorry yeah i think that i think that might be better now guys let us know in the comments if that's better whoops actually i i lower the volume of my headphones i think it uh went in there right that's a nice okay so now we've got the terminal up what am i doing yeah uh so now you will be saying get in it you already said it so you need to copy paste the herokugen remote dash 8 in the back end it's the third row that's the one yeah copy and paste boom copy paste that's it um and it should link your project to your uh project right and with that done uh let's go ahead and commit our code with saying git add dot yeah so get okay so now i can commit like no more so i can say get add dot and check that all the apps uh to check that everything's added correctly i'm gonna get status and we've got everything including the node modules is that okay oh that's not okay we forgot to add the get ignore file okay oops so now i can go inside of tinder back end and i can add a gig norway i can say uh boom and what do i add in node modules just type in node modules and save the whole thing and then shit's going to go crazy so we're going to say git add i think i think get remove dot and then we do oh no oh yeah right get remove is it get removed don't get add status oops oh god damn it i hate when i do that okay so now i still added the no module so um i can't remember the command forum guys let us know in the in the comments right now if um uh if how do you i can't i always forget this one i'm going to go ahead and find it if someone can drop in the comments how like to go ahead and get rid of this stuff for the git add or get add get remove i'm sure this would get removed uh i always forget this stupid command um okay how do i undo a get ad yeah so david your voice is echoing okay so david's going down um sorry about that guys uh i need to upgrade my microphone dude you can do get reset okay let's just do a get reset get reset boom there we go get status there we go okay so get add or get this let's see now yep there we go now we go there we go that's nice oh okay now that's the one that we wanted so okay now we just need to add the comment message so we can do get git comment does say thank you so much um prince by the way uh i saw you added a nice little donation thank you for that dude and he says hey sonny this is my small donation in seven days my first upwork project complete and i'll donate more money dude that's insane well done for landing and upwork and uh honestly all we do is we appreciate that you're here so smash the thumbs up button and that's enough thank you dude exactly and now we can just uh type in get push heroku master and i think we already added the start script so it should be working perfectly right but what about the npm install how about that stuff uh the npm install stuff is going to be done uh is by heroku automatically someone say get push heroku master boom is pushed some stuff now how do i actually go okay so we got this happening now so it's downloading installing node let's actually open up a new uh terminal actually so guys what this did is it pushed in the code to heroku it went ahead and installed all the dependencies it built it it done everything we needed um it even pruned it nice okay dope yeah let's go ahead david what are you saying and now you can type in heroku logs dash dash tail okay so somebody's saying it's not going to work somebody's supposed to say profile is needed but let's see if it works uh let's see okay so we now we will see all the uh logs and what's happening somebody's already calling but i mean right it says it's running okay so how can we test this david so let's go back to heroku.com and in the settings if you scroll a bit down uh that's where you will see uh the link yeah your app can be found yeah yeah so yeah and we just uh open it in a new tab and see if it says hello club programmers oh let's go that's not that's just like right so guys whoever said profile i don't want to say it but i kind of do shame i'm joking because i remember like in the past this gave us so much headache like guys i'm only joking yeah throwing it on fire the prop file is needed okay yeah so devin oh that's nice actually devon gray thank you for clearing up pro profile is only needed if you have to run commands other than mpm stop so i take it back i take it back i take it back guys uh yeah you're gonna need a profile if there's other commands then start so i'm guessing by default it just runs npm start on the server maybe um so yeah okay cool nice dude um i'll be checking the house from sweden go sweden nice let's go ahead copy that link and then what we're going to do now is we're going to go to our axios and seo.js file yep and that's in our front end so we need to go tinder clone source axios and we're going to change this to now pull from that heroku right exactly and actually remove the formula yeah yeah that's it nice i'm going to save this now and let's go ahead and test it let's do it dude so now hey look at that it's actually running through our heroku server now so if i actually go ahead and ring so let me clear the server log and then we go ahead and refresh and look it made the request there we that's awesome dude that is awesome smash the thumbs up button for david because i think that's pretty damn cool right so that's the back end dude right that's the backing completely deployed that's live right now bro my interview is scheduled tomorrow well done dude thank you for that amazon and spotify come on that's insane let us know how it goes dude i really want to hear about that and hopefully you can be one of the five thousand developers that we're trying to get that job for so insane stuff shivam and proud to hear that okay let's go that's it let's go dude so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna set up firebase so firebase is pretty simple to deploy we're going to hit ls to make sure we're in the right directory we've got the stuff tinder clone there we go so now guys we're going to go ahead and say you need to actually make sure you've got the firebase tools installed so in this case we're going to say mpmig firebase dash tools uh but i've already done this so i don't need to go ahead and do that so now if you do you need to add sudo at the very beginning yes good good shot dude you're gonna have that sudo because it's gonna add it globally so chances are you can need the right permissions now what we're going to do is we're going to say firebase login and then that will actually log you into the correct account um let's see if i'm actually logged into the correct account uh okay so i'm in the right one then we're going to say firebase uh if you're not logged in it will pop up on the screen and it'll work now we're gonna say firebase um david i'm not sure actually on youtube we hit over a thousand likes my youtube's kind of frozen nope uh we are at 9 58. oh guys let's push to a thousand yeah do it come on guys like i think david deserves that thousand i think like he absolutely crushed it he showed up he showed you guys nice 960. push that thing to a thousand three nice yeah actually let's set up everything uh and stop right before deploying yeah we'll be waiting until we're waiting for 10 000. let's go guys i see that number creeping up um so firebase i'm going to say firebase and net okay firebase and that's actually going to allow us to go ahead and set things up so i'm going to make this full screen for a sec then i'm going to go ahead and say to hosting so i'm going to click on that and i'm gonna go down here use an existing project i'm gonna go find the uh tinder clone so tender tinder tinder tinder oh okay i have two tinder clones um so what i'm gonna do now is go over to firebase to clarify which one i'm interested in so this one is actually gonna go here go to project settings and this one is two ffa a9 so two ffa nine is the top one boom here now this is important guys here we need to go ahead and do uh build so this has to be build okay then you want to hit enter and then single page app yes you have to type in y if you type in no or you just hit enter here it will not work okay we just got a lovely donation from prince oh nice dude thank you so much thank you nice for pulling that out by the way um i didn't pop off my thing so i can't pull it out but thank you prince donated 20 rupees that's huge thank you so much yeah i'm gonna go ahead and pull that up for you
