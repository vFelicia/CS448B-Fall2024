hey what's up guys welcome to another episode of the command line tutorial Series so now we are going to be doing more practical things okay I want you to keep playing that game on your own it's a great game to play but let's uh jump in and start doing some more practical things so on the left hand side we see the actual world as you see it so if you're using Windows you'll see a different world but essentially it's the same idea you got some folders you got directories you got files and all that stuff and if you're looking at Linux or Mac or whatever it's going to look pretty similar to what I have on my left hand side so now let's see how moving in the real world looks in the terminal World okay and once you understand that it's essentially the same thing you will become a lot less intimidated with it and start to understand what's going on all right so so okay so I clicked on documents and I'm in this folder called documents I don't know what its depth is I don't know um if it's in users or if it's in like my directory like users slash something slash documents or whatever so I can figure that out uh first of all on the right hand side I'm going to do LS and just see what's around me and when I look around me I see this thing called documents and so if I go to documents how can I check where I am so if you remember from your previous commands if you're ever lost there's something called print working directory so whatever directory you're currently in that's your working directory so if I hit PWD it tells me I'm in user chest tastic documents which is actually this thing okay so I'm actually here but from my terminal rather than my gooey graphical user interface so I know I said user with the S but it's user now if I hit LS what do you expect to see do you expect to see playground do you expect to see uh playground here Final Cut Pro do you see do you expect to see those things well let me hit LS and indeed you see Final Cut Pro playground clever programmer and everything that's on the leftand side here you see that on the right hand side right there now what if I wanted to do something more let's say I want to actually go inside of a directory while I can do CD playground you remember that one so if I do CD playground that's effectively going to playground and double clicking playground okay so I want to keep this video short because I really want to be explicit and make sure you understand understand what it is that we're doing here uh even if the last two videos were maybe a little confusing or if they didn't do a good job of explaining this concept it's okay if this still seems a little bit basic because fundamentals are the most important part of this we will get to the more advanced things but I don't want to take any for anything for granted I want to make sure you understand every step of the way and in the next video I'll show you how you can perhaps create a folder right from your command line all right I'll see you in the next video
