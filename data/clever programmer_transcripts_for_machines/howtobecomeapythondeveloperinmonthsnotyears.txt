whoa hey guys how's it going alright guys welcome to this live broadcast with Kazi from clever programmer and in this video we're gonna talk a little bit about how you can go and become a Python developer in months and not yours so let's jump right into it alright so guys unbelievable unbelievabl so yeah we're gonna discuss all of those things in this video okay but I just got to kind of talk about this for the first time in my life ever my computer is just not working so I got to my office that's where I am right now you got to my office literally like turning on my computer and it just shuts off so the broadcast starts at 400 and then that's why I came on a few minutes later so I'm doing this from my phone right now hopefully it's working well from the phone how is it looking on your guyses and I know Austin I know sorry man Eid Mubarak sweet okay if anybody is having trouble kind of let me know but that's good to know that it's working alright looks good beautiful alright guys so yeah you know I want to kind of cover a lot of things in this one but I just want to go through most of the things stepbystep let me make it a little bit better hopefully my phone won't fall I like to set it up on my tripod and then it's just like hanging on by the thread alright so in this one I'm gonna be taking some of your guys's questions as you guys know my create apps with Python or Python opie create apps course has finally launched so what I do is I take a cohort of students who joined then we run through a few months one two three months or maybe even more and then we go through that course together it's not live it's recorded right so when you get it you actually have lifetime access to it and then I launch it again so right now my course is open and it closes on June 30th so in three four days from now now in the last few videos I've talked a little bit about how much value there is in becoming a software developer right and kind of the job opportunity things of that nature so before I start let me ask you guys are you guys interested in becoming a software developer and why I kind of want to hear your reasons why you're looking into becoming a programmer so let me know below and I kind of want to see that HUD nice but this is kind of cool you know cuz I can just hold this up show you guys a little bit about my office here okay so a jack says freelance what else because I love being creative whatever is in my mind I want to create mobile apps always interested in programming my job ends on ah Tom Lynch I remember you man that's awesome I mean I don't know if that's awesome you said your job ends in seven freelance for one for fun I want to give it a try okay so I'm gonna parole I'm gonna probe a little bit further and a little bit deeper okay so I got a lot of things like I want to do I want to be creative I want to just try out something new so by programming why not literally anything else why not computer networking I love the fact that saw really based on imagination Python for web development bring your ideas to life okay those are really cool reasons Cody Cody just joined our course recently okay so a lot of you guys are saying that you want to do this because one let me get this right you like the challenge too because you can take what's in here make it a reality three how about this one doing something you know when you create a solution or you solve a problem all of a sudden it can be scaled instantly to millions of people does that kind of sound important hell yeah yeah so you know that's exactly you know one of their I'll tell you one of my reasons was because I did computer networking and kind of hated it oh my god like I was going to college and my brother was my brother was like hey why don't you do something so you're ahead of other people so while I was going to college I thought I don't want to just um you know not do anything or kind of figure out life by default this is something I talk about a lot right like you guys know how sloths survive so let me tell you how slots survive they're so slow right they're so slow they are weak they just drag along everywhere so how in the world have this survived till now how is that a possibility one very interesting thing is that sloths live on branches okay they live on like trees but like on top of it and they just kind of hold on to a branch and they live there now the thing about them is that they don't really take in a lot of they don't need a lot of food and stuff because they don't spend that much energy so because they're just literally chillin Netflix and chilling pretty much the entire time the Netflix and they just kind of you know that's how they survive they need to eat very less now the animals that are at the top that can actually get to them are not really interested in eating them because those animals are usually smaller the animals at the bottom which are really giant really huge and can then come at the top and then out but the problem is that when they try to get to where the slots are they end up breaking those branches right those branches end up breaking and they end up falling so they can't eat them and so when I found this out first of all I thought it was really cool I thought oh my god you know that's pretty weird but you know that's how salons actually survive and live up to 20 or thirty years and then I was thinking holy slots survived by just existing like they literally survived by just existing the service survived by default okay so to relate it back to when I was kind of going in college I didn't wanna survive by just existing which was any job opportunity that comes my way I kind of accept it any any literally any upper like any college that comes your way you kind of accepted any first job opportunity comes your way you accept it and a lot of the times you even accept working 9 to 5 doing lots of tedious soulcrushing paper shuffling kind of work and you find out they it's like thirty years that you've been doing this and then you kind of just spent your whole life like my uncle he was half a year from retiring he worked for this company for 29 years and he was gonna get started getting a pension and everything from them and then what happened was he got sick and he couldn't work so he had to quit and no pension for him and he literally has to survive off of whatever little money that he's gonna start getting in Social Security income and then he has like four kids that kind of have to survive off of that so for me I personally saw a lot of that and a lot of just kind of like people have this helplessness that happens a lot of the times whether it's you don't have enough money or whether you're doing something that makes you miserable those all kind of make you helpless and that's why I wanted to just pick something that allowed me to enjoy but then also earn a living that I can support not only myself but other people around me so I thought okay that's gonna be computer not working for me and then I joined computer networking and I wanted to kill myself in computer networking but then I joined but then I started doing computer programming I found out about it what I'm you know my oldest brother called me and he's like hey have you ever looked into this thing and I said no but I'm gonna check it out and then I started looking into it and I said hole the crap what is this this is the most amazing thing because I can take literally what's in my brain and turn it into a reality right like make it a real thing that people can use so you can do the same thing you can put something that you made online that people can use play around with and it's literally like they're playing around with the ideas that you have in your head but in reality and then that's how I kind of got started on this path but I'm not now I want to talk to you about you know this industry is where kind of the world is heading so first of all it's fun it almost feels like a glitch when somebody pays you to code because you're thinking it's literally something that I do for fun and I'm getting paid for it imagine like you watch Game of Thrones and you get paid for it or you're sitting there watching house of cards and you get paid for it imagine going for you know like I don't know going for this is the only thing that's coming to my mind because I did that a few months ago like jumping off of a plane and having fun enjoying your life or going to Six Flags and then somebody pays you for it so literally that's kind of how it was for me and I was able to get to the level where I was getting paid to code in less than three months and I got a lot a lot a lot a lot of you know I when I make a video like that or I even have a video I get so many people just hatin and write and writing on me basically and there's going you can't do this in three months and start getting paid it takes 25 years and so the reason why I started this clever programmer channel was kind of to debunk that myth mmm i feii in dedup you know this was something that I ended up discovering and I was like okay this is not that hard you don't need to be some kind of math genius you don't need to be some kind of like prodigy to learn computer programming it doesn't matter kind of how old you are because I know people who are 60 years old who started and then they ended up getting a career in this but now one of my goals was okay I want to start a career in this fast and once I kind of did that this is something that I wanted to share with other people how can you then start your own career just rolling and then doing this faster and here are a few things that I'm gonna tell you that will help you so if you're watching this right now you know just close your other tabs if you have chrome and everything you know just close all of them out I can't just want you and I it just be oneonone here for a second okay you know put your phone on Do Not Disturb and just relax get some popcorn get a legal pad this is what I use a lot just really helps me you know I write down my ideas here and that's how when I'm coding that's how I solve problems as well like I literally write them down by hand and that just it really helps me like putting things on paper so that's what I would suggest because I'm gonna give you some really valuable resources that will save you I don't know ten to hundreds of thousands of dollars and this is not a joke there are and those resources are free and then I also want to share with you some ways of how you can improve your coding skills you know so here's one of them really really important things that you should do okay schools hate them that's hilarious yet they do here's one of the really important things so somebody just asked me how do you start as a beginner I'm gonna tell you right now one of I will guide you okay one of the main you should focus on is play if you're learning and you wanna be you want to improve really fast focus on improving your focus on improving the time you spend playing with it okay so whatever skill it is that you're trying to get focus on just playing then learn later so if there was a 80/20 right something that there's like an 80 up here and a 20 up here something that you spent short amount of time on something you spent a lot of time on a lot of people will tell you watch you know a video on udemy and Coursera just like learn and then don't do anything else what you should be doing is spending most of the time not learning theory but most of the time should be spent actually playing so 80% of the time should be actually spent playing and 20% of your time should actually be spent really learning the theory behind things okay so if it's computer programming for you this is what I would suggest and I won't even go further than that and I want to say it's almost like eighty ten or eighty fifteen five okay that gets really complicated but play build learn so most of your time should be spent playing then the rest of your time should be spend building and then the rest of your time should be spent learning and the reason why that's important is because first of all you associate fun and enjoyment with that skill so if it's you want to become a programmer right and you don't want to spend years literally years and years trying to become a programmer and start enjoying what you're doing and that happens a lot of the times by playing with that making it kind of natural for you then use that to build stuff okay and then once you start using it to build stuff now you have stuff to show for what you did because that's practical like you and I were busy we don't have all the time in the world to focus on one thing and then just do it for 20 hours a day you want to spend your time and get the most out of it right so when you play and you build now you have something to over it even on your portfolios when you're going to get clients for Python and doing freelancing or if you want to even apply the software developer you're building a portfolio as you are going okay and then you have although at the bottom you have learning so you want to kind of do the learning part and you want to and actually shorten that a little bit so you want to spend less time learning and more time building things with it getting done I'm a huge proponent of doing things rather than just passively sitting there and learning because what happens is that it doesn't become a part of you and you also don't have anything to show for it because a lot of the times what would happen to me is I'd be taking these courses on and you can write these resources down because they're all free and very valuable udemy okay so if anybody knows the spellings of these please put it in chat code Academy team treehouse Udacity Coursera and edex okay and all of these guys have you know PhDs from UC Berkeley and people who are working for Google and people whatever and they're teaching you and most of them are free so you can actually pick up those technical skills from right there but a lot of the times what happens is I'd be taking these courses and would be working on really esoteric things like a for example recursive Fibonacci solution or we'll be working on you know using the Fibonacci to make this like circle get the area under the curve using Python and this stuff improved my coding skills but at the end of the day when I got done I didn't have anything to show for it I didn't have anything that I could take to my clients and I don't want that to happen for you guys because that's how you end up spending years and you don't have anything to show for it at the end of the day like when I was actually starting out one of my friends got a job before I did because I focused so much on the theory stuff he focused more on just building web apps and things and he knew less than I did he was way less skilled than I am and he ended up getting a job faster than I did he started getting consulting work and freelancing work faster than I did because all of the things that he was learning he was building and then when he went to apply he had stuff to show for it he even had recruiters find his stuff on websites like github they found his activities that he was kind of doing on meetup.com and wherever like he was going to all these groups they're like you know what we're gonna hire this person because there are actual projects that this guy has write actual work so that's what I would tell you to focus on so if you're debating between taking a course from one of these websites and you're trying to think about them right which website should I take a course from where should I go first of all make sure that the instructor is the right fit for you and then make sure that what you're learning isn't so theoretical in a satirical oh I love you too you say you love me from Egypt I love you from Chicago I'm in Chicago right now so basically that's you know one of the things when you build those things you build projects somebody asked me what do you build well when you're okay for example I'll give you an example instead of doing a recursive Fibonacci solution work on building a tictactoe game I'll get a lot of hate from developers on this but you know there is a time and place for doing those like recursive Fibonacci solution and like complicated things with data structures there is a time in place but what I want to focus on with you is practical stuff that gets you started because look you don't have so much time some of you guys maybe 20 30 40 years old some of you guys maybe have a family some of you guys already have a job you don't have time to learn all this other crap which is beautiful it's a lot of fun but you don't have all this time to learn it so what I want you to focus on instead is focus on things that build a portfolio for you so you can start working and once you start earning an income then all of a sudden you have time for it you you're working in IT field right now and you start earning an income from Python you can go you know what I can start dropping some of my work I can put it a few hours into the site each job and more hours into Python all of a sudden you're learning faster what should have taken you years is now taking you months then you could go even further and just say okay I don't want to do IT at all and just switch over to Python and you can do that as well because those things are really important like how do I make that career switch how do I go from my current job to Python development and that was another one of those things I didn't see some anybody explain which was okay great they're all this course covers really technical stuff and I'm picking up lots of technical skills but how do I go from my current job to becoming a software developer how do I go from what I'm currently doing to doing programming or sorry doing programming and kind of getting paid for it because I want to be doing real practical stuff how do I go on to build a portfolio how do I know I'm ready to start freelancing how do I know I'm ready to apply for a job how do I know where do I go to find clients how do I know how to keep those clients what do I say when I'm about to lose a client you know and most of these courses aren't even like teaching a lot of the times a projectbased way of learning but those that do those are really really really really helpful some of the courses that have helped me and you guys could write it down and you guys actually could go take these courses or free intro to computer science course on Udacity write it down don't open that tab and go to it yet you can always go to it later but this is important then you have courses on Coursera and it's called intro to interactive programming and Python on freaking believable course and it's actually free of cost the drawback of those courses they don't teach you how you convert to actually making money how do you even the projects that you built put it on your portfolio and all that but the great thing is that the course has a lot of great valuable information in there so if you want to improve your technical skills great place to go to again this is another one of those reasons why I created my create apps with Python course so first of all I already have you know like about 150 videos on YouTube and I have my free course which is called learn Python but the point of my new course which is called create absolute Python or Python olp create apps is literally how do you go from knowing nothing to learning Python while building a portfolio while trying to earn an income as you learn because that's what I found the secret was between the people who took years to learn programming versus months for me it took me months like one to two months and I was getting paid to code that's why so many people can wrap their mind around it because then what I was able to do is just completely drop the other thing that I was doing is focused on software development and then that allowed me to be in a position where and it will allow it can allow you as well to be in a position where you can choose to work for somebody or not you can choose to hire or fire a client you can choose to kind of work on your own hours and then it's fun like when you're actually working as well those are one those are a few of the things that I really liked and I saw that you guys kind of like that as well so that's what I would suggest you know if you're gonna take those online courses from the websites that I've mentioned above make sure that they're projectbased and they have something on your portfolio so when you walk in you don't look like an idiot okay and again if you're ready to make that leap that is again one of the reasons why I made this course teaching you programming skills along with all of the skills that go along with it this is something I explained earlier being good at interview or being good at getting jobs is different than being good being a good software developer they're two different things and the example I always give is in my high school I was like almost certified dumped I got a really really low score on my AC T which is a standardized test they use in the United States to figure out how intelligent you are basically and I got a really low score on that but at the same time I was top 1% in the world for chess and still am so how can somebody be top 1% in chess and kind of know a few things but then get such a low score on a CT that they are actually like they're almost certified dumb like I wouldn't tell anybody I was so embarrassed and I'm actually sharing this now and what I ended up finding out was it's not about how smart yours about how good you are taking that test so it's not really capturing your intelligence it's really focusing on improving those testing skills those tests taking specific skills so now let's go back to computer programming and software development getting good at interviews is very different getting a job and having a good portfolio that lands you clients gets people to work with you is very different from being a good programmer I myself don't have 20 years of experience programming but I charge my clients like 10 times more than some of my mentors I was working with when I was starting out and they're rock star programmers who've been freaking working their ass off since they were 5 years old and they're just like they know everything inside and out about programming they can probably program better than they can actually even walk or talk literally and then it you know so there are two completely different things so again that's what I want to focus on for you that's my goal for you for you to be able to make that transition from whatever you're currently doing from whatever your current job is to making that switch as fast as possible to the programming field to the software development field from going from scratch being able to create apps and then being able to actually get clients from it okay so if you guys are interested in my course or you want to learn just learn more about it and see what it's about the link is right below or it should be if it isn't I don't know what I'll have to do because I'm on my phone and I can't really do anything my computer isn't coming on so it is what it is but my course should be in the links below can you see can somebody tell me if it is it is right okay beautiful oh my name is Rafa Kazi kuber's okay so I'm gonna start taking questions from you guys now but yeah if you guys are interested in course you want to find out more about it literally clink click the link below right now I stand behind my courses so much first of all you know they they give you tremendous value and hands down these are the best courses out there the reason why I know is because I've taken literally every course and like for certifications from Coursera I have like three certifications from EDX I have taken the courses on Udacity like four of them team treehouse code Academy pretty much everywhere and then I what I didn't find from there is what this course is about but you know again I stand behind him so much that before I was doing a 30 day money you know money back now you're not happy for any reason I'm gonna give you 60 days on it so for any freakin reason you don't like it cause II your jokes are not funny anymore or you're looking ugly and I want to return it like sure no problem no questions asked alright now I'm gonna take your questions the link is below click that link in the mean times let's jump in to these questions and I'm gonna try to turn on my computer because it's really pissing me off gonna have to buy a new computer all right Neil Patel says what about you to me um I'm gonna have to write down these questions somewhere too because they're moving so fast okay so somebody asked what about you to me you to me is really good but it's made by a bunch of old people who that's what I think you know they were running a little tight on their budget and they're like crap we're gonna make a course so we can pay the bills for June and they're like behind a PowerPoint behind a slide that has zero passion they're not interested in what they're teaching you that's one of my biggest problems with a udemy if you can get something from Udacity go there first like if you're looking between those academic resources and you don't really care about making money from Python then go to Hey Bruce how's it going then go to Udacity always go to Udacity first then go other places udemy sucks like most people are young you to me because they always have a 90 I know this because I take so many questions from you to me and it's always like oh they have a 95% promotion sale going on so I'm just gonna buy 30 courses that I'm never gonna take so that's really what it is yeah I want to shoot myself a lot of the times when I'm going on you to me there's no production quality they make it in like one sitting on a Wednesday there's like it just pisses me off because there's no love for this like let me show you okay how much love I have for this monster monster okay I have my frickin office over here I spend all my time making these courses for you guys like I'm a psychopath like I love it so much and it's built with so much passion you know I hire crews I have to software develop I have software developers working for me I have marketing development representatives I have business consultants I have video editors and then I work with them and we work together to make sure that we give you the highest quality and the best material possible it again it all started from just me zero people's your subscribers just a few months ago seven eight months ago and this is my passion this is what I love to teach this is what I love to do this is what I'm about you know this is not oh I want to make some extra cash money and let me make one course over the weekend put it on you to me because they'll market it for me and yeah hopefully there'll be a 90 percent sale and a bunch of people will buy it and cool we get to go to like Mexico and have a nice little vacation with our family know like I gave up my clients I gave up my software development jobs and I'd the reason why I did that so I can go and fight or flight mode and then just give it all I've got to bring clever programmer to the people to you guys and bring this message out and the word of software development how amazing it is out okay all right kuber's i'm mm not 1900 what types of things go on your portfolio let's see you build a web app using simple frameworks with Python flask which in this course I'm actually going to show you I'm gonna have videos on flask as well in my course I go over where do you get clients how can you earn an income while learning Python this is one of the biggest secrets once I found this out it helped me make a switch to programming in months not years and once I found this out I helped my best friend quit his soulcrushing paper shuffling tedious job at CVS that he was doing from 900 to 500 making $13 an hour to making $75 an hour with the clients that he was working with and he was making about seven to eight thousand dollars a month doing computer programming software development in a few months so it is possible the reason why I don't like to always throw these numbers out people are like can you guarantee my success sorry Cody I'm gonna throw you under the bus here but I can only put the path for you they're like my oldest brother did for me like my coding mentors did for me I want to kind of return that favor but you do have to put in the effort when I started out I was putting in 20 hours a day my mentor would come at 7 p.m. and he would see me working at this coworking space and then he would help me and then he would leave at 900 p.m. he would go to sleep at 10 p.m. whatever he'd wake up he'd go to his job he'd come back and I was work he would come back and I would still be working there my eyes would be like red bloodshot and I'd be solving a coding problem or doing a coding challenge and then also what it made me realize was that's not practical for most of you guys that's impossible for most of you guys right that's not you know you guys have things going on and so how can I make this so you get the most practical stuff and it gets you results in the least amount of time I'm not saying the least amount of effort but the least amount of time gets you real results yeah so let's see yeah no that that's okay you know for how do you get high in code I don't get high that's okay if you this is this course is a serious investment and I understand that but it literally has material that can change your life and it took me months of time to make this into the best course possible I do have one hundred and sixty videos that are completely free of cost all over it on YouTube and then my learn Python course is also completely free with exercises quizzes and everything so if this is too expensive for you that is completely fine there are courses available that I have that you don't have to pay a penny for but if you're interested in this course which you should be if you're serious about this at least take a look into it the link is below and then decide for yourself whether this is an investment you want to make or not but this course does close this course closes on Friday June 30th and then it'll be probably many months before I launch it again so what I like to do is I get the students and then I want to focus on them I don't want to talk about this course I don't want to spend any time outside of working with the students for taking this course and then also any time any new videos get added any time any new live interviews if I do for this course get added or any bonus content that gets added if you have lifetime access to everything for free if you join this course so if the price increases for this course later on which it probably will because I keep adding so much stuff to this you'll have access to it for free of cost so you don't have to pay a single penny once new stuff gets added that's what happened to all the you know students who joined it the last time it launched it was way cheaper and every time anything got added it was free of cost so my the way this course is really done it's very simple I put money by focus on putting money back in your pocket most Python courses or most courses on programming teach you technical skills only and they don't focus on putting money in your pocket so you're not making anything mmm they just charge you what they charge you my course focus is on making sure to kind of put that back in your pocket all right I'm in a coding boot camp right now for a Java course is it a good idea to learn Python simultaneously should I learn statistics and R before I learn Python so I'm going to answer that question there are too many things going on and you need to just narrow down and focus on one thing so don't worry so much about languages worry about the concepts if you started with Java or R and you and it's been years you don't need to make that switch it doesn't make sense if you're just starting out languages don't matter the concepts do the reason why I mentioned Python and I'm a big proponent of Python and I preach Python and I say start with Python is because one it's the easiest to it's one of the most highly trending it just beat out Java in popularity last year and three it's one of the most highly paid it's literally up there with JavaScript and all those languages that get paid the most so and it's used in the biggest companies you can imagine Instagram Google YouTube it's probably even used at NASA for like doing data science stuff so from all the way web development to data science pythons got you covered it's like United autos insurance 7 7 3 2 you know what I mean so that's what it is I need some books to go hard here's a book it's called Python programming incredible book it's not my book I will probably write a book soon but get this really freaking good book unbelievable what do you recommend for a resources left oh god damn it oh I'm so sorry ok somebody did a super chat which is so cool this is the first time somebody did a super chat with me so this is actually really exciting he just paid $5 thank you so much I do apologize because I'm on a livestream on my phone and any message that comes up it just goes away and hides so unless I see it it kind of goes away so I try to write it down but I think you asked me something along the lines of what kind of book can I get after the livestream I'll try to find your message and reply back to you but what I will say is that this is a good resource really good resource to start off with focus on learning the concepts first and then you can switch to any programming ok so any language so for example if you pick up Python then you can switch to JavaScript you know in like two days not a big problem okay what do you recommend for resources slash books for people who want to learn Python to work in all finance electronics ok so again good book to get started off with I do have experience I have I also have lots of students were like PhDs and then going for their masters at UFC I have another student who's going she's going for her PhD at UFC and I was coaching her when I was like 19 years old so I've just been doing crazy stuff since like you know just I just go really hard when I jump into something and one of the things that you know for her she's trying to learn all these skills and still what I recommend for a lot of them is start with basics people who want to do complicated things will look into complicated things and they'll think there are past the basics and then their programming skills are absolute I'm sorry but that's what it is my students who are going to get their PhDs were way worse programmers and some of my students who didn't know anything about programming and they even thought they were dumb but they learned way better and they were much much much better you mean UFC somebody just said UFC UFC is awesome I love watching UFC one of my students also goes and does trading so for trading there are also frameworks and Python that you can use focus on becoming a better developer and then you can actually leverage these big frameworks for things like trading and you know basically you can use those frameworks then and you won't need to know any math or any crazy stuff behind them because they'll take care of it for you that's why I love software development the book name is somebody please write the book name for him but the book is called Python programming and introduction to computer science by John Zell and people who spend time buying things like this books like this somebody even in my slack channel was asking questions and I kind of got upset at him I shouldn't have but it's like three sodas guys but you're gonna spend this time oh my god Austen thank you so much somebody said they thought this is crazy it's like live streamers when they get money is just cool it's like five bucks one buck like you just bought me you know like whew a few more of these monsters thank you guys like this is what it takes for me to code for you and make those videos so the more you get any of these monsters the more training sessions you'll have there's some super chat option but seriously you should not be asking should I invest in getting this book like there's something wrong with you if that happens because this is worth like three sodas it's like 15 bucks maybe 10 bucks so in knowledge invest first and then think later all and also all these always have a moneyback guarantee so you get it and you don't like it you can literally read like half of it and then return it that's a cheap thing to do I don't recommend it I never do it but if that's what you're worried about spending that money which you were going to invest in probably sodas or I don't know HBO or Netflix subscription anyways or your extra phone bill like it's much better to spend it here yeah like don't be so hesitant of spending when it comes to knowledge and learning things like I'm so crazy I bought a $4,000 course I actually have a video on it and that course is called God zero to launch and it's a business course and it helped me take clever programmer to where it is right now from zero to well I can't give it all the I can't give it all of the credit because I work really hard but yes it's a four thousand dollar course go look it up it's called zero to launch I even have a video on actually buying it live and what I was thinking before making that purchase it's a 59 minute long video but even a few things that I got from it were just so incredible but you know there's a reason why clever programmer went from zero subscribers to over 55,000 subscribers in a few months you know and thanks to you guys because if you guys are not here there is no channel right it doesn't exist if you're not here literally right now sitting here watching this this channel doesn't exist so like I need you and that's what's like valuable for me and that course taught me how to connect better with you and help you out better and that's what I've been focusing on okay yeah and that's just one of the courses like I have so many freaking courses that are really really a you know expensive but when you think of the return on investment they're not that expensive because of the things that they teach you like for example let's say you paid thousand dollars for a course it teaches you how to get a client let's say you get three clients do you have these clients pay you $50 a month or sorry $50 an hour yes it my course does have a mastermind group okay anyways so let's say it pays you to pay you $50 an hour that's one hundred and fifty dollars if you have four sessions with them in just one month that's 150 times four that's six hundred dollars in one month that's twelve hundred dollars in the next month you've paid off the thousand dollar course in just two months one of the students that clever programmer tried one of our strategies and in 72 hours she had booked three clients she went from thirteen dollars an hour to having three clients paying her $60 an hour and she was working fulltime at a job that she hated and so this just kind of freed her up yeah they're launched it's really expensive course but if you're serious about business it's a pretty damn good course what kind of programs you recommend uh thank you guys I love the super chats coming in that's so crazy um okay is there any major difference between the videos I upload on YouTube and the course that's a really good question there absolutely is a ginormous difference I can't control how I put things on YouTube for example if I want to put a challenge for you there's no nice way for me to put it in the course if I want to lay it out in the best way possible I don't have control over that if I want to make a change to something I can't do that as well because things are kind of set in stone if I want to email you a specific video that's timesensitive or there's like a specific opportunity that I think you should look into a reply I don't have a way of connecting with you from fate and YouTube so easily so when I'm on my when I'm in the when you get the course all of that stuff is in one place like for example I have hundred and seventy videos online right now and you could probably just look at them and learn a lot of things and then try to put the pieces together that's what I always did spend thousands of hours trying to put the pieces together like for example it took me two years to learn how to make a web app I can teach you in one hour I swear to god I've done this for so many of my students who took oneonone lessons with me one hour I can teach you that or even less and that was something that took me two years alone because I never wanted to invest in myself and I just wanted to put the pieces together I want to take every free course and I did and there's nothing wrong with that but it just takes extra time so if you have extra time then um you can you know if you have extra time then you can watch the videos on YouTube and try to put it together but in the course it's in a nice linear structure step by step for you to follow so then you get this right stuff at the right time and then you get the most results so that's really what it is it's just packaged together perfectly for you saving you time saving you money okay so you don't have to get ten different courses this one course is you know kind of covers most of those things now once you start earning an income while you learn which is one of the key key key things I think then you can go and invest in more technical courses which is also something that I did because I got really technical courses what kind of programs you recommend to write for beginners programs that I recommend thank you for the super chat yeah that was really cool the programs I say that beginners should write and write this down tictactoe great program to write write that down rockpaperscissors in my free course I actually go over how to do rockpaperscissors for completely free full project for you and you can take that course for free on my website on clever programmer calm that's another great thing to do some other ones that are fun to do is like basic web apps those are another ones that are fun programs that you can do or like a snake game where you're like a little snake going around and then you're collecting those little coins those help your skills and also show people you can build real world apps making them more likely to pay you to code for them how many money you invested through your programming learning days a lot what I would do is all the hourly income that I made from chess and I was even back back even and that day I was charging clients like $150 an hour to coach them in chess and all the money but now you know that happened like a little bit later like before even when I was making 50 or $35 an hour coaching clients for chess what I would do is I don't think of my money as this one static thing I think of it as a very dynamic thing meaning I didn't think of it as money I just thought of it like I can use it to trade skills so for example all the money I made for chess I hired like first of all I invests it by getting online courses or you know books like these or hiring and tours and then working with them one on one side use my chest money to help me improve faster in programming it's not that I won't get there it just it takes you longer to connect the dots but when you have somebody who knows the ropes who knows where you are right now where you need to go who knows your weaknesses who can challenge in the right way that improves your speed by by years seriously so those were some of the things that helped me personally a lot and so I switched basically my I use my chest skills to become better in Python skills I'm sorry I'm missing your guys's question can you give a tip for teenagers I don't know about that Python or Java for first Python for first how easy is Python for someone who knows some Perl very easy could you explain the mindset between the definitions index that's very technical advantages of the mastermind group advantages of the mastermind group okay how many people are here okay so um yeah my so sorry guys what is this this is crazy we launched so many people okay hopefully you guys are coming back and reconnecting that kind of sucks this is so annoying my phone is not dead but the problem that happened yeah I'm alive the problem that happened is that it disconnected because of this WiFi there's just like everything you know the first little computer died when I came in here and it's still dead and then the WiFi died so I switched to LTE rip data so thank you guys for those super chats and those $5 $10 super chats because they'll probably pay for my data fees because I'm calling live thank you I will not be stopped that's right Cody I can't be stopped stupid networks can't stop me yeah I'm I'm up for a game of chess if he has everyone to play so yeah what was I talking about I even forgot Anna my chess ratings mm yeah mastermind groups a mastermind group again what I was talking about was why is mastermind group helpful which is actually you know if you get this course and you pay 47 bucks extra you get the mastermind group now why would the mastermind group be helpful let me explain again for mentors you paid them $100 $150 an hour and that's just one hour of your time and each time right this mastermind group is a onetime fee and you even get access to me and you get access to over hundreds of other students who have already joined this course so anytime you need help you can ask us well if you are stuck with the client you don't know what to say or how to keep them you can ask us we can help you and it's just a onetime fee so in my mind it's like it's free you know it's because of the value that it brings to you so that's why I would say the mastermind group is pretty helpful if you're seriously like looking into this if you want to get it later that generally doesn't happen you know because I don't want people joining the group halfway throughout the course I want people to join the group it has to do between where you are right now and then starting to freelance or starting to apply for a job and how to know when you're ready to apply for a job and how to know when you're ready to start freelancing so all those things are explained in this course as well you can make a game with Python yes you can also create Android apps with Python so Python is very powerful if you're looking for web development you can also do that with Python and it pays a lot you can pretty much do most of the stuff in Python yes and Python makes you very productive which is why I love it the most so from moving from beginner to easy level you recommend only practice in 20% theory yes moving from beginner to easy level or intermediate level focus on projects and less theory so do watch the courses but watch the stuff that's handson not the stuff that's in this lesson we're gonna be talking about how lexical closures are very useful in programming and why garbage collection is one of the most important things you can do absolute garbage sorry to say but it's just a fact and a lot of times they do this to fill the quota for the course and have enough video so they can justify it in blah blah blah you yes it's useful but there's a time and place for it not when you're a complete beginner it's useful when I'm not 28 I'm 22 it's useful when you are at a higher level and you are a better programmer and your intermediate or advanced then those things are going to be very important to you but in the start absolutely not so mmm practice more than you just like sitting back and like learning theory so yeah because a lot of the times what happens is a lot of the people get to in and on their heads and you guys know those people who think that they're like so smart and they always are like trying to oneup you but they're actually lacking in knowledge and they're lacking in the real skills and they and everybody who meets them knows that you can kind of see it on their face when you talk to them that's what happens when people only focus on right the worst people seriously and that's what happens when people only focus on sitting there literally breathing because it's not hard to watch videos right because you can just literally sit there and just breathe and just watch those videos and that's what these people a lot of the times do and then they just say technical jargon that they don't even understand which is why practicality first and then everything else you know comes after it it's not I'm not saying you shouldn't do it but then you should do it like after it and you should do it less than you actually spend time building things okay you Dassin know your daddy's really good don't don't listen to Vanara the hell are you talking about huh see you cause you going back to your oppa course now beautiful we have a few students who joined the course one of the students who joined the course I wanted to read off to you guys why people are joining this course the number one reason because I asked people but I can't because I don't have access to my other phones or my laptop or anything else yeah I'm on my phone so I what happened I'm gonna paraphrase it but when I was driving the car to coming here I saw my notification I looked at the email and this person was saying that you know I'm about 29 years old I don't have time to waste I have I have a family and then he also said that he doesn't like most of other courses he was taking or boring to death whereas my courses are very fun and interactive I'm alongside you I'm like side by side to you when we're going through these courses I'm not hiding behind a okay guys today we're gonna learn about like you know I'm God I almost put myself to sleep so that's not what it is and it's very practical so I get you to focus on learning practical skills that are real world by helping you build realworld projects then getting past the basics and mastering Python as fast as possible so that is kind of I just made somebody on so yeah that's what that person said to me that said look I don't want to be a sloth and just kind of not take action live a life of indecision do things by default because they were the only things that came my way and that is my reason for joining this course because I want to kind of step it up make this serious investment and take it to the next level okay so that's what it is and again I give you a 60 day money back guarantee because I'm just so behind my course because I just know it's the best you know anytime you don't like it now I give you a refund no questions asked so yeah I'm a hundred percent behind this I think this will be really really helpful for you even if you're remotely serious and especially if you're looking for something to help you go from where you are now maybe a current job to then switching over and there's no prerequisite so you don't need to learn you don't need to take my free course learn Python beforehand and you guys don't need to do you don't even need to know any Python from beforehand you can start from completely scratch are there any disadvantages for living outside the US for example getting clients the way you're teaching us in your course if you're living outside of the US there isn't that much of a disadvantage when I mention specific resources that might be sometimes a disadvantage because those resources might not exist in your country but for the most part the same ideas apply for getting the clients the same thing applies like for example if I tell you one website but that website doesn't work for United States I bet there's something exactly the same in your country 100% you literally have to just Google a web site like Yelp but in India or a website like this in I don't know Germany so it really that's really gonna be the only difference but all of the principles all of those rules apply it doesn't really matter what country you're in if you're taking this course if I pay for your course will you take that money and get an orthodontic doctor's to fix your teeth I probably will I have a messed up tooth right here it's like like a Dracula kind of thing going on and I was kind of born with it so yeah I probably will if you get that course email me and I'll do that and send you a video are the videos in the course the same as the free ones absolutely not it's a paid course it's a premium course and that content is not available anywhere else it's exclusively available on clever programmer once you join this course about a bad badaboom can I make the course free no because when I get when you guys pay for this course I reinvest and just make it so much better so yeah this course is not for free and then there's a company not clever programmer that were running to make it the best and just leave all the competition in the dust a lot of the times people think life is a zerosum game if I win the new lose or if you lose or if you win I lose that's not how it is meaning that if somebody pays for the course they think that they're just losing money and it's not possible for them to make money it's like a lose for them that's almost never the case almost every course I've paid for I've made 10 to 20 times that because of what I learned for example Udacity scores called intro to relational databases I remember taking that course and that course alone because I was already advanced this course is not for beginners absolutely not because I was already advanced at the time when I learned those key things from there even though I was being Udacity $200 a month I made like over thirty thousand dollars in just a few months because of what I learned and then what kind of jobs I could do based on that course so just because I paid Udacity it doesn't mean that I lose it's like Udacity want and then I want as well so yeah if I start as a beginner how long god these questions are moving so fast I want to pay for the course but I'm scared how this will help me as an engineer not interested in being a developer F Kanako this course teaches you the principles of getting good at getting clients one and it teaches you how to create apps with Python you can use those apps and you can get more complicated with it and make it really engineering type and not go to the web development route so you can do that but yeah so that's what I would recommend and again 60 you have 60 days to return it if you take it for 40 days and go all out and try everything or you take it for 59 days go all out and try everything and all of a sudden you're like look it's just not it doesn't have that engineering aspect or whatever there's no guilt there's no remorse I don't ask you any questions I refund you because look your one payment isn't gonna really affect anything my main goal for you is to get the skills that you need for to make that transition as fast as possible to the programming field and I want 1 million people to become developers that's one of my goals you know like one of the reasons okay one of the other reasons that I do this is because my dad is really old and my mom is really old and they were really crappy planners so they really so one of my main one of my main main main goals that drives me all the time is I want to give them a really really good retirement and that's actually one of the things that kept me going the software development world and I push myself so hard and I'm much much much younger age so then I can kind of do that for them and they just have a ton of problems like health problems basically and I hate hate when we have to go to like these Cook County hospitals and if there's an emergency I have to take them in and we have to wait like nine hours I think I mentioned this before but my dad like got hypernatremia a super healthy guy played soccer his whole life and he kind of got hypernatremia we went to the hospital and what happened was a doctor would come in he would learn what was going on with him we didn't know he had a hypernatremia hypernatremia is when your sodium levels are really fatally high like you could die high so he was having seizures and all this stuff and it kind of happened out of Norris fit healthy guy who's old but he's healthy and we went to the hospital and each a doctor would come in spend 15 minutes with a playing catchup of like what the nurse said and everything he'd get caught up and as soon as he got caught up his shift was over and then like a new doctor would come in and then that new doctor would try to diagnose the problem figure it out before he did that he would get caught up with all the notes from the nurse and the previous doctor so once he would get caught up with all those notes his time was up and because of that my dad almost pretty much died because he nobody could figure out that he was suffering from hypernatremia because it's so easy once they figure it out they just figure out how to bring your sodium levels down and you're fine but they couldn't figure it out because they barely spent 15 or 20 minutes with him so I never wanted to be in a situation that could happen you know one of Michael's always used to say like I want to get you guys a private doctor that just you know even since I was young so those are some of my goals that kind of drive me past just like superficial stuff like yeah I'm young I want to do crazy stuff jump off planes go out with friends you know buy them drinks and all that but those are some of the things that drive me or like being with my family all the time or friends all the time without worrying about work and all this other stuff that's what kind of drives me let me ask you like what kind of drives you guys and what kind of things you know what would it mean for you if you have the ability to kind of work remotely choose your own hours your own clients and then have enough where you're financially like free essentially like what does that mean for you how much amount of money invested on going okay money in the font cool same as you cool partners lucky to have you cool I would make it rain that's a pretty damn good goal I'm all for that freedom success happiness I love that no ninetofive I can't stand normalcy lifestyle normalcy and being average is what kills me every single day and I want to run away from it more than anything I'd rather be the worst at something then be average at it can you take this course working second shift as a job like it is timebased at your own pace it's timebased at your own pace it's not a live course and you have lifetime access to it so you can take this course any time and the reason why I make this course is even if you're working second job and you're working on a second shift I teach you just enough and I give you enough practical stuff to get you going and help you start earning an income while learning Python as fast as possible so you don't have that pressure constant pressure that alone that you have a lot of other times when you're making that switch they're just like quit your job and then just do programming it's like I have a family to feed and I have my own bills to pay how am I gonna just quit my job and just do this so yeah there you go so it's possible for you to do this parttime that's you know one of the reasons I want to teach you the most practical stuff in the least amount of time click the link below if you want to get this course now or you want to check it out the link is below I think it's something like clever programmer to slash create apps with Python there you go what is the best place to find work programming many different places it depends where you interview or you apply for freelancing you can even look at something like upwork.com and then look for Python jobs but then the problem that comes up is how do I know I'm ready to apply there how do I stand out from the crowd and what experience do I need before I start applying there so those are the things I cover in this course as well once you guys join this course message me in the YouTube thing and tell us why you joined it so we can see what your reason behind this is and let me know because I have absolutely no way of knowing when anybody is joining god I hate that ok Shreyas asks are you gonna teach something here I'll teach you something when you're doing coding don't always do programming like on a keyboard before you ever ever ever start coding a problem or coming up with a solution to their project or a specific programming problem in Python Java whatever write it write it with hand and understand the logic in English or in the language of your choice understand that and then go from there I joined yesterday because I want to be able to provide for me my fiance and my future life I think that's what Cody says I totally make sense you know I love that what were you doing before Cody you want to tell that to everybody and tell us how what how do you think of the course so far because you've taken the course a little bit so tell us a little bit about it yeah and in the mean time and answer that question write it down in English understand it like deadon then start coding it it's gonna save you thousands of hours of your time and you're welcome cause ease like the Jesus Christ lookalike you only pick up questions and answers them like a Family Guy there you go perfect description after your beginners course what course is preferred I can't afford your opie course there are a lot of videos that I have on YouTube and then there are a lot of yeah there's a ton of videos and I even have some sequel stuff fqo Academy stuff so there's a ton of stuff that you can start you can keep learning on YouTube Harvard's ethics course really good I game design graduated summa can't find a job in game so I figured okay so he graduated I think in the software of Albarn in games and he couldn't find a job that brings me to another point one of my biggest problems and again the reason behind asteroid clever programmer was I saw a ton of my friends college students who graduated and then they got really sad that they couldn't get a job because a lot of the times the skills taught in colleges are like the polar opposite of what in real world people are looking for when you're applying to those places and that's why you have a lot of trouble getting those jobs and then you wonder why do I have 30 40 50 hundred thousand dollars worth of loans so again you know my course doesn't need you to have a college degree or an experience and it just focuses on getting you going as fast as possible Cody says the course is awesome so far cause II will give you feedback in the slide channel and yep I do so yeah look at that so even with all the crazy that I'm doing I will give you feedback and or everything should i do ITR CSM college CS i hate IT computer science this is a way to go man I just enjoy it a lot you know IT has a future as well but I did IT and I wanted to kill myself every day I'm starting something class I want to know if I have college václav says I'm really think to sign up but it's a lot of money for me so anyway thank you for your videos it really helps if you have any questions let me know if you're on the fence guys you know ask me questions and ask me what's going on and I want to be able to help you okay so if you're if you are interested in looking into it if okay here's what I'm going to tell you for interesting you're not the verge of buying it alright guys sorry the thing is gonna start going offline quite a bit now because lots of people are getting this course and joining the course so I'm probably gonna shut off the live video cuz every time somebody gets the course I get a call and then I have this automated thing that I've coded up and programmed so it tells me your name and it tells me what course you just got so that's yeah I've automated it because programming programming is awesome yeah but ill it'll keep distracting the live event that we're doing so I don't want you guys to get annoyed by it you know what I mean but yeah in the meantime go click that link check out the course get the course here's what I'll tell you if you're on the fence get the course try it out and then you can again I can guarantee you're gonna love it you're but if it's not the right fit for you again I have a 60 day moneyback guarantee that's not offered any other course look at any other course on udemy or anywhere else all have 30 days I stand behind you know what I'm telling you guys and I wouldn't do I wouldn't tell you to do anything that I wouldn't do we're probably gonna get more clients will I be able to pick up chicks after taking your course absolutely that's actually one of the main things that taught us taught in the course by learning computer programming and then you know getting the jobs you want you probably have the confidence to pick up the chicks that you want man this this gets so deep do you accept paypal yes it accepts paypal I'm also a nice human being and I have a payment plan for you guys as well so you can break it down in three months if you can't pay for it once Bouguer thai i don't want to answer that question it's way too specific doesn't help anybody else Paul Garcia what was your question I'm starting to keep messing it up you yes you can pay using debit card I don't yeah you can you can pay it using debit card what type of Python programming did you do to make money game web app bug bounty web apps gaming there isn't a lot of money unfortunately are you comfortable telling us your income range that you're raking in at this point in your life at all the coding knowledge you have I will tell you that like last one or two years I've been consistently making over a few like a hundred thousand dollars so and that was when I was 20 and 21 years old so yeah that's what I will openly tell you guys what was the longest line of code that you have written on not a month a year um longest line of code and again keep in mind that I'm also working on my own terms like for example when I go to California and I'm going with my brothers or I'm going out with my friends to ski lift or skydive or whatever a lot of the times I'm declining clients so if I just want to go all out and when you can then obviously you can earn a higher level income so we'll yeah I I stopped doing lots of donations but it's actually a lot of fun when you guys did super chat before I think I used to have a lot of donation things because the channel was kind of starting out and now I don't want to do that I just wanna you know if it's free material I want to just have it be free and not have you guys worry about donating or anything but if it's a paid course of paid course if you still want to donate or you want to kind of support the channel because it is helpful you know because off of donations I'll get things like this beautiful microphone and then all the quality of the videos are great you can go to my patreon channel so things called like patreon.com slash clever programmer and then you can become a patron and then it's like a monthly thing no I'm not getting annoyed by your guys's questions alright so guys this is it I'm probably gonna take some more questions for like 30 seconds and then I'm out this is longer Thank You Omar Gomez for sending the $2 a really cool another monster for me um take a little very few questions guys I gotta run I gotta get going in the meantime check out the course it's in the link below create apps with Python helps you land clients you get lifetime access for this it's a nononsense practical Python projects and applications so you can start putting on your portfolio I teach you how to get clients where to get clients how to keep clients how you can make the transition to becoming a software consultant in less than three months and much more all of this cover in this course I sound like like a radio host but you know it is what it is it's true the link is below clever clever programmer to slash create apps width Python somebody please put it in the chat that would be great but the link should be in the description below unless something weird happen the next livestream I think happens to p.m. Thursday on Pacific time but I mean I kind of doublecheck that and then schedule it for you guys IDE sublime text when you're starting out I use pie chart but that's for pros this thing is like so nice you know it's very comfortable you guys should have like a nice comfortable chair so when you're programming you know you can do it like a pro yeah it's a great chair okay guys um anybody who gets this course in the next let's say 15 minutes you can email me and then we can also do like a oneonone but it'll be like 10 minutes or 15 minute call okay we can do it oneonone and I will you know if any questions you have about is this even a right decision for me do you actually think I'm too old or not smart enough to do this should I invest my time and energy with all the stuff that's going on in my family and all the other stuff that I'm doing is this a career switch that I can actually be making I will give you that call free of cost to you okay but if you join in the next 15 minutes so that will be one of those things that's like the bonus okay but other than that guys I'm gonna get going thank you guys so much for being here thank you thank you thank you so much as always I love you guys this channel is seriously wouldn't exist without you we are fifty five thousand subscribers plus strong and normally growing and let's get to 60,000 70,000 hundred thousand right let's do this thing thank you guys take care as always I love you and I'll see you in the next video
