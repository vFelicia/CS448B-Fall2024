what's up guys how are you guys doing this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com super amazing to get started this early in the morning it's actually what time is it it's 7 25 a.m for this live stream pacific so if you're in chicago or in you're in new york i think it'll be it'll be a little bit later right and then if you are in michigan it should be about 10 something a.m 10 25 a.m and yeah just let me know where you guys coming in from are you guys coming in is anybody here from new york or chicago welcome guys so today guys i want to talk about alter ego and productivity i think this is very important for developers for people in general i mean i just call the developers at the end because i think it makes it relevant to everybody but this is something that has been on top of my mind for a while we got people from mexico fortune from dallas from hungary nice switzerland ruth aye alexander mexico killed london let's go in a ukraine melbourne berkeley hungary nepal nice you guys awesome so keep the chat clean guys if anybody is uh doing anything more than once just block them don't even give a warning so it just keeps it clean now this is something i've been thinking about for the last few days and it's something that's been on top of my mind and it's something i want to share with everybody i hope it brings you value but one thing that i've been realizing is as my time gets tighter and tighter and there are more challenges and restrictions and responsibilities that i have to face what i get left with is a lot of competing priorities that need to fit in a 24hour time span probably resonates with a lot of you but the problem comes in is when you feel like you cannot fill that 24hour time span with all of the things that you actually want to do and so you sometimes get in this cycle of damn am i doing enough do i need to do more and just sometimes like not being as effective as you can be and so for me yo what's up corey how you doing yeah i think gigi ball asks are you an introvert yeah i think i'm an introvert who has developed the capabilities to be an extrovert when i need to be but i think like i just i prefer probably being an introvert more and so i started this off with my instagram stories and i started just like writing out my thoughts at night and i just shared them with with people in general and then like these thoughts that i had shared started getting a ton of engagement from the people and so i thought it might be a good thing to do a video on it might just bring value to everybody so started off with me just kind of realizing i was like time to admit it i haven't been doing what i need to be doing so one area of my life that i've been really lacking in is working out hard and i haven't been doing that i kept using corona as an excuse and i would always say i'll just train once the gyms open up it'll be fine for now i'll just focus on clever programmer the truth is i haven't done [ __ ] all i was watching my content from a year and a half ago and i saw myself and i was becoming a [ __ ] monster i was fast powerful i was quick and explosive i was like training lifting hard in the gym i was doing kickboxing i was doing jiu jitsu there were so many things that i was doing i was rapidly improving in boxing strength and speed was on my [ __ ] and going hard and i feel like that's kind of what made me who i am today right even if i look back in 2017 i was waking up oftentimes at 5 5 30 a.m i would go lift really hard then i would go and like read books and learn and then i would go and do other things now one reason i feel like i haven't been physically doing a lot of training is because i miss lifting weights i don't know if this you guys ever feel that i know some people like body weights but for me it's like body weight just doesn't do the trick for me and i don't really enjoy it as much as getting on a heavy like deadlift or a squat i also like love hitting hard so whether i'm doing boxing or kickboxing just the feeling of like you got something there to hit on like that's a good feeling whereas shadowboxing is not that fun it's cool but again all excuses however those things did stop me now a few things that even if it comes to the parallel that i can draw for you between me training my body and new training maybe coding is there are a few things that i say that i think could be really relevant to you right so for me one i'm gonna start off by having some solutions so one of the solution that i decided to come up with is finding places that are open to work out that have that equipment which not many places to set up speakers upstairs in my house so i can blast music and get equipment in my house as well so change for me that means like changing my environment and sometimes even if you want to code or you're trying to work on something changing the your environment can help number three i said neural rewiring and what i meant by is record and watch myself train every single night recording an ungodly amount of instagram stories and then watching myself train when i'm going to sleep that is going to keep rewiring my brain and keep me mentally sharp lifting and working out and kickboxing that was stuff i never wanted to do i had to develop the habit of it by recording myself through literally doing instagram stories by the end of the day i would have these tiny little dots at the top and then what i would do is i would just tap through them at night before i'd be going to sleep and i would watch myself working out the beauty of that was i felt primed when i woke up the next day i felt like a lion just ready to go and i would just boom if you documented your journey of becoming a developer and you wrote things and you took stories of yourself coding even whether it's time lapses or photos or just you coding and you watched it at night i promise that would rewire you to want to code the next day as well and number five or number four was immersion for me which was i had to force myself to break out of the pattern of watching dumb garbage at night so i have this habit of watching chess i love chess absolutely love it so every single night i've been watching chess you know every time i'm about to go to sleep every time i have any down time like if i have to wait one second for you like literally if you and i were hanging out you're like bro i'm gonna go grab a bottle of water if we're talking i'll be chatting with you what's up bro how you doing like hey but if there was like one second or you're like bro i'm gonna go and grab a drink you know i'm gonna go and i'm gonna hit the restroom and i'll be right back i will open up chess and i will play a speed chess game of like two minutes right one minute bullet chess so that was my pat i was watching all the stuff at night and so i thought okay i need to replace that with something that's entertaining so i still feel like i'm snacking and it's fun but it's instead the things that i want my life to look like right so for example chess is not gonna really help my lifestyle even though i enjoy it but what i started watching was i started watching like max tuning's vlogs on fitness and that was basically a really good thing for immersion for me which was just it immersed me in the world of fitness so hmm okay that is annoying somebody just keeps like sending me the same message again and again and again and again on my instagram so it just keeps buzzing my phone and literally like sir can you please fix my header.js header.js file just copy it and just pasting it pasting it enter enter like if they did it maybe 700 times that would get my attention and maybe i'd help out but anyways so i thought okay immersion so let me immerse myself in things that can improve my life that meant for me watching tick tocks instagram content or youtube content stuff that i was going to do anyway but now i want it to be designed to actually change my behavior to do the thing that i want to do i remember when i used to want to code more i would watch crazy amount of content on coding all the time nonstop and i would try to find entertaining content so i could watch it before i would be sleeping so yeah that was that was the part of immersion that i wanted to do now i want to talk about like alter ego i'm breaking it down with alter ego and then ego okay so that's two things so alter ego being your devil right and then ego being your angel side so they're not technically correct terms i'm sure somebody the psychologist will be like no you're talking about ig ego and your id or some weird stuff like that that's okay that's just how i'm defining them so just follow along with me and hopefully it'll give some perspective so i'm i wrote here i'm like i have a very powerful alter ego it's what makes me deeply want to outwork everyone's face and prove them wrong which also makes me an [ __ ] seem arrogant offend people i've had to learn a lot i have had to learn to let a lot of it go in order to become a better leader the pro of subduing my alter ego i wrote is made me a better leader less threatening polite inclusive empathetic emotional caring loving understanding introspective and develop other leaders so focusing so much on that side of me um but yeah so by letting kind of go of my alter you go the thing that drove me so i remember back in 2017 i was just like go like qazi like you're the best like i had so many things that i would actually say that i kind of cringe and saying right now but i'm like nobody can [ __ ] outwork me my work is the best work like i will work your face like i will outwork you when it comes to coding like i will make something better than you can i will outlift you i will like pretty much anything you can think of i would tell myself and because i was a oneman army i really needed that part of me to be alive like kind of that animalistic part right where when fight or flight kicks in you go in this place you go in this mode we all have that place you don't all you're not always there but what about like when it comes to protecting somebody in your family or there's something there's somebody disrespects somebody that you care about right we all have that like animalistic mode i used a lot of that to initially build myself up and to grow my channel and to put in the work and to do coding and you know to be able to do the 15 to 16 hours a day of work now that was the positive side of letting my alter ego go which was you know becoming a better leader more empathetic does that kind of make sense i hope so looking in the chat frank says why low on energy no i'm just it's just a morning bro and i'm just chilling by myself so no really reason to be crazy high energy but you know i can be but not i'm just i'm kind of in my deep reflective mode which you know i'm actually kind of like this one i'm just thinking i'm by myself like i'm thinking i'm not always like yo what's up guys like you know like i'm not sitting like normally by myself doing that so okay all right so all right anyways now the con of it i felt like was it made me uh soft never outworking or outshining anyone and literally even in the yeah like sometimes i was even telling the team i'm like guys sometimes i literally don't go into team meetings because i feel like when i go there it scares the people or they don't want to talk a lot so when i'm there i'm actually genuinely sometimes not trying to share ideas which is my fault right and me not having me not have a good communication skills but i'm like i don't want to outshine anybody and then i would feel like some of the team members would get quiet or they maybe felt intimidated or something so those are the cons but then i don't get to sharpen my sword right if i'm helping a lot of other people sharpen their sword and maybe if you feel like that you're helping a lot of other people sharpen their sword it won't actually help you that much sometimes and so i felt that the biggest pro and the biggest con of killing give me one second so yeah i felt like the biggest problem the biggest con of killing my alter ego in one sentence was i can develop leaders at my expense now here's what i feel like actually needs to happen i kind of need to learn how to switch it on and off and that's something i haven't learned yet and the alter ego has helped me achieve a lot of things right so the the whole thing about being a one man army now it's a mind [ __ ] between alter ego and like nonalter ego right so when i even say that think when i say alter ego think michael jordan when i say nonalter ego maybe think bill gates michael jordan was the type of leader that just put in so much [ __ ] work and worked so hard that he made you want to step up and if you didn't want to step up he would just tell you get the [ __ ] out of here steve jobs was also a alter alter ego based leader where a lot of people said he was not a nice person he was an [ __ ] and he also created a distortion field but they didn't like him that much now i don't think there's anything wrong with being a leader like that by the way like if you are if you have to get stuff done like it's remarkable today i have an iphone it wouldn't have happened if steve jobs didn't like follow through on his mission but then on the other side you have nonalter ego based leader or i what i just call ego leader is like martin luther king and martin luther king this guy is not he's working hard to develop other people into leaders but he's not trying to out not just by purely outworking them right he's actually just coaching them and guiding them to become better like mahatma gandhi is an ego based leader he truly sacrificed himself to grow others and i feel like an elon musk is a alter ego based leader where he's like yo i'll actually sometimes put my desk in the middle of everybody so everybody can watch me outwork everybody else so both are good ways how do you want to be remembered i don't want to be remembered like that i want to be remembered like somebody who you know like who gave up things for the people and who cared for the people and who yeah like to me the legacy of it really matters and i don't know maybe i don't have as a big enough of a purpose as elon musk that's also possible um but i care more about the people and i feel like instead of sometimes even being right we should do right now is this something you have figured out how to actually deal with and if you have i would actually love to know if you guys would drop that in the comments like what is the balance between being a leader versus somebody who makes you feel like you're always in their shadow and and this is another thing i wrote on alter ego and alter ego basically goes like i got me here i put in the hard work years and years of belief work vision commitment to my dreams and a relentless work ethic nobody's opinion [ __ ] matters not even the people who are on this live stream not even the people who are [ __ ] commenting not even the people who have been there and cared every single day nobody's opinion matters if i had to do it all over again from scratch i will clever programmer died the youtube channel went away instagram channel went away every single student went away every single customer went away i will build it again i'm never gonna give up if they can't keep up they can leave michael jordan did that to his team in the book relentless tim grover talks about it they all hated him but everyone stepped up steve jobs did that too now on the nonalter ego side i want to work hard to develop leaders on the team even if it means some of my things get sacrificed everyone on the team has more potential than me and i want to work my face off to bring that out with care and a [ __ ] ton of empathy human beings are the ultimate asset my team doesn't serve me i serve them you guys watching this video don't serve me i serve you everybody needs to be treated fairly and equally don't be right do right now i want to ask you guys is it fair are both ways of looking at life fair what do you think let's see a servant leader i'm better with my alter ego too pretty anxious says frank says what do you think of other youtubers like nick white nothing bad i think they're just doing what they need to do um even the negative video he made on me like no harm i feel like if it helped him grow his channel then great like so now those are the two sides right the alter ego versus the ego side the alter ego is like it's probably not right we should swim for defamation the ego side is he's also a human being he doesn't know me that much he saw an ad he made a video on it and he moved on and it grew his channel so maybe in some way i helped him and he just grew and you know maybe because of that video people are finding out about clever programmer and maybe at some point they realize oh yo there's actually good stuff alter ego versus ego so yeah so this is what i yeah i think so trevitti says i think ego can be beneficial in certain situations but in most cases overall i think alter ego slash empathy and relationship is the way to go okay the point i was yeah so i think you're you're right on i understand what you're saying but on the alter ego side i kind of was saying that that's the devil that's what i was calling the devil atharva says i saw your comment on nick white video you were a lot polite to him yeah cause like look i can be right but i wanna do right right like five or ten years from now i don't want to even say anything to him that like i just i don't feel a crazy personal attack right and so to me he's producing content he's trying to help people and that's great you know how many people i'd rather have somebody trying to create content than not create content right so it is what it is few faces i think it's all a matter of interpretation anything can be a good thing or a bad thing like a tool so yeah so basically i thought okay both of these are fair ways of looking at life right now which one is better in your opinion would you say you guys probably can't read it but would you say alter ego is better like your devil or ego is better your angel and i don't want you to give me a [ __ ] answer just because like angel sounds better but like ego leaders right where mahatma gandhi martin luther king bill gates in my opinion and alter ego leaders i felt like were michael jordan steve jobs elon musk right alter ego leaders are just very driven by their own vision to the point where they kind of don't care about people ego leaders are driven by the people so much so that they like you know care more about them than almost anything else atharva says alter ego java p says i landed a job okay if it's true just send me an instagram message with proof a huge says i want to be a future content creator and you are my inspiration thank you bro minix says you landed me a freaking awesome job man and flipping 17 hey nice bro short film says alter ego gives you more power el manana says ego okay nice yeah guys you're gonna get blocked just don't spam the chat therma is on it prion shoes on it too there's they're racing against each other um yeah so few phase says it doesn't need to be either or we need to be able to turn one each one whenever it's necessary trivedi says brother i think we all look at all things these are black and white but it is so much more complex and interconnected with each other and that's just being a human being so you see yeah i think that's where the answer lies i think that's beautiful what you guys are saying i think it's a balance and i think it's just how you want to live your life and how you want to be remembered but i think that balance kind of never ends yeah and that's what i wrote too on my instagram story that day and i was like i imagine should i read it like this looks good on camera i basically said i imagine the right answer is a mixture of both but that's so much goddamn easier said than done for me i said ultimately i want to be i want to develop leaders and be a servant leader i want to be an ego beast uh ego based leader but i really don't want to lose the alter ego side of me that goes really hard and so that's the balance that gets tricky and that's the side of me that comes out and protecting my team so alter ego side is what comes out when it's time to protect my team when i'm fighting or training and doing really hard things and when you know stuff hits the fan and i gotta make some serious decisions that's when i'm like boom the other quasi right the quasi that's not on youtube a lot the kazoo on youtube is just the nice causey fun causey hype good hype good energy but you know like there's not a lot of times i have to fight people on youtube you know so it's like yeah and then it started great conversations on the ig story so i'm just gonna kind of skip um skip over them let's see yeah and then i think that that was kind of that was the end of that thought that i had at least for that day let me go back and then yeah like the the text thread is great i'm just seeing so a few things that it started off with then i started having a conversation with logan who also comes on this channel actually quite a bit on youtube and he'll be here a bunch and i started talking with logan um and logan was like i can't say i've been in that position myself but he goes the leaders i've had and loved were always exceptional at recognizing people's strengths and allowing them to explore those traits themselves while also being capable of kind and direct conversation exposing weakness and their technical craft and what i was talking to logan about as well is i said before when i didn't have a team when i didn't have a lot of students i didn't have the people on youtube i didn't have you guys i didn't have customers in pwj or profit with python 80 to 90 of the focus was just me right what do i need to learn what do i need to cause like one of the problems i've been having recently is a lot of my time is spent making content here on youtube a lot of my time is spent with the community of pwj a lot of my time is spent with the team and so the thing that was getting neglected oftentimes was my own learning because i miss learning learning is what got me here i used to learn for 10 to 15 hours a day and i personally started feeling like man i'm not learning as much as i used to be able to and i miss that feeling and i don't want to like to be honest like being an expert is cool but like i just miss being a learner and then just sharing insights with you guys that's how i was when i was growing clever programmers just like i would learn something and just share and i was like whoa learn and share it and so there's that other part of the ego that comes in that's like well now i'm an expert and so now i don't learn i just like share stuff but then you kind of start sounding like a broken record and i like to have my own learning going at all times and sometimes it's at odds with what other things i'm doing because if i'm learning and fulfilling what i want to do for my brain then oftentimes i'm actually not either developing team members or providing content for the people if that makes sense mindlean says don't you think it's based on the situation of the person to the situation where mahatma gandhi was and where elon musk is totally different so i say it's based on situation i mean i'm sure but yeah but like still i feel like he's his goal was different and his leadership style was different right like there was a difference between malcolm x and martin luther king even though they had similar goals and they were around similar times malcolm x and martin luther king was like yo no violence at any cost right malcolm x was still a great leader but i think there were times where that kind of happened i don't know i'm not really good that good at history by the way so i could just be making stuff up author says you guys took the efforts pretty much just says we pwg students are here for you and your but uh and you're bad in your good times thank you bro like i appreciate that that's huge so and i think you know it's a balance of admiration from other people versus admiration from yourself because sometimes if you're just working really hard on other people they will give you admiration but or you're like hey do i get at um should i have admiration for this so for example let's say i'm putting out nonstop content on youtube right and just teaching insane amount of concepts it's fun it's uh it's fulfilling too don't get me wrong i enjoy it we all enjoy it but you will respond to me and you will be like yo quasi you're like awesome bro like you're putting out so much content you're helping people and you might feel like that now on the other hand what if that same day i didn't hit the gym what if that same day i didn't learn do i have the same amount of admiration for myself and i have to you know you know what i mean so it's like i can get admiration from you but then there's this other part of admiration from myself too and i think those are also things that you can definitely everything has a solution so i don't want any of this that comes off like i know some people in the comments are like college you have like low energy man you're sad like we're here for you guys i'm not sad i don't have long energy i'm just like being reflective and there's always a solution for example i can probably just go hard in the morning and have morning time to learn and to train really hard and then the rest of the day i can focus on producing content and then evening i can like actually reflect that's very very possible it comes down to being effective and having good time management right and it might be easy for me to look into your life and be like boom that's the answer but when you look at your own life it's a little bit harder to you know like it's weird it's like harder to balance certain things out so so yeah those were a few of the things that were on my mind and um i'm just going through the text thread that we had right and pretty much ultimately like i started having a conversation with a bunch of people at that time on instagram and we were going really deep into it but ultimately i just came to that balance is not gonna go away but in order to feed your own thing i call it like take the devil out for a walk so take your alter ego out for a walk every single day because i think of people like dwayne johnson the rock i think of people like joe rogan how are these people they're animals right but then at the same time they're very calm and loving to people and caring and mild tempered and they don't have these random they don't get frustrated and have these random things happen right it made me realize you need to have good outlets to let that devil out for a walk if you don't it's going to come out in other weird ways it's going to come out on your own people on your own team members but maybe in the mornings for me what it means is having disciplined time to work out to learn to maybe even get on these podcast style of videos and share because i get a lot of insight from you guys as well and that can be like my growing time and then after that it's like sharing you know the things that um yeah just sharing the things that i've picked up on so maybe for you what does that mean maybe for you it means you know what what are you feeling like do you feel like you're giving yourself enough time or are you always just giving other people time and doing things for other people if you are not then maybe you need to have just a very strict disciplined thing in the morning where that's your time and it's untouchable no communication no contact just you focused on you doing your thing for maybe three four five hours for me sometimes it also means waking up as early as four a.m if i have to because if it's important to me i'll i'll do it and if four to seven or four to eight they're like four hours where i can just go hard and like learn and reflect and you know lift and do kickboxing or whatever it is i think i will be so freaking happy with myself like that gives me admiration from me because i'm learning and training sharpening my sword right and then the rest of the day i can help other people sharpen theirs and that would be just clean balance ajit says bro whenever i get demotivated i watch your videos and this will help me to boosting my development hell yeah i thought it says if you smell what the rock is cooking damn we got deep on this one boys and girls there's a lot but bradley knox says interestingly i give myself way too much time trying to become a very well skilled developer to the point that i don't spend time with my children enough but i'm on a time limit and my burn rate is high so there's that few faces i'm quite the opposite i can hit the gym every single day but bringing myself to code that's the hard thing that's what i'm saying it's whatever mode you're in right like i will tell you that i was going hard at the gym last year so hard i was training six to eight hours a day in the morning i would have a power lifting session so i'm doing my deadlifts my squats my overhead presses and i was getting heavy on them for my body weight um i got so i would do that then in the afternoon i would go and run and i would do a lot of cardio i would do kickboxing and then at night time then i would go at seven or eight pm drive one and a half hour just one way to a jiu jitsu gym it was eddie bravo's jiu jitsu gym i think planet ten planet tenth planet right ten planet jiu jitsu i would go there and i would train and i'm learning all this like crazy [ __ ] like the the the leg locks and all this you know they're more focused actually on leg locks and even like guillotine or some of the other stuff which is super cool and it's really practical so i'm like learning that and i love their nogi like that's so much i hate wearing the freaking ghee and you know putting that on i just love like the nogi so i would train uh jiu jitsu for one or two hours and i was effectively training for a total of seven to eight hours a day and i was enjoying it then i would come back and all i would do is watch jiu jitsu on my tv till i just crashed and knocked out right and then woke up the next day and then i would just repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat so really good at mastering something and then just immersing and doing it and just going all out hot really bad at like like a little of this today a little of this look that balance it just something i have to keep working on sueta says let's see mac talk if someone wants to go for web development in future what tech would you recommend to learn apart from react i mean you will need to know a few things so i'd recommend learning firebase so you can actually host your app and have a database i would recommend learning node node.js i would recommend learning about apis i would recommend learning about microservices whether you learn it through firebase or aws elijah fuller says dividing attention for me is really hard as well okay i ayush says you are like an elder brother to me and i truly wish to have a meet up with you as soon as this pandemic ends and it would be an honor guys i gotta run i really appreciate you i don't know how did you guys like this i want to do more stuff like this it's it just really speaks to me like what we kind of talked about today and how we just got in depth just about life i really really enjoyed it like personally and i feel like if we can have conversations like these i think a lot of the solution is just sometimes having conversations like these as well because it just opens your mind to so many different possibilities and ways of looking at life so yeah freaky this was like really really great and i would love to do more of these if you guys are down priyanji says do it quasi i'll be there awesome bro thank you was really good thank you for the knowledge awesome bro nice to see you if you not feel better you can contact me always ready to help a dharva man i'm telling you guys like i am i'm not like um and i i really appreciate that by the way so thank you for that that actually does mean a lot but i just want to be clear like i'm not sad or in a depressed state like if i was i would let you guys know like i'm actually i used to be very embarrassed of that oh i can't tell people but i would let you know like last year in august i was kind of depressed and i was just freaking sad but right now i'm not like that at all i'm actually even right now in a really good headspace but i'm just in quiet reflective mode so my energy will be very different than my regular youtube videos right and so there's going to be a difference like my regular youtube videos i'm like yo what is up guys how's it going this is qazi atharva how are you doing today bro really really nice to see you priyanshu man beautiful this is epic it's a it's a switch i can turn it on turn it off it's not a fake part of me but it's just it's it's a part of me if i need to be lit and have epic energy i can turn it on if i don't i just need to chill i can turn it off and turning it off allows me to go deeper into my thought because when i'm in the other mode i'm all like i'm just kind of good at speaking getting to what you're saying fast it's kind of like my garyvee mode but this is like where i can actually consume this is where i'm like i empty out what i know like i empty out the water bottle and i'm i'm ready to listen i'm ready to learn says cause you love when you share your true self with us you sound emotional today we need more videos like this this is the energy let's go the extroverted programmer yeah 800k subs this weekend guys let's [ __ ] go hey so really excited about the 800 sub 800k subs hopefully a million soon humans are a dynamic bradley cell i understand the mode you are in thank you brother guys with that said i'm gonna bounce i i have a team meeting love you guys let's do this more often you guys are amazing thank you so much for coming this was fun all right guys love you bye peace you
