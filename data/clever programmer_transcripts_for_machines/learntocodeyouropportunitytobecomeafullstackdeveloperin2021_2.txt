you're able to become a developer unraveling the myths behind becoming a developer how to get started with code and how to build and host your own portfolio online okay all right so really quickly as well very important guys this has never been done before or it hasn't been done you know in a long time let me ask you this who is sick of just online stuff who is sick of these online things not seeing people not going anywhere who's sick of that i know what happened who is sick of that raise your hand me me me a lot of people i know me too me too so what we are doing this is this is our first javascript conference javascript tour 2021 that's right this is our first conference but we will bring all that we know in terms of how we bring to the challenges but now into our inperson event it's a first inperson event it is happening in los angeles california from august 6 to august 8th every single day between 9 a.m and 5 p.m pacific time standard time okay we have already the venue booked near lax airport right it's all set up we're going to have guest speakers for example we're going to have a ceo we're going to have the ceo hackernoon come on in and become a guest speaker we'll have a few other guest speakers come in talk about so many topics guys you will get to learn things like i mean besides just learning now what's the most important thing about these conferences is one what is it well part part of it is networking networking that's right oh let me see not working you will be part of an amazing community right you will learn some upcoming technologies like for example typescript oh it's all disappearing it's okay like for example typescript right like for example tail and css right like for example you know react.js will have amazing workshops with react.js with tail and css typescript we will have amazing workshops and guest speakers come in and talk about their opportunity we'll have mastermind workshops for example where you guys get the chance to work on your mindset right mastermind workshops we will have workshops around money so as a developer how do you actually make money and how do you reinvest that money right so investing money and so much more but the most important is that this is not this just covers like the nothing of it okay jesse what's some of the most important things that we'll learn from this i think the most important thing is to see that once you learn code all of the beautiful things that are possible for you all the beautiful technologies the tailwind the typescript the you know those are all frameworks but we're also going to be talking about you know what's artificial intelligence what's you know other technologies hardware basically getting you guys introduced to the world of technology and especially this is so important when you want to make a career switch into software development let's say no because i often see people very focused only on programming learning the language itself but actually not knowing what you can really really do with it how cool would it be you started programming for example and suddenly you realize wow i could make a virtual reality game i could do game development i could you know invent the next alexa stuff like that you know and that's really important with these kind of conferences to get openminded to broaden your horizon basically and meet likeminded people of course most important thing guys is going to be your connections that you meet on here okay there will be over 100 people at the event so basically what i'm trying to say here say here is be there because the thing is the connections you make are the most important important things you do in life for example for me right the way i became who i am is because the connections that i have all of my jobs that i had as developer were because of the connections that i have right even being here clever programmer to teach you right now right to have all these courses to have the boot camps it was all because the connections that i had okay connections are the key and this might be the missing link in your career up and coming careers developer you guys might be struggling you guys i think figuring out hey how do i just keep going how do i just keep doing this well the what's missing link here is you just don't know every do not know anybody let me ask you this who does not know anybody right now around development recording so many people look at this but yet you want to go into that field how does that work out right you want to go into that field but yet at the same time you don't know anybody in that field raise your hand if you agree with me that if you want to go somewhere you have to find people who are already there and learn from them do you agree with that do you agree with that 100 that's right so let me ask you this anybody here interested in coming the javascript tour maybe you're in los angeles maybe you're in a different state raise your hand if you're interested in coming to the tour raise your hand nice a lot of people a lot of people great great great so we only have a few tickets left we only have a few tickets left okay um we'll go ahead and

have the tickets linked on youtube as well thank you all right yes okay cool let's go and continue on so a few things i want to talk about uh so three things important to you the money let me ask this question i want to put in the chat what are the three things important more important to you than money what are the three things tell me tell me time food family food family family nice creating religion okay fun good health peace god okay family chilling nice a lot of family i see a lot of family i agree with that okay let's not there's some weird ones too there's some weird ones too right doing what you love that's a big one i agree with that one right so you know for me for example jesse what is the three things that more important to you than money let me ask you that jesse make an impact on the world okay i'm doing what i love and be creative so impact yes impact right do what you love what you love right being creative creative for me for example you know for me it's doing what you love is a big one for sure it's actually in family family friends relationships relationships honestly i think if that's the only thing i have in life that's all i need honestly doing what doing what i love and the familyfriend relationship that's all i need honestly um so then i'm covered you know life is complete i can die and i'm just kidding but don't say that dude i'm kidding i'm kidding of course so what can what can making money as developer help you achieve in your life let me ask you that question now put that in the chat now okay okay let me see what can making money is developer jesse what can making money developer achieve may help you achieve in your life let me ask you well for me and everyone's christian careers um one thing and it's also one of the most important values in my life i guess is freedom so so money is equal to freedom but also i like doing the remote working style as a developer being able to work from home or from any place that i want to work with who that i who i want you know um yeah basically flexibility that'll be cool to go from anywhere in the world that to me is the best if you if you had the chance to work from anywhere in the world who would love that yeah i know i know that would be amazing that would be amazing i'll thank you guys because i live in amsterdam but i work with the guys who are based in l.a absolutely look at how that goes that works that right there breaks the barrier you're thinking hey you know what but i'm in this country and i don't have any jobs in this country that by the way just breaks the barrier fully okay in that there's jobs everywhere now and because of the internet you can technically be at that place as well so it breaks that barrier for you so easily okay guys nice okay financial freedom support your family right having more time to spend with your loved ones these are these are so such important things now let's figure out your income goals okay how much income do you want to make per month as a developer okay let me ask you that question i'll have something a lot tenth day per month guys let's be realistic guys now don't don't tell me a hundred thousand dollars per month okay that's not realistic okay adrienne are we reaching for the stars let me say as much as jeff bezos okay so uh jesse what's a good income income per month when you when they start out when developers start out tell me um i think it depends a little bit where you live for example so i know that californian software developers might earn more than on the east coast um but european software developers earn even more than american ones not always really you guys what depends depends where you work that's what you want that's not cool it depends what's funny when you work as a european for an american company in europe then that's when you earn more somehow anyways um so it depends where you live first of all guys second is um what's a good start well if you're doing first if you're being hired as an intern that's of course very different from if you're being hired as a full stack junior developer of course that's right that's right that's right that's right so i think you know more about it give me give me a number just just give me a number i think 50k dollars it would be a good start 50 to 70k dollars annual income annually so that would per month that would be around probably three thousand to four thousand a month okay yeah three thousand a month okay okay thank god per month okay so 4 000 per month okay is is a good average income you might start out with as you become more of a student developer you're looking to increase that you know 5k 6k 7k i know ten thousand dollars to fifty thousand dollars just developers making three hundred thousand dollars per year yeah that's an income that's possible do you want to freelance or full time that's a good question there's freelance okay and there's full time what's your decision let me ask you that freelance or full time free lens for lens or maybe even both maybe you want to do both maybe you want to do both like jesse what would you what do you like about what do you like most both but i like freelance a little bit more okay so you like both but you like freelance why is that so this is the thing there's always i always say like you know a coin always has two sides right if you're a freelancer that's great you got all the flexibility you can do whatever you want basically but it also sometimes means you have to work 24 7 and also acquire clients yourself however when you do when you're working fulltime in office the clients come to you well if your company is doing good right um and then you're working there plus you have a team you have a support you have you know teammates you can learn from when you're freelancing you're often by yourself unless you create your own team but when you start out as a freelancer that's often not the case okay so it depends a little bit i like to combine it um freelance for me would be more like a hobby that just pays me you know doing something for fun and then get paid for it but um yeah so there are there's just depends on what your lifestyle is and what you like that's right that's right that's right a lot of people are saying full time i'm looking at a chat right now a lot of people are saying full time a lot of people saying um okay a lot of people by the way tutorial if you guys look at the tutorial tutorial is going to begin tomorrow guys today is the opportunity to become a developer okay guys all right let's see both both freelance both both both yeah of course there's ups and downs with with either so with freelance it's awesome because that gives free that's freedom i see this as more of a freedom role where you can work from anywhere you want you decide when you want to go out we decide when you want to stop work but the issue with that is you're pretty much working every single day like it's not easy to get clients it's not easy to actually you know uh be someone who's credited that takes time like to be somebody who on upwork makes a lot of money that takes time so i want to want you guys to be realistic with this at the same time okay don't think that you can be on the beach coding and making a [ __ ] ton of money you know uh but and that's it it doesn't work that way it's it's [ __ ] hard okay and i'll just i'm i'm looking that following i'm using the file language too because for a purpose because i want to say that you know what this is actually really hard okay full time also really hard but with full time the cool thing is is you can get a job as a developer and even as a junior developer and you can be learning amongst a lot of people you see that's the thing with freelancers you're pretty much on your own that's the only issue that i have with that so your opportunity to become developer in 2021 okay what do we know about what do we know jesse okay well we know a few things we know the fact that a web developer position are growing like crazy right since 2014 i mean if you look at this the tech industry has always been booming and it's still booming to this day and it's not going to stop we know that for sure okay well developers computer jobs all jobs in general look at this all jobs are booming seven percent computer jobs are booming at 12 with developer jazza booming 27 and what are you guys learning here javascript html css tailwind css it is what is it jesse it is web development web development exactly okay look at this a thou one million more jobs than students by 2020 what does this mean whoa there's a lot more so think about the list it's like this is this is what this means there's demand uh one the demand is high yeah demand is high the supply is low supply is low okay yeah supply of developers so anybody know her economics anybody know economics anybody who knows economics what happens if the supply is low but demand is high what happens who knows put in the chat what happens then price goes up that's right this means this together this together means price and when i say price i mean your income goes up dramatically that's what happens when the supply is low demand is high the price goes up like crazy that's right so we look at it as well this means that there is a 500 billion opportunity 1.4 million competing jobs and only 400 000 computer students to computer science students so that is not a lot comparably that means your income will just keep going up and up and up comprehending plus you don't need to study computer you don't need to be a computer science student in order to become a developer that's right that's right nowadays you don't need nowadays you can go into a bootcamp developer nowadays you can start on your own and be a developer either one works okay here are some software engineers salaries guys that that work here we have soft engineering salaries in the us and again i'm suggesting us just for the purpose of you know because we're in us but um this is since january 2021 we've got ios developers making over 122 thousand dollars this is average by the way it's just average wow yeah yeah yeah android 121 000. look at this javascript developers 31 right there 112 dollars and again this is average i know people who are making more than this i know people who are making two hundred thousand dollars but i also know people who are making sixty thousand dollars and fifty thousand dollars right so there's there's two sides of the coin the better you get as developer then what happens the battery gas developer the more knowledge you know the more experience you have what happens to your income boom boom it goes up of course right so but it's up to you to make it happen it's not up to anybody else besides who you okay you i know somebody said php's still there i know it's right oh my god no php honestly php is still not bad i i still did code with php with laravel uh it's still a pretty good framework every time i mention php though you you crack up i know i just i don't like it but it's there okay it's there and it works okay next up remote work during clover 19 look at this 62 percent of us employees are working from home due to cove 19. 62 guys 62 percent wait do you hear anything by the way yeah i don't know what that is somebody's airco or something i got this i got this i got this okay no everybody's muted all right i'm back okay now it's better yeah it's better now great so 60 percent facebook apple all these companies say you know what no need no need for an office who loves working remotely anybody adrian says i love it working in pajamas is awesome i know i do too i do too i'm working remotely right now i mean i'm attacking an office here but i'm working from my home right now that's right so why javascript is something that's a good question why javascript anybody here knows why javascript who knows why javascript well i have a very simple answer for it because i love it and because i think you should love it too it's as simple as that okay it's as simple as that so why do you love it nice i don't know it's just so good you know it's just like it's like but what makes it so good then because you cannot just love something because it's sure you can why not it's just so good who says i love it too but yeah i just like it i like it but yeah so why do you why do you love a jesse here's a good question why do you like it jesse so what i like about javascript is that um syntax is compared to other programming languages like c or java it's pretty um what's the english word um it's like a language like a natural language normal language okay that said at the same time you know what i noticed with python for example um if you do things in python you don't really know what's happening under the hood but with javascript you are able to find that out so i think working with javascript therefore gives you so much more control and of course i love working with react and react is working with the components and how the components render out that's also actually how my brain works how to design an app so that's why i love working with javascript because it makes me allows me to use react actually yeah i like i like it because it's visual that's it that's why i like it i like it because yeah that's why i like it okay yeah yeah so most used programmers this out so most use programming language among developers worldwide javascript right there boom okay then instead we have html css i would not consider this a programming language but i guess it still is so there you go html css we have sql python java csharp and so forth right now the reason why this is becoming so popular is because actually javascript is starting to get used to for a lot it because it's not only used for web development it's also used for the following it's also used for things like um mobile development right right so ios android right so ios ios and also android okay and that is very popular if you can build using javascript for ios and android you're solid my friends you're solid next thing we have this is a stack overflow survey which is the biggest survey in the world around developers and look at this right there it just shows you right there javascript html css the top languages right there easy web frameworks react.js so we focus a lot on reactgs as well that's the biggest framework that we like to focus on because it's also one of the most biggest ones that people use right now okay so here's a good question what can you do with javascript answer that in the comment below what can you do with javascript roman says everything take over the world games that's a very good one monique that's right games that's right that's right that's right fly the moon well i mean you can try that too blockchain blockchain yes blockchains build on node.js i believe interactive animation websites so here's some tech companies using this linkedin we have a facebook i mean pretty much anything that you see on the web is just using javascript ebay tesla coupon netflix google uber paypal abb those are all companies who are using you know javascript okay next one let's see okay web apps for example like web apps like facebook ios and android so actually i have a tesla app right here and this desktop is actually built with react native it's on your iphone but it's built with react native which i think is so cool right then we have server apps which are netflix apps so for example who knows what a server app is anyone know what a server app is what's a server app compared to computer like for example i was an android app a server app what is it what is the server app jesse or nevermind so a server app and then sorry i was checking the chat i'm sorry oh good i'm good so a server app for example is for example if you were to use node.js okay let me go ahead and make sure this node.js okay so this is a framework with javascript and so this is all the behind the scenes stuff that's going on you know behind netflix so we have the front of netflix which i believe is actually built with react gs the front of netflix right it's actually blue with build with react gs but the back end of netflix is built with no gs this is where all the database is stored right this is where all the logic when you log in log out that is where all of that is happening right this because server app is taught basically the front end is talking to the server app and the server app then is talking to the front end all the time right and that is of course built with javascript the myths of becoming a developer right do i need to have a degree to get a job as a developer what do you guys think what do you guys think what do you say no no no no no no no no no that's right no no no no no hello why are you playing cricket i don't know because it's a no so no you do not need to have a degree to get a job most of my friends who are developers do not have any degrees they just they got the job because they're just good if you're good at what you do that's all that matters that's right honestly that's it okay so this is what we talked about if for example we have um google right so google for example do i need a computer science is good to have a google software engineer no a cs degree is not required for most of our software engineer or product manager roles it says it right there that's from google okay this is a this is from reddit it says i'm selftaught no degree whatsoever i didn't have a problem lending a job in microsoft regardless with a few years of mostly plus plus experience under my belt would wouldn't even say it was hard and no one at work had asked me if i have a degree ever since the first that first interview now that's nothing technically speaking oh you know but for what it's worth i've had recruiters from google facebook amazon try to learn me over as well so like i said just it's possible so this is what we say for certifications we don't like these okay let me ask you this did anybody come here for a certification did you guys come here for a certificate i hope not because you're not getting one where i hate them that's right you're not getting a certificate certificate okay nobody needs a certificate okay nobody needs a certificate here that's right i came for the challenge you came here for what why did you come here give me a reason why did you come here guys why expand my brain to learn something to learn gain knowledge you have friends to build projects that's amazing guys learn learn learn that's right yes right your powerful thing guys you have yes he's autographed maybe you should come to the inperson event to do that so to gain knowledge guys this is why you're here for knowledge it is the most important thing this knowledge is we like to call it very simple knowledge is power no nas it's not yes it is no it's not okay what is jesse i'm sorry okay what is it jesse then applied knowledge is powerful dang let's go jesse okay okay jesse's hidden okay let's go i acknowledge his power because this is the thing guys often we learned in school or maybe your parents used to say this knowledge is power okay so you start reading a lot of books you start watching a lot of documentaries or anything however if you only read the books but you don't apply the theory of the knowledge of that book on your own projects or on your life guess what nothing changes doesn't nothing happens doesn't matter so that's not the real power knowledge is not power applied knowledge is power who here let me ask this who here has learned something new learn something new okay and have wanted to get into something maybe you've wanted to get into coding but you've never actually done it you've read the books you've started maybe if you're watching a video but you never actually did it a lot i know a lot of people that's right why why why because you can learn all you want but unless you actually apply it to the real world it does not matter whatever you learn here in this let me tell you this the unfortunate truth is the following fifty percent of you here in this challenge are going to watch it and then that's the only thing you're gonna do fifty percent of you are going to do that and that's a very unfortunate truth but that's just real world the other 50 are actually going to apply what they've learned they're going to take the knowledge they have here they're going to do something about it or they're going to take it to the next level maybe they'll use what they learned here and maybe the next thing you know maybe they'll maybe get some more training and they keep going at it they keep doing the same thing they keep learning more things other people will just be like oh great i did this that's it that's all i need so let me ask you this are you the other 50 are you the 50 that's going to be just using this and that's it and you're done are you the 50 that's you know what no i'm gonna take what i learned from here and then i'm gonna take it to the next step which one are you which one are you let me ask you that i'm gonna take it and build on it awesome jason that's right that's right i'm really serious about this because i talk to a lot of students and ver the unfortunate truth is they say oh no as you know i'm not ready for this right now i'm not ready for you know maybe a coding course or even a boot camp i'm not ready for to learn anything to you know that's that's outside my league well you know basically what what you're saying if you're saying that you're saying what that means let's say you're not serious about what you're trying to do it also means you're not ready to change your life even though you should be changing it maybe at that point because otherwise why would you be here wanting to learn something that's right that's right somebody said not ready is delaying forever have you ever thought to yourself hey you know what oh yeah i'll do this later oh yeah i'll do this later i'll do it later later and then later just never becomes the truth never becomes forever raise your hand if you've done that i've done it too i've done it too yeah i've done it everybody's done it yeah guilty of charge me too the thing is though guys you know what procrastination actually is procrastination is not about you not being ready you not being motivated enough you not having the money or you not having the will or the power or the sleep or the energy or whatsoever that's not what procrastination is procrastination is actually a coping mechanism that comes in when we're dealing with stress guess what changing your life yes can be [ __ ] stressful guess what it's also worth it so once i noticed for myself for example that i used to procrastinate on stuff i knew like okay i should not procrastinate on it i have to step into the fear and do it immediately and this is the moment right like who's that guy marcus aurelius says it right fear is often about 99 scenarios you have in your head but none of them is actually true right so once you realize that and once you practice that guys and once you you know be comfortable with being uncomfortable and going into that step going into that fear that's when you will change your life but you gotta go move forward okay somebody said it's a daunting talk to get your [ __ ] together basically that's it that's worth it that's it so that's what i like to say you know for me a lot of times and sometimes yes it is hard sometimes yes it is can be difficult and it's scary but what isn't scary what isn't scary anything that it's new is going to be fearful is going to be scary it's going to be something on the unknown we as human beings we are driven by a few things right here the few things we are driven by we are driven by what we are driven by uh when we have uh safety right we are driven by when we have uh not not direction but we are driven by um not competence what isn't when we're consistency we like consistency don't don't we we like consistency right but we are also driven by differentiation we're driven by new things growth and your brain by default is there for this your brain by default is to keep you safe and to keep you doing consistent things that's what your brain is there for anything outside that creates fear is the reason why is because your brain is telling you no it is not safe it is something new it is not consistent we haven't done this before so no no let's go ahead and scream and let's uh be scared that's what happens that's just the truth but the truth is this is what's stopping a lot of us this is what stopped me i'm guessing it was was maybe stopped jesse at some point too maybe not i don't know jesse but it stopped me at some point okay i'm not perfect okay but i mean of course everybody has been there you know um because that's the thing guys when you do something that changes your life or that is a little bit scary maybe even not changing your life but just a little bit you know um what not says right the little voice comes in and the little voice tells you no actually don't become a software developer because you're earning more money now at the job that you're at now even though you don't like it you're earning more money and if you become a software developer again you have to start from scratch you have to invest a lot of energy in it a lot of money yeah you know you should just stay where you are yeah yeah but there's this other voice in your head and that goes off like but i'm not happy at my current job i think i could be happier i love code i actually love creating things i don't see why i cannot do this and then the fight starts that's right you know and that's you struggling and getting over that wall to get outside of your comfort zone yeah some of the scariest things for me were for example quitting my job you know the scariest thing for me was talking in front of a lot of people the scariest thing for me heck even asking a girl on a date for me was scary right but it had to be done you know but it had to be done right but through all that that's where the result comes around right that's where the result comes around when you for example anything new when you go into college or maybe when you go learning a new piece of technology maybe you're learning how to ride a bicycle it's going to be scary and there's a reason for it okay but that is okay and i want all of you to understand that what i like to do is instead of being scared you know what that's fearful in my mind i'm like you know what no i'm going to go into it if it's fear that i fear i actually do the opposite i paired it up i make the assumption the following if it's fearful i do it and so if you just keep doing it fear equals do i mean don't do it don't do anything crazy stupid okay don't just go jumping you know or something just let's also when you come here you're going to go skydiving with us 100 by the way okay but fear equals do i start to pair that in my life with fair equals do my parents for example at 35 years old they completely changed their life they stopped everything they had in ukraine and they came to america imagine restarting your life from zero they came to america with five hundred dollars guys and they're in cash that's it that's all they had they sold everything they had in ukraine they saw everything they had in ukraine and they came here how's that right and they literally came here to a country where they did not know the language they did not know anything my dad was working 18 hours a day cleaning clean cars at a car wash my mom was cleaning houses that's the only job they could get at that point but because of them it is the reason why i am here the reason why i now have a sister right it is the reason why now i can teach you it is a reason why you know i've been able to learn so much and become a developer and become a great developer hard working person because i've realized that the hard work and fear is just part of the game and now to me and i because of the example that my parents have set for me i have nothing else but you know but to thank them for what they've done because it is not easy to be 35 years old and to restart to hit a restart on your life in a new country though you can't even speak that's right some you said salma that's right my parents came here to give us a better life the reason there's a reason why they do that to give us a better life so for a lot of you here you guys might be here because you want to give your kids or your future a better life raise your hand that's you am i right isn't isn't that a good intention so let's look at so let's make it happen let's just [ __ ] do it because somebody has to go through it somebody has to go through the troubles and tribulations and let that be us and that's fine all right guys are you with me here are you with me are you with me beautiful i love it let's go all right awesome i just got deep that's cool yeah i mean i mean it's how we set the tone also for this challenge guys like are you [ __ ] in or what because actually this challenge of course is about coding of course it's also about fun but it's also about how are you going to take the next step in your life how are you going to make code you know work for you how are you know um i studied law i changed careers and you know it just seemed like a career switch but it was not just about that it was about i want to live my life on my terms i want to create the life that i want to live okay and so that's also why you guys should be in this challenge and feel that you know embrace that power that you have and work for it to gain it basically okay so that's why this is so important to talk about and to overcome the fears that come in the little voices to get out of your comfort zone and i always have i'm not going to talk about this much more but i have one question for you all what's the real prize if you're not going to go into coding what's the real price now a lot of people only think about the money that they're missing out on or you know because they're changing job from a higher salary not wanting you know becoming a software intern but it's about what's the real price and often that's happiness that's health that's creativity that's freedom which is just as valuable as money to some point or even more okay so let's continue i love it i love it that's it and somebody said joseph king said can i learn coding while studying medical school 100 yes you can't 100 hell yeah i have a really good combo i have a student right now who is actually working right now as a doctor no she's i forgot doctor no i'm not a doctor in the medical field anyways and she's also she's also in her boot camp and she's literally she has the coaching call like it's not no joke she opens up the cultural on her in the zoom on her phone right she puts an airpods into her uh you know he puts in airpods and then she then she just works and she listens like because that's her job right but but she's doing it she's killing it right so there you go awesome sweet so this is what you know for example this is what uh elon musk even said for example right so you can't successful in life without you can't succeed in life without a degree that's why you need schooling if you want to go to harvard yamas says that's not true don't confuse schooling with education i didn't go to harvard but but the people that work for me did right so like i said it doesn't really matter right same thing elon musk do you still stand firmly on requiring college degrees are not at not requiring character he's like yes right there right so just a few examples so don't do a degree guys that's not the most important thing right if you don't do not have a degree uh salary i'll look we're looking i mean it just keeps going up and up and up and it will keep going up because there's a lot more demand than the supply okay and here's the breakdown again this is for the entry level software engineers for example you know spacex tesla you know crews these are some example companies there's a ton of companies out there you can go and check it out spacex for example you know average sale is around 170 thousand dollars tesla 157k south engineer 216 000 so yeah if you're really good if you're competent in what you do yes these numbers are not crazy honestly like they're not crazy when you are competent at what you do so here's an example i mean cause himself who knows kazi raise a man raise your hands who knows cause he here you guys know kazi right and you guys know cozy that's right he himself has dropped out of college he himself did not go to college and he just instead decided to learn by himself do freelancing and then build a business like clever programmer here right and teach everybody else so that's just one example another example look at this look at this who's this anybody know this girl i don't know this girl who knows this girl anybody hope you guys do but this is jesse this is me um studied law in amsterdam okay um actually i studied law because i didn't know what i wanted to become well there you go so um working a few years as a text law consultant okay and then i realized at my first job they asked me to survey a tax newsletter and guess what i had to program that newsletter in the html css that's right that's right that's right that's where i fell in love with code realizing i love that part of my job but i hated the [ __ ] rest loves code there we go there we go that's all she needed she just loves to cook and now she's a geeky and a nerdy coder there you go and that is okay i was always a dirty i was born to be a coder um so yeah so you know um after that um going to meetups uh learning code on my own um never you know but having a hard time finding communities in that time you know most of it was online um so of course free code camp or code academy or tutorials but that didn't get me any further um long story short um i just tried some things out and i landed an internship and i did it on my on my own you know so yeah basically i think that muscle makes me a strong teacher actually because i learned it from scratch i learned it the hard way the soft way the medium way whatever way um you guys wherever you failed i feel too and i got back up okay so i think that makes me a good teacher in the sense of uh i know what it takes um to learn code from scratch um and how you can learn it better and faster and uh make it work for you that's okay that's right that's right but the most important part guys and when all of this is mindset you know being a good developer is about being a good communicator and having the right mindset okay so so let's keep on i have another example here robert he is a friend of mine great guy okay look at how good he looks so so robert right has an agree he's a good friend of mine and i actually work with him on trindala it's a startup company that he did with one of my another friend steve um i use them as an always example they were amazing mentors of mine he was a mentor of mine so will steve i love both of them and i still keep in touch with them to this day um yeah we both were doing this startup company turned out we were all doing this and you know he didn't have a degree he just kind of started this right and now he works at quicken loss which one of the biggest company look at this he's a team lead he's he's a team lead guys like he's a leader he's a senior developer who's a leader in his whole team at quicken loans and he has he's leading people who are you know a lot older than him and who even have degrees who have master's degrees doesn't matter he is just hard worker and he just loves what he does that's it period okay so the career ladder kind of looks like this you know you start with a junior developer in your position you start off with this amanda actually before this you might actually start up with an internship at first that might be the first thing you start so an internship might start out then you go into a senior developer position then go into a lead developer position a technical architect potentially a team lead which is think about that right he now is a team lead he is here now already wow and he's my age he's my age guys he's 25 25 years old that's right and he's tall as heck by the way anyways right and he's gonna be on the verge to becoming a cto at some point as well so also the javascript tour you guys we talked about so talked about this already uh link i think i told you about the link already at this point if you guys are still interested in doing the javascript tour to meeting a lot of amazing people networking and connecting together let me put the link again yeah the link is also below in the youtube at the youtube description okay if you guys have youtube open it's also there awesome uh that's right you're never too old guys that is correct okay i just put the link guys i'll just put a link if you guys are interested in joining the javascript or if you did the javascript tour if you just joined the javascript tour please let me know in the chat dm me that would be amazing dma here in the zoom chat i would love to see who did it and so i can actually call you and actually talk to you that'll be amazing um also one last thing guys i want to talk about is actually something called the graduation graduation call so we have a graduation call basically we will be talking about your next roadmap towards becoming a developer we're talking about you know how you did at the boot camp or at this challenge okay we're talking about how you can improve and maybe you know what are some troubles and tribulations you had and how you can work on those so for those for everybody here you guys every single person here gets gets a graduation call with one of our team members it's a oneonone call between me between jesse for example you might get jesse you guys might get me you might get for example uh luke is another great guy um he might actually be here in the call as well you might for example get uh frankie as well frankie right so let me go ahead and make this right so i call this the graduation call okay five day challenge five day challenge a graduation call very important guys okay very important day basically your roadmap ah come on nas find a challenge do you have the link for that by the way which link the graduation call yes let me check okay let's go this is going to be your roadmap for becoming a developer we'll talk about how you did in the challenge how you did during the challenge and we're doing this this for only two three days august 2nd through august 4th okay how you did during the challenge how you can improve improve improve your reach your goals your goals okay this is only for people with the way who've joined the actual challenge if you're on youtube unfortunately we can't do that but if you have joined the challenge okay click

and then you know what you guys did and how you guys did it and what's been going on okay okay let's go ahead and get it started all right oh let's go so we talked about this so what's the first step you should take towards becoming a developer guys right really good question well what do i need to do to pass the interview how do i get noticed and how many interviews do i need to do right so let's do that before this you need to learn before all this the most important thing you guys need to do is what very simple it is to learn to code okay you need to gain that knowledge first before anything else honestly like we said knowledge always comes first knowledge is gonna be your key knowledge is your your key guys okay knowledge is your key all right all right go ahead i see daniel okay just message me okay let's go and continue on question how to learn to code that's a good question how do you learn to code well first things first is we need to simplify the journey because the journey is honestly not that hard guys okay let me ask you this how are you learning to code right now okay what are the ways that you're learning to code put them down the chat i'm very curious what are the ways that you are learning to call someone say you've done me somebody said how else somebody said by doing practice that's right pwj youtube fsm nice full stack mastery by project youtube youtube youtube coding apps documentation courses codecademy udemy reputation that's right so what i want you guys to do is very simple number one let's set a longterm goal okay which is this one the longterm goal is become a fullstack developer in one to five years okay that's our longterm goal raise your hand if you want to become a fullstack developer here raise your hand anybody yes good i got i judge i see you guys i see everybody yes that's right right now the shortterm goal is what a lot of people don't tell you this is the unfortunate truth that a lot of people don't tell you you think that you need to build crazy products here's what you think you think that in order to get to this you need to do the following you need to do build crazy project you need to really just say you're there yeah okay i am here okay good build crazy projects you're building crazy products you need to for example learn a bunch of technologies a bunch of technologies like you need to learn so many technologies right you need to learn all these technologies right you need to you know you need to maybe you know um let me see let's see you need to learn node.js and you need to know react to yes and you need to know all these different you know like frameworks and angularjs and let me cut all that [ __ ] out from you okay let me just say this very simple just cross this out i know i know it's crazy i just crossed out for you because this is the reason why you're not an actual developer period you think that you just need to keep doing more youtube you think that you need to keep doing more udemy courses you think you just need to keep doing more and more and more and more and more of the stuff that does not [ __ ] work oh are we stuck where we where i think we're stuck at if you're doing the same thing of the thing that doesn't work then you're just doing the same thing it doesn't work it doesn't change yes deborah said it tutorial hell that's right you my friends are in tutorial help but it's not just that you're in the hell in general okay that's right because you yourself if i just give you is very simple problem right now and i said to you hey you know what create for me a function that will merge to a race together could you do that right now or hey can you for example build a binary search tree or can you for example just even build a project from scratch can you do that right now like i build a car before yourself by now some of you you have that knowledge and maybe yes you can because you've done that before but some of you you're like oh hell no i know what you're talking about that's right reason being is because what you guys don't have unfortunately is the following is this the fundamentals it's like for example if i told you to build a house what is the first thing that you build when you build a house what is it it's what is the foundation and yes it's the foundation of the house if you've got no foundation whatever happens your house will collapse by about your house will collapse right so i take this very seriously i take this problem only very very seriously right and some of you for example and here's what you told maybe hey you know what you need to learn html you need to learn css and uh you know this is so important and all this stuff and yeah html css yeah that will make your developer uhhuh uhhuh yeah this is what's important right here uhhuh learn this spend two months learning this okay hell no as well also cross this [ __ ] out you don't need none of that okay let me tell you that i don't know what kind of voice that was that was really interesting that was the first time i did that before now is you okay sometimes i don't know maybe it's a movie that i i heard or something right but you don't need that guys this my friends is not a programming language it is not i can teach you html css in literally two days i can teach you guys a whole html css and i'm not kidding in probably three days over you actually being a challenge and if i focus focus only on html css that's what you will learn your best way to learn html css is just for practice and nobody have you ever seen on the actual for example on an in not an interview but for one have you ever seen anybody ask an interview about html css maybe there's like one or two people nope no hell no no have you ever heard anybody tell you hey you know what you need to learn to miss success and uh yeah you're gonna be asked about ishmael css uh as a requirement for a job a job requirement yeah yeah so important yeah that's right learn that right now no never i never had that maybe some of you have done it maybe you've seen it right it's i want to say never ever that doesn't make sense right never never that doesn't happen right but they don't focus on that what you need to what they are asking you is hey how can you actually problem solve and problem solving comes from what solving problems that's right that's right all this stuff is unnecessary boom it's very simple how can you problem solve it is very simple and problem solving comes with knowing these fundamentals it is comes from experience it comes from you practicing nonstop that's where that comes from okay guys so i want you guys to be very serious about this you guys have taken courses of html of css and i know a lot of you are there and let me tell you you don't need that let me save you your time and your money okay so what you need to know actually the fundamentals first right because if i ask you interview questions like around uh foundations around algorithms or on data structures it comes from you know how to promote it comes from you know the fundamentals of actually coding that's it right so here's what you guys to do okay number one take out a piece of paper and a pen right now i'll be every single person right now okay take out a piece of paper and a pen right now i want you to write down the following or to write down that i want you to write down one one let me say this right now let me say this right now one write down i need to learn the fundamentals learn fundamentals right two i need to create projects on my own what does that mean you don't look at anybody else you don't look at youtube you don't look at you dummy no you create projects on your own on your own you figure out a good project you want to do you figure an idea and then you just do it okay it's sometimes things are as simple as just you just doing it that's it you can't escape it that's an unfortunate truth what what type of products to start out with what depends on what technology you know if you know javascript and you know html and css build a website build a website for example for maybe a company that you love build a website for maybe a specific restaurant that's right right anything that's right so fake it a good project there's actually some amazing products you can guess guys can take a look at i want you guys to take a look at a company called frontend mentor okay everybody right now i want you guys to check out a comical front end front front end mentor these guys these guys will show you projects to do okay go to their website that's right go to that website go to google.com type in frontend mentor and then you'll see all the projects that you can build they literally have the designs for you all you have to do is just build them and you build them and you have fun with it that's it guys simple as that okay and of course you make a plan so your plan should be the following one learn the fundamentals of javascript so look learn all the fundamentals around algorithms data structures right for example like things like what are some fundamentals that need to know jesse who do you know in order to start wealth with frontend mentor no for the mentors in general they need to learn no things like stacks right oh you mean data structures that's right stacks uh binary search trees um linked list of course queues um tries and maybe hash table or graphs but that's very advanced yeah i would say arrays just objects in general yeah okay i know for some of you it's like oh you know this stuff is not fun this stuff you don't actually need we're never going to use this in actual you know in in actual uh in real life you're right you're not like this kind of stuff you're not actually going to use unless you're doing really complicated stuff but what this stuff builds and this is actually crazy enough i realized this when i became a teacher i realized that the way the reason why i became such a good developer is because i know this stuff all this stuff that's the reason and i initially i was like oh that's a bunch of [ __ ] screw that nobody needs to learn this i'm never going to use this in real world and you're right you're not but this builds neurons a this kind of stuff makes you a good problem solver yes because you're always thinking you're always thinking okay how can i do this how can i do that how can i do this how can i use all these little tools that i have in my own tool belt to solve a problem and these are just simply the tools these are just the tools so i want you to be very careful that the reason why you learn this kind of stuff not because you're going to use it but it's because it's going to make it a better problem solver that's it honestly that is it that's the reason why i'm going to we're going to we're so focused on that so another really cool thing that we like to use is something called notion notion is a great company that we like to use as well for you know um for uh scheduling things or for creating tasks lists so go and check them out okay so sound important habits for you too for you to get there we i talk about this really simple it is really easy not easy but here's what i say fun i prioritize this a lot don't put if it's if you're tired uh you know at night and you feel like you don't want to code and maybe you just like you just just feel like you despise it later on then just don't code just don't worry about it instead figure out what's fun for you like let me ask you this like what in what way can you work that's fun put in the chat i know my way ways that i like to work that's fun like in what ways is your fun for you what what's the fun just i know those ways yeah you know those days for example somebody said music playing music playing music dancing while coding um i like to draw draw things out improve ideas um think of new features use pinterest or dribble um yeah well sometimes i watch twitch somebody said by making money somebody say cook watch twitch anime yeah for sure of course that's fun yeah so for example from me and again you will learn this you will learn this as you get better okay for me for example the way i like to work in a fun way is i actually like to go to coffee shops i don't drink coffee but i go to coffee shops so for example really cool for me is i like the environment i like to set myself a really good environment right so just going to coffee shops in general well there's a lot of people doing other stuff you know they're all maybe working you know by themselves you know they got this coffee it's like it's like this whole process you go to a coffee shop you know you get a coffee maybe you get a chai latte i like chai latte that's what i like because i don't i don't drink coffee so i'm gonna try i know i gotta try latte maybe give myself like a little cookie you know just to you know make myself feel good you know sometimes give myself a small sandwich they got there you know so good and i just take that and i go to i go to sit down i open my laptop i put on my headphones and i just work i just have fun honestly and i enjoy that i enjoy the crap out of that and that to me is fun so yes i would say prioritize fun because fun is what allows you to keep doing what you're doing fun okay so fun allows you to keep doing of course then we talk about hard work that's really important as well you know patience uh this you know these are some key terms you i'm sure you you know all of you guys know this is you just need to put this into actual perspective and actually use it uh team cooperation communication learning tick initiative very important i think on here is ticket initiative whenever you get the chance to actually work at a company i want you to remember this word take an issue i want you to write this on your piece of paper right now take all right take initiative take initiative all right okay take initiative this is very very very i would say extremely important as a developer also as in becoming a problem solver now i see a lot i talk to a lot of students and i see students behave a certain way often right when they start out and they want to become a problem solver they want to solve that problem however they ask me how do i solve this what's what's wrong here but they're they're that's the only thing they do they only ask me one question instead of you know going to google google it search it search on more ask the right questions write the right questions down get some clarity if they got some answers uh show the steps they've done to solve the problem and then come back to me and say like hey i have this problem this is the goal of my code but i have this problem and i tried this this this to solve it what direction should i go in a or b that's sometimes what i see um a lot of students lacking in they're not taking that initiative they think just asking the question hey my code doesn't work can you help me out they think that's initiative but that's not initiative real initiative is going out there you know trying to get what you want listen you don't have to know the answer but initiative is about making that effort to find out the answer would you rather have if you were a senior would you rather have a junior that just ask you hey my code doesn't work can you help me or would you rather have a junior asking you hey this is the goal of my code it doesn't work i tried this this and that can you help me out with this and that and that a lot better right that's right that's right so that's what taking initiative is about guys that's what that means that's right okay sweet so next up how to learn to code uh well there is how can i not so there's a few different mentalities i'd like to talk about there's the one mentality which is if you ever approach a problem which you guys will like it or not you can either be mad at your computer and just kill it and you know throw it outside the window and say why can i not solve this and be mad at yourself and be mad at the code or and i honestly i've done this before so so you know i can't blame you if you're in this in this and this too but but the verses is you're always thinking thinking about this thinking about how can i solve this right in your mind the question should be you know i prioritize a lot and i've been told this actually a lot where it's like i'm always in the mindset of okay there's a problem how can i solve it how how how i never limit myself thinking that i can't solve something if for example maybe you're in a bad situation right now maybe maybe you're not making money maybe you don't have a job right maybe you're tired and you just don't know what to do but can you get yourself out of that is there has let me ask you this question if you're in a certain position right now where you have a problem has there anyone asked yourself this has there anyone else that's been in the same position and they've solved that problem has anyone else done it maybe you don't know them but has anyone else done it yes am i right yes of course yes so if they did it could you do it too if they are the example could you do it too we have for example the borah says yes i had no job and i got a job not the job i want to but i'm working the board that's right see so you can always give yourself a situation and know sometimes it's really hard sometimes maybe you are just not capable or not able to get out your situation because you know maybe there's certain things limiting you maybe physically you're limited in a certain way but i'm i'm still sure i want you to keep thinking about how can i solve this i never want you to keep in the mindset of like i've given up and i can't do any more that's not a good mindset to have okay all right next up so full stack developer role map okay we know this at this point it involves a few things front end backend database devops mobile app the one thing i want you guys to focus on are these three database for the backend okay that's what makes a good developer from full stack developer okay so let's just go ahead and make that uh a focus all right next up again these technologies html css javascript that's going to be your frontend technologies like react.js together with firebase okay right here you guys can write this down kind of stuff down okay who knows this kind of stuff html css in javascript i always think this gives you is so much fun because it really explains actually um these languages you know or these frameworks i'm going to be this guy okay i'm going to be a javascript so i got you you're definitely that guy but then like then like two times faster like forward i don't i don't know how he does it he just like goes nuts he's just like yeah left right why can't he do that he does a little bit of cramping and then a little bit of boogie you know like yeah i got the most can i learn from him i like this i like this person anyways so of course the three main things html css javascript html what do you think what do you guys think that is that is the skeleton so if you're a person your skeleton is your structure it is your html okay so let's remember that okay your css is your presentation who here likes to dress up when i say dress up just look good okay who here let me know in the chat and it's okay because i like to i like to yeah i like to do it too hell yeah i like to got some nice shoes i got a nice jacket you know got some nice pants you know there we go i like doing that i don't care some people say it's my ego no it's not i just like it okay but anyways that's your css okay that's right that's your appearance okay then we got the javascript okay who here likes to take action who here likes to move who here just i mean if you're in general if you can just move your hands you're good or anything anybody right who here right i'm me i like to dance right anybody here likes to dance or anybody here likes to move around yeah me okay don't say that julian just dance that's right that's right that's the javascript portion of you okay the javascript it is your mind it is what makes you move the way you move right your mind tells you you know what step next step this step this that's right by the way guys if nas and i if we're having our coding sessions it often goes this way we play music and we're coding and dancing at the same time that's right that's that's how it always goes so uh with html what would like to talk about is of course learn the basics don't focus too much on the html it's amazing uh thing i want you to understand is this is not your main focus your main focus is going to be javascript which we'll talk about here in a second but with html make a page make it work don't over complicate it it's simple guys honestly you learn how to how to use a div h1 a p tag and that's [ __ ] it okay and then you learn some css literally please do not over complicate it if you are right now spending [ __ ] months on learning html css you're in the wrong position period all right okay so here's some basic things literally if i taught you this that's all you got to learn okay html header your body your body is basically this is what you actually see it has things like h1 tags so each one tags are headers okay so it's in my first web page that's going to be a header and p this is your paragraph tag and everything and then there's something called div which you don't see on here but it's like um it kind of looks like this let me show you yeah right here right here and these are building blocks that make everything inside your html work pretty much okay then we've got css again you know focus don't focus too much on that one as well learn how to use different layouts so for example like flexbox in this case we're going to learn how to use tail and css that's using flexbox as well so we'll learn how to do that in this session and not this session but in the next few days okay so guys it is prerequisite that you have some basic knowledge of css otherwise it's going to be really hard to follow along for the next few days so if you have some knowledge on css you're good to go honestly even if you don't it's okay okay because yeah no it's okay completely because uh for you guys if you don't know css that is all right basically you will be seeing the way we are doing this and then this will be sprinkling basically knowledge into you so it's kind of like i'm putting a seed into your brain uh like it's being exposed to it that's right you've been exposed to it that's the whole point of this you're being exposed to new technologies telling css html css javascript so do i need to know javascript no you don't no you don't okay you will be learning a lot of this kind of stuff on here and this will be a seed that will spread out and turn into a beautiful butterfly not a butterfly seeds don't butterflies don't go from seeds um that will turn into a beautiful flower or a tree okay that's what seeds are for okay one of my amazing teachers victoria she was a teacher of mine this teacher she always told me you know what does i'm just planting seeds in you and then what then you become a good dancer that's it and so that's what i like to do to my students as well so again this is some css examples i want to show to you guys so again if you do not know uh nate if you do not know html as well doesn't matter this is for complete beginners you will be all good guys okay it is for complete beginners you'll be all good don't worry about it guys okay this is some examples of css for example here you can see this is an a tag and we're targeting a an a tag an a tag is basically a link and we're saying hey display block we're going to give it a padding which is basically some spacing we're going to give it a text decoration i'm going to give it a color as well and on the hover of this a tag it's going to be a cursor pointer with a new color of red and now this might not make sense that's okay you will learn this on the fly of course now we get to javascript this is where it's real actually really hard or it gets harder html css is not as bad as what this is okay so this is where you'll be learning data types so for example um you know data types like what are some data types jesse well we talked about this before right the data structure so this would be the linked list well i should talk about data types so numbers oh sorry numbers um arrays booleans strings um variables of course um wow that that that light green yellow is really hard to read nice i know it's okay i can't change it object uh objects and that's about it i think yeah these are the main data that you need to learn and a lot of stuff you can actually learn go to codecademy go to free code camp a lot of stuff you will see actually on there okay so feel free to use those libraries or those learning resources of course learn functions es6 function is a little piece of code that you can utilize um to kind of repeat that same piece of code so for example let's say that you want to you have a one you have a function for you know maybe grabbing some data you can reuse that function multiple times right dom manipulation dom manipulation is what who knows what dom manipulation is let me know in the chat who knows what dom manipulation is anybody put in the chat okay but tell me what is it don't just tell you i do just tell me what is it though tell us michael curry that's right when they put the nodes of it that's right so of course html has nodes right so and the document has nodes right and so downward pushes but manipulating those nodes so they look different okay so for example maybe i click on something and i want something else to appear on the page right maybe i want to appear a dialogue that's called dom manipulation i'm adding a new piece of html into the dom okay scope who knows what scope is anybody anybody who knows the scope is it's a more advanced topic more that's right so a scope is kind of like this kind of like imagine you have a a piece of paper right right and your scope is like your score is i'm saying hey your scope is this piece of paper you can only look at that piece of paper or maybe i can say hey your scope is on this little section on a piece of paper and so you can only see that section so when we talk about scope we talk about we can actually see all the little variables or the little data that i have in my application that's scope and again we'll talk more about that later on then there is this this is the hard stuff guys okay this is the hard stuff a data structures slash algorithms and so what those are are are what what are they jesse we just talked about this but stacks and queues of course okay um binary search trees linked lists um double linked list because you have two kinds of linked lists okay singly and double and um tries hashtables i want to say about it yeah i want to say as well like for example graphs as well and so forth yeah graphs yeah yeah so these are your data structures and then of course you get your face api this is actually get stuff from an api yeah that's right there's a hash you'll you'll see a hash table is uh it's just a very complicated way of mapping data you'll see a hash table actually consists of two types of data structures that's right i believe yeah that's right so this is an example of some javascript this is yeah i mean yeah this is pretty complicated but what's gonna happen here this is an array you guys can see this what do you guys think this is what what is this so this is an array what do you think this is anybody can guess what this is what is this that's right christopher this is an object it's an object okay who knows what this is what this what is that it's a key that's right this is a key and then what what is this right here value value right so an object has multiple keys and multiple values and i can actually reference them okay who knows for example what uh you know what is this right here filter function that's right it's a filter function that's actually already accessible for us that's right it's a filter function right and we can actually use it in our a piece of code as we don't have to create it it's already there for us by javascript that's right so that's right that's what we talk about let's talk about some frameworks so of course knowing javascript is your foundation it is your fundamentals okay but you cannot just stop there unfortunately right so nasa seems like you're not sharing your screen on youtube all right oh dang thank you jesse right there my bad yeah that's okay right there that shallow script alrighty right there hey okay sometimes forget that dang it i know why but sometimes i just forget that um so yeah there you go thank you guys by the way um so frameworks of course right these are most important things javascript can only take you so far at that point once you've learned javascript once you learn the basics then you have to actually learn the frameworks okay and what are those well you guys know that we have frameworks like angular so i actually started with angular my first framework was angularjs okay and imagine a framework it's kind of like it's kind of like the embassy hmm it's kind of like the engine imagine if a car right it's kind of like a car no imagine like this imagine a framework it's like you know how you have a house you know a house right a house is a house and then you have rooms imagine the framework is like the room so you can create the rooms and make it fancy that's what the framework allows you to do it makes it very easy for you okay so that's what that is that's angular we have vue.js which is another javascript uh framework and then of course we got react gs right here that's react.js for you right there okay beautiful and here are some companies who are using these technologies we've got for example you know angularjs oh right here oh wait wait right here used by companies like the guardian upwork paypal sony that's angular vigi oh yeah people in angular okay yeah airbnb instagram eats dropbox also for example facebook the new facebook is built with react.js of course because they made reactions also netflix yeah netflix is a big one that's right uh view gs alibaba grammarly you know dashboard gitlab and so forth right a lot of companies so what should i choose there's a lot of options you can you can honestly choose either you want to use vue.js go ahead there's going to be companies who are looking for that you want to use you know angular go ahead there are companies looking for that doesn't matter honestly for example for me i got a job at a company without really knowing react.js i got a i became a react.js developer without knowing react.js seriously i went to a company they're like nas but you don't know right yes you're right i don't know but i'm a good problem solver so you can either like me or you don't you know they send me like they literally send me these all these interview questions and they send me a test to do around a reg gs i completely flopped it completely failed they're like yeah you probably should learn some more reactions i'm like yeah that's fine i can probably learn erect on the job you know i learned i can learn on the job like oh okay okay okay and then they hired me you know and then i was making 10k a month right so there you go and then and then i learned react gs with them that's it the most important thing you need to learn is just pick one so the one that we usually go with is we just do react because it's one of the simpler ones to kind of learn it's there's not a lot of headache too much you know and it's becoming very popular that's why so companies already talked about this company is using javascript we know this already so resources to learn well there's a lot of research you can learn well there's a lot of web fundamentals by building projects resources uh there's also for example free code camp there's front and mentor okay and by the way with this one when you get on the graduation call and if you actually wanna have this like learn what developed by building projects just mention this to the person that you have the graduation call with and then we'll be able to give you it's like a small little course that we have for our students sometimes who want to build some cool projects so just note it down for yourself if you want to actually want this course once again a call with the person for the graduation call ask them for that and they'll give it to you okay free code cam from the mentor youtube of course uh if you go to us on youtube there's some great resources to learn to learn there we have a fullon html course on our course literally guys if you take this and you take this you know css done so here's what i commend to you every single person okay can i can i can i give you guys a recommendation to everybody this will be really helpful to you can i tell you guys this one i want all of you right now really easy i want you to go through this course and through this course before tomorrow oh yeah like type in clever programmer html type it into search box or go to cleverprogrammer and then search up html crash course or css crash course and i want you to learn it by tomorrow every single person here right now every single person this is your goal for tomorrow literally not even kidding you this is going to mean they're like homework what the yeah yeah this is going to make your life so much easier and it's going to teach you so much it's only four hours guys it's not that bad you sit down for one hour you crank this out you sit down for another hour you crank this out and then maybe you do another hour so you got time okay tomorrow morning to the evening you got time can you promise me that who can promise me i'm actually curious who is so who is very dedicated who can promise i see you marian i see you i see you i see you who could promise when you can do this yes topher can promise me promise promise yes kevin can promise me who else nobody else can promise me nobody else put in the chat nice tamiz i see you nice nice nice i'm putting the chat nice oh wow okay and i'm look i'm looking to chat now brian landouk luffy beautiful i'll do it kidian yes bobby julian thori yes i promise yeah that's beautiful and of course we have an eighthour javascript crash course too you don't have to do this one for by tomorrow because of course there's a lot i recommend you guys go through this one and through this one and the javascript you guys will learn throughout so but i want you guys to go through these one these are going to be really powerful for you okay so these ones right that's it so here are some resources as well to use uh of course we got this score we got slide there's facebook linkedin instagram there's a lot of places you can use also for learning we also have a community do we have a community uh is amaz by the way as a mother here by any chance jesse um no he's not does he have the link to the community or no um no he wanted to share that another day okay so we have an actual community so we are actually building an amazing community on discord of just clever programmers it's a community and we want to build out to have a hundred thousand people 200 000 people literally you want to build this to become the biggest development community in the world and uh we're going to do this i'm not kidding you this is going to happen we will have a discord channel we have a discord channel by now it's currently closed it's private right now but if you want to be part of an amazing community but there will be thousands of people let me know in the chat let me know in the chat right now if you're on youtube let me know on youtube if you're on zoom let me know when you zoom literally there'll be thousands of people on there that's our goal is to make this community big and humongous and there we go that beautiful beautiful beautiful yes yes yes yes yes all right and of course we got the javascript tour that's happened 2021 um by the way just really curious as did anybody here buy tickets for the javascript tour just on this session anybody here or you guys still thinking about it anybody here buy javascript tickets for the session oh you did fernando you did not they did nice lamont did yeah okay cool cool cool cool cool so a few people did awesome sweet if i see in the chat i'm really curious because if you did i'll actually i want to go ahead i bought a few weeks ago somebody said a buy one on the early bird nice nice i did nina did oh nice nina beautiful frank did fernando did nice sweet sweet sweet i gotta take it away topher said beautiful well we'll we'll have excitement oh gerardo is coming with his brother that's cool yes yes nice nice nice we're excited to see you guys it'll be a lot of fun so of course at this point probably i'm not sure how many tickets we have left maybe like ten or five i don't really know yeah there you go so time for some homework guys okay at this point we've done a lot today we learned a lot today uh homework one download vs code everybody right now you can go to literally code the visual studio code you can literally go to google.com let me do it with you right now okay go to google.com like this like this type in vs code like this and then right here click on that right here download it that's it if you have windows if you already got it beautiful okay next up is going to be of course build your own portfolio website so we have this portfolio website do we have the portfolio website the github for it let me see uh portfolio right there so i have a link for the portfolio website guys yeah right there okay this is the link right there so bootcamp developer portfolio let me send you a link right now and so you guys can go how to download that okay i'll send to you guys right now if you don't have this portfolio website then download it so i sent you the link it's very important guys make sure you do this okay make sure you do this one download it okay and it looks kind of like this and then what i want you to do is very simple here's the steps i want you to take okay download the portfolio okay are you guys writing this down or even take a screenshot if you have to or take a screenshot or take a picture for yourself all right so download the portfolio we have a video for you here basically on how to actually upload it and how to actually use it it's right there so i'm gonna change that link as well command c nice okay i send you two links guys okay all right download the portfolio then i want you guys to is to watch how to use the portfolio video okay the portfolio is basically just the html page it's an html page or actually it's with react.js so it's a really good portfolio this is where you will put your projects on there the first download was via scope guys by the way run the portfolio locally on your computer what i want you to do is the following and write this down or take a screenshot very important if you miss this you're missing an opportunity update your portfolio photo up the your experience section there will be a few sections you will have on there screenshot your portfolio and upload it as a comment in the homework post on facebook so there will be a homework post on facebook okay there will be a homework post on facebook that's right all right and what you need to do is you need to go ahead and make it a comment and just screenshot and put a comment as a screenshot of your whole homework and submit your homework on air table for us to give you a review on your homework so we will create a facebook post so we'll listen up really carefully we will create a facebook post everybody here is on facebook we will create a facebook post and also we will send out an email if you are a part of the challenge okay we will tell you here's all the links it will tell you here's the where you put the comment over here is where you upload the comment of a screenshot okay and then the air table it here here air table is basically like a form it's a form where you will submit your homework your screenshot and that way we can give you feedback on your homework does that make sense any questions okay any questions guys any questions does that make sense any preguntas yes or good if any questions please let me know oh good oh good okay fine okay awesome so take a screenshot i'm gonna give you five seconds to take a screenshot of this right now literally like ten i'll give you five seconds guys five four three two one everybody done everybody done that's right to get a screenshot or take a picture nice job that's right that's right good good good good good and of course the javascript tour we talked about this the links to the javascript tour will be there though so that's it guys that is it for today did you guys enjoy you guys had fun you guys learned some new things maybe maybe you don't have done this already you've known some of you a few things but yeah you know it so guys q and a time if any questions we would love to get you uh any answers you might have for for you so any questions as well on youtube if you on youtube if you have questions please let us know as well okay let me see let me if you see if i have any questions on youtube let me see preguntas youtube as well okay somebody said done done done frisian yeah if you have questions on youtube please go ahead and let us know okay any questions again irritable i said this guys we will send you the link to airtable uh after this call okay okay so please all right if you have any questions please go ahead and raise your hand or raise your hand on uh the zoom and we will be able to unmute you all right let me see raise your hand anybody let me see anybody have any questions frank kevin did you have a question or no by the way you also must have your uh zoom call zoom video on we'll take any questions whatsoever it doesn't matter if it's about coding if it's samir samir i see you my friend okay let's add you some here hold on let me find you some here it's just getting harder now okay and i'm gonna put all you guys on uh youtube as well so we can all see it right there okay bye adrian okay good good good so if you have questions let me see deborah you had a question oh no where was samir samara you were first i'm trying to find you hold on oh there's two of you hold on which one do i pick okay this one um let me see where are you samir talk i think you're me asked you i'm here go ahead samir hello hey how's it going my friend hey how are you guys doing good doing good time thank yeah um first of all thanks a lot for this amazing content you guys are putting out out there um i myself have been uh you know learning a lot from you guys um by the way guys if you don't know nas is my python developer as well so yeah nice he's been a great support to me and and i'm pretty much um uh thankful that i came across cp the whole cbd yeah so thank you thank you you got it thank you thank you appreciate me anna and you know i love having uses too oh there we go i see now hold on can i follow you oh i can't there we go ah beautiful i like a spot on myself and i guess jesse nice yes yes yes so oh no why not you muted yourself let me admit it yourself samir i'll move yourself wait wait here here i got you here go on your phone on your phone on your phone there we go no do it again do it again one more time i'm yourself there you go can you hear me now yeah beautiful perfect perfect so my question is that um okay you said that certifications are not important like what certificates are not important like what like during the interview when you go for a job right so so during the interview if the interviewer is asking okay if you have some certification house then show me or you know show me your certification your course your degree or something and if you don't have that how can we tackle those same kind of situation during an interview yeah so yeah so you see you say that kind of like this okay if you don't have certification you say hey i don't have certifications but i went to these places and instead of certifications i actually have projects to approve on what i did that's it okay like for example if you don't have if you don't get a certification from for example from us right let's just say you are in this challenge and there's no certification that you will be given to you you say okay well don't have certifications but here's the projects that we did that i learned and then hear the technologies that i learned there right and then you actually talk about what did you learn that's it so you talk about hey you know what i learned this i learned that i learned maybe how to create an api i learned how to create you know api routes that i created in front of a technolon application that will actually use the api routes you know and work together to create a whole web application system that's it okay so so because because uh i have seen uh when i have seen the job interview a job description they have like some of the companies have over here have like certifications a month or a degree is a must you know let's still apply still apply a lot of those descriptions on um in terms of uh given about developers or descriptions on job postings are a bunch of [ __ ] okay because and it's not their fault and it's not their fault because sometimes for example you know um a lot a lot of times big companies uh they will have for example uh it's right it's hr so hr will actually have uh they're given all these little things that they you know oh this guy needs to have this and this like there's there's job postings where it says like 10 years of experience you know 10 years of coding something really that doesn't [ __ ] matter you know like it doesn't matter as long as the team likes you and as long as you pass the interview and you know what you're talking about the team will overlook everything else that you have by the way guys i've never even applied for a job like a position that was available i just looked for companies that i liked and even though they didn't have a junior position at the time or an internship i would still send them an email send them an email letter that's right real that's it that's it so it's so it's more it's more of a connection what you make and the presentation what you give in during an interview that's right that's much about right that's right it's right it's more so how you showcase yourself and how you make the other person feel about you okay okay so don't ever when they talk with certifications don't ever let them bog you down because don't ever let them think that oh you know because i don't have certification i'm not good enough or or you know that it's a must no be confident with it yeah you know what no i don't did not get a certification because i think it's unnecessary or i think it's not needed for me what most i got from it is knowledge and i built these amazing projects with what i learned that's it depends makes sense thank you thank you so much and you say you say it proudly so samir actually say with me right now so if i was an interviewer and i interviewed right now i say hey samir you know but what kind of certifications have you had like i feel like certifications are really important some of your what will be your response uh i would say that uh i don't have a certification but what i have is the projects which i have worked on myself and i've been building with my own with using my own knowledge and and um the skills i know about the language i can show you the how does it work and the main the whole project by itself so okay all right beautiful i think you could put even more confidence into that to speak very clearly so i think let's try one more time okay i want you to speak a little bit more about okay what did you learn so i want you to actually go deeper into what you actually learned okay so i don't have a certificate with me but rather i have projects which have built just using html css and javascript okay and in those i have in in in terms of html it's just basic html but when it comes to css i've used uh flexbox i have used great for for positioning of the of the of the content in my website and and and when it comes to javascript i've used uh i've used a uh apis to which which which interacts the backend on the front end of the website so yeah that's good that's good really good stuff that's good the only thing i would say for you to work on is maybe say it maybe more louder and maybe say with the without more of like a hunch you know making sure that that you're more of a you know you've got more of a stance on it right so as long as you're like not breaking your voice because that says a lot as well so they're an interview they're reading you a lot in an interview they're going to read you a lot so for example for those of you guys who signed up for hacker noon you know um hacking we actually did a interview with hacker and we talked about how does he hire he hires a lot based on just how you speak and how you talk like how you're compassionate that's right like they hire a lot about you know are you truthful right if you're simply just truthful if you're not making a [ __ ] if you're a truthful person that's this person they want to hire they hire a lot more on soft skills right now he said it himself go watch the video guys it's on a youtube channel it's with the hacker and ceo go watch it you'll see it it's there and so that's why i say soft skills are so important in this industry okay so you're doing you're doing good just be more confident stay present and that's it i'm here okay thank you thank you so much uh announced once again you got it my friend you got it okay perfect all right next one what's up and if you guys have any questions let me go ahead i'm with you from spotlight all right any other questions here let me see if i have anyone else uh tamiz go ahead okay um yeah i want to say hi dummies hello can you hear me yeah we can hear you go ahead you speak up a little bit more i think oh okay is that better yeah yes okay um i wanted to take the freelance route okay but i'm still like learning the foundations um i do have a decent grasp on some things what exactly would i need before i put myself out there because i don't want to start putting myself out there and then i'm not able to do what's required and then next thing you know i develop a bad reputation right yeah so good question good question i think maybe just you want to take over for that so um first of all a freelancer um like i talked about before it's not only having technical skills okay because you also need to get clients get paid so you gotta do acquisition um you gotta do the contracts you gotta do the invoicing so there's a whole you gotta learn how to run a business next to doing technical skills when you become a freelancer okay so that's something you have to be aware of when starting out as a freelancer first of all second is um you're saying you don't want to get the bad repetition the thing is though we can't really control the future in the sense of you know sometimes you just gotta try it out and do your utter best right and then hope you'll just work hard enough on it and make it succeed make it work okay so there's no such thing as a bad repetition if you just keep in contact with your client and keep communicating and also what's very important um a very good freelancer or a very good developer is somebody who communicates very well so that means meeting your clients expectations at all times so if you feel like you can finish this project within the next two months great don't tell the client that tell the client they're getting the project in three months then maybe ask for support next to it so you can also make it within that those three months and you're delivering it then you know maybe you're becoming so good you're able to deliver it in two and a half months guess what you're over delivering and your client is happy but you didn't um how to say you didn't cut yourself short because you were honest to yourself and you are meeting the expectations of the client so there's no way that a bad reputation can come from that as long as you're loyal integer and are committed okay first of all that second of all i would um as a freelancer you do need the technical skills now as a freelancer you can either work solo or you can start creating your own team the thing is though if you start freelancing but this is just my personal opinion if you start freelancing but you've never worked in a professional environment as a software developer it's going to be really hard because you don't know really how a software developer team works at that moment you don't know the process you don't have the process just yet right yeah your internet is breaking up naz oh really oh i think i'm good um so i would say before going into freelancing you should start for one year have a job as a software developer just to get the experience just to know how it is to work in a software development environment in a corporate environment how they work with github how they plan their projects how much time it takes to finish a project what they do with testing because that way um you learn all of that without having to risk it all for yourself which you do as a freelancer you bury the you carry the risk when you're a freelancer that's right okay so that that would be my advice um that freelancing just started straight off the bat it's not easy i wouldn't also not recommend that because you don't want to be focused on running the business you want to be focused on learning the technical skills okay and if you become a software developer you work there for two years great you got experience on the technical level now you can see how they run their business and you can copy that if they're really a good startup or something you know and also build network because if you become a freelancer now off the bat it's going to be hard for you to also put time in to networking that's right as you know you come to our community and all that of course there are things like that but you have to invest time in that next to that okay does it answer your question yes it does but uh from your answer it brings me to another question um what you said about starting out with um a company for about a year so okay what is the skill should i expect to have like that i need to go in there just beginning like do i need to have all the data structures and apis and all like that and just have all this knowledge or like what what do i uh actually need to before i start you know applying so good good yeah good point excellent question nice so for this one is nothing crazy learn javascript on html or css the way you learn those is you build more projects you know and you keep doing things on your own so for example maybe you built a few projects through youtube now maybe you build a few projects of yourself that you want to do okay so you do that besides that the one hunkered out because once you build projects okay great you i've built some projects i know javascript i know html and no css okay great i know that once you've learned that maybe now you go a step forward and then you learn a little bit of reactions so just you know a simple framework that you can bring to attend attention when you go into an interview that makes you a much better a suitable for a job okay if you know a framework like react.js or vue.js or angular and so i always recommend you know react.js just as a starter but you can pick anyone as you're doing that the one thing you're going to see yourself stuck with is actually the interview process the interview is not going to be as hard as actually passing the interview okay once you've got a good portfolio you have some good knowledge around javascript html css react.js uh you know maybe node.js you've got some good knowledge around that and you maybe you went and you went to the interview the hard thing is now passing the interview but the thing is when you pass the interview you it's you you will need to learn those foundations and the foundations are the following it is the algorithms it is a data structures it's all of those so right now what i want you to focus on is focus on learn this fundamentals so like free code camp maybe you know um maybe udacity maybe uh you go to code academy you learn those fundamentals of javascript html css and then maybe you start building projects but you build one or two projects from tutorials and that's okay but then you have to do things by yourself so i recommend for people to do the following build a project from a tutorial and then add your own something to it okay that will actually teach you how to do it okay because without that all you're doing just copying and you're watching somebody else do it and that's not necessary that's not useful at all what is useful however is when you're using your brain right and the ideas are coming from you and the problemsolving is coming from you that is what's useful so right now i just want you to focus on the knowledge and building up the portfolio that's all it thanks a lot to answer your question yes it did awesome thank you very much thomas i hope you have a great did you schedule your graduation call by the way uh yes i did okay on the second at nine with uh jesse nice all right yay all right okay thank you very much in that case have yourself a good day who's next anybody else oh jeffy i remember you jeffrey jeffrey franklin i remember you from the last one too okay who else had a question let me see remove spotlight here let me see please raise your hand so i can see you or just say me in the chat so i can see otherwise it's really hard for me to actually see you guys okay if we don't need questions we're gonna stop here in a second let me see here me daniel daniel amiya let me see if i can see you here i'm mion okay hey daniel hey what's going on guys how are you my friend what's up danielle so um for somebody that's a full stack engineer just coming out of uh a boot camp oh dang okay what boot camp where'd you go kenzie academy oh how have a few people who went there okay yeah um my question is for someone that's coming out of boot camp and someone that's you know as we know boot camps they cram everything in at a certain amount of time that's right and it's it's hard for some people to really grasp the knowledge that's being given to them so for me i what what my question is is is anyone here at clever programmer able to be a mentor to someone like me coming out of a boot camp so i guess my question is anyone of you two able to be a mentor for someone like me so we don't have a mentorship program per se right but we do have a mentorship through other ways so let me ask you that okay why are you looking for a mentor right now why aren't you why aren't you ready to apply for jobs right now you just came from booth camp how many months did you do it uh one full year one full year okay all right why do you feel like at this point you don't need a mentor i i think i just i mean i honestly feel that i need a little more help to keep myself uh focus on i think more i'm looking more focused on the front end okay so okay great so i'm trying to understand why so tell me why in that case what what are some things that you feel like you're not comfortable with i think more i'm more uncomfortable with the first half of the boot camp was front end and then the second half was all back in like python django and you know rest framework and so front end which used what technologies tell me html css react express node.js mongodb okay so what do you not know about react.js that's hard for you to understand give them something not what i don't know i think it's just more that i would have to focus more on um i mean i have i have the i have the projects and everything like that i think i just need to focus more on the skills that i've learned and actually apply them myself and you know be able to um you know the way i i learned is if you don't use it you lose it that's true 100 yeah so let me ask you this okay okay do you know any algorithms data structures do you know for example stacks queues you know how did you get the chance to learn those at your kenzie academy yes okay so if i ask you a question very simple right now i asked you hey daniel uh create for me a function that will merge to a race together can you do it for me on the spot right now no no it's been that long like no because the the way the schooling had worked they focused us as soon as you move away they didn't give us enough time to allow i i well i didn't i wasn't able to go back and just continue to work on it on my own because i was just more focused on what was right there in front of me gotcha so then in that case did you actually learn those data structures yes well right but you can't answer that question right not without going back and have to think about it i couldn't answer that right right see but what i asked you is a very simple interview question right right so i'm just i'm asking these questions i'm trying to understand where the root is right to understand what the root problem is and i still think the real problem is add those funded foundations and fundamentals and i do think that it's about also using the knowledge that you've learned which is react gs and actually applying more of that towards the real world right but it's not just that it's also about learn those foundational fundamental skills because you've got the portfolio okay you went for one year right you know towards the kenzie academy or whatever it's called and you've got the portfolio it's it's there i'm guessing you built projects there correct correct yes you just start applying for jobs the best way to use what you learned is to just apply for jobs okay but the issue becomes here is not applying for jobs it's actually getting the job to get to get the job right because once you're in it and they see your portfolio and you've known some stuff okay great then you actually start to use what you've learned and that's how you get to learn even more you see what i mean so the most important thing is not just about using more of what you know it's actually more about using what you currently know using that to apply to a position and then you just see yourself growing from there right but the issue is getting that job so what you need to now learn is is actually you need to start applying for jobs like literally right now i i've been applying for jobs you know okay i've been applying uh mainly frontend jobs okay and have you gotten any interviews no no interviews yet no interviews why is that what do you why do you think that's the case um maybe i need to work on a resume okay that's part one work on uh bettering my resume maybe you know but i am also working with uh i guess kenzie academy has a career team that helps you with building up the right resumes and uh getting a portfolio together but i've learned my portfolio through you guys i didn't use you know what what kenzie academy wanted me as a portfolio so really yeah i it look it just clever programmer uh portfolio it just looks better okay officially visually and functionally it looks better okay great that's awesome that's awesome i'm happy to happy to hear that that you you actually use that um but right well now what i see is okay now you when you're applying for jobs what might be stopping you is part one is your resume and part two your portfolio and your linkedin so you need to work on those three things so you need to go back to kenzie and to talk them be like hey you know what i need to improve my linkedin your resume because like or not no matter what you know if your resume sucks and your like thing sucks it doesn't matter then that case whatever you know that does not matter at all right you see what i mean so yes what needs to happen here is you need to go back to them talk to them and say hey you know can somebody help me with my portfolio or my just simple resume because resume says a lot and is the reason why either you get submitted into the pile of yes interview them or no i do not want to interview them because that's the only way they know you they only know you their resume how else are they do they know you right they don't know you they can't see you they don't know who you are where you're from what you know hell no they only know you through your resume and if it's nicely built the way it's supposed to be then yes you have an opportunity there that's the first thing you need to fix okay okay second thing you need to fix is okay apply for more jobs so how many jobs have you applied to about 50 jobs so far i need to apply them more right so that's part of one is applying to more jobs there should be a minimum of 100 to 200 jobs applied in general okay right maybe even 300 jobs that's possible too right okay so that's another portion of it then when you're applying for jobs and this should literally be your job should be to apply for jobs right now that should literally just be your job and while you're doing that you need to be freshen up on your algorithms and data structures you need to go to youtube and you need to learn algorithms and data structures go to youtube type in algorithms data structures just type it in and learn those stacks cues you need to buy a book called cracking the coding interview okay okay it's called cracking the corgi write that down very important cracking the coding interview that's right you need to go to websites like lead code like hacker rank and you need to practice those algorithms and data structures because like it or not you will be asked those questions what i asked you i said i asked you a question daniel right i asked you can you emerge to a race for me together that is the simplest question that you will be asked another question for example i was asked this question create for me a function that will reverse and narrate can you do that can you reverse an array from me you have an array reverse it using a function can you do that not right now right so you need to learn those type of things i'm asking you because i i want to get to the root again i'm just getting the right thing right this is really important it's a really important conversation we're having yes right so get to the root so you need to learn those algorithms to data structures and that is actually how you will become a better developer and how not only will you become a better developer you will become more confident and that is what will train you for the actual interview is what i mean yes so keep using that keep interview or keep applying for jobs fix your before you apply to more jobs make sure you you run your resume and your linkedin by someone because for example for us when we run our own bootcamp we have a booth team called full stack mastery bootcamp when we do it we have a specific theory two three week process where we fix your resume and we fix your linkedin because it's so important okay so make sure you go back to kenzie and actually fix it with them that's part one and then of course and then just you know focus on the algorithms and data structures so that you're prepared for the interview when that does come around got it okay and if you do want more mentorship then did you schedule your graduation call by any chance i scheduled it when i first signed up for the course oh that's an onboarding call that's an onboarding call well i'm talking about the graduation call did you schedule that i actually wanted to do a call with you okay well schedule the graduation call and i will reach out to you how does that sound okay sounds good yeah uh where's the graduation call hold on i think i have a link yeah so make sure you schedule i'll put it for you and everybody you guys should still schedule a call right here so schedule it and then maybe and then uh i will go ahead and reach out to you personally and then we can we can talk how does that sound sounds good okay daniel daniel ammian right yes just make sure you use that same name will do yeah for sure okay daniel and me and i will go ahead and touch base with you all right okay okay awesome did that help you out so daniel yeah it did help yes yes jesse so don't worry too much i would say about this i would say can i call it the state you're in right now right right it's just a moment of measurement for you it's just a realization of hey i'm not yet where i want to be right that's all it is there's nothing wrong with it there's nothing you know bad about it it's just the way it is right now so now you gotta look at the future and be like okay so what can i do right now in order to go to the next level okay that's all this cold this conversation for you should be about so there's no need to punish yourself or to look at the past or feel like oh i could have done things differently it's just your journey okay so this is just your moment of measurement your moment of realization i would say congratulations you know for making it this far come join the next few days come code with us have fun with it okay put your back into it make a revamp your portfolio put in this new amazon 2.0 on it okay and work on your resume this week and maybe even if you work hard this week why don't you work on your resume you get on the graduation call with nas and you show him your resume boom there's something for you to do now this week so get your focus straight and you know challenge yourself and have fun how does that sound sounds good yeah beautiful great awesome good awesome good attitude that help you yeah it helped me a lot i think you know i just need i i need honesty and and you know a little bit of criticism here and there that that'll help me stay focused and keep my own eye on the prize basically beautiful beautiful that's awesome well i'm happy that i got the chance to speak with you and i'll speak with you at the graduation call okay all right so make sure you schedule that have fun danielle i know sometimes some of you are saying it keeps saying no time in august i actually might know because i actually ran out of graduation calls but um if you do still want to speak we'll we'll have more availabilities we'll create more availabilities for tomorrow okay how does that sound so you guys can still schedule it okay let's all start to get to the next level yes marlon let's go that's right that's right if you still here oh here's all do this right now if i you want i will open up one more day potentially i'll open up one more day for graduation calls and that way let me see oh let me see so you guys can because i know some of you guys said that there's no more available so i will open them up right now let me see because i can do that here graduation graduation okay there we go i see it okay i'll guess fourth i'm gonna do it between august 2nd august 5th okay apply all right here all right there should be one more day i just saved it so if you guys click on that link there should be one more day available yep right now so there's so you so go right now guys to that graduation call schedule right now because it's before it's too late okay so same thing with you daniel okay i sent you a link before it's too late schedule that call right now i opened up one more day here here's the link i opened up one more day it's august 5th let's do this let's get to then daniel did you get did you gotta give me a thumbs up got it nice so go ahead guys there's you test oh dang there's a few times that's available there guys so there you go all right okay cool sweet uh any other questions any other questions you guys got for us it's almost uh 2 p.m nas that's right so we're going to be ending here in a little bit guys maybe one last question frank frank will to give you almost a question will you have about five minutes left guys uh let me see frank frank frank okay i see you my friend asked to unmute go ahead frank i can't get me hi frank hello hello hello so uh yeah i'm pursuing a cs master degree and i'm uh expected to do graduate this december so i'm just looking for a job but as i actually had the internship last year about kind of like a frontend but unfortunately i didn't learn too much from that because they just gave me some code you know like they use the angular and it's a little hard for me to get started because i learned to learn uh kind of wet web development during master you know uh graduate years i only learned learning undergraduate with php that part so yeah you know it's outdated right so yeah and actually the thing is after last internship i just don't know uh what you started and now a little hard for me to land a job or something so i just want to ask uh what what kind of thing to uh i can improve from the resume because some uh when i have the interview they just ask me uh is that uh does that the class project you did or do did you do something out outside the classroom but uh uh unfortunately i don't do too much on that yeah but you but you but you had an internship right uh last year but it's on campus year one yeah yeah but but it's still an internship that you did right and it still involved coding yeah that well can i say it again so so the internship that you did did that involve coding yeah yeah involve coding that's the front end uh yeah so but i just feel a little bad they just send me the code send me the api you know the swagger swagger the documentation but uh i just don't know what what to start and that's a little struggling i mean yeah no for sure for sure for sure i think um what country amber are you at usa yeah i mean los angeles now oh you're los angeles okay and i i plan to join the onsite boot camp on well we'll help you what we'll walk you through and how to improve that okay so that's part one all right that just gave me an idea let me write that down hold on um um let me see uh resume linkedin okay sorry just give me an idea that's why so i think for you uh if you feel like you're just not comfortable enough for example if they give you a project to do okay frank if they give you a project to do and you just simply don't know where to start let me ask you this where do you think you should start like what do you think you should start if they give you this build this api with swagger let's just talk about that where do you think you should start what i'm doing last year i'm what i'm doing try to uh mapping the code the part of code with uh the you know the part on the windows you know on the window on the scope for example the which table uh does this code do or what we were kind of like uh word part words uh what parts that this code uh try to do so i just try to make this mapping thing so right yeah and try to learn the documentation but actually i don't really know how to use postman like you know that so that's another thing because i didn't learn it before so that's but can you learn it can you still learn though can you still learn um can you still learn that communication or no okay like do you think that you if you were given that task to to learn how to use swagger can you do you think you can learn it actually no that's why i don't know how to start what i yeah i mean just so many things i don't know at that time angularjs the swagger how does this frontend background work works because usually i just build my personal project you know that's kind of thing i know everything back and forth but in that part i i can't get access to the background code or yeah it's a little hard it's a big project so i can only do this part so just a little little bit uh uncomfortable so look i i think i think i think for you what might be the best to start out with is you need to look at this this big problem and divide into small problems so let's say for example you have to create an api with swagger right you know and so forth right you think about okay well one how do i create an api that's part of one okay so maybe you do research on how to create an api this is this is all about problem solving guys it's just all about problem solving right there were everybody were at a point where they did not know how to do something and then they learned it right so you're the point where you remember you don't know those technologies you don't know where to start but where to start is okay looking at the big picture here okay what are some small problems that i see well what the problems i see i see okay i see an api okay how can i solve this remember it's where were those two philosophies how can i solve it and then the fact that i can't solve it your question should be how can i solve it so api section how do i solve the api section how do i create an api maybe that's what you focus on okay next one swagger okay how do i use swagger how do i understand swagger you go to youtube you figure out okay how do i understand swagger to actually use it because swagger role is documentation for your api correct yeah that's right right so you look at that and you figure that portion out once you forget that portion okay okay i kind of understand what it's asking me to do let's now take it step by step so you think about okay i'm going to give myself one day to create my first api endpoint maybe at first i will create my node.js server api or whatever that might be so i look up okay let's figure out how to create how do you create an api you go to youtube you figure out how do you create an api and you do that and maybe it has nothing to do with swagger or with the project that you're doing but you were but you put yourself in that situation to actually learn it small steps so you did that small step what's next after you've done that what's next then tell me uh i guess try to use the api documentation we have to test my code or test the just the code we we already have i mean that's right that's right you test the code that's right you test the code and you see you know if it works or not you started to test the api so these little things that you have to try and do that get you to the actual the actual uh you know fullon process for me for example when i had my first internship frank okay i'll give an example i had my first internship and before i had it the way i got it was really interesting i was a creative computing club okay and i saw this one guy who was building a project called trandala right and they will build this application that's really cool and there was a web application i was like oh my god can i build this can i work with you guys can i help you guys out like yeah sure so to actually get into the internship they gave me a task they said hey nas create for us a web scraper that will scrape data from this website using python so what did i do i went home and the first question i typed into google was what is python not kidding yeah i had the same what is my name that's right like literally i had no idea how to use what is python how to use it so i'll look at what is python and i kind of learn some things about python then i ask myself question okay how do i scrape data from a database so i said how to build a scraper in python and i saw a bunch of tutorials on medium on youtube and how they built scrapers on python so i watched them and i saw what they did and i actually built projects with them once i learned that those little two pieces i'm like okay so time to build my own scraper i realized that i can use beautiful soup and then i can use a link and then i can simply just get the html and then i use the specific a html html attributes to actually get certain aspects of the actual data that's it and i built this scraper now i want you to ask me how much do you think how long do you think that took me two weeks two days two days what's very visible here nas is that you ask the right questions and when you ask the right questions guys you get the right answers simple as that so frank it's just a matter of asking the right questions like when i say that before you know like it's not about why can't i solve it it's about how can i solve this what is the next step what should i be looking at where can i get clarity on what's my plan you know that sort of stuff wow can i break this bra problem into small pieces what is one small piece and what would be the next small piece i have to solve you know that sort of things does that answer your question yeah this is my first question and uh after that what i said is uh landing for the next job next internship maybe like in the fourth semester or something but uh i just want to know how i can do on my resume of some projects which they just don't think that it's just a class project you you did every student do that so just do more projects that's it what do you think is the answer that if they if they're saying it's not enough product then what is the answer what is the answer that you know what the answer is huh i mean tell them what what i learned from it but they just think if it's a class project they feel like frank is so frank then what is the answer to that what is the answer that they're saying that they don't want class projects or it's not enough for them yeah yeah right so what is the resolution what is the solution it was a build by our by myself outside the classroom right though yeah yeah that's the thing that's it there's no other solution so what are you gonna do now doing my own project so that's why i just want to join this bootcamp and try to maybe think about what i will do so no don't
