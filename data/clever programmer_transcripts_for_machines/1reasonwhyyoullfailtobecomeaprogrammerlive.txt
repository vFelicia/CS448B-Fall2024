our live yet I do not know we'll just have to wait and see these technical difficulties kind of get out of hand sometimes oh okay sweet hey what's up so welcome in this video I want to talk about the number one reason why people fail to become developers why people fail to become programmers and we're gonna get into that but I just want to make sure that we welcome everyone in welcome welcome everyone thank you guys for jumping in hello dem Zee our loyal fan he was here for our live stream golden honey is here our moderator very excited to have golden honey back Allen Drac Swasey was seem Ricky Muhammad everybody welcome green screen video status was the first one so a special shout out to green screen status in gaming hum gaming hub not humph Freudian slip there and thank you if you if you just jumped in thank you for liking the stream as well it's pretty cool we got eight likes looks kind of like a tea which is dope alright so and we you know who knows we might do some live coding as well like we did in the last video so we might do some web scraping or something fun you know something random let me let me give you guys a little let's just do something for fun right now actually how about that huh so first of all let's switch to this and I don't know if you guys know this but you can actually hit inspect here or it said 20 like you see how it said 20 likes right there right I can just go here and go like two thousand three hundred forty likes like that weight wide network oh is it because it's a live page I think so I think has run a live page but generally by just hitting inspect you can actually change the setting here and it will change the numbers yeah this is because it's a live page that keeps refreshing but yeah you can change that and it's pretty dope so thank you guys for liking the video let's go back here and I want to address this thing because I think it's important again welcome everybody welcome Michael welcome abrir welcome anode welcome Vinod welcome Santosh welcome Mosab thank you guys for being here this is so awesome thank you my brother is here yes will cause cause II know what's up bro yeah and we have a live training by the way I've put together which is called my six that step system to becoming a Python freelancer and I popped that in to the description so if any of you guys want that six step system then make sure you click that link that I just dropped in the chat and sign up for that live training that I'm gonna be doing this is what the page looks like so I will go here so you can see the screen this is what it looks like my six step system to becoming a Python freelancer and you can see we have a bunch of people signed up already and dropping we have about 131 people registered which is pretty dope and there are three live right now so if you want to jump into this training which I'm gonna do in one in about two days from now on Friday at 12 p.m. Pacific time then definitely sign up it's gonna be pretty unbelievable training and it's completely free to sign up okay so now let's address this thing now that we have a lot of people here we're already going the momentum is up let's talk about what is the number one thing that stops you from becoming a developer a programmer from making that income that you want to make and now one thing is this that one thing is that we and you and it's kind of like a little reminder to myself at times and I tell this to myself it's like I need to stop being a little [ __ ] okay and this goes for everybody who's here for me it helps me to think like that okay because I realize that it's my own mental game that used to stop me all the time from achieving the goals that I wanted whether it was in programming lifting or running a business or running a team whatever it may be most people are too busy being little [ __ ] excuse my language and they just can't get past the first sign of failure they can get past you know when any obstacle is thrown at them or when they run into frustration they hit a roadblock they're building you know they're writing code for a project and all of a sudden they can't get past it anymore or it's a coding problem that they can't solve anymore and all they want to do is just give up but more than that people want to make excuses like I want to be a developer and get a job but I think I'm just gonna wait until my college is finished and then I'll be good to go or I want to wait until I finish this one class or tutorial till I want to do this one thing okay so let me yeah so let me make make that clear okay so let's let me share this with you guys here real quick where is this do I need to add this to the top layer will it show now okay like that maybe that's better all right so you guys can see this comment and the comment is the following let me make this a little bit bigger so you guys can focus on it easier so the comment is this this guy commented on one of my videos that's called why most programmers are broke alright and he says let's make it even bigger so it's even easier boom on the money I waited 10 years of wanting to code quit my structural structural engineering job after having a heart attack at 25 started my own business subcontracting engineering and build my own website learning HTML CSS JavaScript and PHP along the way a few months later I started writing WP plugins then learned to program apps in laravel continuing the journey and the plan I had 10 years earlier to program hardware like microcontrollers now I am building my own libraries and hardware for smart homes and should have a product to market this year all while supporting a family and doing contracting to keep money in the bank anything is possible if you take action and make it happen no University no graduating high school no waiting David Knowles 42 minutes ago on a YouTube video ok now with that said I will hoppityhop let me actually do this let me move can I move this one down down to this level and then this one down to this level sorry guys it's uh I'm like adjusting some stuff on the fly so just learning how a lot of these tools you sorry I think my mic was off and wasn't working so I'm just gonna say that part again but okay if we're looking at this this man had a heart attack he had no degree he did not graduate from high school and he goes on to start his own business hire contractors and gets a high paying job all while supporting his family and keeping money in the bank now if that to you is not powerful I don't know what is and this is some this is a common problem that I see with people all the freaking time where they're like oh I didn't graduate or I didn't do this or I need to make sure I do this that or the other thing before I can even start to think about getting a job before I can even start to think about doing something and it's like at the end of the day you're just being a little [ __ ] you are just making an excuse it's a form of procrastination you are saying that you're waiting until you finish something to start something and it's not true you don't actually need to wait for anything right and this man is a really powerful example of that so now I'm gonna hide that comment and go like this okay so what first of all are we still having audio issues guys what's going on audio issues is audio fine okay sorry about the no audio guys should be back now alright so this is the thing that's so important and we overlooked it all the time the amount of grit that it takes the amount of resilience that it takes for you to actually become good at a thing and you go through a lot of failures and this man went through an insane amount of failures and then this man went on to crush it and succeed and if this guy can do it with all these drawbacks then what stops you from being able to achieve the very same goals also in his comment if I bring that up again I want you to notice okay I want you to notice let's go I'm trying to adjust this at the same time okay let's do that zoom in now he learned HTML CSS JavaScript in PHP along the way meaning he actually did it completely by himself he did not rely on let's say an external resource to provide that now I'm not saying you shouldn't leverage college but college or some kind of degree or some kind of course don't hide behind it and don't make it your everything it should just be one extra resource so this person was still learning even though he didn't even go to high school right it doesn't mean your learning stops I never encouraged you to not learn you shouldn't be learning for the rest of your life but you need to leverage being able to learn on your own and becoming you know learning the practical skills because those are the skills that will land you a job and keep you at it but if you don't have that level of grit you will fail and you will not become a programmer I mean it's just that's just facts because this programming is a very very hard skill and because it's a very hard skill that is precisely why people get paid so much for it okay because you're the amount of money that you get paid right who says Bob Proctor says this the amount of money you get paid is directly proportional to the demand for what it is that you do okay I think the second thing is how skilled you are at it and then I believe the third thing is how difficult is it to replace you if it's very difficult to replace you that is how much if if it's very difficult to replace you in a job where there is a lot of demand then by definition you are going to be making a lot of money your income is going to be proportional to that programming is going to be it's not going away all right it's only becoming more and more everything is becoming automated cars are becoming automated cameras are automated we have lights that are automated we have apps that you know we use every single day like Instagram YouTube so everything is moving towards that and has been so programming is now going to be going away anytime soon and if it's a skill set you can develop and you can become just brutally good at it it's gonna become really hard to replace you and when it comes really hard to replace you in a skill that there's a huge demand for your income is going to be proportional to that so as long as you keep that in mind and you understand what the big goal is then you need to understand that there's gonna be a lot of difficulties coming your way it's gonna be a painful journey you're gonna feel frustrated so many times you're gonna feel just frustrated and wanting to not move forward because that's what programming will do to you where you're coding something and you're working on things and it just seems like there's no forward made forward way to make progress and sometimes it can feel like it's dry and it's boring but you have to always go back to your number one goal of why you even started this while you're doing this it needs to remind yourself of that and then with that you want to keep moving forward I mean honestly for me it's one of the most fun things where I feel that you it's it shouldn't even be allowed it should be illegal for you to get paid to code because of how fun it is like it shouldn't be allowed but yet people pay you to code so I mean it's just such an amazing opportunity because I grew up playing video games this is a video game do you write stuff and stuff gets created in real life like you can make real world applications on the fly that is and then you can just share them with people okay I'm just sorry I'm just reading the comments so if you have such an amazing opportunity and it's almost like a video game and you get paid for it take like it's like take advantage of it you know and there's so much demand take advantage of it and you could work as a remote developer you could travel and do this and what I find really cool about it is that it can turn into just a fullon lifestyle for you I don't know how to solve this thing by the way I'm just holding this to make myself look smart it's like it could just be a lifestyle where you could still have your own life to do whatever you want because I always wanted to travel the world and I wanted to go to super cool spots and I wanted to be able to spend time with my family and I wanted to be able to have freedom to kind of do whatever I want so you know I'm from Chicago but now I live in Hollywood and it's a pretty dope spot and I love being able to just pick up my [ __ ] and travel at any time that I want and so for you you know it just depends what kind of lifestyle you want I wanted to look I wanted to be able to do a skill where I was so good at it that I didn't have somebody always watching over my back you know and always looking over what I'm doing all the time I wanted to be able to have my own autonomy I wanted to be respected and appreciated for what I do and when you're writing code like especially when you're freelancing like your clients don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing so they actually just give you massive amounts of respect they're just like you just handle the business you just do this we'll just pay you and you tell us what we can do to make you happy because they don't want to be on your bad side either so it was I thought Matt I always feel massively respected when I go in anywhere I almost feel like I'm being respected like a doctor and then on top of that I choose my own hours which is what I want to do cuz you know I wonder I always wanted to be able to choose my own hours so then I can do kind of whatever I want like the idea of going somewhere consistently but like I said a specific time and getting out at a specific time feels like prison to me you know it's like [ __ ] prison it's literally the worst thing I could think of like if I had to do a ninetofive job I would probably just shoot myself alright so yeah I just wouldn't do it I never have I never will it's not because I'm afraid of work because most days I'm working over 10 hours 15 hours a day so it has nothing new of the work I [ __ ] love work but it's just that meant it puts me just in a mental prison when I have to just show up somewhere at a specific time get out at a specific time just do a specific thing it makes me go crazy and I love how there was there were two dislikes and then it went from two to one and then that person I think liked so that was pretty cool thank you for that by the way I appreciate it yeah so the micromanaging is really just [ __ ] right like the golden honey says in the chat it's not fun and I just have too much I don't know if you want to say ego or whatever you want to call it but I just want to be able to do the thing and be good at it and just have people leaving the [ __ ] alone when I'm in my zone of genius create something and then give it to you right and that's what programming allows me to be able to do so I find that super cool all right I'm looking at some questions here as well and comments somebody says facts big facts YouTube Plus Stack Overflow is equal to divine discourse who says yes that is true what do you think about Scala okay give me one second guys I think Aaron is here okay goes you switch the nine to five and I'll shoot myself okay so this one guy says hey guys Aaron is here welcome Aaron we're just chillin we might code up something who knows dude I discovered some really cool stuff like you can pop in a you can pop in a comment and then if I hit live it like will show up on their side and then I can't even like make it small and do whatever I want that's pretty dope huh yeah by the way guys iron is our new instructor because a era gone over Aaron is our brand new addition to clever programmer and wait sounds are gone why are people lying like that sounds were right here so he is he's a developer he's really badass he's probably he's actually probably more skilled than I am at programming but in just different things like he's a real software developer you know I'm more of like builds real [ __ ] and go get jobs Yeah right he's more of the bloodspot says the joy when you read my comment was kidding by the way oh yes yes sound is good yes sound is fine yeah there we go Sam says they line thank you all right I love that we have some moderators you know that we can trust yeah yeah all right so this is why you know I was just telling them why the number what's the number one reason do you know what's the number one reason why most people fail to become a programmer or fail as programmers to get jobs it's kind of a trick question yes so you said lot he said lack of experience I said being a little [ __ ] [Laughter] yep so they heard my answer he goes Aaron in his favorite chair I work 70 hours plus a week at a job I hate and still find the time to learn to program so here's another concept of not every dollar is equal so I'm gonna take this comment and give me one second I'll do some magic here real quick wait we need like a fulltime person who edits this stuff on the fly that'd be so dope I'll pay some good amount of money for that alright so hide your face alright so this is the comment we got very just right now which mr. snow wolf said this and he goes I work 70 plus hours a week at a job and I still find time to learn to program so first of all I just want to give mr. snow wolf no slaps on class so so absolutely love what snow wolf says and so first of all that's great but the second thing I want to mention here what's not great about this is if you find yourself in this position try to get yourself out of this position as fast as [ __ ] possible because not every dollar is equal all right so this is a concept I recently talked about and what that basically means is let's say I made $10 from uber let's say my goal is to become a developer and I'm gonna ask you guys this question I'm gonna need an answer from you in the chat before I continue forward I'm not gonna continue until I get answers for this so let's say I when I make so I want to become a professor developer my dream and goal is I want to work for a company like Google or I want to start my own startup and have and hire their developers and that's my dream is it better for me to earn ten dollars from uber or is it better for me to earn ten dollars from programming okay which is the better option uber or programming so drop that in the chat and I'll take a look at it this is what's this is what happens a lot of the times people want to get a particular job just so they can they always say this I just want to be able to support myself I just want to be able to survive well here's the thing that happens my friend you do that thing for 70 hours a week 70 hours a week what's total amount of hours in a week hundred and sixty eight twenty four times seven right there 168 total hours in a week and if you spend 70 hours a week and these are probably the 70 most effective hours right because most of the times you're doing a job in the morning till like you're starting your day off by doing work right so when you're doing something for 70 hours when you're doing a job you're essentially spending your most effective and alert hours there right and then the remainder is just like like whatever random time right so that time you have to spend some of it obviously with your friends and family so you you don't get divorced and your friends don't leave you and then you look like a loser so you have to spend some time there and then you what's remaining you have a few tired exhausted hours remaining to then learn something new right which there's nothing wrong with you can still do it but now think about this you spend your waking best most powerful hours doing something you [ __ ] hate how would that make you feel learn yeah so that would not feel really good you'd probably need to take Advil a lot of the times and then let's talk about what happens right so you're spending seventy hours on something you hate and your most effective hours of every week what ends up happening is that your thermostat of life starts to go down as well okay so we're talking about your joy starts to go down your level of creativity starts to go down your level of inspiration motivation ambition and your ability to actually want to achieve more you start to also compromise so have you ever found yourself like think back to when you were younger and you might have had some insane goals I wanted to be a soccer player okay then as I grew older I'm like no that's that's really not gonna happen that's the unrealistic goal then I had some other big goals and I would keep bringing them down when you are doing that you're also bringing your levels of goals down coming from that place to learn programming is a difficult thing if you can do it [ __ ] fantastic hats off to you that's why I don't even have a hat on because I took it off you know in prediction of this comment so as that's [ __ ] great if you can do that well most of the times this is why when people get into problems and they're run into a coding problem they quit right away or after they get frustrated for a few hours I mean how much more frustration can you bear if you're doing something for 70 hours of your most effective hours probably not that much more frustration right so then you run into a coding problem that gives you that makes you more frustrated okay look [ __ ] this I'm out right whereas if you can figure out a way to do it where now imagine these seventy hours were replaced by 20 hours of coding and I don't know what mr. snow wolf is being paid but I know most people are being paid ten to fifteen dollars an hour or less who are here on this livestream but you know I don't know maybe you could be making a [ __ ] ton of money some of the people that clever programmer you know are making 400 euro four hundred grand a year or millions of dollars a year and they have businesses but I know most of the people are not at that level so if you are making 10 to $15 an hour and you are doing some random tasks that has no alignment with your goal and then it's crushing so many of your other things gonna be really hard to move forward in the direction of your goal however if you replace it with coding in an intelligent way where you start charging another person as you're learning you find other people you can coach or train in coding they might pay you 30 40 50 dollars an hour we have a few students in a profitable shortcut program which is my group coaching program where I've actually worked with you in a group setting and they have already landed clients for $50 an hour $60 an hour or more and now they can replace a lot of the like okay let's do some math here if you're making $10 an hour and you jump to making $50 an hour how many at the $10 an hour job how many more hours how many hours you need to work to make it equal to your $50 an hour job does that question make sense okay so if you're at a $10 an hour job how many hours you need to work to make it equal to your $50 an hour job five times as much which means that if you had one lifetime if you did one lifetime of work at the $10 an hour job how many lifetimes would you have to spend to make it equal to your $50 an hour job you would have to have a great great great great grandchildren and you would have to spend five lifetimes yeah correct right I mean I would just have grandchildren and then make them my employees and then it would just be this great big business but no farm so you would have to spend five lifetimes so you have to look at it in terms of that don't just look at it was just temporary I'm just maybe $10 an hour here like no if it's not in line with your goals I would rather make no money and learn and and do an internship somewhere where I am coding but it's in line with my dream of becoming a developer then make $15 or $20 an hour because it's just not worth it right in the long run it's gonna be a way to lose now I know there's practicality issues right you have you might have family to support you might have to support yourself you have bills to pay I get you which is why I suggest figure out intelligent ways work more up here okay figure out intelligent ways on how you can start replacing that income from coding as you're learning coding so then you don't have to spend 70 hours a week doing something completely different that you hate you can start to spend 20 30 40 50 hours coding and maybe even getting paid for it and then the remainder of the time also spending coding and now you're gonna be getting to the place where you want to get to at a much much much faster pace so that and with that said mr. snow wolf this is not to pick on you or anything this is a great comment and your life to be totally different and I could have just made all of this up and I probably did but it's just this is something that just happens with people sometimes and in their case it might be a lot worse you know then what's happening to you so I'm just kind of emphasizing points and making them a lot stronger and maybe even harsher so it gets the point across to people who are really young and just want to make sure that they stay on the right path so I'm gonna clear that up right there all right let's see what's going on 141 people that's awesome I love that great okay so people are saying like imposter syndrome work harder not smarter I just hired myself a clever program programming yes but do over on the weekends charge more money sure if you're gonna do a BER then be listening to books or something like do something that's more in line with your lifelong goals okay yeah closer not I was like fifty shades of gray or anything well like listen to like books that'll actually achieve help you achieve what you want to what you want to achieve in life like south of books business books coding books yeah anything like that yes yes grind us all inside our cell and make programming your full revenue stream Sam says is great I would also say intelligent hustle pleased its overlooked and it's the ultimate form of laziness so I had this quote by let me see if I can pull this up I had this quote by Tim Ferriss is fantastic and I'm gonna pop that up on the screen here and it's just it's [ __ ] lifechanging like really let this one sink in really pay attention to this because this is super powerful but first I have to obviously find it okay there we go mana gotta do all this [ __ ] on the fly but I'm getting faster at it that's good okay so here is the quote and it goes in discriminant action is reflective of too little thinking and planning and that is lazy it is one of the most destructive forms of laziness because it is socially reinforced and people will encourage you to do that in other words they will say don't just stand there do something if you're constantly doing things that are not carefully thought through you will end up doing the opposite of the 80/20 principle you will end up specializing in unimportant things you will become an expert in doing the things that are trivial well that is a travesty and it's a huge waste of life or a card but only when it is applied to the right things everything with measurement and objective Tim Ferriss so what does all this mean it simply means the following hustling without being effective is a fall is the worst form of laziness it's a pretty destructive form of laziness so you want to let me edit that out of the screen so basically you want to get to the point where you are hustling but super effectively that's why you want to always planning and changing your plans and then working all right coding pads approximately eight out of ten actually or four out of five four dollars learning your goals skill is worth more than five dollars in which you hate ice I don't really agree with that coding pads I would say that one dollar or even twenty five cents of learning your goal skill is worth more than five dollars doing what you hate I would go as far as that the difference is huge if you think that the ratio is four dollars of learning your goal skill is equal to like five dollars of doing what you hate your [ __ ] gonna you're just on the wrong path that's [ __ ] that's unbelievable like I cannot agree with that it's wrong yeah it's just wrong like um basically what sometimes we end up focusing on is a shortterm goal but not necessarily the longterm goal so if you're thinking about the longterm goal you are gonna lose really hard with that comparison but you will win if you're thinking 25 cents to five dollars all right Christopher Johnson says who cares about money just enjoy coding absolutely wrong why don't you just then go play video games but you have to understand that we live in a Western world Western civilization and money is how the world runs and to make impact impact oftentimes requires money you want him and I'm not just talking about motivational impact right I'm talking about like something happens to your father he gets into a car accident and there's a brutal situation and now the hospital doctors require $90,000 surgery do you have the [ __ ] money to pay for that or not because you can't motivate him out of you know lifeanddeath situation so you do have to understand that money is very important but with that said also have fun okay mr. snow wolf says I'm gone most of the week I am fix that okay great shout out ahead Ville yep yep yep okay let's go Oliver O'Brien says I'm on 130 K okay great I'm just going through the comments trying to find some great comments you should jump on the comments maybe you can help me find them faster David Rivera says this is true a tried learning Java with Udacity for nine months and was basically forcing myself to do so after my full time job and it sucked I couldn't finish my projects in time yeah because then you have just so limited time you just you can barely even finish your projects at the end you're gonna hate coding but it happened because of the other thing so you have to fix the main problem and it's root okay I am complete Christopher Johnson says I'm completely new to coding I find it fun and I want to learn artificial intelligence should I jump to learning AI or do I need prerequisites you can jump to learning at my friend there are prerequisites that are gonna come along the way but just learn them as you go and I would say find somebody who knows about AI and you can find them in the online world you could go to channels and find somebody who can help you you can go to a physical location like meetups and find somebody but I would say find somebody and then learn from them but then also don't be lazy in the mean time still keep doing it and don't be like I'm not gonna start learning until I find somebody okay let's see it's Dempsey says we need money to live in this cruel world it's not a cruel world at all I mean it depends what side you look at it from but objectively speaking there's no such thing as good or bad they're just things just are so you know don't have a victim mentality there look it's a cruel cruel world just roll with it golden honey says honestly I worked 80 to 90 day 90 hour hold on I work it's okay I work 80 to 90 hours a week with three days off I get up early exercise then program for about two hours before I start my shift and on my off days I work on my programming that's pretty good but that's also really tough right because you have 80 to 90 hours of work three days off and then yeah but hey if you're working on programming that's really good you know you're spending your weekends there was just really good so that's more good job meetups are really good Aaron says make me a moderator all right Aaron here you go Aaron is now moderator we put a like Aaron he hates the new column he says cause you should make a music video I've thought about it we made this rap song a while ago and put it on Instagram let me if you guys want it if you guys want to hear it let me know you say something like I want to hear the rap song I'll put it on but yeah we made something and then we were thinking to actually hire a few models rent a Lamborghini and we were gonna actually shoot a music video we were so well we still could depending on how much if people really want us to do one we might just do it might be fun let's see this isn't one here yeah it's that one it's pretty lit actually to it oh how many people oh by the way guys yeah we do have 153 so far that's pretty cool so yeah I do want to mention this thank you for reminding me Aaron's alright so here's the training it the link is in the description below this is my six step system to becoming a Python freelancer I'm running this training this is gonna be really epic training I'm running it in March on March 22nd which is two days from now at 12 p.m. Pacific so it's a Friday you're gonna go here and then click Save my spot pop in your email and then you will you know you'll basically enroll in this training alright otherwise there's no other way to enroll in this training I'm not doing it on YouTube it is exclusive but I will be doing it for that you're not gonna be paying for it okay it's gonna be a free epic just massive amounts of value so we're gonna be spending a lot of time putting this training together for you guys and making it as valuable as possible yep like these live streams are more just casual you know I jump on and we just talk and maybe I answer your questions maybe I code and we just kind of have fun that training is just very specific like you know it's very goaloriented and focus because I know nobody's there to [ __ ] around people want serious information whereas on live stream sometimes people are more in a fun mood and just want to hang out and not gonna do something too serious so yeah go sign up and that'd be super dope to see you in there [Laughter] nine people live hello world huh I wasn't gonna say that and then all of a sudden just came out of nowhere I just said hello world in there apparently YouTube allows you to now do stream like right from here it's crazier it's like it tells you concurrent viewers chat rate everything and then you can even do it right from YouTube so wouldn't that be just so much easier we don't even need to use any tools yeah probably not who knows we have a hundred and fifty eight people registered that's great should we max it out at like 200 or no the training just cuz I feel like sometimes it gets too many people in there cuz then sometimes just ready to get so many messages on the side that people can't then they're like they can't pay attention like we've had we've had like we've had like sometimes lots of people register and then it's like crazy Lucas goes hi hi Lucas I'm like messaging them in there but yeah I'll talk with Rachel

signed up what just please say signed up okay just say signed up or what is the training called yes I signed up or say Python freelancer so say something like that that tells us who signed up right now and it helps me figure out if there's any interest for this training and if we should run it and let's see what other kind of questions were getting I'm a chronic problem okay Musab says something pretty interesting he says I have a chronic problem of jumping from project to project constantly I leave one Midway when I have an idea of another promising myself that I'll come back to it but never do this is a very common problem and it happens all the time and if you notice this happening with you quite a bit then just sometimes it's okay I'm sorry all right so if you find yourself that happening it's not so bad I do that too with projects I got what I want and then I'll move on but if you really want to finish one and you constantly keep finding this happening then just know that you do that and just don't do it anymore just stick to one [ __ ] project all the way until you kind of you know quoteunquote complete it then stick with it go all the way in just kind of hold yourself accountable to that okay okay cool David says David reverses just signed up that's really great oh my god we have people saying Steudle Bank whoa sugar Sean resolve who just who said that my

good so I'm gonna share my screen with you guys again here real quick so yesterday we created this app I'm gonna go here please keep making sure that it's working and even get headsets in to you so you can listen to it with one ear like put it in one year but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like you should be listening to it the whole time so okay umm what I was trying to do here right I'll delete this file so we can do this again because this is pretty fun so yesterday we coded up this app on a live stream which was super dope it was a web scraping app for eBay deals and if I go on this deals page if I go eBay comm and click deals what this does is it goes and finds the feature deals and then writes them out to a CSV file in excel file so it scrapes the web for the best deals on eBay and then writes them to an excel file and you could put this you could make this script and have the script do this for you so this was the script we wrote now it should get these things right like free certified preowned ZTE or Michael Kors or the Crocs Swifter or Skagen or Canon EOS for $699 and it should get these prices not to strike through pricing here I should get to $6.99 $69.99 let's check it out and see if the script works I'm gonna hit run here and you shouldn't get today's deals let's check it out all right and we wrote this file out to eBay deals March 20th that's CSV so let's go there and click boom looks like it's there which is super dope and what we're gonna do is now download this as a zip file I'm gonna click into it and then I will click here and let's check it out so boom we see free certified preowned stuff we see Michael Kors we see Crocs I see scag in the watch and I see Canon EOS oo earlier as well for $6.99 and not strikethrough pricing of what was it nine one one nine nine I think so this is super dope and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you guys access first of all who would want access to this code alright if you want access to this code and you want me to just link you this file drop it in the chat below and I'll give you guys this file is audio gone again no it's going okay is he just trolling us or what yeah okay somebody said it's back
