hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk to you about why coders or programmers burn out and how to avoid that in your life this is something that can impact you in your career as a programmer it could stop you from getting the job of your dreams it could stop you from becoming the programmer that you want to become and it destroys people's potential and career as a programmer so with that said and without any further ado let's jump right into it what is programmer burnout what is a what is burnout in general well burnout often times as grant cardone says I was gonna say I say but grant cardone says this he says you're not tired you're uninspired and burnout rarely ever happens because you're overworking because most people don't work that much and they don't actually push themselves to that limit most times burnout actually happens because people feel uninspired they're either doing the same thing over and over again or they're constantly getting frustrated and hitting a roadblock and that's the one thing that they're getting stuck by and so what happens when you keep getting stuck well eventually you will give up you will get uninspired and you will not want to move on so the one thing that can help you really break past any of these barriers and get virtually guaranteed that you're never gonna have a burnout is by setting really tiny little goals along the way to where you're trying to get to oftentimes I'll see some new programmers coming in and they're like you know I want to build the next Facebook I want to build the next Instagram I have this crazy idea too big of an ask too big of a task and when this start obviously they can't build it they're not ready oftentimes they give up they're burnt out now for other people the burnout happens even if you're big even if you're past a beginner right you're coding you're building projects but then eventually you forget what your goal is what you're doing and you kind of quit or give up so how does it work for me for example I'm gonna be competing in a powerlifting a petition in may May 25th is getting my first powerlifting competition to get to that I'm trying to make sure that I keep hitting everyday I increase my weight by two and a half pounds five pounds because I'm still in like the beginner face so I can keep making those gains and I have very systematic stepbystep things that cause me to win every day so when we bring it back to programming you need to set up these small incremental goals where you're winning every single day so let's say your job you're you do want to build an Instagram clone or you do want to build the next Facebook well you got to break it down what does a face what does Facebook have well you know I've talked about these topics before but I think it's really good to reiterate because as humans we need reminders all right like know why do we keep looking up how to stop procrastinating because all we need is reminders why do we need motivation just to be reminded and get back in that zone again okay so this is why I keep reiterating this so much but okay so let's say we want to build Facebook now just to break Facebook down into its component parts it's not just Facebook and boom that's it all right that's not actually what it is right when you're working on Facebook you need what is Facebook made of well we have login functionality so that's one we have log out functionality what else do we have do we have the ability to make a post yes so we can create posts we have a database that can store all the posts so when you create them and you log back into your account all your posts are saved somewhere it's kind of like a massive Excel spreadsheet so we need a database all right what else do we need after a database well we need to have a way we need to actually show this and make this look nice so we need to know HTML plus CSS if we're trying to make a clone of it okay we're not gonna be copying all of the technologies that are using let's say we're trying to build this with Python so what are what are we going to need well we need HTML and CSS to make Facebook look nice make it pretty okay what else do we need besides html/css well we need to know django so we can actually have something that speaks between all this pretty crap and the database okay so django just allows you in simple terms allows you to do that okay it allows you to speak between these two okay we got django and we will also need of maybe a few other technologies but let's just stop here for the sake of simplicity and not turning this into a technical exactly how do we make facebook but more so what is the general idea what's the message that i'm trying to get across here so when you're learning stuff one of your goals is to figure out how do you build a login logging in functionality all right oh we also have to upload this online right somewhere so maybe you need to know a technology like Heroku alright okay or digitalocean something where you can actually host this website online now you need to know login functionality that's kind of the first thing you need to know so i would start working on how does login functionality work or maybe i'll start with let me learn HTML CSS so then i can make a website look pretty so then when I build my Facebook clone I can make it look beautiful and you learn each technology as you go and you implement alright so this is how I learned so let's say I wanted to build a Facebook clone when I learned the login functionality at some point I went ahead in my app and I added this functionality okay then when I learned the logout functionality I went and added it to my app then when I learned to create post functionality I added it to my app and I would keep doing this and because I didn't know Heroku at the time and I didn't know how online stuff work I just used a module like tech enter in Python which basically allows you to make graphical user interfaces so it stands for GUI GUI and when it allows me to make graphical user interfaces well this just allows me to do it locally that's the cool thing about tech enter so I don't have to learn about all this crap about how do you post I didn't have to learn about Django at that point I don't have to learn about html/css I don't have to learn about databases so basically it it makes it simple for me to learn without adding too many complications so first I just learned GUI I learned there was a tech intern module I built a login functionality with a decanter module I built a log out functionality with the tech intern module I be able to create post functionality with that module and then when I needed to take it online and I was kind of stuck and I needed to know these things that's when I started actually learning about these things another big secret I will give you so you are not stuck on really really stupid things and just smashing your head against the wall constantly and not making any progress because in coding sometimes you get stuck with the dumbest errors a lot of people will know if they if you've ever tried to post something up online using Heroku you'll run into you stupid 500 internal service errors that don't help you at all improve your coding skills you'll not know what it is it'll turn out to be some small little bug and it will take you about let's say one week to figure out with five to eight hours a day of debugging very very painful and a total waste of your time so one secret I'll give you are coaches so what do you do what would I do here I would go to code mentor dot IO which is the online platform where there are mentors you pay them they help you there live it's almost like going to a pizza shop you ask for a pizza to give you Pizza you need help with code they help you with code right away and I used to have a mentor and her name is Jessamine she is in absolute killer badass she's usually always books I don't know if you're gonna get her or not but if you are going from this video message her that I sent you she's not gonna give you a good deal she might but she will definitely think that I'm awesome for doing that but yeah please let her know she loved that knowing that you're coming from me and she'll probably prioritize you higher I don't know but she's super awesome and she helped me a lot when I would when I used to get stuck with my coding problems and what would happen is like she'll just tell me right away what's the best resource and in what order should I go to add this database to my tech interapp okay so for example she might just tell me hey right now don't add too much complication of adding online functionality just build a local database using like Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file and with your graphical user interface that'll work then later she might tell me okay now it's time for you to learn HTML and CSS and she would just guide me on the right track and save me countless hours on stupid errors not intelligent errors not the errors were reading debug them you increase your skill I'm talking about you lose your brain cells debugging some of these problems okay so those are the bad problems to debug that I'm talking about and you know this woman has saved me years of my life there are some other mentors that I hired from code mentor as well that helped me a lot but she was definitely my favorite just to wrap it up how do you avoid coders or programmers burnout you one have a big goal and to you you break that goal down into small component parts and then you learn those parts okay three you apply each of those things that you're learning to one of your projects and your apps this way you are implementing and taking action as you go and the fourth secret that I gave you is if you have a mentor when you're stuck you can literally go to a platform called code mentor dot IO they're coders on demand they can just help you right away and then you can move on with your life okay if you can't afford somebody who's charging higher prices like 30 or 60 dollars an hour look for somebody who's charging $10 or $15 an hour and if even that's tough message them and say hey can we work something out that's the message for this video I hope that you enjoyed it if you did please go ahead and give this a little thumbs up really helps the channel we're trying to make this we're trying to grow this channel massively and we're trying to create like one video a day for you guys if not that's our goal but the way we can do that is if you support this channel and the super easiest way for you to support this channel is honestly just giving you a thumbs up then YouTube will put it in front of more people the more people that view it the more people will come into the clever programmer community and you're gonna keep getting tons of more videos and all we need from you is just the little thumbs up with that set thank you so much for watching subscribe to the channel if you haven't already this is Kazi and as always I love your face and I'll see you in the next video
