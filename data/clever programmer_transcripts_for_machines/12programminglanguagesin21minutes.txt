let's try to talk about 12 programming languages in minutes let's go now the reason why I'm excited about this video in particular is because I think whether you are beginner or advanced or intermediate it will give you a very highlevel view of what has happened with programming languages and sometimes even professional developers don't actually understand the real breadth of the different programming languages that are out there and what you can do with them in this video we're gonna be talking about multiple different programming languages but I do want to emphasize that what programming language you actually choose is important okay don't let people tell you that it's not important because what language you choose defines a lot of what you're gonna do in your career and so on and so forth okay for example if we talked about a programming language like Swift well that's more driven to mobile development we're gonna talk about it later for iOS not the same thing as data analysis or machine learning if you pick something that was to do with like making video games where you're probably gonna choose something like C C sharp okay so what language you pick is actually important now Before we jump right into this video I do want to say that if you ever were interested in becoming a developer or a freelancer and you want to be able to make an income from coding my team and I put together a pretty amazing training it's over one hour long it's absolutely free it's in the description below so definitely go and check that out with that said let's jump right into this video my friend let's go let's look at a lowlevel programming language versus a highlevel programming language kind of let's start right there so take a look on the left hand side where you see a lowlevel programming language now this looks like a lot of gibberish code it's one zero one zero zero one zero all kinds of random stuff that makes no sense well that's writing coded the Machine level it's almost like you're getting close to the hardware of the actual computer the CPU you're talking to the memory the storage all of it directly and so the code you're gonna write is gonna be really obfuscated really hard to read not really friendly for humans but really good or the computer another thing I want you to notice is look at the processing time it's really really really fast because the computer doesn't have to understand you in any way it doesn't have to compile it anyway it just understands you directly and so the code runs really fast that's the power of lowlevel programming languages okay so for example machine code is the lowest level programming language that you can do assembly then takes it a step further and then as you keep going you keep getting into higher level programming languages okay so that's one important thing machine language is kind of like talking to the computer in its own language but if you do a highlevel language something different like Python or Ruby or JavaScript well now you're speaking to the computer in a different language so it has to get like an interpreter or a translator to translate what you're saying that's what causes and slowdown so now if you take a look at the right hand side what you'll see is you will see code that's very readable steel prices steel prices get greater than two then have a discount otherwise discounted even less and that's how you write code in a highlevel programming language and as you can see it's very very readable as opposed to what you see on the left hand side like what kind of garbage is that now this is why most of the times I'm not coding in machine language right but somebody who is creating things that require it to be really really fast they're working at the machine level so if that's the type of thing that excites your wanna work on sensors or games or optimizing things and just making them as fast as possible you're probably gonna want to go to the lower level programming languages if you kind of like things that I enjoy which is working at a higher level with writing code that's easier to read easier to write makes me more productive as a developer rather than my machine well then you probably want to go to words a highlevel programming language here's an example of machine code this is what it actually looks like let's keep on going all right now one important thing I want to actually talk to you about is what are a generation languages okay so you have generation 1 2 three four and five there are five generation languages you can have so for example the first generation of languages programming languages so it's called one GL one GL is basically machine learning code and lowlevel languages okay that I'm highlighting right there on the screen for you now you can have second generation languages or two GL and they are also lowlevel assembly languages there's sometimes using kernels and hardware drives were more commonly used for video editing and video games okay so these are the two GL programming languages that are like assembly all right then you got the third and the fourth which to me are sometimes pretty similar but the third and the four GL programming languages are highlevel programming languages and that's where you're talking to a computer more like you're almost speaking English or you're speaking a certain language and the computer is just somehow understanding you so if I go back and look at this you have the third generation of three GL or highlevel languages such as C C++ Java JavaScript and Visual Basic so let's talk about a few of them but C is a programming language that's actually just one step above assembly language okay assembly is one level above machine code so the power of the problem with C is that you're writing code that is sometimes difficult to write if you want to achieve a lot you kind of have to write a lot of code to achieve those goals but the good thing is that it's really really really fast C++ is basically C but with like more batteries included and then when you go to Java now Java turns into a high level programming language where I would argue C is still kind of a lowlevel programming language okay so Java now has more bells and whistles more things that you can actually do with that programming language and then obviously as you get to JavaScript which is you know the programming language for the web that's primarily the reason it was developed as a scripting language and now it can do a lot of different things it can make messaging apps that are really good networking apps and it can also make mobile apps using the react framework they have and what a boost of JavaScript even more in the last few years is with the rise of their framework called node node allows JavaScript to run serverside and that may in JavaScript even more popular and made it grow even more okay so that's kind of third generation and third and fourth generation I again put them in a similar bucket but you have Perl PHP Python Ruby sequel these are all like four GL programming languages we're gonna talk a little bit more about them as we continue in the video and then the fifth generation programming languages are actually artificially intelligent programming languages so in those programming languages a developer is actually not coding most of the times you actually give it constraints and problems and then you let it do the thing and solve the thing and sometimes it even is visual so it allows you to visually do things and then it does the problemsolving for you so it's actually really fascinating so that's how you have like three GL for GL 1 GL 2 GL and you can use that framework to kind of go okay this is high level programming language is a low level programming language okay now with that established let's go to the next thing of the differences between high level languages versus low level languages okay what are the benefits what are the not so much benefits okay so as you can see the high level languages are easier to read hi leg level languages are actually less memory efficient than low level languages which are more memory efficient and it makes sense because the computer doesn't have to do that much translation you're speaking to the computer in its own native language Python is not a native language of the computer it needs to use an interpreter to read python that's why python is really slow if you have java or something else it's using JVM if it's compiling the code for it to read it okay so you have compiler languages you have interpreter languages and so those are always almost always slower even though Java is going to be a little bit more then Python Python is gonna be a lot slower unless you use something like PI Pi which is a JIT compiler justintime compiler or you use C Python which is a C implementation of Python and it allows your Python to speed up really fast highlevel languages are easy to understand whereas lowlevel languages or a lot tougher to understand by default the highlevel languages are simpler to debug versus lowlevel languages and this is the important one that I'm just gonna kind of skip to it needs compiler interpreter for translation that's the high level programming languages and then low level programming languages they need an assembler for the translation so for example if we go back to talking about c c++ right people go as c c++ a lowlevel language what's the what's going on here right c and c++ programming language was considered a lower or middle level languages there's no such thing as middle level it's a very rare use term but it's cut they're kind of a low of a language and they provide minimal amount of abstraction at the smallest cost to performance and efficiency so that means it adds a little bit of abstraction you can still write human looking code but it's so minimal that it still it still allows you to have a very very fast speed it doesn't sacrifice too much speed and it's kind of friendly for humans to write okay it's still more difficult than a lot of the other programming languages so that's kind of the thing with C and then C sharp you know is why is it this is widely used to create video games and unity engine which actually makes up and if you look at it it's the most popular game engine today more than a third of top games are actually made with unity and there are approximately 770 million active users of games created using the Unity engine again why are we using csharp for game development and not another programming language like Python or Java well because C and the C family of languages is just going to be much faster and it's gonna smoke every other language and so that's why unity is built with csharp and that's why it's just so fast and one of the best so we've talked about lots of different languages we're kind of jumping around into different places I touch base on JavaScript now I want to talk a little bit about Java so Java the main reason why I got really popularized was because of how it could run anywhere that was one of the greatest things that JVM was like one of the most awesome things about Java and now primarily for web development people use the spring framework for Java which allows you to kind of do the full stack so this is the spring framework here okay and it's closed as a source for a modern Java okay coordinate anything build anything connect everything and this is what allows this is what a lot of what people are using Java for another thing people are using Java for a lot is for Android development now there are lots of different programming languages that are growing in popularity for development for example you have Kotlin which is used for Android development as well so that's a big competitor that's by Google and it's probably going to outgrow Java when it comes to mobile development but it's not gonna be anytime soon maybe and then you also have you know there's a few more programming language it's like xamarin which is crossplatform and then you have flutter which is made by Google and it's also crossplatform so it allows you to make iOS apps and it allows you to make Android apps and so my money personally is on flutter I think it's gonna smoke everything but again it doesn't matter what I say it only matters what actually ends up happening but I really like flutter I did create some basic apps with it too and flutter is really really great for cross mobile development so that's my opinion on Java and flutter and we touch based on Kotlin now another mobile development language that I want to talk to you about is Swift Swift is primarily used for iOS mobile development and I think it started somewhere like 2014 ish and Swift started gaining in ranks pretty pretty quickly obviously because was pushing it to make making their main iOS language and the reason behind Swift was so that it's very easily readable it's really really fast and it's a pretty great programming language and they wanted to get rid of Objective C because that's what they were using an objectivec just really clunky and hard to use and it was a pain in the butt so they took away a lot of the objectivec and then replace it with Swift and Swift was their language but you know honestly flutter is pretty damn awesome so I would be looking out for flutter and if you're a developer you should probably look start looking at a little tiny bit into flutter you're not gonna go wrong with it Google is pushing it so you're gonna be pretty happy okay next let's talk about Ruby Ruby is a pretty awesome programming language it's mobile development primarily that's what mostly what people use it for and it's really easy to read the only kind of drawback with Ruby that's happening is if if I go here write to Google Trends and Google Trends is really good to look at and you just select programming language and this is a leading indicator and it tells you the popularity or or whatever of a programming language okay we're just gonna cross out this and we're gonna take a look at Ruby just by itself so ruby is really taking a hit in the last few years when it comes to popularity and so it's not dead and I wouldn't I'm scared to call any language dead but it definitely is on a downward trend so if you're gonna do something with web development maybe go with JavaScript okay you're gonna be better off there it's very popular and it's not going down anytime soon and the trend is much much much bigger right so we're gonna do something with purely web development then Java is gonna eat Ruby any day for breakfast that's my verdict that's my that's what I wanted to share with you on Ruby now I'm gonna talk to you about obviously my favorite programming language if you are a follower on my channel you know I just talk about it all the time and I will continue to talk about it all the time because it's awesome I'm like the Gary Vee for Python alright so let's talk about Python and if I put up Python you're gonna see the Python it's gonna eat actually all of them up so if we go from 2004 to present oh I'm sorry I was blocking the view there so if you look now you'll see that Python is the yellow one and it comes and it just eats everything okay and if you don't believe this then what you should do is you should open up like YouTube and then also type in Python here and see what comes up okay and you'll see the top videos have like eight point three million views as you can see right here I'll try to zoom in so it's a little bit easier for you to see you'll see eight point three million views and if I actually type in JavaScript you will not see anywhere near those views right at the top 1.8 million views that's a big difference this is one of the leading indicators this is actually called Pipal popularity of a programming language and it's one of the best way to determine how popular or programming languages and its demand you don't want to look at something like Toby index because it's a lagging indicator it only tells you how many webpages there are for a certain language okay because objectivec has like 2030 million webpages but who the hell is reading those webpages okay and so Toby is more of a lagging indicator you want to look at Pipal it's a leading indicator or just go to Google Trends and look for yourself so that's one of the reasons why I'm a fan of it and for for Python you have this framework you have multiple different a web development frameworks one of the frameworks that I really like and that's one of my favorites is Django and the thing that I like about it is that it's made for me it's a web framework for perfectionist with deadlines alright so if I just zoom into that and if you can read it at the top here that's my favorite line the web framework for perfectionist with deadlines so with Python you have a lot of functionality I mean obviously it most languages have lots of functionality I'm just biased towards Python but you can do web development with Python you can do also lots of data analysis and machine learning type of stuff that's why that's one of the reasons why it's growing so much in popularity because that's one of the things that people are really looking to learn but I just like the fact that it's flexible enough to do things and do most things really well and make you really productive as a developer it's also very very easy to read it and there are lots of job opportunities out there for these for this programming language so there you have it I've covered lots of different programming languages I don't know how many minutes this is do you have any idea Frankie no okay so hopefully that was covered in less than 20 minutes and I hope you did enjoy or get something out of it now I want to leave you with this every programming language has its pros and cons but really look at why you are learning a programming language look at what the future looks like look like look at what the job salaries for that programming language look like really pay attention to that because if you don't pay attention to that it's gonna determine your future and a big chunk of your life okay because if you're doing mobile development sure you can switch out but you'd be much better off if you became a specialist with that and the language is gonna determine a lot of your behavior okay it's kind of like culture if you grow up in a predominantly Caucasian culture you're gonna have the impact of that if you grow up in America versus if you grow up in China or you grow up in Hawaii or you grow up in India or Pakistan your childhood and the environment around is gonna shape what you do who you become okay if you're africanamerican and you're growing up in America the things you're gonna deal with maybe somebody else is not dealing with those same things okay so that culture in what you stick with is gonna determine a lot of your job opportunities what you go on to do so a programming language is very similar if you pick up JavaScript the community that you're gonna be a part of the things that you're gonna create it's automatically gonna be really a lot of it is gonna be client facing stuff and you're gonna be making a lot of frontend stuff it's just part of it okay if you do primarily Python you're gonna be doing more backend stuff you're gonna be doing maybe more fullstack stuff or you're gonna be doing more data analysis stuff it's kind of the part of it and the culture of it so something really important to understand then other important things to understand is what are the opportunities that demand how is it growing and what are how much can you be earning as a developer okay so some programming languages if you learn them you come a specialist in them maybe you make fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year but the nice thing about certain languages like JavaScript in Python you can be making over six figures as a developer if you're a great developer if you get a job in United States of America then that's the case otherwise for average developer worldwide as a developer you'll be making between fifty fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year depending on your skill set depending on your negotiation skills and all of those things combined now I hope this video gave you a lot of perspective I do want to just say my team and I have put together an amazing free training for you it's to help you become a freelancer with Python so we share our secrets with you on how you can actually become a freelancer that can make more than six figures and have a pretty amazing career as a developer beyond a pretty
