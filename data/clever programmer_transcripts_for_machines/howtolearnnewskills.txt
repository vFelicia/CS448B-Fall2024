hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and one of the questions that I get so commonly is how do you learn something very quickly and become skilled at it the secret about that is making learning into play think about how anybody or anything gets good at a skill think about even a little cub lion how they get good it is in the start they just play around they feel things out and over time to start developing better skills for them it's in hunting it's in scouting and being able to see really far for them it's in running surviving skills but for us somebody who's learning to code it could be in becoming a better coder becoming a better programmer one mistake that I see a lot of people make is that they want to stick to the script if you're following a tutorial you'll literally follow every exact step by step in the tutorial and they will never deviate from that example to try to turn it into their own example something that helped me the most was actually taking snippets of tutorials and then just deviating into my own world creating something from just the first few lines of the tutorial that I was following that was my own and that could actually help me in my life when I started learning Java or when I started learning Python in the beginning days I would create these little things that could help me calculate my paycheck I would just be like okay 30 days of cause ease time what's the return one week of cause ease time what's the return on that and that's something you can do as well but make sure that if you're doing something and you're following and you're learning more time should actually be spent outside of just what you're being taught and you should be exploring playing around with it and just making it play really getting the feel for it so invest the time in just learning invest the time in making something play because realistically that's one of the best ways you are going to get better that's one of the best ways you're going to pick up more skills and become skilled in a very short amount of time right and again I say this as somebody who understands the psychology of hundreds of thousands of students that I've worked with oneonone whether it be teaching them computer programming whether be teaching them chess or table tennis or whatever else and I'm also speaking from a perspective of somebody who became top 1% in the world of chess somebody who became better at computer programming and there's nothing special about me I didn't have a 4.0 GPA in high school I didn't have a 4.0 GPA in college I didn't have the best ACC scores and know I was not a math genius but those things that have helped me make my skills so good is I never just did what I was assigned to do I never just did the bare minimum and did exactly what it said in the script I took those examples made them up my own and ultimately turn it into play that's it for this video guys thank you guys so much for watching I love every single one of you please like the video please subscribe if you're new to the channel it's that Bell button so you make sure you get all the notifications freshly in your inbox so right when they're delivered you get them all right guys I love you and I'll see you in the next video
