hope you guys are doing good this is nas and jesse and today we are building amazon clone 2.0 but we're building the cart page of amazon clone 2.0 right look at this uh look at this out so we've built this yesterday uh about in terms of a new amazon clone 2.0 we have ourselves categories we have ourselves you know a banner we have ourselves a navigation bar we have ourselves you know this little add to cart icon and then we have products right here so what we're using for this again is we're using javascript using css and we're using kl1 css and of course we're using firebase as well to be able to populate all of these items that you see right here so stick around because this time we're actually going to be building this card page so the goal is when you go ahead and add to cart inside on the home page it will automatically populate it in here and kind of make it into like a live a website right so that every single time you got to cart it shows up in here this total cost is going to update from firebase this numbers are going to update as well same thing with the count same thing with the total cost as well okay so welcome welcome welcome glad to have you here and the you it in the youtube live great to have you have you guys here on zoom let's go ahead and get started and see what we can get done together all right so a few things you guys know from the last time is we have the code from the last time let me go put it on the lefthand side nope that's not what i want you have the code right here this is going to be the code that we you know finished working with the la uh you know in the last uh video which the link should be somewhere you know down below but i'm going to put my code here so i can see it just for reference so that it's all good there and i'm going to open up a new vs code window you guys can do that too or you can just open up your current vsco window right here i'm going to say open and i have my project which is amazon clone 2 which is technically this one right here amazon clone 2. if you do not have this project the link should be down below so i'm on if you can put the link to the github down below in the description for youtube that would be amazing thank you very much all right okay so we got that we got that that looks all good what do we have so far well we only have basically an just this one and we have a style the css which is this one nothing much so far right we've built what we've built the homepage so if i go ahead and right click and open with live server i'll do one more time there we go this is what we have right so not a lot of products you know we only have like one product right here i know a lot of you guys who did are doing the amazon challenge you probably have a few products now at this point uh maybe like 30 or 20 or 100 maybe like one or two you know depending on how you like it um and now we're going to be working on working on building the cart page today and then tomorrow we're working on actually building you know the the whole thing which is using firebase grabbing data uh pulling data showing all the pro all the items um and yeah all right so my friends hope you doing good hope you're ready let's just get started all right a few things we've done this now in order for us to get started on the card page what do you guys think we should do right now all right i want you guys to put in the chat those of you who are on zoom i want you guys to put in the chat so i can see all you guys let's see that's right i need to add the card button of course but mainly what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a new html page so new file and i'll say cart dot html right the unfortunate part about using vanilla javascript right now because i'm using the very very bones of javascript the unfortunate part is that we kind of have to copy and paste the index.html into our card html and explain why in a second okay usually you wouldn't do this but for now let's just make this work because i want to show you the most basics basics all right let's make sure that come on let's make sure that there's nobody who's talking okay or let's just a model has please mute everybody and so nobody can unmute themselves please okay that means they're all good thank you monique okay all right in that case what i'm going to do is i'm going to in this card html i'm going to copy everything from here into card html okay right there so copy your init.html copy this one command a or ctrl a and then you want to do command v or control v right depending what you have let's do that and now we have basically the same pages we have inside the initial.html now but in order to get to this page now i want you guys to look right here see this says index.html go to that one and then change it to jar card.html right there all right okay let me go and make sure that you guys are all here i'm see i'm on it you all right jesse please um yourself jesse actually no you're merely you're good all right so i just met everybody sorry guys i just made it everywhere so we're all good all right now we're curling the card page right but of course nothing really changed nothing really changed so to change it what we need to do is we're going to keep this sidebar the same right and we're going to keep this navigation bar the same as well right here the one thing we're going to change is what is just basically this portion of the product itself right right so in order to do that what do we need to delete to only delete this section you guys tell me in the zoom what do you delete delete only that section the banner no the whole that's right same here the whole main section so if i go down to here we have that one this is the main section right if i go ahead and make this smaller it shows me all the things we have we have the main section deals the main section categories and the banner right that's all in there so all i have to do is just simply highlight this whole thing okay click delete and that's it we're good want to delete once you click save now it's all clean all right the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to just simply change this bg gray to bg white there we go so it's a white color okay and then the next thing we need to work on is what is it what do you guys think what do you guys think is the next thing that we need to work on to make this fully work i want you guys to put that in the chat well what is it it's going to be the header the shopping cart header okay so jesse maybe you can help me out that's going to get started if you give me a live share i can't that's right jesse needs to do the live share i forgot about that dressing a e so what do you guys think guys when we're gonna be making the title of shopping card we've done it a lot of times yesterday what would we do so jessie here jesse though okay i should say h1 that's correct julian h1 and what kind of styling would you give it if you look back to the 2win documentation how would you style this up exactly you could give it a fun bolt or a text to xl you know to determine the size of it and you could give it that green color correct that's right so let me connect in the meantime maybe you could start typing that already nice yeah so let's go ahead and create an h1 so we'll do by the way is the song good is it do i keep the music should i turn it off let me know in the chat guys should i keep the music or turn it off it's like it's like pretty is it good it's chill okay it's chill keep a little a little bit less a little bit softer softer is that good all right yeah it's lower a little bit yeah okay it's good so let's go ahead and create an h1 right here all right and that h1 is going to be not no class right now but it's going to be the shopping cart right now so shopping oops right here put that shopping cart shopping cart inside here the cart okay so let's go ahead and save that let me go back to amazon 2.0 and here we have the shopping cart of course let's start styling this shopping cart okay well a few things need to happen with this shopping cart the first thing is go ahead and make a text gray for 100 so let's do a class right again we're using tailwind css remember that guys text gray right 400 save so it changes the color next thing we're going to do is give it a larger text so we'll say text dash 3 xl all right and then we'll do a margin bottom 6 because we want to push it to the bottom so you see how there's margin here in the bottom so just so you guys know by the way guys margin is a space under is basically the space around the box so if i have the box right here you see this the margin let me just show you guys some a lot of you guys have questions around that so the margin is basically spacing above it below it underneath it like this to the side well padding is a space inside of it okay so once you guys just to keep that in mind so padding is inside margin is what is it outside that's right okay beautiful so we got the text three excel so it's a little bit larger now let me take a look at it x3 xl save it nice beautiful let's make a little bowl so we'll say font bold inside the piece of code font fontbold and yes i know you probably want me to wrap to wrap at this point so i will get i'll do the word wrapping now okay right here so we got the font bold all right we got the phone bolt that's looking exceptional right oh hi jesse jesse is trying to steal our code hello fun bold then honestly that's pretty much it uh mb6 is gonna be mmb six for margin bottom six all right so got the shopping cart also good next up is what is going to be this section which is let me see here uh let me see you here which is going to be this section right here how do you think we should create this i want to ask you this a question where do you want me to put this in what is it guys what is it well it's a dip that's correct so let's go and put that into a div div and no class for now just an empty class okay i am humble just going to call this class a main or a like table titles for example like maybe you know table dash titles why table titles because you know this is technically like a look at i think of it as a table all right then that's pretty much it inside the table titles we have three things we have and what are those they are the headers so we're going to do an h2 in here that one h2 is going to be a product right okay another h2 is going to be a what a count and then the third h2 is going to be a what what is it it's going to be a total cost right and they're going to create these specific product count and total cost okay so that's just kind of that all right save that and let's see what we have so far we've got product hi jesse product count total cost right now we need to of course modify this currently they are from top to bottom but we need to make that from left to right how does that work what do you guys think that's right it is going to be using something called flex and if you guys want some good information on flex if you just type in flexbox inside your google search if you type that in go to complete guide to flexbox right this is the only thing you need to learn around html i'm not going to lie if you want to learn css you go to here and you learn flexbox honestly that is it guys right the only thing you need to learn this tells you exactly how you should be for example you know uh displaying things in what direction in what column how to wrap things how to center things right here you see so save the website go to flexpod it's from css tricks save it it's really really good alright let's continue to make sure it goes from left to right we're going to call it flex save that all right and honestly that's that's that's pretty much it okay so flex all right i'm going to i'm going to go ahead and call it a um i'm going to give it a full width of 100 so let's do let's do a bg dash uh yellow dash 500 just for now so you guys can see what's going on the width is full which is good which is good let's go ahead and give it a font bold so everything is fun to bold font dashboard save that now everything is bold all right let's now go ahead and do text great let's give the different tickets to text dash gray that's what that's 400 right there okay and honestly that's pretty much it okay now you see so it's the weird you know weird color but that's all right don't worry about the word color right instead we're going to worry about is how do we make sure that hey this card total is on the right hand side and this total cost is on the right hand side as well how do we do that because if you see here like these you know take up a certain percentage or a certain uh a certain width right here see and so do does the product okay so does the product now to fully understand how we do that well it's kind of like this we we're going to give this column a fixed width and this column a fixed basically width you see but then we're going to give this column the ability to stretch as much as possible right because you can see if i stretch out my page you see what stretches does this stretch or no time in the chat does this stretch or no not necessarily okay does this stretch or no only the product that's right does this stretch or no that's right just the product is what stretches so if we want to repeat that all we do is just we use flexbox to repeat that so for the product what do we say guys for the product we're going to stretch it right so to make it stressful we say this class equal to flex dash grow this is what happens again if i go to here and i say flex you see it says flex girl right here right let's grow is what's allowing a div to expand as much as it possibly can as much as it can take up the space all right that's flex grow then for the h2 for the com we're going to get a fixed width so i'm going to say class is equal to w dash 48 remember not 2 38 but w remember i know remember with the width right it's width dash the number that we want to use that's using tailwind css okay then next one we're gonna oh jesse is in let's go then okay just sorry taking over i'm like holy she's like she's just waiting to take over the computer so then we have h2 class of w48 as well right okay which is right here so we got that and next up what we're going to do is we're going to create the card items but before i do that let me refresh this for you and you can see that it's going to look pretty good that means i can remove this whole bg yellow 500 so you guys can see more clearly save that all right are you guys still with me you guys still with me yes or no yeah you guys are beautiful all right next up is the cart items because remember these are the card items that we're going to be showing so jesse let's go and create a div that's going to show us the card items jesse okay are you still here all righty yeah yeah i'm here i'm here so so go ahead that said um let's go and make the class known still inside of the main section so still here i'm gonna make a div class i'm going to call it cart items and let's define that first okay make the div boom and inside of the div guys what are we going to be making inside of that div one our card item correct and what does that card item contain well contains an image contains yes so it contains an image okay what else contains the product details about it uhhuh okay product details a counter a cart item details okay what else it contains the counter it contains a counter um yeah well is it this class yeah it's this class diff class counter whoops contains the total card and then the total that's right cost all righty e e last total cart item i'm gonna call it cart item total cost so guys we didn't we did with the name of your classes you want to be as consistent as possible because if your app becomes really big it's easier to read if you have a certain style to it to your names okay yeah so that's very important card items and we also have that little cross where is that oh that one that's uh that's right the delete one right which is this one right here yeah this one yeah yeah that's right so we're also gonna add that in later so we're gonna say div class cart item delete okay so guys this is your structure for the card items each card item will have all of these elements okay so let's first start off with of course the image right but i want us to be careful because jesse because we put all these details outside the card item so we want to make sure that we put it inside the cart item right so he wait that's a very good yeah good catch that's true you see how we have the card item right here but all these elements are right here is that you want to put all of this inside boom right there boom nice good good good right so make sure you guys do that here at your home as well okay that's looking good and so we've got so far nothing so far okay nothing so far she's going to create a div class card image card item image yeah and we can actually have that image in there okay so what are we buying today i know we're buying i know i know i got it i got it i know what i want to buy oh i know i know we're buying the apple macbook pro let's go the m1s the um m1 chip yeah i like that one oh that one's amazing i love it that's the one i'm using to stream everything right now oh yeah yeah i'm also coding with what it's crazy okay so you go ahead let's go go ahead so guys just like yesterday okay you're just gonna open up the image tag like this have the source and you're just gonna look up that the address of uh a macbook or m1 picture okay like like this now if we open up the browser now i don't think it's going to look good let's see i got this it's probably looking really is it oh yeah yeah now we're buying one humongous macbook pro doesn't even exist i love it it's the biggest macbook pro that exists on the planet okay so let's style this one up okay so first of all let's check this with the class itself with the image no let's make a diff around it and we already have a div around it okay the card item image div that's right so let's give it a white of 40 and a height of 24 and to make it look really like goes seamlessly into the background which is also white we're going to give it a background of white hey let's go and we're going to give it a padding of four okay and we're gonna round the edges okay we're gonna round the edges nice okay good now what you wanna do if you have a diff around your image you always want your image to fully take up space inside of that div so what you do is you style up the clock the image okay so you can say image class with full height full and guess what object contain that's right so what's going on in this situation like this is basically what's going on is basically we're creating this div and i want to show you guys what's going on we create this dib right here okay then we tell the image hey you know what make sure the height is a hundred percent and a hundred percent of width and height of that of that there right and then we say you know what make sure do by using this whole thing of object contain this tells the image you know what make sure you can also you can actually see the object because sometimes either the object gets cut off because of the different aspect ratio or the object is stretched which is not right as well so what we want is just contain it inside and that's what that allows us to do yeah exactly and i made it purple so you guys can see the div class around it and what it actually does but i'm gonna change it back to white again okay so now the image is good i do think it's a little bit close to the top or the top is closed too so let's give card items let's give margin top okay five plus hmm okay let's continue let's continue further with the card items item details so what do we see there we see a title that we bought on ipo pro apple macbook plus we know of course that the brand is apple okay so what i'm going to do inside of card item details i'm gonna make two other div classes okay i'm gonna first one i'm gonna call it card item title let's first start off with that one okay so there's some delay hello i need i need to type the div myself close it up okay apple macbook pro 13. and here i'm going to give the other i'm gonna make the other div class okay carts item brand okay oh now it is okay thank you and the brand is of course apple that's right okay so let's style that one up because now it's just i think just play letters plus it's not vertically aligned i think or is it so let's go and save that let's see so if i go to amazon right there it's not vertical line instead it's like oh yeah it's like bad so guys who knows what should be done in order to get those items next to each other instead of vertically like i mean at this point i think they should notice if they do if you don't know this i don't know what to do with you okay don't say that not don't say that i'm kidding but like if you don't know this i don't know no the question is how can you find out if you don't know this that's right actually that's right that's right that's right that's right kevin is like everybody's like i don't know jk i don't know they're like i don't know but it's like they're like they're scared they don't dare to tell us otherwise i'll give them more homework that's right this is a good idea actually so that said guys how to do this okay so you want to make something like this you always want to make it well sometimes you want to make it visible you know so let's say we make the card item we give it a certain color i like that purple color actually okay did you notice yeah so let's say this is the purple this is the card item and this is actually are you seeing it are we seeing it yeah we got it are you saving it yeah i got it so this is the card item guys and actually so you want to give this card item what a flex of course because if you give it a flex boom everything will have the direction of a row okay so let's do that let's give it a flex okay which stands for flex display flex and the default value of this reflex always roll okay and of course once we do that boom you will see it line up next to each other let's see come on come on come on there we go nice oh there we go plus we want it vertically aligned in the center so what's what's the property for that guys it's items uh hyphen center okay and that's it basically that's it now to be a little bit um to be very specific let's give it some padding bottom okay and that's it so let's style up the details now all right so for the title let's make it a fun bold okay fun ball so guys i'm inside of the card item details and i'm styling up the title so pay attention here okay fun bold i'm gonna give that a small text okay so text hyphen sm and i'm gonna make it gray so text gray 600. okay awesome and oh oh no it's all good so good container it's all good yeah and then text also small text for the brand and we're going to give that also a gray color but a little bit lighter than the one before so instead of 600 we're gonna do 400. okay and that's it for the um so let's remove that purplish that beautiful purple color okay boom nice that's looking really good that's really really good jesse nice job nice job so yeah yeah nice job so at this point you guys have done the details you guys have the card image that's already done what you guys can do is now what work on the counter right this is going to be a little more difficult because now you have to focus on having creating these two buttons right you need to create this text and then of course needs to be some kind of a hover on these two buttons now these two buttons are what's going to control how many items you have right so if you want to have 20 of them or maybe you have 230 of them i'm guessing you probably won't have 20 macbooks but who knows maybe you just have a lot of cousins okay that works too you know i'm the youngest in the family so i'm kind of lucky that way there you go all right so let's go ahead and make that one work now yeah for sure for sure so let's get into it so counter and first of all always start off with the easy part okay guys so we know that there is one time right so i'm going to give that an h4 and do like this oh is that like that like this okay boom basically it's there however let's style this up okay h4 class text gray whoops text gray 400. that's it that's the times one can we see it on the screen of course we can oh yes we can i really just i really think you need to implement autosave but yeah oh you don't have the autosave no okay that's okay so yeah we have it right there it's x1 right here it's just very like in the corner which we don't like no we don't like that no so but that said we need to style up the counter because uh we have to give that of course a width like before okay so let's style up the counter the card item counter part here so remember guys when so i'm gonna go to the top look here at line 105 remember this column count was set on a width of 48 and the column next to it was also set on with a 48 that said these widths here are fixed but the column the first one about product that one can grow as much as it can you know as much space has been given so but that said because we're working on the counter column we also have to set the width here okay so with 48 boom and of course we're going to give it a flex here and item center so my one and two chair fronts will be nicely vertically or uh aligned okay so the one she's talking about by the way is you're talking about these chevrons you see this right here so we're going to let's go and maybe create these chevrons first and then we can showcase just how necessary the flex is jesse right right right right okay so the chevron um this time we got them from um font awesome we got them from font awesome so awesome okay and then we're going to say chef ron to the left and then inside of this div i'm going to put in that font awesome see chef ron which is like this guys and as you can see it has a class of f a hyphen x s on the right side so i'm making sure that the hyphen is really small there you go beautiful beautiful okay so now if we see it now if i say we have a div that's just there no no no no i removed it i removed it so i'm gonna remove it right now so hold on save it there we go now we have a chevron on the left inside let's go and create a chevron on the right hand side now yeah and we have to i think we have to add on the card items detail like we did with products we have to add a flex girl to that why is that jesse because um oh yeah right i should have done okay i'm not doing this in the right order i'm sorry let's continue yeah just keep doing that okay so yeah yeah so uh let's go with the right with the right chevron okay um the right chef ron the right chef ron okay so that jeffron is behind the h4 of course so here chef front to the right boom why is it not strange and then inside of this saffron of course we're also going to have that chef from class but instead of left guess what it is right okay like that there we go nice nice looking really good looking really good awesome a a right okay let's style that up let's style everything up okay so that said um the cursor the chevrons they're not really they're not really doing anything about they're just chef runs now okay so let's give it a cursor pointer and let's also make it gray so text gray 400 oh hyphen 400 okay and we're gonna give it a little bit of a background yeah okay that's right so this is the box around the chef front guys because look at your line this is a diff class surrounding the chef ron right okay so pay attention to that that's why your indentation here is so important okay so background gray and oh let's round it a little bit say rounded okay how does it look now let's see let's see nothing so far i think you change the color do you guys oh no we do see i just i don't see on my cam on my on my screen but yeah it's there it's there it's kind of oh okay cool yeah okay we just need to give it a width bigger maybe give it a height of six and a width of six okay nice that will change things i think let me see i'm not seeing it on your browser yeah i see it though i see it yeah oh yeah boom there we go and look to center the the chevron inside of that little gray box of course flex justify center you guys know the drill items center nice all righty that is nice okay uh yes there you go plus no i think this is it for now plus or do you want to add the hopper already on it no it's all good just continue going with the other chevron okay okay so actually guys surprise surprise the right chef ron is gonna be the same of course of course okay so actually you can just copy paste this one and then copy it over the right chevron right class and then change this to right that looks good that looks good whoa i'm not seeing it in your browser yet is it changing oh there we go right there so now guys we have two buttons we have one button right here another button right here and only thing to do we need to add the hover state so when i hover over something right it changes color so maybe it signifies the fact that you can actually click on it all right so let's do it right now so add hover which is an action okay hover and then bg hyphen gray hyphen 200 nice okay so let's go and try that if i hover over this oh right let's see and the coolest thing about tail and css is you can actually create this inside the class right away right and normally what you would do is you go to css you would do like the actual tag then the hover you change the class and so forth but with here by the way i can say hey here's my hover and then here's the class i want to change it to so simple and i love that that's probably the biggest i love about 101 css you know not so sure about the whole thing in line html stuff but this very useful right right and also i want to add something very small to it to the left chef ron i think this is a little bit too close to the x1 and the right chevron is also a little bit close to the x1 as well so with the first chefron the left one i'm going to give it a margin right very subtle a margin right of two and with the right chef front i'm going to give it a margin left of two just to give some spacing right there see just to give some space so if i save this now there we go now it looks a little more spaced out i want you guys to remember this is very important guys spacing encoding is extremely important so whatever you guys are doing right make sure you space it out okay right so always look at how much white space you have there's actually a counter for how much white space you need to have so make sure that you are seeing that this is why you can't have things too close to each other this is why you need to create padding and spacing inside here and here if it's too clumped up together it's not a good website and it's not a good application then nobody will want to use that there's a reason for example a lot of these new applications or applications you see they're more open they're more open style just like it's kind of like even when you buy a house nowadays people are going for more open style houses same situation coding badly enough so that said let's go first over to cost yeah go ahead go ahead okay so cos guys very simple we're also going to give that just like the counter we're also going to give that a width of 48 okay and it's not so hard it's just a fun bold attacks gray okay of 400 and that's it and how much was the what's the apple book macbook i think 1099 or something like this 140 yeah yeah so i think so yeah it's nothing like this that's good yeah awesome there we go nice look at that is it visible yeah it's literally right there okay we're gonna do the spacing and all that later guys okay so what first pay attention is we're first gonna fill in the details okay then next up we're gonna be using that cross right very easy just a fun awesome class again it's called times boom it's called times when you look at fallout awesome you you search for times and then you find it right there times excuse the cross click on that cross and then you can go ahead and just simply copy this html and then this is what jesse will paste since right here but of course you have to make sure guys you have to make sure that you have uh the actual style you see this font awesome style you have to make sure that you have that so if you don't have that you can actually get that by going to font awesome if you're in zoom i'm gonna paste it in here just in case you don't have it but that's the only need to have in order for this to work so guys you also just like you have to paste that into your index.html you also have to paste it into the card.html file okay so make sure you have that that font awesome link the one that nas now has put into the chat okay so that said also this one this this column we're going to give it a width of 10. okay we're going to give it a width of 10. nice and wait excuse me fun bold okay text gray of 200 that's it so if i go ahead and save this right now oh cancel save save let's say oh look at that right so it's it's like right there it's like very light right here one thing i want to change this so maybe maybe like maybe make it like a 300 so it's a little more visible yeah a little bit better yeah and okay yeah and what i would do for this one is i will make a cursor pointer so i'm going to say cursor cursor dash pointer ah yeah so that feels like it's an actual button okay so by now if i click on this you see it feels like a button and what you can actually do is is on the hover of this button you can do bg or you can do what is it text color as a text um bold or text gray gray and instead of 300 let's do 400 maybe this time right so 400 that way if i hover over this it seems like a button see boom see now changes to a button right it makes me want to click yeah okay it becomes darker that's right yeah same thing same thing we're going to do with this portion right here as well so if i'm going to go back to my chevron right the one class i'm going to add to here is going to be okay cursor dash pointer right and then also this the other side i've already added that dodge uh no i don't oh it did never mind okay yeah you did okay yeah yeah oh it's you know why because because it was curse or space point that's why it doesn't work that's why it was cursor space pointer so it didn't work okay there we go yeah that's right yeah yeah yeah so should this cursor dash pointer just like right here you see that way when i save this see now it's a button this is a button this is a button as a button only enough left to do is for us to actually uh make sure that give it to give it some spacing so just how do we make sure that this is all in line because what i like to do is i like to make sure that this is in line and then this is in line together with the actual cost and together with the actual counter right so how do we do that right right so what happened so i didn't go into this before because i want you guys just first focus on the details but look if we go back to the we go to the top you know start at the start i always say okay so we have the main section and then we have the product count total cost which was you know this is the three columns we're working with basically right so the first one is a flex crow the second one it has a width of 48 the count one the total cost also has a width of 48 then i'm gonna add another one to it i added this span it's like a placeholder almost yeah and i'm this pen i'm gonna i'm gonna leave it empty okay i'm not gonna put anything inside of it but i'm gonna give it a class and i'm gonna give it a width of 10 interesting interesting so you're not seeing it right now but if i say here if i say hello you can see me saying hello in the browser boom there it is so there it is so let's remove the hello okay and as you can see guys so we got the flex grow 4848 w10 okay that means on the product on the product so where was it um on the product we also had a flex pro i think right that's right we do right now that's it right that's right we did so what we are going to do on the product in that case on the card items detail right here the card items detail we're going to put a flex grow right because you want this to go as much as possible right so this div is going to grow as much as possible going to push everything while this is going to stay static and so is the rest of it is going to stay static okay and when i say static i mean it's fixed okay it doesn't change that's what means when i say static yeah so yeah look i made it purple so you guys can see it so if you guys if you can scratch the screen right now nas let me see right there see searches as much as it possibly can hey nice that's beautiful that is beautiful nice job so that's how you can see guys how the flex grow works and guess what now that we have card items with the flex grow we had the card items counter with a width of 48 right there and the card's total cost also with a 48 so those columns are not moving because they got a fixed width yeah and guess what card item delete the little cross has a width of 10 right which is exactly the same as how we made the first row here that i'm highlighting here that's right so that's the right that's the reason that's the reason how you right so that is the reason guys why if you for example make this right if you make this the same width right and then you go ahead and make this the same way so basically it's going to be like this right this is one width this is another width and then there's a placeholder that you don't really see that's nothing right it's really nothing and then the other columns are going to follow the same structure this is going to be a certain the same width there's going to be a certain width and so this is going to be a certain width right but this placeholder is kind of where she put it sure just to put hello right it's because it's a placeholder it allows us to have that axe in the same position and then this portion right here is just going to stretch as much as it wants if once you scroll this way go this way it wants to go become smaller become smaller right that's how we make sure that it's all kind of the same and follow the same pattern and honestly guys that's pretty much it that's pretty much it and then the last thing when you we only think we have left for this is we want to go ahead and just add a bottom border which this border right here let me go ahead and remove this for sure for sure right there so that guys go at the start it is of course at the cart item class because you want to have a border bottom after each card item so here at line 110 okay i'm gonna say border oops inside of the quotes please border hyphen b which means border bottom okay and then in tailwind that's very easy about tailwind automatically this is a border bottom of one pixel solid look at that boom right there done see whoa right there yeah but now it's kind of black i mean you cannot see on the screen but now it's actually black so to change the color you're going to say border gray um 100 which is very light like super subtle okay so a lot of times when you actually go and do a lot of design and coding you're gonna play around with you know very light grays a lot of nowadays you know gray is becoming a very um popular like color to use and so because it's just simple for example your macbook pro is gray right my trackpad here is gray right there's a reason why it's becoming such a popular you know um color and so a lot of nowadays websites are actually just playing with a lot of grays they're playing with a lot of different light grays darker gray as you see this is a darker gray darker gray more darker gray light gray darker gray you know because it just it just re makes things read uh very easily okay for the eyes because it stands out enough against white but it's not too hard for the eyes and at the same time it has a friendly minimal clean appearance you know like david says that's right so cool cool we got one card item so we got one card item should we add another one just just for the sake of it let's go ahead and another one well what do you want to buy you wanted to buy the nintendo switch yeah i want to buy nintendo switch i want to buy that i mean because everybody everybody keeps telling me i need to buy to the special i guess i probably should buy them to switch well but if you buy a nintendo switch you gotta have friends though that also have the nintendo switch because then you can all play together yeah unfortunately unfortunately i don't have friends so unfortunately i'm just really lonely and still sometimes you know so probably might not be the best decision for me but i do have my computer every day with this guy guys every day [Laughter] okay uh that said okay let's add the nintendo switch okay let's do it i'm just gonna i'm very minimal minimal yeah i would say lazy person nah i don't know so be efficient so i'm just gonna yes i'm just gonna copy this one boom and boom see you should just paste it right here but now i i bought two macbooks that's gross that's a lot of macbooks all right okay let's go see is it there oh it's there it's there it's there okay so let's go there let's change the two let's change that up go ahead jesse okay so i got here i got i got the link for the source guys i'm gonna put it in the chat okay i'm gonna put a chat for you guys it has it is the source the source thing only okay so did you already paste it in nas i didn't do it there we go oh let's see i'm i didn't do oh yeah wait i got double double quotes here okay all righty let's go there we go okay so i got the nintendo switch um i got the nintendo switch image there okay and then very simple guys just change up the title okay card item detail the first look at it okay 100 so card item details is the div inside of this this remember we have the title and we have the brand okay so nintendo switch okay and here nintendo of course and we're gonna buy it one time so i'm not gonna change anything about that and it was about i guess about 290 dollars or something yeah that's cheap like this no it's not it's not that expensive for how much fun you can have and honestly that's pretty much it that's it yeah so look guys so clean we've gotten here this is honestly like you the only question to ask yourself do you understand what's going on here in this shopping cart like raise your hand if you understand what's going on here in the shopping cart do you understand how many products you have do you understand yeah very much right do you understand what products you have there we go there we go beautiful see it's it's it's a very clean design and now somebody said ford products it's that's right that's right there's four products in there so now we've got that okay there's only one last thing we need to do and it's honestly we're not fully done for the day once we finish it because there's one last thing i want you guys to do together um but it's going to be this so if i go to my shopping cart here and i go to this total cost you see this we need to go ahead and incorporate this total cost so let's do that right now we have our card item i'm going to minimize that just uh so that it's a lot easier we have a card right here okay and then underneath the card items all i'm going to do is just put another div and that's div is going to be the card item total that's it guys card item total so let's do this i'm going to say dave right here div class is equal to right is equal to what cart item toll toll or or maybe we call it better maybe it's like um complete order or something complete order maybe i think it's better for complete orders so let's do this right now complete order lead dash order right that's going to be our dip and that div contains two things the first thing contains it contains a total cost so we'll do this we'll do a div class is equal to what total dash cost all right because remember what's going on here is if i made this a little bit smaller it's a little smaller it's a little bit bigger there we go right what are we doing right now so we're creating this portion this portion right now there's a total cost section right you're still with me the total and then what what is the second section we have it is going to be the complete order section complete order button section and that's it so i'm going to say the total oh yeah so first um the first div is going to be on the left part like total cost and then the number and then the second part is going to be the button correct that's right jesse that's right okay so let's focus on the total cost total cost has a few things what does it have well it has first the actual text called total cost i'm gonna say h2 so we're working on this one right now h2 right and that's going to be h2 and that's gonna be total cost right the next thing it has it is going to be another div and that date is going to be the total cost numbers let's say class is equal to total cost dash number boom right there okay and that number is right now let's just say for example it's gonna be a thousand one thousand oh jesse just got it 1780.00 right i didn't count it i'm not a math genius actually no i am pretty good at math but i just didn't kind of hear okay i love math it's my favorite subject okay so there you go and then the last thing is just going to be the complete order button and the only text that we need to put in here is just simply complete oh there's canvas interesting all right it's just simply complete right there complete order all right that's it let's save that and what do we have so far let's go take a look at it that's it so nothing crazy we have one div right here another div right here so how do we go ahead and and make that from left to right right now sorry not i'm changing i'm changing the total because that ain't right i was looking at it i was like no that's not right that's not correct jesse is like no okay the number just has to be right no no i'm not going to allow him mathematics which one is you so total cost is this and complete order okay all right so what we want to do now is we're going to use what class in order to make sure that they go from left to right you know that class already right it is going to be flex so i'm going to say flex here and boom now the total cost is here complete order is here i'm going to give it a bg yellow just you know 300 for now so you guys can see what's going on this is the actual you know whole div all right now i want to make sure that they actually go to the end of the div like they're at the end of the dev and again that's going to happen how well yes that's right the end of the world okay if you go to flexbox documentation guys okay and you look up right justify content what can you say flex and you see that right there yeah that's right so the only thing i have to do is so that means it will go that means it will go to the end of this parent div but like on the horizontal axis look at that justify and justify end pushed everything towards the end of the actual this dip you see just like that right and then now all we have to do is just work on the individual uh you know total cost uh dips all right so let's do that right now one thing i want to do is i want to give a little margin so i'm going to do margin top 10 to space it up from the actual product all right so now it's spaced out next up total cost hey let's go ahead and give it a margin right on my other seven just space it out from the complete order okay that's spaced out uh next up let's do a total cost let's give it a class of let's change the color that's going to be text text gray dash let's get a color of 400. 400. nice now it's different total color next up let's give the color for the 1499 not 1780 which i think is right and then i'm kidding i'm kidding jesse no that's not right all right let's make it a little bit larger so now it's a lot a lot larger okay which i like and then let's make it a font bold right let's give it a font brush bold nice okay oh right there let's save that so now it's a bold font all right let's give it a bang that's right let's give it a text gray 600 guys okay yeah otherwise it's a little bit too much in your face i know it's like boom scaring you you know well otherwise you know probably 430 now okay never mind i'm not going to buy it anymore then probably you know amazon amazon will probably be bankrupt at that point that's why guys gray gray color okay imagine if your amazon card if basically if imagine this this would be funny imagine if your number your total number of what you're buying changes color depending how much it is so look if it's like over 1 000 it's like red screaming red they'll probably be broke at some point no they wouldn't want that yeah i don't think like look at that hold on let me let me say let me show you guys oh my god that is scary the heck no no thank you oh i know it no that's no good yeah okay thank you there we go okay let's remove this background yo because it looks hideous and i don't like it at all okay there we go much better now bro almost there guys almost there okay let's go ahead and go to complete order for the complete order we're going to make it a button remember to make a new button we need to create a a div around it which we do have already at this point right div around it and then we can center this text to set that dip all right the div that we have right now is complete order button we're going to give it number one a width of 56 okay go ahead jesse yeah width of 656 right we're going we're going to give it a a flex so because we want to go ahead and center the actual text inside of it so let's give it a flex we're going to do item center to center it vertically and then we're going to do justify center center horizontally right there see so if i go ahead and do that choo choo right and now let's go ahead and do a background color to make it a background color we just do uh bg yellow 500 okay that's going gonna make it look like a text oh dang why are you typing jesse i don't know yeah bg yellow pg yellow 500 that's right right there see okay let's make sure we have justify center right so justify center right there oh yeah okay and i'm gonna give it rounded edges because i find it's a little bit too harsh i like it boom plus text should be white i think so i'm going to say text white okay that's right text white and there's one more thing we need to do and that's this we've got the car the button right there it looks really good i love it it's a big buzz in a complete order all you want to do is just spend money on our site okay please spend money we need to make money right so the button is humongous okay right but i know i know right let's actually make it feel like it's a button so we're going to use cursor pointer cursor pointer to make it feel like it's a button that way when i hover over it we have the hand print i like to go like this in front of the camera right that's the hand print and then after that let's make sure that when you hover over it actually changes color so all we have to do is simply do bg dash uh b uh hover colon and just change the background color so in our case all this is bg yellow instead of bglo 500 i'm going to say bg yellow 600 save that and now when i hover boom right there you see now it just changes color and this makes you feel like you want to click it right and there's a reason why it's also orange i don't know if you know but orange because orange i think orange color shows like trust it shows no blue shows trust anybody know what orange color does blue show stress yeah anyone know what orange color does uh adventure or something more like energy energy yeah yeah yeah yeah so energy so they want you to have energy around orange there you go and guys at this point we have the card done that's it it's complete look at that look you guys need to be part of yourself one thing you forgot is there's a no bg hover on this one let me see oh let me see i like to make sure it's all good there i know okay i'm gonna go back to my uh bg okay hover text gray copy that and put the hover on the other one too save that boom boom boom boom oh oh that looks so good i'm loving where we're going with this guys give yourself a lot of applause for where you've gone guys i've gotten let's go let's go hey we did it there we go so i'm lucky where this is going already at this point guys the card is done that's the only thing honestly we were planning on doing for today but i do have a few ideas on what we can work on so that we're ahead for tomorrow okay because tomorrow's gonna be pretty hard tomorrow is just gonna be all javascript we're gonna use firebase we're going to use uh you know a bunch of all these other technologies so the first thing we can do is we can actually work on this little icon right here right you see this icon right here let me show it to you so maybe just let's work on that icon right now okay this icon right right so guys open up your index.html file okay and we're gonna go back to the start because as you can see where is that card located in the header correct so as you can see here we have we have it on line 25 no not categories wait wait wait logo logo aha right icons not put this really nice comment here that's why guys comments are important okay we got the icons this is the heart icon boom the card icon so we want to have like a as you can see we want to have like the small one in a sort of like a small cloud small bubble on top of the cart saying that we have one item inside of our cart that's right okay so in order to play something on top of something you got to work with positioning yeah in css and it's actually very interesting it's actually very interesting because if you want to think about it here's kind of how it is right remember everything inside html is like once with each other right so if i look at it right now right i'm going to show it to you guys right if i look at it right now if i want to take this specific you know oh shoot if i want to take this iphone let's just say right and i want to put it next to each other right i can only put it next to it i don't i can't just put on top or you know on the bottom you know inside html it's just impossible i have to like put it put it next to each other above below above below in the bottom but in order to actually put it on the top so that it's kind of like this right right it's kind of like this you see right here instead of set to the side we need to use absolute positioning so what can happen to this your canvas right here becomes your position relative it is what you're going to be positioning to so in our case what's our position relative right what's our what are we relating to it's going to be what well it's going to be towards that orange little box which is which one which is right here it's this little orange box that's your position relative that's your space that you're going to be positioning to right now what's going to happen is we're going to take that box this is our box right here right you guys see it yes or no you guys see it all right yeah and then we're gonna make this right here this iphone a position absolute when you make this absolute you can pretty much place it anywhere you want that's the crazy part right so if i say position absolute that means i can place it on top now or even on the bottom if i wanted to right if i say push absolute and i say hey you know push absolute from top zero pixels right and right here i think not sure this is from the left or the right hand side from the right zero pixels i'm going to place it in the right corner right i think you're seeing it from the right or from the left i'm not sure but if it's i'm saying here from the top i want zero pixels and from the left or from the right i want zero pixels as well okay and so what's gonna happen i'm gonna paste it in that little little corner right there and honestly that's it guys right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do the same thing the same thing with uh the same thing with that div let's take a look at it so jesse let's see how does that work out so you want to on like you said the parent div is that orange box so let's find that orange box it's here on line 41. that one so let's give that a yeah let's give that a relative positioning okay and until when css all you got to do is say relative well like that okay then um we need to of course make that number well to make that dumber we're going to create another div class so we're going to say diff class okay and let's say card number because those are the numbers of cards no actually card item because those are the number of items we have okay and this one because the parent is relative we want the child to have an absolute positioning okay but you gotta tell what this absolute positioning will be right guess what in relationship to the parent all right so we're going to give it we want it in the top and we want it at the right okay so what you do what you do is you're going to mention something with top and then also something with right okay but how much that is that is something you got to figure out sometimes it's a little bit like trial and error okay so you could do um positive i mean i believe with positioning absolute you can either use positive notion but sometimes you're also using a negative one right now well let's let's show them how the positive let's just let's just say top zero and right zero let's just see what that will look like right right that's for yeah right that's yeah that's a good idea so let's first show what happens when you do top zero right zero okay so i've done that but now we're not seeing anything because i need to give it some height and width okay that's right so i'm going to give it height the width of four i'm going to give it a background of white and rounded but rounded like full because we want it to make like a circle and of course what is inside of it is we're gonna you want to center that so we're gonna give it the flex justify center and item center plus of course there needs to be something inside of that so here we're going to say one okay and so now if we save that boom right there look see now we have a circle in the right corner because why we said hey you know what we need to go ahead and make sure that a one it's uh what height of four width of four but the cool thing is that we're saying hey from top zero and from the right zero so from the top there's zero pixels you see now it's on the top and i will be set it's smack on the top and from the right it's zero pixels as well so it's pushing to the right hand side right so always remember top right if you want to make something on the left corner what would you use guys what would you use if i don't put it on the left corner what would you use tell me let me put in the chat i'm very curious what would you use if you want to put it in the left corner that's right top zero zero zero that's right correct exactly but what you can also see guys is that even though we have a value of zero here it is not going outside of the parent mmhmm it's not going outside of the parent it's not overlapping the parent so that's when the negative values come into place okay so by the way to make the to make the one visible let's give it a color also by the way so i'm going to say text gray 800 okay and i'm also going to make the text very small so text hyphen xs okay and right guys let's go into it now okay we got the absolute positioning here looking good excuse me looking good so far awesome we got the top zero position here and the right zero but as you can see it still stays within that orange box so let's move it a little bit up we're going to give it a minus a negative value and how do you do that in cs until wind you're going to say minus top okay minus top hyphen zero a one okay to move it a little bit to the top so this is like a negative pool it's being pulled towards the browser i mean the top the website okay and minus right well minus and then hyphen one yeah boom so right there so if i save this oh look at that so what's going on when you give it a negative value basically for example if i if i go back to my right my ipad which is like right here if i given a negative value if i have in the corner right here guys you guys can see it it's like hey yeah not top zero but top minus two pixels minus one it's actually bringing up up it's like going the opposite way that's the weird part about it same thing if you say right minus two or minus one let's just say right is you push it from outside right because if you say hey top two pixels it's gonna push it to the bottom from the top that's what's gonna happen right from the bottom to the top but if you say minus two it's like you're going the opposite way so that's the weird part you have to understand right right that's like yeah that's right it's like a mirror that's right right so it's really really cool the way it kind of works but it's really helpful and very useful because that allows us to create things like these right and honestly at that point that's it we've created a little card icon it looks so good and so clean guys the design you build here is looking beautiful right we have our card page right we have our so if we go to cart page to go the cart page oh here's what one less we can do is we can actually give it a link so one last thing we can do is if i go and expand my code here right our whole cart icon is right here see right right there so if i'm gonna go with it like this the two cart icon i'm actually going to give it a link right here right so i'm gonna say a shreef is equal to what card.html i'm going to close it up and i'll copy this closing link tag and i'm going to put it around the whole card icon like this you see just like that right there and honestly that's pretty much it so now if i save this i go back to here i can click on this specific car link click on it it takes you the card html and that's it then we can go back to back to the home page how good does that look i'm pretty proud of you guys you guys did an amazing job yeah so yeah guys that's it from us on the html side all right you guys did an amazing job you guys enjoyed it you guys have fun you guys still with us let me know in the chat i'm curious i'm curious if you will not guys let me know yeah yeah let's go let's go let's go that's what i'm talking about all right so for your homework or actually for your homework that you need to work on before you go the homework though i want you to do one last thing okay and this has nothing to do with html or javascript okay right but what i want you to do is i want you guys to prepare for tomorrow and what a way well what's gonna happen is for tomorrow we're gonna be working with firebase and so i want you guys to create the firebase account okay and so how do we do that i want to show you that right now you've got the product there all is good let's go and open up a new tab i'm going to say firebase okay and everybody do that right now every single person you're on youtube you're on here you guys can do that okay open up firebase and open up just like this okay if you are not logged in you can simply just log in right there should be like a sign in button somewhere right there signing a button or a sign up button doesn't matter right so you should make sure it's right there okay all right all right then i started the project nice nice job nice job right so then go to console if you have signed in or if you've signed up go to console nice then what i want you to do actually i'm going to change my account to a different account here okay and so you can see i have a few projects that i've started beforehand so let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and create add project let's say amazon you know clone maybe two who knows that's the one you want to build so amazon clone 2. you guys still with me yeah give me a thumbs up give me a thumbs up everybody thumbs up thank you maria everybody all right so click continue you don't need this specifically i mean you can have it on it's fine it's not the biggest deal right then click continue from there all right select the account you can say default account for firebase that's fine and all you would do at this point is just create project wait for it to wait for it to load wait for it to load let's leave for it to road okay wait forever to load up there we go nice nice nice good good good good beautiful that's all good now that's done click continue all right and now we're inside our project okay and then one last thing i want you guys to do is go to your firestore database right here so you see it says firestar database actually no don't do it right now go to settings right here settings all right go to there guys okay or maybe you save this maybe you make sure when you're watched make sure you do this go to settings project settings okay and then what you want to do is go to your click click scroll down from there so you're on here now scroll down and this is your app so this is what you're going to do to actually configure your application and actually put it in to your application so configure your app right here all right click on it click on this app so click on this web portion not this not this but this one right here all right click on it also give it a nickname so amazon clone 2 all right register app and that's it at this point that my friends is it okay you don't need anything else so then what you do later on is i want you to kind of copy this so copy this right here make sure it's copied and then you will later on save that in your script right so what i want you to do is let's go back to our project let's do new file that's called firebase.js all right firebase.js make sure that's there is a javascript file you're going to copy this var configuration together with everything here so i'm going i'm not going to copy this script instead of going to copy just this firebase config all right if you're trying to mess with my fibers config don't worry i'm going to change this right after because i've had people who will mess with this and i have gone and did some weird stuff okay so don't mess with my config i'm going to change it okay that's like a warning so right there copy the fibers config right okay paste it inside here this is what you got and save that right and then what you want to do is okay then what you want to do is copy these script tags see the script tags copy them these script tags right here copy command c go to your index.html and then paste them underneath your js you know the gd icon and then right right before the head tag is ending so let's remove this copy paste the scripts i don't need this right there right make sure that's done so now we have the firebase app configuration and then now we have the firebase analytics as well which i'm not really necessary but we're just gonna have it there it's fine save that and my friends that's pretty much it next time tomorrow we're actually going to include a database create our own database and then include a database and actually get items from a database so if you want to have a head start on the database here's my recommendation okay let's go ahead and continue to console right this is your configuration if you want to have a head start go to firestore database right here okay click on gray database put into start test in test mode do that click on next okay click on enable alright that's it click enable alright good good good good good good good let it load let it load again this is so you guys have a head start for tomorrow so you're all good okay because tomorrow we're gonna be using a lot of this stuff firebase javascript and actually implementing putting this all together because the last day of the project and we're going to be finishing this up provisioning the cloud firestore right now give it one second one second one second one second one second one second one second one second but yeah the reason we're using firestore guys by the way just to let you guys know is because it will allow will allow you number one to connect to database really fast uh david it's gonna be test mode okay test mode david right it's gonna be really fast and it's going to allow you to live reload so basically as soon as i add to card you know as soon as i add the card it's gonna be really simple add to cart and then right away i'll actually see the changes that's so fast that's the that's the really cool part about uh firebase right so it has created our application right here that's all good all we do now at this point is click on start collection and that's called items right this is going to be your actual products right right it's going it's a database now you have a database for items okay click on items and click next this is gonna be your first document id so click auto id for this one you don't need this this is a unique id for individual product our first field is going to be image right that's the data we're going to save that's going to the link to the image so let's go back to our amazon 2.0 where is it let's copy the link to our image let's say it's a macbook pro copy image address right and then paste it in here beautiful now it's in there click plus and the second name is going to be second feels gonna be name also right apple macbook pro 13inch copy that go back boom paste it okay see and they're all strings last one next one is going to be what the make so it's going to be make and that's going to be apple right okay good then click another add field and all you do at this point is what the rating see says 4.8 so let's do rating instead of being a string we're going to give it a number so i'm going to say 4.8 number okay and the last was going to be price right here also not a string but also just a number put it in there go to here and then say 1149 so 1 1 four nine and you cannot add any commas because it's a number not a string guys click save and there you go now you have your items collection it's an items database and your first document is in there so my condition for you for homework is go ahead and add as many documents as you possibly can inside here whatever documents you want to sell maybe you have your own documents add them all inside here understand do you understand me yes or no yes you know seven yes or no good yes good so that's gonna be your homework so now at this point guys now we are fully done this is going to be this is your day three oh the javascript challenge we did the card page it looks pretty amazing let me go back to it hey look at that right there we worked on our little icons what jesse your sound is a little bit yeah okay so we're working on our little icon we worked on our cart page it's looking beautiful the only thing is left now is javascript and firebase right somebody said what was after price after price there was nothing maria it was just only price was the last one image make image name make model no uh image name make um price and then the rating make sure there's a rating is in there too rating that's right and that's it so let's go let's go over your homework guys what i want you guys to do all right so for your homework of course this is not your homework right this is not your homework we're going to customize our cart page customize our cart page all right okay so basically change the colors slash fonts of the card page very important right the other thing i'm going to to have you do is add as many products possible for yourself to firebase you've seen how to create a firebase now so you make sure you have to you have to make have a firebase there all right and finally the last thing that's going to happen is uh make sure to how about this create a add to cart button i know i know i know what can i add to cart button if we go to amazon you see this one this at the cart button this time you're going to create it by yourself without our help at all boom boom creators at the car button together okay so i should add a functionality no that the car should not have any functionality just create the html in the css for it and that's it guys you don't have to worry about anything besides that okay do that and then the last thing is take a screenshot of of the amazon off the cart page of the card page right here and now post account the facebook post and then submit your homework as an airport data table and honestly that is it guys that's it that's all you have to do do we have any questions on youtube facebook any preguntas that we have any preguntas so guys
