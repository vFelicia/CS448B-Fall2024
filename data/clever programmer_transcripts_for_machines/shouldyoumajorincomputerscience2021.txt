a computer science degree now i'm here with my friend logan right here here right here my head my friend logan so logan go ahead and introduce yourself how are you doing i'm doing great nas thanks for giving me the invite here um i'm part of the profitable shortcut program over with clever programmer and i've been doing so since june i've learned a lot i get to work with people like kazi i get to work with people like sunny and nas and with michael if you know him and daniel as well he's been on a couple of our streams so all of it's really cool um in my daytoday what i do is i work at a cultural organization and i kind of fit within the realm of i.t and data science so a lot of that is looking at our programmatic work making sure that the data aligns and we're moving in the right direction towards the outcomes you want to achieve so with that i'll pass back to you awesome logan sweet so today's topic is very quick very simple guys right is a computer science right for you that is the question drop that in the comments guys if you have a computer science degree or if you're planning on giving your getting computer science degree also drop in the comments if you do not want a computer science degree okay if you just want to be selftaught right it is your choice so wait hold on so that is what we're going to talk about today let's go ahead and really quickly and honestly really quickly get into it you guys hope you guys are pumped it's going to be a good one now very important before we go before we go very important we have a link down description for those of you who do want to be selftaught developers for those of you who are looking to become developers who want to become a react developers like me or login right here we have a link in the description for a web for a webinar on how to become a react js developer okay so go ahead link in description go check it out and we'll continue on with that all right logan let's go ahead and get into it so this computer's like science degree right for you logan do you have a computer science degree i do i actually i graduated in april of 2020 so no convocation but i do have a computer science degree okay cool and i actually have a precise degree too but what i realized actually after time that i did not need my computer science degree pretty much at all because all of my jobs were from different things guys hi nas what is up roshan what is up ali what is up guys so good to see you all john samarth wolf wolf wolfgang says car looks what carlos says i do rashaan viction nikhil how are you doing guys so good to see you all all right let's get this going let's get this party started hey hopefully you guys can hear the sound effect so logan sorry you can't hear that but i can't all right so really quickly this computer says red degree for you yes or no i don't know maybe so um with that said well yes but actually no so what is computer science logan go ahead and give us the rundown here yeah for sure guys so if you if you google what is computer science you look for your dictionary the lines of like the study of you know computation um algorithms uh essentially like how computer architecture works and you know from basically the point at which you interact with the computer all the way through the circuiting in your computer and all the way back out to the monitor so it's kind of a holistic view of programming coding in general but also a theoretical approach too so we're going to be looking at or as a computer scientist sorry we'll look at stuff like mathematics and kind of like how can they best produce algorithms and such um making sure that they use most efficient or they do the best with the least amount of resources on there gotcha gotcha gotcha okay sweet sweet sweet oh let's get in let's get together so what can you do with cs guys that is the question okay obviously one thing here is one thing that i would like to say for me computer science is honestly for me computer science is like the way i see it is it it's like for me it's like being an inventor inventor i am not even kidding for me it's like being an inventor right you have this this you have this power in your mind to just simply basically create anything you want with simply just code like how powerful is that okay that's what i see that's what i see computer science as okay now let's go ahead keep going so right it's just some examples right some examples what can you do computer science logan obviously we can do we can build applications like tesla you can build applications like netflix you can build applications like facebook what other locations can you build uh you can build all kinds of applications so i mean we have a whole spectrum a lot of what we do at clever programmer is going to be web development so actually you'll be doing stuff like websites full stack development previous streams that we've been having and even this react challenge we're doing full stack applications with stripe integration we're building effectively an ecommerce site but i mean it's not limited to this we could do mobile development we could do desktop application development we can do video games um it really the the ends of which your imagination can go to there's no limit at a limit gotcha gotcha yeah something we have uh says um i will study software engineering next four years at 39. that's amazing wow i love that um wow at 39 that's awesome that's awesome so uh yeah like so many opportunities out here guys everything around at this point is i mean is electronic it is digital you know as as we are talking to you through this camera and you guys can see us right on youtube all of this computer science all of that is through software development and i'm sure you guys already know because you guys are on here and this is why you're watching am i right like why are you watching this otherwise like literally like why are you watching this let me know in the comments below i'm actually pretty curious so so that is the very interesting part of course right so so with that said with that said really quickly let's keep going um all right top pane titles for cs background here's some topping uh you know uh titles we got net developer number 10 around 94 000 per year that is just simply insane we also have uh it what is an iet auditor uh i'm not sure exactly but if i had to guess an it auditor would be someone who you know is obviously working with the it space and one probably is taking accounts of kind of like what is necessary what is needed as far as infrastructure with uh with organizations uh that would be my guess gotcha these are all these are all stolen from indeed guys so if you go to that uh link up in the top you'll be able to find the exact article that i posted yeah yeah somebody's like data scientists love ali says yeah this size is pretty cool i like that too trust me all right i t auditor wait hold on let me yeah this is this is it right here next time we got front end developer guys which is all front developer i know you guys are in for that a lot that's where you guys will join the react.js challenge but really if you have not joined the react.js webinar link in description below but from developer of course we have national average salary for that front developer is gonna be a hundred and two thousand dollars which is just whoa that's insane that's pretty dang good um honestly um so front developers include things like right if you're a react developer if you are an angular developer so right that's for for example like right react right if you're like angular right anything that has to do with right with what development that's going to be a front web developer credit login yes yes correct yeah cool all right then you got a java developer right then get around 103 000 and then you got yourself a software engineer so what is a soft engineer what is the big difference between there a software engineer is kind of a very broad look at basically it's all it's almost like you have to be the person that goes out finds the client listens to them about what they want gets an idea of their needs kind of goes back with your project manager comes up with the idea about what product is going to make sense and work for them create a budget a project timeline let's create the creator project you're the software engineer and then kind of make sure it goes back to the client so the software engineer is really about like creating applications that are you know for commercial use got it so okay complicate applications for commercial use but it's also very general a general name in general as well right so with job engineering like when you search up on google you're searching for a software general engineer and that can pretty much lead you to anywhere that you want to go solve the front end development back in development right and so forth then you got yourself a network security engineer right here at around 115 000 then you have yourself a mobile developer 150 000 average salary that is insane guys okay then you got yourself a data scientist 121 thousand dollar salary wow data scientist honestly one wow and that's probably going to go up as well you know that you got a dev ops engineer what is the devil switching can you explain that really quickly yeah for sure so guys if you've never heard devops before um that's okay if you've heard of it and you're familiar with what an it professional does think you're in luck a devops engineer is essentially an i.t person on steroids so if you can think whereas it is going to be helping people who are you know working with microsoft office applications or if an it professionals can be someone who installs windows on your laptop for your coworker a dev ops engineer is someone who's going to take that to the next level they're going to be working directly with developers and what they're going to do is they're going to be doing stuff like setting up virtual machines like ubuntu operating systems on virtual machines on like amazon web services they're going to be setting up teams of developers making sure that they're all ready it's going to be managing all the version control and making sure that that's all functioning correctly but holistically what it's really trying to do is really push towards that philosophy of continuous development and continuous integration that we'll cover later in the slides yeah exactly exactly so for those of you i'm actually really curious guys who here is kind of going towards more like which side are you going more towards right i know a lot of you guys are frontend developers a lot of you guys are going to become react professional developers you guys because you guys joined the react gs challenge and built the amazon clone i know that for sure um but yeah let us let us know in the comments below right here and let us know what field are you more interested in right so that's going to be the interesting part on the other than that let's continue on so we have devops and then and the last one's going to be software architect and what is the software archetype really quickly yeah so if you guys don't know daniel i believe daniel's job is quite relevant to software architecture but the idea behind software architecture is it's kind of like aligning the stacks of technology and making sure that they all make sense so it's um you know it's going to be like oh you want to build an application stack which is like mongodb express um react and sorry what's the last one i can't remember but anyways it's like are we going to do that or we're going to switch up our pern stack which is switching out [ __ ] for postgres so it's kind of like stuff like that but we're doing it large scale we're working with really big applications that could use 40 different pieces of technology and we need to kind of see how they all fit together and we need to work within that space yeah so it's like for the way i see the way i see software architecture and the way i know because i've done software carter is for example you've been able to understand the whole big picture of the a piece of software right so right the way i see it it's like you being it's like um if you have the architect right an architect goes in has the plans for the house right land lays out the plans for the house it's kind of like that so plans it's kind of like creating the plans for the house right kind of kind of like that right you know how you have that drawing right for the plans of the house it's a similar situation in an architecture and when you design software architecture especially when you're going into building huge applications you can design software architecture you're going to look into okay what is my okay where is my front end contained right in that front end how does my front end look like how am i going to how how am i going to actually lay out all the files for my front end for this developers to go ahead and develop on when i did here's an example when i did for when i did soft architecture for an application this was back back then like i was doing it for service.com this was a really cool app that we were building and i literally had to lay out okay how is how are we going to test our app how are we going to you know um how is the application going to be divided up for example i'm going to have this folder i'm going to have the folder for all of my components i'm going to have all the folder for all of my kind of big picture application pages which is for example the home page the about us page right you know the dashboard page and so forth and the the naming convention behind it was very also was very thought out right so it's being able to understand that naming convention how does your application the layout of your application all of that right because that's very important logan that is very important the way i see right it's very important because if your develop application development like the application you're working on is hard to develop on because the files are all over the place there's no proper standards for how things should be it's just going to be a mess it's going to be a mess and that probably only gets worse the larger your application gets so you know like we all love free to creep we all love continually adding only working with but you know if if you don't have a strong architecture those problems are going to get massive and we have a big bubble when it pops it's going to look like a nightmare exactly sweet so let's continue on all right so the first thing that we got the first thing we got is going to be web development guys i know you a lot of you guys are web developers here or want to become a developer let me know in the comments below if that is my correct understanding but in my development obviously you know some of the technology stacks that we're going to use is for example like obviously html a css right let's go back css javascript right in terms of frameworks you know frameworks you're going to use things like react angular vue.js and so forth those are probably the topmost three but the best one as we know is which one it's react boys you know it it is react exactly we're a big fan of this i know sonny's big a big fan of that guys drop us on fire for react and for sunny down in the comments below sweet so now i want to dig deeper in terms of what are some requirements right because we want to introduce you guys like what do companies actually look for what it comes to actually look for when they are searching for right web developers right and the big thing that i would say we've laid out some of these big specific requirements so logan give us some examples what do you think yeah for sure let's walk through the the text on the left hand side so this is going to be for react js developer position and i pulled this off of linkedin from a canadian company up here and so if we just look through the bullet points you're going to see some things you're probably already familiar with so what they're looking for is they're looking for knowledge of javascript css html and they say and foreign languages but you guys know that everything is kind of like javascript css html we just work within frameworks knowledge of react tools you guys are learning that when you're doing your react challenge when you're following our buildings on the youtube channel you're learning react tools you're learning things that are going to be relevant to this position such as react redux and working within um the context api uh going down you're probably going to need some general knowledge of interface design you're going to have to know how to kind of like structure things lay them out use things like um adobe xd working within that creating awesome prototypes and wireframes um you're gonna have to know how to debug things within the browser which means your knowledge of the browser and a little bit of how the internet works should also be up there and the rest is kind of like good communication skills of course and i i want to drop it drop to the last bullet point which is an important one get and knowledge of version control is a critical part of how you get yourself to the next level where people are going to be willing to give you a job inside the inside the space so really guys if if if you're just starting out as a programmer what i want you to do is i want you to really take this to heart every time you work on a project i want you to initialize a git repository and i want you to regularly commit your code updates to your repository every time you enter in like a new module anytime you enter in a new class and you know it works you've tested it do it git commit make sure you save it then what i want you to do make a github account push everything to your github make sure those repositories are public and people can see that so just to recap kind of which i was like oh i'm not on my meter right now so just to recap what you guys need is one number one obviously we talked about right javascript css html right you need to know a little bit of ui ux design right so that comes with experience you need to know obviously javascript css html right there these three components are the core pillars and there's actually something that we teach you know we teach in profit with javascript which by the way we're going to launch um on sunday september 13 at the webinar which go ahead and sign up for the webinar we're going to be launching pwj profit with javascript on that day where we you guys will where you guys will be able to actually learn technologies like react technologies like css html javascript and become web developers if that is what you want to be okay so now with that we know besides obviously reacting ui ux right we talked about a little bit about version control which is obviously the very important part right version control making sure that you can save your code and you know have different versions of your code very important right we also talk about what's another thing that you really need to know uh you need to know rest right so rest is also very important right being able to create like apis as a web developer um another big thing you know really important is what anything else event handling we need to know dom manipulation understand how to change node elements inside the browser dom manipulation right very important as well but right behind the core pillars uh behind all of this right you're probably thinking yourself oh there's so much to learn like what do i do right with that um well honestly learning this stuff guys is actually not that hard this stuff will come through time as you build what as you build projects guys rogers projects boom right there as you build projects guys that is the core the core view talk about so much here you have no idea right so that's how we built amazon clone that's how we introduced amazon clone with this reaction challenge and so forth because all of that gets built all the knowledge you will accumulate over time right so don't when you see this kind of stuff don't think that oh there's so much stuff to learn just think of it as like you know what it's good a little opportunity this can be fun let's get into it alright next up now question is do you need a degree i don't know do you need a hug hey it's a relatable feeling you know you never want to be in that position like you need to go out and do four years of work that's tough yeah uh a beat is like um abit is like i'm learning coding for fun uh space cadets is like i am pumped let's go let's go let's go c4 co says version control is really amazing yes yes yes yes guys so good to see you all in here sweet all right let's continue on hopefully you guys will take a crack at this uh really funny gift um we tried so do you need to agree you don't need a degree the short answer is no oh hold on my compute this computer is like lagging short answer is no you do not need a degree guys okay these days have a degree in computer science is not a requirement as you guys can see to find a job in web development okay there are many ways to teach yourself online right which is you know through pretty much anything through youtube if you you can teach yourself through youtube you can teach yourself the profit of droughts which by the way we are launching september 13th so make sure you join the webinar down below link in description okay all right also for example by so just for that according to last year's study and by stack overflow almost 70 percent 70 right 70 let me just put that on here 70 right of all developers are at least partly selftaught yeah that's something i want to that's something i want to talk about degree we can all share with those who don't that there's no end the amount of selftaught content that you're gonna have to be going for you know it's not as if by the end of a comp sci degree you've learned everything you need to know and you're good for the workforce actually what tends to happen is you really realize how much you don't know and like everyone else you're still stuck googling things constantly um we're always going to be selfteaching ourselves exactly exactly i personally am partially basically 80 for me is you know i'm selftaught as well logan i feel like you're pretty much selftaught too right yeah i mean in the evenings i'll be transparent with you guys i'm learning machine learning on udemy so that's my selftaught i'm extending the education that i got formally and i'm making sure that it goes in the distance it's so crazy rashaan rashan says myuni teaches one class another in fouryear curriculum that is insane wow that is insane so yeah guys right 70 moldova was at least selftaught with 13 of respondents saying they are exclusively selftaught less than half have a degree in computer science or a related field less than half of all developers have a computer science degree which is dang right i think that just says a lot right and specifically now as we kind of go forward check this out guys right so google here right google here says will you so do you want any computer science degree to be a google software engineer no your cs degree does not require so no a cs degree isn't required for our soft engineering or product managing roles right just like i mean that's it right there guys they say it in clear text you do not need a degree to work at google and it's actually really funny because they changed this specifically they changed this not too long ago this whole thing where you know you need computer science degree google facebook right all these companies said ah sayonara baby we don't need your degree i don't know why i just said it like that but you get my point you get my appointment all right let's keep going so google for example here's an ex here's a good example from google software is a frontend developer right you know you can they say here for example you do need a bachelor's degree in computer science or a really technical field or right here let me make sure you guys can see that every equivalent practical experience one year of work experience right so experience counts so much more than for example like a computer science degree they talk about here right and they're looking for experience in javascript and one or more programming languages including but not limited to like cc plus plus python or go right so and i was thinking to do things like html css and so forth right so that is that is the big key here you guys are laughing at my a lot of you guys are like laughing at my uh funny funny funny way i say things um apple go ahead talk us through a little bit through here yeah for sure so this position here uh if you can read from the top is for user interface and front end engineer it's at apple um and so if you look at it here there is no specific mention in the key qualifications to do with education they don't ask for that instead what they're asking for is five plus years of software development experience how do you get exterior experience it can really be anything you know you build projects at home you work with employer really as long as you're working within the space and working on your technical skills uh as we go down it looks like specifically for a couple frameworks angular preferred but could be react could be used so there you go those are the top three frameworks if you know any of those three you're probably going to be able to answer some really relevant interview questions with apple uh yeah and as you go down it looks like there's a little bit of api integration so if you guys are familiar with apis how to set that up in full stack applications you're even more enriched you're going to be even a better applicant for a frontend engineer position with apple yeah so api we talked about api we talked about you know react we talked about you know angular right we talked about right just experience experience in general right all those things are going to get very big for these companies next up netflix for example senior software engineer okay does not require a degree seeing yourself seeing your software engineer does not require a degree like what that is right like you think like that that old wise wizard who sits in the back he's got that old graveyard 60 years old like knows everything you think he has like a master's at least a bachelor's but no actually yeah he doesn't require that yeah yeah yeah so yeah single full stack engineer with five plus years of experience so you that's what they're looking for they're looking for experience right in any specific company let me go ahead and drag me down a little bit here um right they're looking for just simple experience guys you know any job that i apply to they're always looking hey what have you actually done what have you actually done that is a big question okay so uh netflix senior level engineer strong and java javascript css html react react node.js another javascript frameworks and you know for example if you can build restful apis that is amazing too which by the way we teach you all of that in profit or javascript again we're launching that i know um in our webinar on september 13th so make sure you join the webinar on how to become a react javascript developer link in description below okay let's continue on uh next up we have facebook go ahead and run us through this one logan yeah for sure so again guys this is a frontend engineer position at facebook so let's jump down to the minimum qualifications right away we see that they're looking for five plus years of experience in three different fields but nowhere in particular are they looking for it as a qualification or a requirement what they want is they want you to know javascript they want you to know asynchronous programming they want you to know closures and they want you to know es6 they also want you to know your html and your css they want you to know it well at the very bottom they want you to know how to work with apis in the browser how to get information from other servers if you know that you know those three categories you're set up where you're reading that by the way where do you read that es6 all this stuff oh yeah closures types and cs6 i'm like wait where is this coming from okay i got it i got i got it by the way frankie frankie um just want to say bless you yeah so he sneezed all right so five years of javascript experience it's insane again they don't talk about you know the computer science degree which is you know again it's great it's great to hear that companies are finally switching next up let's go ahead and do a different route now a little bit guys this r is going to be towards video game developers drop in the comments drop in the comments guys if you want to become video game developers or has it have thought about that right because that still is also a possibility right in what development there's just so many fields to go into and that's just one of the paths that you can go in right now very important guys before we go on right very important i will say that right we talk about you don't need a degree you don't need a degree right so forth right degree is still helpful that's still fine so if you have a degree that's all good i have a degree logan has a degree a lot of you guys might still want to get a degree that's not that's not a problem um but one thing for certain is that you still need hard work period okay so you still need hard work uh you know at the end of the day that's what matters okay guys so with video game development here you know uh somebody says elias says i'm currently into unreal engine that is amazing uh we have here uh alexander says i have 15 year olds alexander says i have i'm 15 years old i have touched html cc plus plus and javascript so forth that's awesome that's awesome uh we also have anna's says just be trying to challenge myself yes yes yes yes who else who else was who else wants to become a game developer guys huh let us know down in the description below but let's continue on with this so with video game development you and maybe know this a little bit more uh logan let's kind of like run us through this for sure guys sorry sorry the call cut out for a second so i don't know where we're at exactly but i'll give you a little run down about video game development so when i did my degree i did take a course on video game development and that game development was using unity if you google unity it's an open source game engine that anyone can download anyone can work with and anyone can learn from using the tutorials on unity's website you can build all kinds of games and the ones that i want you to think about are all the games that you see on steam all the games that you see on epic games all those indie games that are made by small studio studios and testing ten people yeah look at this guys just some just just some examples of games built by unity okay i personally have not built games any by unity but i have friends who built it and it is unreal in terms of what you can do with it just an example here nomads island um bmax oh there we go i love i love baymax sender trinity we also have coco vr no way guys who here has done vr that is insane uh battle scar right and so many more applications right drone um rick and morty virtual recruit no way he did not know that was building a big game that's in that showcase by the way if anyone is a big um person on twitch escape from tarkov is a big big game that was number one on twitch as far as streaming which one where is it where is there you go one with the guns the guy wearing the hat looks it's key from torco this one oh damn that that's a huge game that one was number one streamed on twitch for at least two months maybe summer last year and so unity unity is definitely more than powerful to create games that i go to go to the top of the charts and make you tons of income nice nice nice nice beautiful guys so it's like it's a very powerful tool so if you're looking into one game development definitely look into you know unity that is going to be a very powerful tool for you and then you can obviously you know go on to different other technologies in terms of building games so let's go back to our presentation here um just an example you know some games develop by is like harsh stone i see i'm not a game developer wait hold on i'm just making sure i'm sure actually showing you hearthstone so i'm actually not a game developer but um you know uh you know yeah not again available but i appreciate how much time and work it takes to build this stuff i listed some resources for you guys if you're on the stream you want to know where can i learn game development so i have them just at the bottom so if you're doing unity they have tutorials that are freely available for you to learn unity on their website website they're very good they're actually the ones that my professor had us use to learn the content for our course and they did very well yeah let's look at some job requirements guys so for what i've seen with job requirements i've seen that yes some do require a degree for example here right edition is open to recent undergraduates and a recent graduates so some do require a degree but not again not all require a degree it's very important i want to actually really quickly go into it and actually find i actually want to find you know uh a game development position right game development job with you guys so gaming development job and see what they got for example junior game developer right here santa monica because we're currently right near los angeles junior game developer let's see what they got so junior can develop a mob crush mob crush let's go they're just the best names i'll just love their names let's go um this just sounds so good let's see so job description santa monica work in the development team let's see let's see let's see so for example responsibilities preferred skills bachelor computer science or games better besides game technology some it looks like some do require a bachelor's degree let's see what else we got uh do we have any that don't require a bachelor's degree i'm sure we do a senior game developer that will probably require a degree let me see let me see bachelor's degree or equivalent experience right so this is what a lot of people are saying now right or equivalent experience bachelor's bachelors in computer science or equivalent experience so right here senior game engineer at play q what about like unix unix um let's see uh unix unity unity game developer yeah yeah yeah just fix your typo oh shoot you don't need good phone you don't need to find him you're going to find there you go my bad bro all right and promote unity game developer let's see uh create unit test validation remote unity game developer it doesn't really say what the requirements are for this specific one software development engineer and test that's actually at unity wow that's going to be an epic one actually at unity applying linkedin this one should be run apply to remote let's see let me see let me see this is the one remote unity game developer doesn't really say what it just simply says c sharp expert c sharp expert right there that's what it says let's see umd developer left field labs let's see let's see they give keep going could be all responsibilities this one says also computer science agree a acrylic degree dang really game developers come on tone it down a little bit they're a little stingy man everybody was stingy i'm like i almost kind of want to become a gandalf but just to prove it to them that you know you don't even agree for that [ __ ] i'm sorry for me for cussing you definitely don't let's see i'm sure we can find something i'm sure you can find something right there all they're looking for is five years of they're looking for five years of professional work experiences bachelor's degree or related something related to bachelor's degree yeah so you can say forget developers it's like it's like iffy sometimes they need to decrease sometimes they do not but there's still a lot of possibilities at the end of the day if you know what you're doing and you build something amazing you're going to get it no matter what so that's one thing to consider all right let's continue on really quickly here so we got game development guys i know you said a lot of you guys have talked about a lot of a lot of you here in this chat actually want to become game developers which could be fine um you know you guys all want to become react.js developers right there let's go ahead yeah so and based on some statistics fork and development looks like we do have a lot with bachelor's degrees and master's degrees but again it's really quickly switching up to where you don't actually need one as as google says you don't need it as facebook as you need it and so forth all right ai ai field guys a lot of you guys are excited for a data scientist field let us know in the comments below if that's something that you're into and before we go go please go ahead and smash that like button and hit the subscribe button for more videos like this guys but smash the like button let's go ahead and get this up how many likes do we have 207 let's get this up to 500 guys i know you guys can i know we can i know we can so run us through the timeline here logan yeah for sure so ai kind of started even towards the beginning of uh computing so this is kind of like post world war two in the 1950s so you'll see i want to point out in 1964 eliza was the first chat developed and it was developed at mit that was in 1964 guys wow that's beautiful that is insane that's before even c was created so that's like they're working with stuff like fortran you know things that most people never heard of but it's ancient moving forward um a lot of stuff didn't really happen with ai from about like the 70s into the 90s i think that had a lot to do with kind of the limitations of hardware at the time but moving forward into kind of like the late 90s the 2000s and definitely the 2010s ai kind of takes off as hardware accelerated so it looks like in 1997 we have deep blue so we have a chess playing computer that beat uh uh from i think is that ibm yes ibm and it defeats the world chess champion so in 1997 ai trump's the best chess player in the world oh definitely i think i think kazi will definitely like this one for sure oh i'm sure he'll love it it'll you know uh so moving into 2002 you guys see roomba so i'm sure you know about kind of like the robots that you vacuum your house roomba was in 2002 and so that was an artificial intelligence that kind of tracks like that the the geospatial map of your living room and will vacuum the house moving into 2011 so a big 10year jump roughly siri and the iphone in 2007 we have 2011 sorry we have watson for ibm another question answering ai we have eugene which is another chat bot and we have alexa in 2014 with amazon and then moving forward before behavi which is now microsoft's ai that you can talk to and in 2017 we have alphago which is uh google's um it's their ai that they use to beat the best go player in the world yeah nice nice nice so you can see as we go on right a lot a lot we are getting a lot more complex and we are getting a lot more smarter with this right between alexa like i'm sure you guys a lot of you guys probably have alexa in your home and i know it's so useful um you know and you know imagine you know really in the future just kind of being like oh alexa you know uh alexa you know uh you know take me to the moon i don't know but i mean i want my ai to like start the car for me the morning so it's warm in the canadian winter man that'd be great yeah that'd be funny that'd be funny i agree all right let's continue on so where to learn let's go ahead some responsibilities or some requirements right qualifications for for the specific i'm not going to be touched too much guys but with ai obviously right python is going to be a big one so let me go ahead and just kind of drop that down here right in terms of text right so you go ahead logan tell me kind of what is a big one right for example i would say python right language we're looking at python for machine learning especially we're going to be looking at kind of like web frameworks like uh django is somewhat relevant here but definitely things like tensorflow um tensorflow yes um moving into artificial intelligence that's not on the web but maybe more for embedded systems like selfdriving cars or autopilot and aircraft so aircraft simulation stuff like that um we're gonna be looking at lower level languages so you might be looking at c c plus plus c plus plus okay then obviously you're looking at for example like python right you're looking for example like um for this one like matlab and by entrance or no matlab yeah that'll be relevant for sure i want it i want to just tie in guys here that data science is 100 relevant to artificial intelligence usually data science works with a smaller subset of ai right where we're looking at like natural language processing we're looking at machine learning but i mean these are all ai concepts this all kind of lives within the realm of ai so i want you to think data scientists live within artificial intelligence exactly exactly okay sweet sweet and then those are the pretty much right those are the very big core pillars and then i would say that's like the r language right is it the r language as well yes yes are very very popular data science language uh really powerful for working with large data frames um doing calculations data cleanup and the rest exactly sweet okay beautiful so let's continue on so that is some things you guys need to know suk hi everybody says hi nas umar hello what is up what is up so good to see you all like always all right some examples we took from online right tesla here for example south engineering computer vision ai right um in ai what are some some of the requirements they're looking into this is actually this is literally we took that just now like really a few minutes ago so they want yes they say computer science degree but check this out a proof of exceptional skills in related fields with practical software engineering experience okay right practical is the key practical okay so also with that a minimum of three years of experience with production level c sub spa so for example logan talked about right c c plus plus um right and j and generic programming and are highly as uh we're desirable we talk about matlab look at this python numpy c plus plus all those things are going to be a very big key players and here for example this is elon musk talking about how all right all that matters is deep understanding of ai and ability to implement neural networks if that's what nns stands for guys okay neural networks in a way that is actually useful don't care hold on check this out don't care if you ever even graduated high school high school guys they're like ah you don't need to high school you're fine just knock on his front door man it's like hey i dropped out 10th grade but hell i can like make a selfdriving car super easily oh man oh man all right let's keep going guys okay that's an interesting slide yeah yeah that was a funny jib that's an interesting slide one okay what are you trying to say here what are you trying to say here logan huh logan what are you trying to tell us ai is going to take over the world no guys but for real uh the most powerful superhero computer in the world take over the world not we don't want that none yeah or am i never the most powerful super computer in the world it's about as intelligent as a cockroach all things considered so we're at no risk of what people talk about when they're in fear of ai taking over the world is if the machines can learn faster than the humans can learn then they can outpace us and then we have a problem yeah so we're still pretty smart guys we're still pretty smart human beings okay they will come get to a point where maybe we not you know there'll be smarter things but we're still pretty smart alrighty so next up computer security guys who know what's good somebody says skynet yeah computer security guys so let's go ahead and talk a little bit about that computer security it's another different field in software development right we talked about right that is why we do not get hacked all the time right a lot of our computers have a antivirus right installed so that is where you have for example malware right phishing password attacks so trying to protect against those and a lot of companies for a lot of companies like for example right bank companies or credit card companies they're gonna hire a lot for computer security so guys if you're that's something that maybe might interest you or if you are computer in computer security let us know down in the comments really i'm really curious right but that's going to be one of the things that you know uh when the jobs are also very popular and is going to be getting more popular through time as well okay and just some requirements can we talk about some of the quick requirements really quickly here uh yes for sure um so just as a disclaimer guys computer security is kind of being on like the edge i would say of maybe what you're used to with software engineering and computer science it's starting to get into the realm of networking transferring data over the internet it's also going to be within the realm of kind of understanding um like protocols and working with lower level languages however what you can expect to have as background knowledge coming into it is an understanding of i.t maybe a bit of operating systems understanding of the different kinds of attacks that you can do on machines so those are listed here one through six we have malware there's stuff like regularly computer security people are doing what's called penetration testing to see if they can break through systems and kind of like impersonate data that should otherwise be correct penetration testing what is that uh i can't say i know 100 but my understanding is penetration testing is essentially you have a system it's think of it as a wall and so that wall is to represent security and your job is to kind of like hit it with different kinds of attacks or different kinds of like data ways two ways to kind of like break that wall and so the idea is you want to break the wall and you want to see how you did it break the wall so see if you can break the wall basically essentially if you can bet get past the security okay can you get and actually a lot of companies actually pay a lot of money for that can you get past the security so for example i know apple as an example will pay you i think thousands of dollars if you can actually find you know find a security loophole in their system right go ahead bug bounties so if you google bug bounties here you'll see how much money companies are putting up tens of thousands of dollars to see if you can find major flaws really wait bug bounties yes google bug bounties hold on let me see bug bounty bounty i'm actually very curious how much is that bug bounty list i'm never actually looking at this kind of stuff guys there's entire communities of what's called white hat hackers these are people who hack professionally but do so in a way where they were when i don't hear you logan logan you're looks like you muted hello you're muted logan that's fine can you get that let me see can i hear you talk hello hello talk i don't hear you i don't hear you hello hello hello hello hello that's okay so yeah go ahead and try and fix that if you can if you can it will keep going so bug bounty as you can see let me see what are some great examples of bug bounties bug bounty bug bounty just i don't know we're just looking it's gone guys guys let's all hype up this round to bring logan back let's go go ahead guys yeah logan try to rejoin if you can if you can that's completely fine but try it one more time guys but let's bring up logan back into this chat but while logan is trying to figure out his stuff we're going to continue on um right and do our stuff so bug bounty bug bounty examples i'm very curious because i haven't looked back bunny examples wow how i hacked facebook and received 34 wow how i hacked facebook and received 3500 bug bounty insane i was actually working funny flaws on dropbox to begin and i noticed when using their web interface there was some restrictions on what file names that were allowed if you try to rename a file name for example to this okay it was not possible you get this error but if you instead connect a local directory create a file there and sync it you get you you got it inside dropbox without any problems holy moly no way i select the file and i synced to dropbox and it was called blah blah blah and shared it nothing awesome happened except the file be being shared but then i clicked the share link in the entry bam the title of the entry was not escaped correctly and i was able to get the stored xss triggered i'm not sure what that means but using the the files in my dropbox i could inject script code that was no way so basically guys what he was able to do is he was able to inject script code you with the files that he uploaded to facebook that is insane so that i mean no this is not you know i'm not saying go do this this is not good guys i'm not encouraging you guys to go out and hack but this is you can find flaws in different systems right that is really cool part about this all right let's go ahead and keep going let me see if we can still get logan back on here maybe maybe not we'll see if not okay all right let's keep going here all right so for that here are some examples that we found in specific in this specific all right let's go ahead right here so cyber security analyst that is an example from microsoft and if you oh let's go ahead if you look at the qualifications that microsoft looks for so two plus years of handson experience in either security operations threat detection analysis incident response and secure network design so again they're not looking so much for not looking so much for um you know uh computer science degree they're looking so much more for experience logan if you are trying to to get in touch go ahead and call me because i cannot for some reason call you right now all right so go ahead and call me and i'll just pick up yep let's hack nasa let's not let's not hack anybody that's not what we're trying to do embedded systems guys another field a potential feel for developers okay potential feel for developers so embedded systems are our systems that do not run operating systems okay so for example like let's say you have a watch right so let's say you have a watch right here you have a watch and it's a casio watch that just simply shows you time that isn't a better system okay um for example a car and i'll show you an example right here a car logan's calling me now let's see logan can i get you on here why is it let me see them cmc come on man my skype is like frozen dead nice club is just frozen that doesn't huh skype force quit quit skype that's not screen skype man all right first quick oh never mind it quit skype yeah let's go i quit skype all right good good good good all right so then i gotta bring that skype back up i am back up on skype let's see logan i'm calling you logan all right i got you so while i'm trying to get ahold of logan let's see if we can oh is logan on here logan on here connecting looks like it's connecting guys it's connecting connecting connecting connecting let's go guys give us a fire for location hear me yeah we can hear you hey logan what's up wait but we can't see you just yet that's weird because my camera's on um i'm going to try and fix this all right try to fix it if you can't it's fine no we still can't hear you logan all right i'm gonna continue on with the presentation so embedded system right that is gonna include for example including you know uh building up your raspberry pi is building up your the systems through their arduino right so for example when you want to when you build digital cameras that's an abandoned system when you build dvd player that's in a bad system right any appliance in your home that's independent system gaming consoles setup boxes wireless routers doors are embedded systems and for example in a car and a car is an example here okay you know everything inside the car for example airbag system the powertrain right for example when you go ahead and put the foot down right and it needs to know how much exactly it needs to accelerate that is part of an embedded system okay all right let's continue on and here's some things you need to know for embedded systems if you want to go into that field you have for example c plus plus javascript python oh let me show you make sure i'm showing you c plus plus javascript python you know java and so forth i'm not sure if you guys seen this but here's the airbag system that was talking about the you know the embedded system for uh for cars all right so that is something that you would be looking into you know a building building with for example using it if you like adrenal boards right and if you're into that you will be building it through that let me know down in the comments guys if that's something that interests you for me personally physical things for some reason don't interest me as much i don't know why i'm not a big fan of those um let me see it's quit skype is just can you see me now or can you hear me nah i can hear you but i can't see you though oh weird i just unplugged my camera and replugged it in to make it work but and i can see myself in skype so it's weird that it's yeah i don't see on skype i didn't see unscripted it's all right we'll have we'll have logan as a as a voice as an extra voice guys okay can you screen share and skype notes oh yeah let me see maybe where is skype i can't screen share because it just says connecting all right logan you're just going to be with us here so as an example of the nevada system tesla for a tesla went ahead and uploaded their their um their job posting and by the south engineering for gateway you know where you are going to be delivering high quality c code in real time embedded environment so for example for in terms of cars you you might be working on things like you know um you know engine control right maybe brake control right and so forth right so it's the communication behind the brakes the you know uh be behind behind basically between the brakes between you using the gas pedal and all of that that is what embedded systems as a better system you're going to be working on all right experience requirements here check this out experience and abundance development in robotics realtime controls or system software so basically again they're not looking for a degree right so he's very particular about that and fluid and stuff fundamentals including software design and maintainability so here's an example now let's get into devops a really good one devops i personally love devops guys um it's not something i'm i'm good at something i really want to get much much better at but let me go ahead and put skype just so cuz like it looks like it's just not working um so devlops is the whole process right it is the whole process behind right behind application development okay so an example right the whole process application development includes planning building continuous integration deploying so the canadian integration is when you um basically go ahead and test you have ci that test your app right so it tests your app and then it goes ahead and actually and then it deploys the app right so that is continuous integration okay so with ci for example you think it's like jenkins and june and so forth they deploy your app down to like docker or to amazon for example and ec2 instance or maybe it's to firebase who knows okay then you operate it right right wait operation is when you go ahead and actually uh let's see operation through jira it is when you go ahead and plan things out through jio that is planning right continuous feedback that's when you get feedback about your application and then you continue on so plan build ti deploy opera and so forth right and that my friends is an embedded system so you'll get to work on things like docker like right kubernetes uh eclipse right and so forth not eclipse the eclipse is is is not that in an id don't worry about that amazon s3 amazon ec2 instances right that's when you can architect how the whole system works you see that that is where that comes in so here's an example side availability engineer at uh at apple uh right here in san diego california right they're looking for three plus years of managing site reliability engineer teams and supporting mission critical applications five plus years of experience there um three per year plus years of hybrid cloud so being able to go through aws azure is gonna be really big part so aws is something that uh we will cover as well at some point too right being able to understand nosql databases right and releasing databases as well very big part ci right ci continuous integration pipelines right here so again these are for me personally i love these roles and it's something that i haven't worked on but i've worked on you know as a developer i've worked on continuous integration i've worked on aws and so forth so guys who hear the comments logan is like skype servers are dying here guys sorry my internet is fine yeah skype come on we had facebook who's trying to take us down now we have skype who's trying to take us down what is wrong with this week huh wait frankie's not here i thought frankie was here guys but he's not here anyways let's eat some food all right so all right we are finishing up here almost done and then we gotta take questions okay guys next up databases sorry one second gotta need some water my water is good guys that was so good hey so databases right you've got your sequel you got your nonsequel so sequel database are relational databases nosql are not relational databases okay and you can actually have a job in database management and so forth so but you'll know for example you'll have to learn things like postgresql mysql amazon history amazon amazon microsoft azure firebase right mongodb those are going to be your key players okay and here's some examples from td ameritrade in terms of right database administrator so dba stands for database administrator okay they're looking for minimum one year database administration working experience building and deploying administrative distributed oracle databases so with this type of work it's actually pretty fun it's you being able to go ahead and create database schema so here's an example what i mean by that here's database schema data base schema database schema uh let's go ahead database schema er there we go here's database schema here's an example so for example you will be building a schema like this this is a relational database schema i know it looks scary but don't get scared very important guys okay would you mainly as as a database administrator what you will under have to understand is okay how from the top level view what data does our application need right what can we do with that data and how do we go ahead and save the data in a database so that it is also very scalable right so it's one thing to have a database with 10 rows or 10 rows saved it's another thing to have database saved with millions of rows and i've worked with both with smaller databases and large databases right so that is going to be and you have to think about okay well you know think about for here's an example can you take a quick video from me frankie thank you so let me sew i'm just trying i want to introduce you guys as much as possible in terms of what i know so you can see here as an example let's say you have a let's say you have a database schema looks like this and i start out with a user right here right a user has user password username user email right and so forth right and the user now has for example let me look at this uh comment so let's say now a user has comments right here okay and so now you have a separate table for comments as well which is right here and that has a comment id and user id user type you comment text and so forth right so again right then from comments let's say you also have let me see uh assignment so user might have an assignment right and that has a user a assignment id right you know is it reviewed you know the user id and assignment in the initial as well and so you have to be the person to actually understand what data and how am i going to save this data properly in the database personally it's actually something really fun and that's something you're interested in actually doing let me know down in the comments right let me know down in the comments if there's something you want to learn how to for example build a database schema how to build we call them er models okay let me know down in the comments and uh that's something that that we're looking into actually uh providing that kind of content to you guys right here on this amazing youtube channel alrighty sweet let's keep going let's keep going let's go ahead and exit this out next up so this is to me to the ameritrade right uh example here next up so i know this is guys this is way too much this is a lot a lot has been just given to you okay let me know in the comments if you're a little bit like holy moly what is going on how do i go from there so call degree no degree that is the question okay degree or no degree from what we have learned from what we have learned both are going to require a lot of studying both are going to require a lot of work you can see we just have frankie in the back hi frankie both are going to require a lot of work right degrees are something required in the corporate more traditional world but the world is changing guys the world is changing really quickly right 40 degrees are expensive between 40 dollars to two hundred twenty thousand dollars depending on the tuition cost right but now with self taught with right with with codecademy with youtube resources like this that you have here on youtube right with profit javascript course which by the way we're going to launch this sunday people are starting to realize you don't actually need that you simply just need the experience and you simply just need the projects and you simply just need right hands on experience that you that's the most important part and so if you're someone who wants to be their own boss a college degree may not be necessary for you selftalk can be a fraction of the cost less than a thousand dollars and you can start making your own income so let me know down in the comments all right let me know down in the comments if no you still think a degree is going to be for you personally for me here's one one big thing oh dania i keep doing this command done file every open close tab one big thing that i want to talk about guys is here's here's a big here's a big issue here's a big issue what i will say is as someone who is selftaught so as selftaught okay which you here let me put this again selftaught right taut one big thing you need to understand is the fact that you need to be if you want to be selftaught and not go a degree route you need to be disciplined right you need to be hard worker obviously that's going to be for any case and being able to push yourself nonstop have passion the reason why i say for this for self taught is because the discipline is going to be the hardest part right as a selftaught developer you have to be the one to push yourself to do those projects you have to be the one to actually write right to create opportunities for you versus for example if you're going to go to the degree route right a lot a lot you know as it will be provided for you right so project will be provided right you still need to still hard work required right all that's required of course and you still need to push yourself in any case you still need to push yourself but that's the big key thing that i've seen between selftaught and you know when you have a degree okay you're selftaught you have to be extremely disciplined so if you're watching these videos guys and if you're doing the clones with us if you are if you go ahead and you're building these projects it is extremely important that you know you build the projects yourself to don't just watch but actually build them to complete complete entirety okay and then make sure to share with us as well right so that's going to be the big part that i want to just want to touch on okay and also obviously of course make sure to share this says you know tag me logan right here you know logan or nas right here tag us in in it you know and obviously sunny and qazi and frankie or aaron tag us in your projects we love to see all of them guys um but that at this point guys we're pretty much we're pretty much done i will go ahead and take questions if you guys have any questions um and that's that's that's pretty much it guys we are we are done as they say at the end so if you guys need questions let me know in the comments below and i will love will love to answer answer them guys so frankie we got any questions have you been able to see any questions they have um check it out i don't know if you answered this without a degree you can be a freelance web developer something you can achieve from being selftaught the main problem is getting firsttime clients how do you have any advice on solving that issue let me see where is that one how do you advise there we go let me see i got it i got it boom all right so without a degree without degree freelancer developer something you can achieve by being selftaught the main problem is getting firsttime clients how do you advise and solving this issue so yes you are right getting your first client is going to be the hardest thing out there okay that is going to be your breaking point to solve this issue to solve this issue it's it's it's not going to be simple it's just you're going to have to keep it and keep doing and doing until you get that first client now one way to help you out with that is actually to go ahead and get a client to try to get your first client through people you might know so i always say for example when you're starting out in freelancing okay i always say guys you know call anybody you know and ask them if they're looking to get any job done or they know anybody who needs to get the job done you know who needs freelance work call them up here's why because in freelancing trust is the most important thing that's the one thing i've realized in freelancing i've done freelancing for about a year right about a year until i you know kind of started started coaching you guys and started you know doing my profit with javascript you know and teaching about development right and gain the first client was the hardest but i actually partnered up with a friend of mine and we went ahead what we literally did is we we had someone who gave us work and because we had the trust with them and that was our first client and once we got to the first content again the second one of them was a lot a lot easier okay so that is how i would say how to you know unsolve that issue another way you can solve this issue as well and just gonna as i'm talking through here another way to solve this issue is right you know we talk we what do we touch on we touched on right you know um talk to people you know gawk to talk to people you know you know but also don't forget very important is right just keep going like just keep going keep going don't stop at just one proposal right you sometimes you have to uh submit you know 100 to 150 to 200 proposals to actually get that first client and then what you'll start to see you know for example maybe one way to get your first client is also lower your price i know it's a hard thing to do guys because we don't want to price ourselves really low at all but if you're charging you know if nobody really knows who you are and you're charging a hundred dollars an hour that's gonna be pretty hard to get that for example a network or freelancing okay or freelancer versus if you were to charge like 15 initially for example when i was starting out i told you know i was told and that's what i did it was to start out with 15 for example an hour so like for example at 15 per hour and then i moved up from 15 to 25 to 40 to 50 and so forth okay but we started with 15 pretty much 15 an hour and when you get to download and you know getting that first kind is a lot easier because you're not just the person who's like you know i'll do the work and then actually i was one client for me where i was like you know i'll do free for free because i really need that first experience yeah so that was that was very interesting don't do you know yeah do it for free is is is good okay but if you can charge for example a lower price like 15 an hour and so forth that's gonna be good too um what is the least this least price let me go ahead let me look another one what is the least price you should charge for a contract job like i said guys it really depends um on who you are and what you do let me see let me go ahead what is the lease for is it what is oh my god a show to you here all right what's the least price you should charge for a contract job depends on where you are and depends uh depends on where you are if you're in usa for example and you just starting out 15 an hour is is a good way to go 15 an hour then you can move up from there to 20 25 and so forth if you are somewhere outside you know you might be looking potentially some something somewhere lower right depends on the location but it also honestly you know do not underprice yourself as well because some people you might not know where your location is if you have for example client usa right you might be able to charge higher so it's really hard for me to just tell you an exact number you have to really play around with it but if you're for example when you say you want to start you know you try it out try the 15 and see what works out if 15 is a bit if the bit if the 15 is a bit bit too much because for example you see yourself you're not getting you know enough clients or you can't get one client at least then lower your price it's as simple as that all right but once you've got the first client for that price very important guys very important here once you've got the client for that price increase your price increase your price every single project you do and keep increasing your price very important guys all right next up another question one other question well let's go with to kill all right pedro asks pedro asked let me see oh god it's so hard to no pedro asks boom right there badger asks what's a good way to kill the coding challenge just when it's extremely new to coding i can write code and look i'm looking things up but i can't sit there and do them so pedro if you're in that specific you know you just simply need to put in more time into it right so you need to build the projects themselves so yes you can look up things and so forth but you need to understand what make for you what's fun like why is coding fun why is coding fun for you right because the other day that is the very important that's that's the key if it's fun for you right and you enjoy it you're going to keep doing it and then you're going to get results now if you enjoy it and you get results man you're you're on another level you know but you have to look okay what's fun for me right maybe you want to build right your project projects around around game development right maybe you want to build games you need to find what fun and actually start doing that specific task maybe you want to build a game maybe you want to build a blog maybe you want to help someone else create a landing page right but you have to start right taking in the experience of building something from scratch not just following along but from scratch and we actually do that some we actually do that we built projects from scratch in profit javascript which again we're launching on sunday september 13. make sure you check that out link in bio guys right we're gonna have a webinar on how to become a react js developer very important linking buyer right frankie lincoln bio frankie says go to the link let's go and work go to the link and and we'll see you there sunny we'll see you there kazi will see you there and we'll see maybe someone else will see you there as well all right let's see let's see what the questions we got integrated with the computer trying to see some questions trying to see some questions trying to see some questions guys don't spam the chat there we go because you're going to delete it really quickly do not spam the chat okay i'm currently in a 30year degree and have fivestar uncode chef and can i get a job on google microsoft with ease or not oh that's a good question okay here there you go here's my answer i got a simple answer for you here my friend so i am currently in third year degree and have five star on code chef and can i get a job at google microsoft with ease or not i got a simple answer for you one simple answer yes slash no you're gonna hate me for this but look you don't know if you're gonna get a job i can't tell you that you will get a job easily because i don't know you know if you're passionate about this i'm not sure how much you've worked right the only way for you to find out is to actually apply freaking apply guys apply what gankadeep make sure you apply so just apply to a google engineering job apply it to a netflix job apply to facebook job you guys literally need to do that and then that's the only way you'll find out don't think that while i'd be good at this or not you have to actually do it when somebody asks me hey can i get a job at google i'm like i don't know tell me did you apply no well that's the answer you need to apply i always say this guys it's such a big it's such a big it's such a big it's such a big such a big uh issue guys and you literally just look after you look up on google for example google.com google careers all right let's look at all cool up together cool careers all right software engineering let's go ahead and do san francisco because why not boom next uh finish seashell engineer let's go ahead and do soft engineer service architecture south engineer just in general software engineer right here right clearly click apply boom right there right and you are right away in this right look at this set up your resume contact details address phone number degree school name right right attending university you can say no if you don't have it in university just keep going so forth right work experience what is your work experience they look that uh very prolonged for that very much right and a cover letter and that's it guys one page and you're done and you reply to google and then you'll find out if you can actually get in or not you'll probably go through five rounds of interviews you'll go through a few interviews and then you'll be able to know but you have to start with that you have to start with that well somebody says what about remote ones oh yeah you can you can definitely find remote remote remote jobs and actually you can find remote jobs for example like on stack overflow so stackover is a great job for remote stack over flow remote developer boom boom here's a guy javascript full stack developer right there full time no office location remote check this out guys all right mid level senior because due to requirements no way no way in here does it say about a bachelor's degree which is really cool part as well we're closer with frontend and native developers building web views in react look at this oh look at this hey look at this right javascript full stack developer guys what are you still doing here you should be applying this company right now um look at this work closely with frontend and ada developers building web views in react for our hybrid mobile applications uh you are driven you they're looking for driven selfmotivated soft engineer with at least a few years experience in the industry and has strong experience with javascript and familiarity with no sql databases it's so crazy to listen because that's actually something we teach we teach you javascript we teach you know sql like mongodb we teach you react which is what you're going to be working with that is it's all in there look at this you can be designing performance driven endpoints for a public api we teach you node.js to build apis what oh damn look at these perks excellent health vision dental insurance let's go oh wow insane nice nice nice there's a ton like you might stack overflow you can search up you know remote there's a ton of jobs remote jobs right now guys the uk you guys can get so don't think that there's not enough all right let's continue on guys i have any other questions please please answer i have a good programming skill so do i apply for cs or other major to have two different skills why do you want two different skills and ask this question so you said ahmed said no did not excuse so what would you command to become a foster developer oh that's a good question nikhil nikhil what's up nikhil my accommodation hack yeah full stack yes right away full stack i'm a big fan of full stack development i am a full stack developer guys and what i can tell from experience is a full developer you have a ton more you not only do you have a ton more confidence but you also have a ton more opportunities why because you can apply for frontend jobs you can apply for backend jobs and you can apply for full stack jobs that's three different opportunities you can apply for right so as a full stack developer on top of that at your job at your job you will have the ability to understand other developers right so when you are working when i am working for example with a backend developer i will be talking with a backend developer right for example i'm currently a frontend developer and i'm talking with a backup developer and we're trying to create a feature okay right because i know how backend development works because i've done that before i can fully understand and the communication is so much easier communication communication is so much easier okay okay you will be not on top of that you will be respected a lot expected i mean you're gonna you're gonna be respected in either case but you will also and you will also be the person who uh will be relied on right so they're going to rely because you understand both sides of the coin they will know that okay this guy will not only have to take over the front end but he will be able to take care of the back end and this stuff is especially important important like when you are going into important when you are in you know important in uh startups right startups they're looking for that that's exactly what they're looking for they're looking for someone who can do front end back end marketing uh what else what else are we frankie front and back and marketing you know uh i don't know if you want to do if you want to pretty much anything you can do you will have to wear a thousand hats that's that's what you will do so it's 100 react plus jingle is a great combination right here uh red plus jingle if you want to do for example react plus no gs that works very well too but as long as you're full stack developer hey sunny's in the house what is up sunny so good to see you man let's go i know i just got very loud sunny what's up man everybody say hi sunny in the comments so let's see any other questions guys before we leave on we're almost done here let's see any other questions any other questions i'm studying csmc right here i'm studying boom boom boom boom i'm studying csc please it's just how can i start with python js and react.js very simply join profile javascript guys and join our webinar on how to become a reactor yes javascript developer direct drop reacted javascript developer link is in description below make sure you join the webinar for sunday at 11am pst guys so that's gonna be obvious that's one way but some in terms of another way right how to get started very easily you know you can start with tutorials start up with tutorials build start building some applications start building some momentum that's what i always talk about momentum momentum equals action momentum equals action right with this react challenge we provide them with momentum right we had you build an amazon clone and so you build that momentum okay to now go on and build more clones put the spotify column build a slack clone right well go ahead and join a a coding community right build that momentum please do not just stop here because that's what you need to do right so if you need to go ahead and write and do tutorials do that if you debut projects to that i mean you do need to build projects in either case but it just takes some work and that is it my friend that is it let's see let's see let's see what else we got we also got sunny was like join the webinar guys let me see sunny yo serious value bombs gonna be in that join the webinar guys link in description below we'll see you there sonny's like and hold yourself accountable and get it done very important very important hold yourself accountable sony asked what about view view is a really good framework as well but um you know we've got some pretty cool frameworks right now which is uh which is uh you know reactor yes and and so forth and no gs mern stack or django mercedes or django good question mercedes i would say both both are good the more here's what you think about it guys okay the more tools in your two build the better you're gonna be so if you if you now obviously you want to start out with one right so let's say you know if you know javascript i know go the mern stack route right where you're going to learn [ __ ] you're going to learn node.js you're going to learn react and so forth express right that's going to be that route if you know some python learn django that's it so it's really that easy if you don't know any you can start with reacting and start no no gs that's gonna be your options got it but obviously your goal is to not only stick with money your goal is to know as many as your goal is to just like have experienced many different things and know what they can do i've done mango i've done jingle i've done react i've done angular right i've done a little bit of you right so you want to kind of like plant seeds you kind of want to plant seeds a little little by little right see what they can do so that when it comes time to you do some serious work you can pick it up like this hey there we go somebody says where are you from i am actually from ukraine guys if you're interested yeah i'm from ukraine was born and raised there and i came here about 15 years ago yes 15 years ago let's see what else we got any other questions before we land on i think we're going to end pretty soon guys niki was like okay let's jump into bj you got that right my friend nikhil you're on point you're on point nikhil says he wants to join pwg you hear that frankie oh nevermind frank he he wants to join pwj hey let's go count the webinar tomorrow guys kind of webinar tomorrow somebody asked um mongodb or sequel let me see mongodb or sequel no that's not the one that's not what i wanna am gonna be your sequel you wanna learn both for sure right uh again a lot of my answers gonna be both guys because as a developer you should you should know a few different things let's see deeper engineer or software development engineer i mean i mean you guys asked me so here deep learning engineer or software development engineer i mean depends that's my answer a lot of this is depends depends guys nope oh [ __ ] my bad all bullocks that's how you said that is that how you say your son oh bollocks i don't know i don't know i don't have the accent or the british accent or anything like that but neither case so it it all at all depends guys right when you do deep learning you gotta work a lot with data so deeply is going to involve a lot of data it's going to a lot involve a lot of analysis and so it really depends on which you like um if you like data if you're not if you like analysis except i have a friend who likes data right and she and so she does data she does data science she works out data she works with databases and so forth okay um now if you're going into that then you might want to get into deep learning if you like to from build frontend applications or backend applications that you want to go into software development engineer right so if you're going to build like for example applications like facebook apps right or for example like netflix netflix frontend netflix netflix front end netflix front end you're going to be go more towards the route of a software development route so again really depends on what you guys like okay what you guys like all right let's see if peter j do you help students with their first project of course we do guys we're there to help guys we help you guys nonstop no joke in pwg not only do we help but hundreds of other actually if currently a thousand and five hundred other students help you out as well of course that's we're here to do guys our goal is to be able to get to to have to give five thousand jobs to developers no to provide developers with five thousand jobs no to do to have five how do you say this properly to give like opportunities for developers for fun no that's how do you say this properly to give developers to provide opportunities for developers to provide 5 000 jobs to developers that's our goal guys right that's our goal so yeah of course we provide you with that i started tomorrow hey let's go sonny asked hold on nikhil asked a so so on pwj we do full stack right and lots of projects right can we have a quick overview for everyone on here you guys will see that tomorrow on sunday september 13th guys so make sure you check that out but yes we do full stack we do know gs we do react gs we do javascript we do we teach you the basics right we do crazy projects like building a blog for example like building a twitter clone for example like building a spotify clone right we teach you and we go dig deep into all those specific things we teach how to build a google maps project right that we took straight from upwork right and and so much so much more this right here is a living and breathing product profit with javascript is a living and breathing product it's now it's like you get it and that's it when you get it any improvement we build on top of it you're going to get that as well you're going to get that as well so we keep improving we have coaching calls every single week right where we provide to students where we building projects currently for example i am building a project a netflix clone with students and and so we are literally taking that from the start from the beginning from like core basics of html basics you see it says basis of javascript and we're building up on top of that okay that's for beginners but we also have a route for more intermediates right which is if you want to go the react route and so sunny is taking care of that portion right where he'll help you build a spotify clone you know um for example a slack clone any clones that you know that you guys have been building but more digging more deeper into it where you guys will be able to answer questions and so forth we're gonna do that too so yeah some really some really crazy stuff there happening and we're i'm personally very excited about that odua says google maps project was awesome was a great one thank you thank you i'm happy i'm happy you liked it happy you liked it beautiful all right where do i start if i want to become a developer start out with our peta profitable javascript course but also start out with just you know building tutorials from youtube that's gonna be a good start for you all right guys i think that's gonna we're gonna end it at this point guys i am i was very happy to go ahead and answer a lot of your questions you had so many questions let me see actually i followed the facebook loan now i'm working on a microsoft teams clone of my own using react wait what no way hey let's go hold on it says i worked in on a facebook loan so because says i want a facebook and now i'm working on microsoft clone microsoft clone right here of my own using react router and a bunch of other stuff nice job nice job that is epic give some fire and some claps for because i don't know how to say that properly but you know all right let's continue on all right i'm data scientist and use let's see what else see okay i'm a data data scientist and use and love python sql hadoop and machine learning all day i prefer star development aspect of my job big telecoms company do i need to know front end if you like for example and you love python sql and hadoop and machine learning um just you know keep going with that if that's something you're into keep doing that look seriously you know again you know a lot of this depends on what field you know you wanna you might if you want you can try for example react you can try javascript and because we've actually had a lot of students who have done like data science then they've tried react they've tried front end and now they really like that portion too there's no harm what is the worst thing that can happen but you learning something new huh you tell me i don't know so yeah so there's no harm in doing that whatsoever but if you're going the route of python that's something you want to keep improving on keep doing that really you know go 10x 10x on that specific topic and python on sql on hadoop and machine learning and then you'll just see yourself skyrocket like crazy you know to the 10x squared to the square root now that square root does not make sense you know you're gonna take yourself to the you know infinity and beyond as we say you know infinity and beyond alrighty guys somebody asked will ai take away our development jobs no it will not guys maybe one day we'll see um my thinking is no it will not take our web development jobs there will actually be more the web development jobs created because now you need to build the ai so there you go that's going to be answered for that's going to be my answer there let's see any other questions are there any other questions guys let us know let me know in the comments below if you've joined the webinar did you join the webinar for tomorrow and are you pumped for tomorrow's webinar where sonny and kazi are going to be covering how to become a react javascript developer guys so if you're pumped for that let me know in the comments below and if you have joined that webinar did you join it frankie tell them to join the webinar join the webinar everybody you're going to get massive value bombs so amazing frankie's going to join the webinar too you're going to be there yep says yes let me see another question i'm learning javascript is it okay if i start react before node.js yes a hundred percent it is okay okay reason why is because those are two different technologies like justice frontier node.js is backend if you know reg gs before now gs that's completely fine that's actually what most people probably will do because they will learn front end and then they will learn back in so yeah that's not a problem at all let's see another questions guys make sure let me know in the comments below again if you went in and you joined the webinar yes or no give me a yes yes or no yes or no yeah somebody said ali says hey i will take over the world and would take over clever program in the future after a few years you will see nas bot teaching yeah that's hilarious hold on i gotta screenshot that that's hilarious ali says ai will take over clever programmer in the future after a few years you will see nas by teaching us maybe i'm already bot how do you know maybe oh my gosh my name says yes yes i joined spiro says yep i joined that's sweet sweet good to see you guys awesome to see you guys so as honestly at this point we're going to end this guys i hope you receive some good value from this you know we are going to keep doing more live videos more live calls throughout the week well no all i know at this point all i can say now hope you have an amazing day and we will see you in the next video bye bye yeah yeah i wish i had like some really cool outro song but frankie that was awesome
