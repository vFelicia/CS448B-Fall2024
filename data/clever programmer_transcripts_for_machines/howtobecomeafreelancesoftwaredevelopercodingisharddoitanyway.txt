just wanted to say things are hard good do them anyway like today I didn't feel like going to the gym this man did not look at his face look at his face that does not look like a face that wants to go to the gym he did not want to go to the gym yep and we both went anyway coding is hard coding is difficult there will be days where you don't want to do do it at all you're gonna get opportunities whether it's in freelancing or you're applying to platforms like wise and take lessons or upward this is a student from clever programmer yengee zhang and she actually made this comment two years ago which was super cool and she said I followed your tutoring others idea went on to wise ant and landed my first session in under 72 hours so this is actually that possible you could do this right away and make it work it can take as little as 72 hours it might not happen for you but you could give it a try or code mentor or whatever it is in your country you know always here it doesn't work in my country doesn't matter all right you need there's some equivalent in your country that works so just look it up like it's called Google so just use it ah that now that I got out is there still gonna be somebody in the Commerce is gonna be like wait it isn't working in my country well yes I at this point I can't help you okay what that said yeah yeah yeah yeah seriously move in that case if there isn't even an equivalent then just move that's probably the best if there is no freelancing opportunity in your country that probably is representative of how much opportunity in generals in my country so you should probably move yep that's that's the best advice we can give you like then then start watching Gary B's content and like flipping trash and turning it from $2 in to $50 or $100 and I love Gary Vee by the way coating content you're not gonna put out anything that day I'd rather you just film yourself drinking a cup of coffee and maybe talking about the story why you started coding in the first place so like I'm actually giving this advice from the bottom of my heart like if there are no freelancing opportunities and there are no coding opportunities at all then don't do it then do something else okay just like be very practical about what it is that you need to do like I don't care if you code and make your income from coding or you do something else like as long as you're very resourceful of what you do and how you do it okay with that said freelancing opportunities will be hard and even when people get those opportunities they don't want to apply even when they get those opportunities sometimes they don't want to take action on it sometimes they don't want to go in for the interview sometimes you might not feel like applying to one more client like I tell people hey if you're gonna make a platform you're gonna make up yeah like a profile on a platform like why is that or take lessons to coach people in coding here's a student Casey who's a student at clever programmer and he also has a profile and as you can see he's gotten multiple students he also has four reviews and from there he's been getting lots of work and he's made decent Emma he's made a few thousand dollars from just teaching others already in just a few months okay here's his LinkedIn profile so you guys can go and check him out or message him whatever the case may be here's Jesse who's another student and she has a profile on take lessons for teaching beginners Python and she has a profile on wise and as well you need to be like reaching out to 50 to 100 people a day if you don't feel like it well do it anyway all right so something some days it'll be really hard I know some days if it's really hard then apply to one person apply to five people all right you don't have to do it for 50 things code for one hour instead of coding for five or ten hours at a time but start do a little every single day even if you don't have motivation and especially if it's hard my friend do it anyway that's it raining out here in Chicago I'm back in Chicago right outside a Starbucks but I just launched my earn 1k program and this is a program if you want to know how to land your first client and really get started because I know a lot of you are beginners a lot of you're trying to get your first freelancing client if you're a professional developer it might still help you because you'll learn how to get that first client if you haven't already but this program really goes hard on the soft skills that you need to succeed and it talks about different platforms where you can succeed like upward take lessons Craigslist how to utilize meetups and build those relationships before you need them it's a pretty great program however you I'd at least click the link below and check out I have a pretty epic video there for you so you can learn more about it being completely broke to then learning how to code in just a few months landing my contract as a freelancer with Python and being able to make $20,000 Wow I am enjoy that's it I'm coffee I'm gonna go hang out with my boy peasant in there peace
