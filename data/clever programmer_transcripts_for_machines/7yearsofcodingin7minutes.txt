how's it going everybody hope you guys are doing amazing my name is nas from clever programmer and I'm one of the new instructors here and today I want to take you through my seven years of coding of experience from my failures of being rejected by Google and Pelletier and Twitter and Squarespace to invent having worked with many different startups and many different companies and now actually doing freelancing and being able to charge clients good money per month and and you know what and living a good lifestyle all right so it all starts out in 2012 back in high school it was 11th grade and I took my first web design class now back then we were doing using Dreamweaver so we were building a very basic applications very simple websites and but you know what in the end they were very beautiful and it looked good all right by the way this video is sponsored by dashlane if you guys want to keep your password safe and secure and not have to remember any of those passwords to log in

secure in 2012 as well I built my first personal website and it was called tech help org and that website was made for to review technical products and to write blogs and and at the same time just to learn how it is to learn coding in 2013 I went ahead and out and I did that did something crazy on the sidelines while still taking the same web design class that from high school I decided to completely redo the whole schools website as a surprise I didn't tell anyone I was doing by myself like in the end I showed it to my teacher and the teacher loved it and we ended up actually deploying it and and the school used this website for the next three years as their landing page so in 2014 I I joined college and the thing is that's when I realized that college in itself is not enough for you to later on go on and do work and to be to be hired by companies like Google and to be hired by start or to even learn and that for that matter so that's why in January of 2015 I decided to join a startup in fact I joined a complete creative computing Club initially and I saw these two guys these two guys who were building some kind of application so I asked them what are you guys doing they said we're building an app I'm like that's amazing can I join so alright ok so I asked him the potentially work for free and return they teach me and I can get experience for that time going through 2015 was honestly one the best years of my life honestly we were building a startup we were I was learning a lot of new skills I was learning Django I was only Python I was learning angularjs and so many other technologies that I was excited about right but the most part is I was working with the team as well and it was working with the team you get to build a really some really cool applications one of the applications we build was called trend allah' and that was an application that was literally curating clothing for people who are using it so start now in 2016 sorry 2016 I decided I wanted to get an internship I had my experience but I needed to do something with that experience right so I decided to apply for jobs as I was working at the startup I applied for the first one I applied it was Twitter apply for Twitter it got rejected in a month I applied for Palantir they did went through all the interviews they flew me out to California I did four rounds of interviews got rejected by them too then I apply for Squarespace at this great space I did a really cool project for them right and a couple of days Kerry ejected by them too then I applied for Google I applied for Google they flew me out to Cali are they five rounds of interviews and they got rejected by those but then finally in 2016 I asked my friend who was working at a company called urban science now he he introduced me to the he gave my resume to the recruiter the recruiter contacted me and then right away I got the internship in about a week they also talked about the power connections that is the one of the most important things that I learned in this space if you know someone you're a lot more likely to get that that that job or the internship or whatever less that you want all right through my second half of 2016 I was doing an internship with that company called urban science right through them I gave three months three months of very interesting work where I was working with a lot of data I was actually building a a program that was combining data from from databases that had millions and millions of rows right and then interestingly enough in that time I decided to learn to learn machine learning on my own I took a Udacity course for free and I applied it to the actual project I was doing with them I applied it and then I presented it they loved it an Olfa sudden I was on a different team let's forward to fall of 2016 I got a new team it was a software analytics intern it was a lot more interesting I was working with people who had master's degrees who had PhDs and I was doing very interesting work working with nodejs and machine learning in Python and honestly is one of the best times I've ever had now through that time right after that fall 2016 at the end of the internship they actually gave me a fulltime offer to start right after I finished college which was amazing January 2017 I finished my internship I start something called a senior design class and it's your design class you actually build a real project that's going to be used in the real world and we've built a project called canvas well it was a mimic of canvas maybe some of you might know but this project was allow students to to to do assignments on courses to create groups and it was a very complicated project and involved many people but it taught us a lot of things through May 2017 I was finishing college we finished that project we turned it in we got an A which was great and then I was supposed to start my might my fulltime job at urban science but there was one issue at the end of the college time as I was supposed to start working I had a friend who introduced me to a star that he was working at and he told me amen we got a job here if you want it you got it so I decided like you know what why not I applied I went for an interview and about a week I got an offer so now I had two issues the issue was one either go to startup or or or work at a bigger company right they already gave me an offer and I just can't took the leap of faith I decide to look at a startup I told the other company that I couldn't do it I'm sorry and I decided to go the path of working with a friend of mine at this startup called service comm June 2017 I am working at a startup right we are building this really cool application where we are connecting contractors and customers to get work done at that time I'm learning a lot of things I'm learning angularjs I mean learning testing I'm learning Django I'm learning Django rest and so much more I saw a year and a half goes by a rookie at the company I decided to do something different I realized that there's something missing I realized that I want to start doing freelancing so Duke so December of 2018 I put in my two weeks notice and you know what it was one of the best times I've ever had literally the CEO told me listen man I'm going to tell you this as a father as a friend and as a friend as a financial adviser you're nuts you're nuts and you're nuts and you know what it was okay because he was right January 2019 I start freelancing interestingly enough that company my the service.com became my first client give me a country I accepted it and I was working with them for the next three months and that was amazing because that gave me like a head start on my contracting career right throughout that I go to conferences I go to meetups I meet people and I let my second client a real estate client where we are doing another really cool plication that has to do with them MLS if you don't know take a look at it forwarding to today I have now had about four clients and I've done some amazing work I've learned a lot but it has been very tough there is a lot of freedom that I have a lot of freedom I have to learn a lot I have to do five different things but you know what I'm really excited for what I'm doing and that is my seven years of coding experience I hope you'll like it
