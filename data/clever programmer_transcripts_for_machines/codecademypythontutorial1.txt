hey guys how are you doing so today I'm going to take on a very interesting challenge which is going to be I'm going to go through the entire code Academy course and try to finish it as fast as I can and along the way my goal is to be able to help you guys give you guys some kind of intuition and for most of the people that are stuck this is going to help you kind of get unstuck and think about code um in a little bit of a different way I hope so I hope that this video helps you and it helps you solve those frustrating annoying problems because I remember when I was going through this I didn't have any help and I would quit for weeks at a time because I simply did not know where to go even the forms didn't help me so that's pretty much my main point to help everybody else out there so we're going to be taking the code Academy course here and we're going to be taking in the language called Python and there tons of students enrolled here 2.5 million it's a fairly long long course and the level required is beginner so unit 1 it's syntax tip calculator unit 2 talks about strings date and time and as we get further down we go into more and more useful and more advanced things so conditionals and control flow is going to be fun functions dictionaries and pretty much all of the stuff here battleships is going to be a lot of fun so feel free to use this video as a resource to help you if you get stuck or for entertainment you know just sit through and watch along how I tackle these problems ok so the first one is python is an easy programming language you can use it to create web apps games even a search engine I agree ready to learn Python click Save and submit ok so the first problem is already done all I have to do is hit save and submit code okay max streak of one start next lesson so creating web apps games and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data they do so using variables variable stores a piece of data and gives a specific name for example spam is equal to five so basically here they're teaching you how to store a variable name so what I need to do they gave me the steps to do it right over here so I'm going to say my variable is equal to 10 and that's pretty much all I need to do here so that was very simple set the variables to the values listed in the instructions not a big deal is equal to true B is equal to false and we're done so they're talking about boolean's here boolean values are basically true and false so like they say a light switch you know boom one is on one is off oh my int whoops forgot to add that oh then want me to actually that was just an example so we got to do my n2 is equal to 7 my float equal to one point two three my bool is equals true this should be good all right you've been reassigned so here we're going to try to reassign values so initially my int was seven and then I'm going to change my into three and that's pretty much it for this one sweet okay now we get into functions and functions are fairly cool this code is poorly formatted because every time you write des right you gotta indent four spaces four or more spaces after you write that this is called a function so we wrote a function called spam and what it does is it makes x equals 12 and then it returns so since these instructions they're part of the overall function so these need to be indented right underneath the function let's go ahead and indent this and let's hit submit and this should work okay good white space means right space so in Python remember white space is very important and once again we need to indent all of these otherwise we will get errors a matter of interpretation a window in the top right corner of the page is called interpreter so basically it's that black window the little black window on top right and the interpreter runs your code line by line and checks for any errors so in this example they make a variable called katz and assign it the value 3 so we're supposed to create a variable called spam and set it to true and we're supposed to create a variable called eggs and assign it the value false ok great just to make sure the video is recording okay single line comments and comments or things that are ignored in Python and there are things that are ignored in any programming language so the point of a comment is you're telling the Machine hey don't read this ok read everything else but just don't read anything that has some special symbol next to it telling the machine that it's a comment it's meant to be only read by a human being and the computer has nothing to do with it right so if I said 5 plus 5 the computer might give me back a 10 but if I put as a comment and I did this the computer's not going to give me back anything right if I did this the computer might give me back a syntax error or something right if I if I have semicolons like this but if I did this and made it into a comment the computer is just going to ignore it that's really the point behind behind hashtags their overall comments so it says make sure write a comment on line one make sure it starts with so we can say anything we want right hi I am a very clever programmer okay cool so multiline comments the idea is that I can say stuff like hello how are you doing today five plus five is ten million pretty much I can say anything that I want and this is a multiline comment okay so we're done set count equal the basically the point of a multiline comment is you can just write multi lines and you don't have to put the hashtag over and over and over again it's also useful for documentation later on when you learn what documentation is for now since you're probably learning this language on code Academy and you're watching this video I'm assuming that you don't know what documentation is because you're most likely a beginner but if you're not that's okay too great now let's do some math so in programming languages you can do you can do a lot of math okay there's a lot of the math stuff that you can do which is fun so for example if I opened up my terminal I can I can do I can open a Python and actually let's just do regular Python if I did five plus five I did ten plus ten you know ten times twenty so on and so forth you can do you can do math operations so let's do addition Oh set the variable count to equal the sum of two big numbers okay what does it mean big numbers I don't know 100 plus 200 sure I mean I don't know how big of the numbers of the wanted but I just put some arbitrary numbers 100 and 300 fairly big exponentiation so we're going to learn about how to use the exponent in Python and most of the most of the places you'll see the exponent like this right something raised to the power of some things if I did 2 raised to the power of 2 that's 4 if I did 4 to the raise to the power of 2 that's 16 4 squared and here we're going to do a and we're going to say to a new variable called eggs and use exponent set X is equal to 100 I'm going to do it like this I'm going to say 10 squared right that gives me a hundred so this should run perfectly we got the result 100 we got the little green checkmark at the bottom so let's keep going so now let's talk about the modular operator it's basically the remainder so if you had 10 modulo 2 well what's the remainder if you did 10/2 doesn't to go perfectly into 10 so let's just make this clear and I did 10 divided by 2 I have no leftovers right it goes perfectly to tents if I did 10 modulo 2 I should have a remainder of 0 nothing is left over but if I did 11 divided by 2 well 2 doesn't go perfectly into 11 because 11 is an odd number so if I did 11 remainder of 2 what do you think I'm going to get back to goats perfectly into 10 and then there's one left over so my remainder is going to be if you have guests already it's going to be one okay so that's simply what our remainder is now let me just ask you what do you think the remainder of 99 divided by Manjula is going to be so remember 98 goes perfectly into 98 and then you have one over so you get remainder is going to be one here how about 100 modulo modulo right how about 100 modulo 3 what you get so once again 99 3 is going to go into 99 you get one left over and you're going to get a remainder of 1 so sometimes you want to get the remainder right of whatever you're doing so it's gonna it's a pretty useful operator to have at our disposal because then we can use it fairly easily so here use modulus at spam equal to 1 so once again we did 99 we did 100 modulo 3 and that's going to give us back 1 remember we tested it out so that's how we're going to make spam equal to 1 see use modulus spam equal to 1 you can use any two numbers that will ever mater want to do this cool extra view bringing it all together variables which store values for later data types such as numbers and boolean's so variables are like you know X is equal to 5 y is equal to 2 those are all your variables okay data types are in Python you'll you have you know give numbers you have strings you can have a list you can have a dictionary so once again if you don't know what a list or dictionary is just ignore this so it's not a problem don't worry about it but just remember like 5 and hello those are different kind of data types hello is a string or what if I had a true in here right remember with the word for true and false says source with the B bool ok boolean so true and false they're going to be boolean values whitespace so that's what separates the statements if I had X is equal to 5 and now I'm doing Y is equal to 4 that's separating the statement X 5 and why for you know you can't just do y equals 4 on the same line you got to give it some white space in white space just means blank and blank means something very important in Python so if you did define f of nothing and it says print hello well it's not going to work if you have if you don't have that white space before the print so in Python what white space is very very important in Lang other languages white space doesn't matter you just put squigglies around everything but comments okay comments how can I make this line a comment just add a hashtag before it okay comment my code will run until ignore it it won't give me a syntax or nothing you'll just is just going to ignore and arithmetic operations that's pretty straightforward plus minus sign subtraction addition multiplication of two numbers division exponentiation of two numbers our multiple numbers and then the module operator right the module operator that we played with so it says write a single line comment on line one I'm going to say hello YouTube audience I'm assuming that's how you're watching this video set the variable mod T equal to true and set another variable Python equal to one point two three four and set the third variable Monty Python equal to Python squared right I'm taking this Python and I'm squaring it okay cool so what is the start lesson sure let's start the lesson I mean that's what I'm here for right doing these lessons now let's apply the concepts from the previous section to a realworld example okay so now we're getting to some fun part of the code so you've finished eating a restaurant and receive this bill you'll apply the tip to the overall cost of the meal including tax first let's declare the variable meal and assign it the value of 40 for 50s so here when there's a meal and that is equal to 40 450 the reason why you always see me have spaces here is because that's writing good code that's just trying to make my code cleaner because when it's tightly compacted together like that it's hard for a human to read and it reduces the readability so this is the standard way to do this and it's accepted and it's the convention so you should practice writing good code as you're starting your careers okay so I have this meal and those are all my instructions meal tax is equal to 6.75% another way to write 6.75 is point zero six seven five and because remember 6.75% is really the same thing as six point seven five divided by 100 okay so if I run this code again it's going to work assign the tip variable on line five okay so tip set the variable tip to decimal value of 15% on line five okay so what we're going to do here so the variable tip to decimal value fifteen percent on line five okay so that's the decimal value of 15% wait that's oh ok so they're using Python 2 and here I just want to explain it really quickly so what just happened was you saw me do 15 divided by 100 and then it gave me an error and then I added that little decimal zero afterwards and then all of a sudden it says a way to go click next lesson so I'm going to explain to you why what if those work and why one of the one of them didn't work ok so if I did 15 divided by a hundred in Python 3 I'm going to get a decimal value ok but in Python 2 let me show you what happens ok so let me activate my Python 2 here so I can show you guys what happens and let's say 15 divided by 100 so notice what happened it gave me a 0 that's weird so here's what it does if I did 10 divided by 3 it's going to give me the perfect number of times 3 goes into 10 okay it's not going to give me a decimal value if I want to do that I have to make sure that I'm telling the computer that I'm passing in an integer like a float number a decimal number once I tell it that it knows to give me the exact value but otherwise it'll just tell me how many times some number goes into another number if I did once again hundred divided by three I'm going to get 33 ok I'm not going to get 33 point 3 3 3 whatever I should get if I did 100 divided by 0.3 point 0 then I will get that so what was happening here was when I did 15 divided by a hundred it was like hundred goes zero times into 15 because it's trying to give me a whole number but when I do point 0 now it says 15 divided by 100 and it gives me some small decimal value ok that decimal value will be point zero one five so here if I can show you 15/100 it's going to be 0.15 sorry I meant to 0.15 reassign in a single line okay we've got three variables we need to perform our calculation we know some arithmetic operations that can help us out so we saw in Lesson one we could suspend is equal to 7 then later change your mind and say this like a cool on line 7 assign meal to the value so meal to the value of itself plus itself times tax so pretty much like this ok so no like this okay right no no no I had it correct first all right so here I'm saying if the meal was $44 that's just $44 $44 50 Cent's and then the menial times the tax is the tax you have to pay okay so 44.50 and the tax you have to pay on that is point zero six so this is your tax this is your meal meal plus tax that's the entire amount that you have to pay for your meal okay fairly simple total assign the variable total to the sum of meal plus on line eight now you have the total cost of your meal assign the riddle total to the sum now you have the total cost of your meal I'm confused is really saying do this now I'm saying total is equal to meal plus tip maybe Oh Oh doh okay so it's basically meal plus the tip that we paid on the meal okay so the same logic implies yeah though so meal how much you paid for the meal that's your total okay so the new meal is this whole thing here so this variable here is holding your information for the meal itself and the tax that you paid on it and then this part here is calculating the tip that you paid based on your meal so that's going to be your total this takes into account the money that you paid for your meal it takes into account the tip that you paid based on your on your meal and it takes into account the tax based on your meal okay next strings and console.log I'm going to create a variable called Brian and I'm going to assign it the value hello hello life okay this is called the string string means literally I can put anything I want in there okay it's not going to throw an error it's not going to do anything it's just completely arbitrary and it's just completely madeup whatever you want to put in it that's what a string is okay when you're writing the word document in Python those would be like all it's all every single word in there is you know it's all a string that's what it is because hello life is not a variable it doesn't have any value attached to it but Brian is a variable because if you typed in Brian you would get back hello life cool let's move on so now let's practice let's get a little practice in strings so set Caesar is equal to graham Caesar is equal to Graham and pray line praline and probably sing it wrong equal to John and Viking is equal to Teresa and those are all strings okay and that's pretty much it here the string below is broken fix it using the scape backslash this isn't flying this is a falling with stop so skip backslash what that means is okay look you have you're trying to put this entire thing into a string right you want to put this entire thing with quotes around it so whether you put single quotes or double quotes it doesn't matter but what the main problem is happening here is it's a it's thinking that this apostrophe in isn't it's thinking that it's ending the ending the string so it thinks this part is a string and then it just has no idea what this whole part is right it thinks this whole part if I separated it out it thinks this whole part is just some gibberish and this part is the actual string but what we want is we want the whole thing to be a string so one solution would be I put double quotes here and I put double quotes here but that's not the answer that they want okay they want us to do something that escapes a backslash so this is what we're gonna do okay and what that means is it's saying this is an apostrophe and I don't want you to think of it as a quote okay that's all that does that's Collins you know the term Ford escaping escape backslash okay so you're escaping the quote by putting a backslash there so now the whole thing has turned into a string and that's it okay now we have the string python has six characters number zero to five as shown below all right so now let's try to get the fifth character so I'm going to do how do I get the fifth character so what do I want me to do here fifth letter goes in a blood of string mod T all right so the fifth letter is going to be n here right because that's the fifth letter here weight start cutting right so 0 1 2 3 4 5 oh I see they want us to start counting from here so 1 2 3 4 5 so oh no no I'm wrong it's still N but I just didn't put it in what what is going on so if you wanted Y you could just type this is weird how today how do they want this not sure how they want this oh oh okay I feel I feel feel a little law not good I think for here all right I'm kind of lost this is this is super oh my god they're saying Monty Monty okay Monty all right now remember the reason why so the fifth letter is really the fourth letter because we start from zero so one two three four five but in our case the word was Monty okay and that's what tripped me up so here for us the word is actually Monty so let me actually write that down here and that's that's what it is for us okay okay that's what it is for us that's how we got Monty in the fifth letter ignore the top part that's only an example I constantly was trying to use that okay let's move on string methods okay Len lower/upper string great so these are pretty cool methods you know you can use this one to get a length of a string so let's say you had something like hello my name is Rafa Kazi and I'm a programmer is going to tell you like hey the length of that string is huge that's like a lot of letters in there if you said hello right if I try to get a length so let me let me show you guys these here so if I said a Len of hello well that's five right there five letters in it now let's say I did a hello dot lower what do you think that's going to do that's just going to make Hello all lowercase let's say I had a you know a bunch of capital o whatever letters is going to make it all lower well what do you think the upper upper is going to do you're just going to do the it's going to is simply going to do the opposite of that so if we had you know a bunch of small letters and like this is going to make them all upper case okay so that's really what's going on there okay this doesn't need to be this wide come closer all right cool make sense all right and string what this does is it just converts something to a string so if I had a number like five it's going to give me back a string five okay so like let's say I did five plus five well you can do that but let's say you try to do five plus five you can't you can't add those so what it does is it just add some together just like if you said hello plus everyone okay it's just going to just going to concatenate them so what it did is it added the fives together it's not really looking at them like numbers is just looking at them like strings so it doesn't know that it's an integer type and it can add them together anymore all it can do is concatenate them and do only things that it knows how to do with strings it doesn't see these 5s any different than it sees hello and everyone so that's really what string does so if I do string of five plus string of five well what do you think you're going to get do you think you're going to get fifty five the five five or do you think you're going to get ten so think about it for a second okay I hope that you've thought about it or pause the video I'm going to hit enter you're going to get five five of course because you're taking the number five and you've been burning it to a string meaning you're forcefully putting the quotes around it all it does is put two quotes around it okay if you did string of Hello is going to say undefined variable because it doesn't know what Hello is so you have to do it on something that actually exists so like a number a floating number you can do it on but you can't really you know if you did it on the string it wouldn't make much sense so you can use this on everything but you can use it on numbers so it's helpful all right so I've basically explained to you what Len lower/upper and SD are do and now let's let's get started on line one create a variable name pair it and set it to the string Norwegian blue so I'm going to say a parrot is equal to Norwegian blue on line two I'm going to say print so right here I'm going to write lengths parent okay let me ask you and treat these like short interactive quizzes okay just pause the video and think about what the answer would be so what do you think the length of parrot is going to be I'm going to give you five seconds to pause the video and come up with an answer and then I'm going to go ahead and answer it five four three two one is going to be the length of this strength so it's going to be one two three four five six seven eight nine space 10 11 12 13 14 so it's going to return 14 let's try so we got back 14 iya right okay cool now let's let's move on now it's going to show us Ryan depth so it's showing us Ryan dot lower and that will just return Ryan so call lower on parrot after print on line 3 and editor so I'm going to say print and I'm going to refer to this string by the word by the variable parrot okay I don't have to write a Norwegian blue again I can just write parent and I can say lower and it's going to return what do you think is going to return and lower take few seconds 5 4 3 2 1 and it's going to return the region blue in all lowercase so all is going to do is change this B to a lowercase and this end to a lowercase and return that so here don't worry about the none all right call upper so upper is pretty much the same thing so I'm going to just do upper here okay cool so that's pretty simple and we got everything in uppercase you guys already have an idea about this declare and assign your variable in line five then call your method on line then on line five so I'm going to declare on line four so I'm going to say create a variable called pi is equal to three point one four and I'm going to print string pi okay and it's going to put quotes around that number that's pretty much what it's doing okay it's not showing you but in my terminal which is better I'd showed you there right it showed you there so if I ran pi is equal to three point one four and it is print string of Pi oh well just trust me guys it's supposed to have it's really it's a string so it has quotes around it okay if I showed it to you you see it has quotes around it but when you print it I forgot it just doesn't put quotes around it but in reality it has quotes around it okay so remember this is not the number 3.14 it's the string 3.14 just like a string so you if you did 3.14 plus two you're not going to get you're not going to get three point five point one for which you're going to get is something that doesn't make any sense because it says you cannot concatenate or combine a string and an integer so basically what you're doing is like Hello plus two you can't do that okay that's going to give you an error okay let's take a closer look at why you use Len string and string object but dot notation such as string dot upper for the rest so let's take a closer look down so lion roar Len line line upper okay methods that use dot notation only work with strings on the other hand Len and string can work on other data types so if you have a list of things you know if I had if I showed you a little bit of sneak peek of what's to come ahead if I had a some list okay and this list has a bunch of let's say numbers in it in increasing order X that's what that is well if I did Len of X I will get that there are eight numbers in this list okay so that's what a Len of X is going to do and string of X is just going to put quotes around okay that's all that does okay not very useful okay so on line to recall the Len function with the argument ministry so I can say Len of ministry so once again what do you think it's going to give me if you guess it is going to give me the length of this string here good job that's right line four I'm going to do ministry dot upper and that's gonna basically uppercase the whole string okay the Ministry of Silly Walks twenty seven so the length of this is twenty seven you can count it if you want okay tell python to print monty python to the console online for print and I can just do a Monty Python okay in Python three you have to always use print like this okay so just an FYI if you're if you have Python installed on Python tool you can use the print like this or the other way ordered this way okay all right this was simple enough and now we're doing more printing variables so the Machine goes is going to be our variable and we're going to sign it to the string pain all right and then I'm going to print the Machine goes okay that was pretty simple all right so now they want us to do some string concatenation so remember what I told you hello plus everyone plus say cheers okay what do you think this is going to write I think it's a hello everyone said cheers okay or so it just when you do the plus sign on strings that just concatenate in other words it just puts it together okay that's all that fancy word concatenate means if you don't want to say that's okay but just learn it because the fancy cool word is used very often but it's just saying that you're combining the string so that's what happens when you do the plus sign so here you know you probably have a good feeling what this is going to turn out to be if I did print life of brian so as a matter of fact why don't we do it right there Life of Brian okay let's give it a try print the concatenate string spam and eggs on line three so I'm going to say print and this should not okay so this might work but I'm just going to show you guys the regular way spam and eggs and
