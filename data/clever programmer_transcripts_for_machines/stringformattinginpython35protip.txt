hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer comm and today i'm coming at you with a pro tip in this video i want to show you guys the beauty of something called format and all the cool kids are using it so let's just get started here's how it works i will say something and like a quote or a string with the two quotation marks around it and i will pass in dot format and if i said five here's what it will do this squiggly brackets that you see it's using that as a placeholder and in place of that ill put in whatever i pass to the format method so if I pass in five you'll say hello world five if I pass in ten it'll pass in ten so a cool example of this would be if I wanted to do count from one to ten and I wanted to say the word count and then I wanted to say one after it so for example I wanted something to look like this and then in the next one to look like this well whoops I'm sorry to look like this okay so I can do that very easily I can write a for loop that starts from one and let's say it goes all the way up to eleven it goes up to but not including eleven however it does start from one which means it'll print one and it will go up to ten but not 11 all right let's hit this guy here and I will say print I or I'm sorry print count because that's something I want to show and I want to put that right there the squiggly brackets and I can say doc format hmm and from that I can put I because that's our variable we're incrementing by and I'm gonna hit enter a few times and you can see count one count to count three count four count five all up to ten how beautiful does that look pretty damn beautiful how can you use it well if you're making a game like battleships or something else you can use this to format your code instead of those % placeholders or instead of doing something like hello world plus one and then you realize it gives you an error because you can't combine a number with the string so you got a pass STR around it which is again something that's ugly then you're like oh it's still not formatted correctly so you got to put this space after it and it's it's a whole mess instead use the format way look at how gorgeous that is first of all look at that and it just works right I don't know where I got those syntax or front but it works that's it for this video I'll see you guys in the next video
