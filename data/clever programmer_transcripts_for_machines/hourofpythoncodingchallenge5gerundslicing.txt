hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer common this video we're going to be doing the gerund slicing challenge hopefully I'm pronouncing the word right I didn't learn grammar in United States learn it back home anyways we have done the reverse slicing challenge so our word zebra index challenges switchcase challenge uppercase challenge lowercase challenge if you haven't done it already go check out those videos from before and if you want to do this challenge is live you can do it right below this video on my website the coding thing is right there if you're on youtube there's a link in the description what you feel free to watch it right where you are okay so let's get this thing let's get this show on the road gerund infinitive so basically what this challenge says for you to do is if I gave you something like building anything that ends with an egg right I can't think of any examples end with an Inc well anything that ends with an an egg what we do is we return it as like for example if I give you building you return to build right if I gave you billing you give me back to Bill okay oh yeah here's another one singing if I gave you singing you give me back to saying if I give you dancing giving back to dance oh well that's actually a little complicated we'll keep it simple but for so for Bill you should be able to do that and for building you should be able to give me the right thing alright so let's jump into that and if I give you something that's not adjourned infinitive then just give me back that's not a gerund okay something that's not a gerund just say you know that's not a German so this literally the string on line 8 is what you should give me back okay so let's get into this so how would you do it take a stab at it actively code this up try comment your solution below otherwise I'm going to solve this and I'm doing this live you guys are going to hear my thinking process okay all right so if I get a string and the last three letters of it are ing how would I do it I would say here's how I would do it this I'm thinking of the simplest way to do it so I would slice it can I slice it from negative three all the way to the end I think that's possible let's go and check it out so what I do is I open up my command line and then I try things in here as well so let's try it let's get hello and I'll try to index it like this and it works right from negative three all the way to the end and what if it was something like this it still works so great so I'll say go from negative three all the way to the end and if it's equal to ing right then what we do is we return that string we return to plus let's put a little space here right accounting for this space and we say string from can we do from start up until negative three that way this negative three isn't included in there it's kind of weird I think that should work so what I would do is I open up my terminal if you're on Windows open up your idle if you're on iMac if you don't have idle which it just means you have an installed Python so install Python first of all or just coat it in the thing below and hit that play button right this play button and then it should work for you now let's go back here and let's try this thing here right so I'm going to paste it and I'm going to replace the as with building see what it gives me what's here oh yeah to build okay that actually looks like it works I was surprisingly good how I was able to solve it and you'll be able to say that too when you can solve these coding challenges that's the bonus all right so I have to build and if it's not something that ends with ing right so we can say else we will say I'm too lazy to type so I'll copy this guy from here and I'll paste it and just wrap it because it's a string and this should work let's give it a try okay building we got to build for build we got that's not a gerund all right hopefully that was insightful and awesome for you guys to watch and do it live with me I know a lot of you watching got tripped up on that and that's okay it just means you need to practice think about a little bit more and what I would do follows you when I can't solve something I try to forget about the solution right I come back to it a day later and try to just do it from scratch but not just by like randomly putting in random things in the code I'll take a piece of paper and step through everything and see if I can truly understand and gain a deep understanding of what it was handwaving is singlehandedly the most disruptive thing you can do to your improving your coding skills and by handwaving I mean it's like oh that's just simple I got it I got it of course after you see the solution it's so simple it makes sense remember high insight is 20/20 but when you try to code it right ah completely from scratch and from a blank canvas it's going to be more difficult and that's generally how you start off coding anything any even big project right you start off from a blank canvas so that's why it's good to practice like come back to it a day later don't hand wave and just go oh I got it I got it if you messed it up go back to the drawing board come back a day later and try to do it from scratch okay all right guys that's it for this video thank you so much for watching I love your guys faces off and as always I'll see you in the next video
