hi how are you doing hopefully you had some time to go through my videos either on YouTube or some of my videos at clever programmer comm so you have a sense of how everything is working and hopefully you were able to go through it and learn new things ok that's my ultimate goal now believe it or not there are going to be times where you are going to get stuck all right you're gonna be pulling your hair out and you're gonna be looking at a wall just reflecting on your life decisions and the code and its errors are going to be staring back at you making you think why are you programming still but do not let that deter you please alright that's actually one of the most fun parts of coding but sometimes I understand it can get frustrating when you hit that roadblock and there are times when it's actually completely useless to try to work around it it's spent months learning something that was maybe just a small thing that somebody could have told you okay so what I want you guys to do is if you are stuck and can't get out of it try to find yourself a mentor alright so there is a website you can go to called meetup.com and you can network with other people who are likeminded they could be one step ahead of you two steps ahead of you doesn't matter they could be a professional programmer wherever they are if they can help you that's great or if you guys can make a group and help each other study that is probably the best thing that you can do but if that's something you're having trouble finding and you need a more immediate solution you guys can book a session with me so in our session we will go over whatever your problem is or if you want more general help let's say you want specific and specialized curriculum for yourself that's something we can do as well a few things that you are going to get during the session if that's something that you choose to do you are going to get free downloadable PDF as soon as you book the session so that's going to actually teach you a lot of things and also help prepare you for your first lesson also when we are recording our lesson we will be able to take control of each other's screens so I will be able to code on your screen if you are stuck at a certain point we will be able to share screens and we will be able to record the session so after the session is over I can send you the session and if I want maybe to fast during the lecture with you well you can go through it at your own pace at this point you can either go to meetup.com or try to find a mentor in your local place or you can book a live session with me you can click some link below or around my face and I can help you get through your problem if there is any reason you're unsatisfied or the lesson wasn't helpful or you're just like this guy's boring well I can just refund you okay that is not going to be a problem I want to make sure that you are learning from this and that's the ultimate goal that's it for this video and I'll see you in the neck
