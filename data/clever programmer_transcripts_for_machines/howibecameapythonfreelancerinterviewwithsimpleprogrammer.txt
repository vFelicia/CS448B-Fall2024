hey this is Kazi from clever programmer today I have a very special announcement for you and you don't want to miss this video I have joined teams with simple programmer John somnus and we put together a video for you that is going to give you massive amounts of value but more importantly I have a masterclass for you that is going to teach you how to go from zero to actually becoming a sixfigure developer this is a brand new 2019 fresh master class that we've put together for you it's a threepart training series John and I are gonna be actually talking and having a interview that is going to be giving you lots of value and giving you insights on why you should actually become a Python developer why Python at all maybe you're a csharp developer what's the benefit of becoming a freelancer what's the best language to learn what is the most popular language and the most growing especially as we head into you know 2020 and all the way to 2030 things are going to a I and lots of programming what are the job opportunities that exist and we cover all of that and much more so I think you're really gonna enjoy this video just sit back relax and let's roll the video and I wanted to tell you about a very special opportunity that I have today I've got a good friend of mine Kazi from clever programmer and he's putting on a special class a Python master class that it's really interesting and I wanted to just take a moment you guys thanks for checking this out it's gonna be totally worth your time I gotta tell you right now though you know turn off all of your cell phones er your notifications distractions all that stuff because you're gonna want to really pay attention and stay to the end of this video because we've got some really valuable information here especially if you've ever wanted to become a Python developer if you've wanted to do freelancing work become a freelancer you know get out on your own and make a living for yourself without working for someone else or even if you just want to make some money on the side you know there's there's some huge earning potentials up to making like 300 bucks an hour as a freelance a Python developer and I've got the expert here Kazi who's done it all whose coach people doing this so so welcome Kazi hey thanks for having me John so so Kazi what what's what's going on man I wanted to I wanted to you know really when you're telling me about this I was I was pretty excited and I wanted to let everyone know about this but um you know I gotta ask you like you know I'm a csharp developer so why should why should people become Python developers I like csharp what's what's the why is it Python getting so damn popular right now absolutely man so python is the the feud there are a few amazing things that I love about Python and that are just true about Python in general so for example it's one of the easiest programming languages it's one of the fastestgrowing programming languages so even as data science is growing and data analytics is growing by 2012 believe by 2030 forbes has predicted that you know 800 million jobs are gonna be given to AI so for example even lift right now has selfdriving cars pretty soon uber is gonna have them and a lot of that is run off of Python even recently early detected a black hole and took a picture of it that was done with pythons you know and Netflix just released an article a few days ago where they shared that every film every movie that you actually watch is being powered by Python in the backend so you know things like Instagram are built off of it YouTube is built off of it so it has so much potential and it's only growing so and that is why I prefer and just recommend wholeheartedly going Python okay okay some pretty good arguments and I guess that's you know it's interesting I see all that like the artificial intelligence stuff seems to be in Python like image recognition like pie image and all that stuff is so it makes a lot of sense that you know it seems like a lot of the really the AI and machine learning in all of his his Python and that's that's where we're going in the future but well what about free beginner see that's the thing is like you know if someone's getting started in software development is is Python the easy is it an easy language for them to learn yeah so perfect python is at one of the easiest programming languages to learn and if you look at all the universities right and you actually look at their statistics and data all of them are switching over from Java or any other programming language to Python so okay so you'll see like all these universities switching over to Python primarily because of how simple it is but it's not but you can't think it's so simple it's not that it's not powerful you know its deceptively simple but it's still powerful so people from again like Instagram to NASA scientists are using Python you know on their day to day base so if you're a complete beginner that's perfect you'll be able to pick it up really quickly and then the great thing about it is as a developer it allows you to be maximally productive so then actually you can just go on to get freelancing clients build projects as fast as possible and it lets you use all of the you know its batteries included so to speak so it lets you leverage all of its libraries and tools to build realworld projects really really fast that way you earn your income your client gets your results both parties are happy okay okay I see okay so that makes sense I mean if it's something that's easy to learn and then it has a very high potential you know down the road then it's a good path to be on especially now no what about freelancing right because I know this is one of the things that you're really gonna cover in this masterclass it's not just you know it's not just about learning to become a Python developer but it's also about you know becoming a freelancer and making money freelancing what you know why freelancing why not just get the regular job yep so that's a great question for me honestly it was I wanted to become a remote developer I wanted to do freelancing because I had to be when I was growing up and I used to live with my mom so I wanted to be able to be near my mom and help her a lot because she was oftentimes sick or my dad wouldn't be there and he was in Afghanistan you know as a military and he was doing translation so for me it was really important to be able to do something where I could be near my family and still earn an income and not be bounded by anything then I came to discover that there are a lot of other benefits like being able to work on my own hours right exactly yeah and be able to work with the type of clients that I actually enjoy working with and not necessarily have one boss I remember I read your book many years ago as the soft skills and you had you talked about this one concept which is which sticks to me till this day which is if you should look at a job like it's just one client right yeah exactly yeah it's one big client but it's still one client so your business in a sense is really weak if you look at yourself like a business so if you actually go to the freelancing route where you start to have multiple clients now you have a really really strong business you have freedom to choose your own hours you have freedom to choose who you work with you can travel and most importantly be around the people that you love so that's why I am such a big proponent of freelancing okay okay yeah yeah I agree with all of that you know I did freelancing for a while and you know I mean I was eventually able to build like $300 an hour as a freelancer and I thought that was just it was insane I couldn't believe that that was possible and I was working these regular jobs for such a long time but now I had this freedom and the heck I could work like if I wanted to twenty hours a week and make more money than then I was making when I was making working 40 hours a week yes yes so guys also I want to let you know like Kazi mentioned soft skills it's kind of interesting we have we just met up in LA for the first time about about a couple weeks ago and it was kind of cool to like see his story if you guys have been fall if not you know you should definitely check out his his stuff on clever programmer but he was telling me about how he first read soft skills and how that kind of really launched him in this direction and he's build up this awesome Empire you know a huge YouTube channel the awesome courses like doing everything right and building this business and like so it's just an example you know of what what can what can happen and so that's why that's why I also guy said I'm you know it's not just that that I'm that I'm trying to get you to sign up for this masterclass right because I think there's a huge benefit in it but also the thing is like this is someone that I trust right Kazi because he's implemented what I wrote in soft skills and he's made it work so he's actually taking the action and done that so I think he's just a great example of someone to to listen to and follow because he's actually done the steps right he's not just you know it's sometimes I think you guys think oh well you know some like John is just an outlier and it's you know anyone can do this if they're willing to take those steps so right there you go yeah I hundred percent agree I think ultimately it comes down to choices I think it's just as hard and just as equally easy working McDonald's versus charging 300 dollars as a Python consultant I think it's just as easy to work a minimumwage job as it is to even start your own business so ultimately it comes down to what choices do you like what choices do you make right that's what defines your path in your direction like for example I could just pick up a can of soda and drink it right now or just as easily I could pick up water and drink it right in that time they're both really easy and like you know you and I were sitting in a lane you were like always think five years ahead if you think five years ahead where do you need to invest your time to get the maximum return and oftentimes it's actually not in doing the easy things it's right sometimes doing you know going after the harder thing so you know if you choose to go down this route of trying to become a freelancer sometimes initially it seems harder because oh man the job one client and I'm making decay 60 K maybe more but with freelance saying that might not be happening right in the start but if you actually decide to do this and I think the right way to do it is don't quit your job if your Avella per first replace your income like first either start generating side income or replace your income and now you have the choice to quit your job but and the end what you'll have is freedom and I think that is what's truly priceless right and even if someone didn't want to like you know if someone's listening in there they're happy they like their developer job right but maybe they want to make some extra income on the side or maybe they just want to work on projects that are fun right that was one of the things like I think that pulled me into doing some freelancing is like yeah I like the corporate job and stuff but I want to work with this new cool technology right in fact I think one of the first freelancing things I did was I really like creating automation frameworks and doing iOS development and I couldn't really do that my job so you know that it's a good way to make some extra income and then you can kind of decide maybe you're making it not so much income from the freelancing which is what happened to me that you quit your job and then you just do that full time so maybe you don't even have it planned but hey you know keep making enough money to cover your mortgage every month that's it's like living for free that's right that's a great way to look at it you can yeah if you cover your expenses or your mortgage or your rent I think that is a great thing to be able to do with it too because then everything you make from your job is essentially close to pure profit cool cool okay well yeah we should talk a little bit about what's what's gonna be in the master class oh by the way guys I did want to tell you I just remembered when we went up to LA this guy Kazi he's he's a power lifter so you know not only is he you know super smart developer and and can teach you everything about freelancing but he lives life he lives the simple programmer he can also kick your ass you know I talk about lifestyle of not being the typical nerd I know a lot of you you follow me because that's that's you and you know Kazi Kazi is one of us so but let's talk about the master class so so why should people sign up for this what are you gonna give them in right you know I know so my god I don't really need to learn Python or I'm not sure if I wanna be a freelance developer but why should they you know just like stick around and just at least check out this master class so many reasons so many reasons first of all this class is just epic like it's just so entertaining to watch but more importantly if we look at the really valuable stuff that you get out of it is that it shows you your Python earning potential so even if you are just mildly curious about this right going into it and really knowing what type of realistically what type of earning potential you could have based on the number of clients based on a certain number of hours and I even give you a downloadable worksheet essentially which is plug and play so you can get your own sheet and see how much you're earning income potential is at which point you could look at it and go I think I want to pursue this or you could go I don't think I want to pursue this okay okay so definitely they should at least like in fact right now if you're watching go sign up now you can finish watching the video after you sign up but otherwise you're not gonna get this calculator and yeah you should definitely at least find that out right even if you don't watch anything else at least if you know what your potential is you owe that to yourself otherwise you're just you're just closing a door that's that's right and the most important thing I want to say about this entire masterclass it really paves the way and makes it super clear for you how to go from zero to becoming a sixfigure developer now if you're already halfway there then the concepts are gonna be even easier for you to understand right it really creates a clear stepbystep roadmap and we give you a calculator that you can take away we give you a downloadable roadmap that is gonna be essentially yours and we give you a downloadable portfolio so worst case scenario you leave with the portfolio that can potentially help you land jobs this is a tested and proven portfolio you get a road map that you can use so even if you just come out of curiosity to download these things I believe that you're still gonna find a lot of value in this right exactly and this master Gus is totally free right oh yeah it's totally free that's right okay so yeah there's really no reason to not not check this out so so yeah so guys definitely you know click sign up make sure before you miss this opportunity because I don't know if this is gonna be offered again and I know there's some huge value here so what else what other kind of surprises the bonus you said it's entertaining was it entertaining so it's I mean it's shot

twenty thousand dollar contract that I don't know is okay actually share with you the invoice I shared with you the exact first project I built to make my twenty thousand dollars I share with you how I charged one of my clients how I went from fifty dollars two hundred dollars an hour nice right so those are all really tangible things that you get out of watching this because I don't think a lot of people are sharing that I don't think a lot of people are sharing specifically the project that they built and specifically how much they got paid I also shared with you how you know within my first year I actually went from zero to making a hundred and four thousand dollars a year as a Python freelancer like complete beginner just actually started learning programming and I skipped a lot of steps because I had lots of mentors mmhm and that's essentially what we want to be able to help you do as well like just give you all the tools so then it takes it takes away months and hopefully you know maybe even multiple months off your timeline to actually get to where you want to go awesome okay well awesome I'm I'm so let's do it awesome alright guys so make sure you sign up like I said you know this isn't going to be available for very much longer so you want to get while you can you know and and check it out it's a free class free my you know master class on Python you're gonna learn you know how how to become a freelance developer how to get started learning Python the the roadmap you know the calculator and in a lot of lot in the portfolio the valuable portfolio so go sign up right now and and we'll see you inside awesome love to see you inside guys please sign up and I'm really excited thanks for having me John yeah what would it mean for you if you made your first $1,000 from coding what would it mean for you if I reveal to you my step by step system that I use to go from being completely broke to then learning how to code in just a few months landing my contract as a freelancer with Python and being able to make twenty thousand dollars while I was a terrible Oakland Community College student and to then being able to live the lifestyle I want on my own terms and have the ability to have my own time freedom money and have the ability to make an impact on the world and at the same time travel with my friends be there for my family you know when we hit 300,000 subscribers go to all these events even now I'm in Miami 10x growth pawn with Grant Cardone how does that lifestyle come about as a Python developer I was able to create that lifestyle for myself and in this video I want to show you that how you can do that for yourself take students like for example John Navarro who went from working with me from complete zero to becoming a senior data scientists or nazar Molly who landed a hundred and thirty thousand dollar contract and now he has moved to Germany with his family and living an amazing life or a furry a sheikh who was able to make twenty thousand dollars after she took one of our programs I've put together incredible training for you they'll help you become a sixfigure developer so you can earn the income you want you can have the time money and the freedom and the impact that you want to have in this world the link is below click on the link they'll take you to the training just put in your email I'll send you this masterclass it's threepart series it'll absolutely blow your mind completely free go there do it now and I'll see you on the other side
