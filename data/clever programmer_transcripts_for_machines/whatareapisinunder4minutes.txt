what is an api that is the question check this out today we are going to use our amazing people right here to explain exactly what is an api so let's think about this we got this guy right here okay this is the website okay this is the website where you see so if i am the user and i go ahead and i go to this website which is this camera here that's some guy by the way right so what i like to do is let's say i need to go ahead and i'm like hey bro i would like to order i'd like to order some food okay right i like to order some food so this he's the website so what happens here is he is the front end and that's what i see and he says okay tell me what my what is on the menu what is on the menu what no tell me what is that we got pizza we got hamburgers we got hot dogs beautiful beautiful okay listen so here's what here's what i like i'm the user okay what what i would like is i would like to order some pizza okay so you write this down write this down now check this out okay listen closely listen closely i got this other guy right here right here okay like this other guy this guy is the server okay this guy is actually the api we call it the backhand okay so what happens here now at this point is this is where he now he is the chef this guy is a chef he's going to make the food that i just ordered as the user right so if you think about it yeah keep making the food keep making the food yeah you know come on do your stuff right so at this point he's making the food but he's not making anyone just yet what needs to happen at this point check this out website server api all right there's some kind of middleware that needs to happen or connect communication between the two of them needs to happen in order in order for this for this to actually work so the question becomes what is that connection well the connection is actually something called an api request if you think about an ap api request it's simply just when a website literally calls out to the api and asks hey i would like this resource in this case here's what i would like to do i would like you to yell out hey i need a pizza hey i need a pizza great so here's what you do you just heard that you needed pizza okay what are you gonna do at this point pizza got it okay beautiful he's making the pizza he's now he's doing his thing you know come on look let's go he's doing his thing good good good good good he's gonna sting one minute in okay he made the pizza okay what do you do now you give the pizza back to the to him now right pizza yeah so throw it nice there you go now you got the pizza now i'm the user i just asked for the pizza what do you do now here's your pizza thank you i eat the pizza and now i got the pizza so you see this whole process my friends is called the full stack development he is an api he right here is the front end the website okay and they and they go ahead and talk to each other to make everything in the world wide web work but it's a very important rule this guy is one of the most important people that you don't see he's one of the most important things this is what happens on the back end so now for example let me give you an example let's say you log into facebook okay you log in you put in your personal information your username and password then it provides to you what it provides to you all your information about your photos your news feed well think about like this way where did you get all of that information where is that being stored well that is being stored on something that you don't know it's being stored on the back end right the logic right here right this is the back end he has all the information about you the photos okay all the logic needs to happen in terms of like how do you how do i log you in right he will log you in he will know what is the username password that you provided and what person you actually are so that is the api so my friends just think about that this way very simple api right here website front right here they both talk together to make everything work and that is an api hopefully understood that i'll see you guys later
