hey how's it going this is kazy from clever program.com and in this video we're going to be tackling the apples and oranges challenge so let's get into it now hopefully you finished all your string challenges and your dictionary challenges and you are all caught up to do some amazing new challenges like the type challenges there's only one challenge in here so I don't know why they pluralized it it's their fault but this challenge is about types and types in Python lets you check what type is something so for example if you picked up an apple you'd be like hey this is a fruit and if you picked up uh I don't know something else like a carrot you'll be like hey this is a vegetable okay so as a human we know what types are but in programming there are different types as well and they're important to know because you can then use it to create really cool stuff all right so here we're going to learn to go through types and detect them okay so let's go through that now you have types like string which you can see over here right um and if you call this type function on a string anything that's within quotes oh I can just type it in here so if I say hello and we want to see what type this is you already know it's a string but don't take my word for it type in the type function and it'll tell you exactly what type it is and look at that it says it's a string now here what we're doing is we're saying hey check if type one type one should give you back an integer so for example one is an integer right so if you type that in you'll get back a class integer or type integer so basically we're asking here hey is type of one the same as a type of this thing in quotes and we find out that's false because type one um here we got false type one is an integer class and this one is a string class so a string class is not the same thing as an integer class just like an apple is not the same thing as a banana or an orange right same idea here all right let's see what the heck they want us to do so they say make a function that returns apples if given a string oranges if given an integer and bananas if given anything else okay very simple they're saying hey if you give me something like a hello or something that a human would say uh you know using a string anything in quotes you should return apples if you detect the human saying something if you see an integer like a number then say oranges otherwise say something else all right cool that is not too bad so basically we'll say that if um type of thing whatever the user typed in is equal equal to type of uh an integer right um I wonder if we can say int here we probably can let's try it let's try it type of one equal equal int boom we can okay so if whatever the user typed in if the type of that is uh is the same type as int then what we can say is return oranges oranges like that okay this is going to be else if and then uh here what we're going to say is if the type of thing is a string then I want you to return apples right so I have to write return statement here and then I'll say otherwise just return the thing so this would work fine but just to be extra clear I'll write an else statement I'll say return bananas like that okay so we have what have we done here we've distilled English into code okay we've turned an idea into reality right we uh executed it so that's what coding allows you to do that's the power of it and that's why it's so important to do these coding challenges because literally that's what coding is going to be in your head like you have an idea right that you came up with and the idea you came up with is in English like I want to make a gaming app that stores uh each user's account information it it stores how much gold they have it stores uh what item they use uh it Stores um how many characters they've purchased already right so that's an idea that you have had in English or whatever language right and and then coding you have to take that whatever you said in your own language and break it down into something that the computer can can understand so then you can scale it to the whole world okay so that's what it comes down to that's why I emphasize these challenges so much cuz this is literally how you'll improve your skills and it teaches you the real world skills to go get a job and to even uh be useful and be a functional and badass developer okay so let's continue rolling here and let's see if we're right right I had this whole speech and I swear to God if I hit play right now and I'm wrong I'm going to look like an idiot so let's let's hit play and let's see what happens okay all right boom I typed in the number four and I got back oranges so it looks like it's correct uh if you so basically if you give the function fruit label labeler uh integer it should give you back oranges well what happens if I give it a string like hello it should give me back apples and it does and what happens if I give it uh something that's not an integer or a string can you come up with an example of something that's not an integer or a string okay if you haven't come up with an example pause try to come up with one if you can't continue and an example would be a float number so a float number mean like a decimal number like 4.5 that's not an integer or a string so let's hit the play button and indeed we get bananas that's exactly how they wanted us to do this challenge right okay so that's it for this challenge hopefully you learned hopefully you had a blast and if you're on my website or you click the link below put it in the comments if you're on YouTube put it in the comments I don't care if you had the wrong solution or the right solution if you had the wrong solution you know the drill come back the next day or come back a few hours later and try to do it yourself from scratch because without doing you can't become a better coder if you're just reading and watching tutorials you won't become better you have to practice it and try it yourself even though a lot of the times it feels like it's unproductive you're blankminded and you're just looking at a screen and you're like this is not productive but believe it or not it is productive and it's actually a NE Neary thing to do to improve okay that's it for this video guys thank you so much for watching this concludes the hour of python series I hope that you had a lot of fun you enjoyed this sign up for my new course called create apps with python because that will take all these skills that you culminated Within These weeks doing these challenges and it'll put them to use by building apps with the python skills that you're learning here and that you honed here okay so we're going to take your skills and your ideas and turn them into reality into apps okay so that's it thank you guys so much for watching and as always I'll see you in the next video
