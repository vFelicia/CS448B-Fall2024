wonderful how are you guys doing well you guys by you we're doing we're do we're we're doing amazing hope you guys are doing great let's get really honestly we're going to jump straight into it because i do not want to waste time at all i seriously just want to i know i don't miss time at all we're literally just going to jump in straight into reviewing these resumes and talking about and you know so if you submit a resume actually before we're going to look into those for you and we'll tell you how to fix them we'll go deep down on how to fix them that's what you're here to do because we want to get you that review or that that interview with that job we want to get you that job opportunity and that's what we are here to do isn't that right daniel that is exactly right so guys if you've seen this before we're quickly going to go through the slides we've always talked about nazis dancing i know what he's doing but if you haven't we're going to give you that quick background as to why we're talking about resumes and what you can do to start to build your resume and then boom we'll get into the awesome reviews so let's do it now exactly really quickly i like i said we're gonna jump you probably a lot of you guys have potentially just have seen all this at this point you know so like we're not going to touch base too much on this but all i will tell you is the fact that you know how to build your resume really quickly we're gonna really fly through this okay we're going to fly through this like fly fly like fly to the to the moon i'm proud of myself so how to build your resume you know and how to land those jobs 10 times faster right where have we had interviewed right you know daniel where have you ever interviewed right man to be honest right out of college i only applied to three different places which are blue origin google and microsoft and because of my awesome resume i was able to land an interview and actually because of the interviewing skills i was able to land the job so what we're going to try to teach you at least for my site is offer my perspective my advice to be able to get you those awesome resumes you could start to build that will then allow you to then land the amazing interviews and then all these other awesome yeah all these other companies that you're going to see right here this is obviously not because nod knows exactly what he's doing he did a lot of work as a freelancer and he got to work with a lot of companies so he got to interview at twitter palantir squarespace and microsoft as well so i'm not i just let them know why all these companies are here basically we've gone through the interview processes of all these different companies and it was our resumes that allowed us to get into that step at least yes exactly all these resumes right we were able i was able to get interviews with companies like square you know squarespace volunteer twitter you know google as well and then you know same thing something here same same thing here with with daniel and what we did is we what was interesting is our resumes were reviewed by amazing people you know you know we learned we learned from from other people right you know other people that were already working exactly like those companies they were working at those companies that is why we are here to transfer that knowledge to you okay to you exactly so let's go ahead and get started let's go next up why building a strong resume is important most companies don't even go ahead oh i'm just gonna say it's important because i mean how else do they know who you are right it's like no one knows who you are in this world especially if you're trying to get a job unless you have some sort of paper maybe that's only one page long that summarizes what you've done specifically so go ahead and get into what you're gonna do yeah yeah yeah of course you need to stand out from the crowd that's number one right because you have hundreds of thousands of developers applying every single day so how do you stand out the crowd how do you as that you know the particular person who has got all that knowledge and has got all the experience how do you do that how do you stand out and so that is why you got to send out with at least something like your resume your projects of course and of course of course your resume correct so that's what we're here to teach you how to stand how do you stand out so of course the first thing you need to talk about or you need to know is the sections on you know that you need to have in your resume very important daniel because i want to just notice this how many pages does a resume need to have um i don't know nas this is a really tough one come on girl come on bro you got this come on you got this come on come on come on you got this i think it's one i think it's the one let's go so guys you need to have you need you need one page only honestly please because i i receive all these resumes from you guys and it's like 10 pages okay no please keep it to one that is all you need all right that is all my friends that you need so also awesome so let's keep going so the sections okay some what let's go ahead and go through some of the sections that you need tell me uh here uh daniel perfect perfect so honestly depending on what experience you have you're going to want to highlight different ones right so as you can see these different sections to be honest if you don't have work experience being a developer before then that's not what you want to highlight instead you're going to want to highlight potentially your projects or your awards that you've shown you've been able to build something something of value that you actually develop sort of software and it's applicable to the job but it's still important to have these different sections so that when someone looks at your resume they could easily find what they're looking for oh salman salman someone just donated thank you so much canadian five dollar super chat if you guys are interested i create a react js modern looking resume and portfolio project hope it helps everyone of course if you go ahead and put a link somewhere down below or something like where or link to your video series go ahead put it down below we'll love we'll love to shout you out i would love to show you out and here let me go ahead and actually add him to the broadcast so you can see yep and and this is this is the beautiful thing about the clever programmer community man i mean if you're here to add value we will more than happily put you in front of everyone because you're gonna add value so like you made a video series man that is completely awesome i want to take advantage of that go ahead go through series probably awesome yeah so put your link down below and then i think we should be all good awesome so thanks so much salman let's go ahead and keep going we'll give you an edge here all all right all right bro all right all right so cool let's go ahead and keep going next up so you got awards you got next time of course you need to have those projects okay those are probably one of the most most important things you need to have right why projects specifically because why oh you're asking you're asking i'm asking why projects i'm testing you bro that's oh man this this quiz is hard guys it's hard projects is probably where you can actually highlight specific skill sets that you've been able to develop because you build something for a job right so if you're applying for web frontend developer using react you could show them a portfolio of specific react projects you've built and that shows them like you don't even have to tell them but that literally shows them the skill set that you have now if you know how to translate that and tell them through the resume that's even more bonus points exactly exactly because the thing is you know what you need to understand is the fact that what you need to understand is it's pretty simple like you know you can say that you worked at this company or you can say that you work at this company but at the end of the day what you understand is your projects is what back up your skills it's as simple as that your projects back up your skills period okay period and so you have to get those straight guys if you don't have projects build projects if you do have projects put them on github so really important right i want to say you know is you know put them you know have make sure you have them on github as well make sure if you have a project that's live live project as well so basically the actual link to the live project that would be amazing as well okay so put them on github put it as a live project and that's it that's all you need okay so awesome so what we've done through the projects and we'll tell you how to specifically you know how to format them we'll talk about that here in a second but let's go continue on so work experience let's go next one work experience work experience so guys if you've done work experience in the software realm then you definitely want to highlight it now if you really haven't you might still be able to pick up potentially other skills that you've been able to get from those jobs that might apply for example i don't know maybe if you were a manager at mcdonald's you can maybe highlight that as a manager you were able to work with people lead a team but it's going to be very limited because what you do want to have the majority of the section be the actual technical stuff that you've worked on so if it is applicable make sure you make sure to add it and find that angle that which you can make it work for you exactly beautiful of course an education if you have education if you do not have education that's completely okay i just want to let you know guys that is completely okay you know but if you do have it you know put it on there and you you should be great um and then oh dang someone just donate again i can't put the links on the chat but if you search up my name on react.js resume dang someone you're just killing it of course those ten dollars are going to return oh yeah a lot more for you brother because you're providing value if you provide value the money just comes it's crazy even as a developer you can provide value to a business the money just comes with the big salary with the big paycheck exactly so thank you so much salman all right let's go ahead and continue on and of course if you have a reference a reference what is a reference a reference is someone seriously that pretty much references a person that can you know that can go ahead and support you so for example they will call that reference for example maybe it's someone you worked with before or someone you know they will actually call their reference and ask hey you know how is it to work with this person so make sure it's someone that you trust and they can say actually a good thing instead of saying do not put down someone who hates you i think that's a really important part yeah and i guess another tip is if you don't have someone on top of mind or you kind of want to see how they're feeling about it you could also just say you know willing to provide reference or something like that right if you don't have someone's contact information right off the bat that's another option you can do exactly exactly cool so go ahead and continue on so next things how to build how to mistake how to build mistakes so mistakes we know which one nas is really passionate about it's pretty obvious i know it's i know it's pretty simple the one i'm just really passionate about because i'm just it gets me so pissed guys it's like please do not make it more than one page and make it you know only one page do not make it three four pages two pages no recruiter has the time to go through that okay so just that's the one main thing to understand no recruiter has the time to go through that okay exactly and the second thing you want to avoid all right is there there's a fine line between being so fancy that it's so distracting and you're not highlighting the important stuff and also being so simplistic that you're not highlighting anything that everything just looks blah like no throw up on paper so you just want to find that line that's just very simple and it highlights the things that you wanted to hide so let's get jump straight into we've got we've talked a little bit about the resumes what you should and shouldn't do are you ready for those resume reviews let's go let's go bro let's go so really simple here really simple here we're going to go through your resumes there are right here someone says some of uh obviously just became your 500 subscriber nice nice nice nice somebody john john asks can you use your instructor for reference yes you can yes you can make ask him ask him if like ask him hey can i use you for reference and just let him know that's it okay that's it uh all right cool so let's go ahead and continue on so i have a lot of resumes as you can see here right that people have submitted and there's a lot of for us to go through and the question is like what do you want to go through so what do you think huh um but i was responding over here you're asking what do we want to do let's uh i guess we didn't prescreen them so it's it's kind of like a lottery lottery thing i guess i kind of kind of want to go through this one all right let's do it i'm gonna minimize your screen so i can maximize this yeah let's go through this one yes oh and guys don't take any offense to this yes this is us just letting you know our thoughts what we would do if we laugh don't take any offense right we're just trying to have a good time here right because we're gonna laugh because we're gonna laugh and that's fine we laughed at our own like if i pulled up my very first resume i would have pointed at myself and laughed so hard and the dude probably would have peed his pants from all the laughing that was being done to him right so don't take any offense and he literally literally stands we love you guys so take this with you know uh uh an open an open mind exactly exactly i would say so so okay let's look at this so it looks like d show right here so let's take a look at your resume okay really quickly here right off the bat oh right here so i didn't show them the the screen just yet so there we go now you guys see it so right off the bat what do we what are we seeing here what do you think okay um so first thing for me i at least from the experience i've had pictures don't really work right because what that allows them to do is that allows them to already i guess i don't know was it prejudge you before they even start looking at anything just because of how you look so even if you look professional there's already some i guess uh what are those called uh so because of the whole black lives matter there's a lot of researchers that start looking into like i guess pre uh things that you already judge of just because of like for example their their skin color or their background or ethnicity or whatever that may be so me personally i've never seen pictures i don't know what's your take on that no i haven't heard your take on that before yeah i would say i'll say as well pictures are not necessary that's not why you you know you put this on your resume so say remove your pictures honestly you know that's that's the main thing right so um they know how you look like they don't you things like that you shouldn't put on your resume that that's just as simple as that okay um second thing that pops out to me we talked about not being too fancy yeah i feel like maybe this show is trying to be a little fancy with that background and it's too distracting it's hard to read yeah the actual letters because it's just like these so remove the background remove the background very important so guys make sure make sure to remove the background guys and you got a lot of you guys are talking about the content guys we told people that you know go ahead and remove your contact because it will be shown to everybody so honestly the contact is is fine if people submit it to our resume that means they are completely okay with showing the contact okay so don't go ahead and hate on us for showing the contact we let people know remove your contact beforehand okay okay beautiful so so when i when we when we say fanciness this fancy colors right here are necessary not necessary at all these fancy colors i don't need no fancy colors at all so remove that just make it plain white okay plain white and that is it okay uh no someone i would say you know remove uh no some of that is not right still remove your picture someone i don't agree with you still remove the picture okay stimulate the picture so let's go ahead and continue on so remove that part i don't need don't you specifically need the background at all the name here pretty that's fine then i have no no problem with this that's fine education um let me see what about education what do you think uh let's see education i feel like so there's two things because on the left i see that she's saying i'm a student which is part of the education on the right i feel like it's just taking a lot of space as well yeah so yeah so i feel like that could definitely be simplified yeah so i think a little bit of simplification interest education here you don't need to talk about your classes 11 through 12. i would say just talk about where you your latest education that's it that's it exactly okay just relay the latest education talk about your latest right your latest latest hold on latest education okay may that be college whatever it be if you actually if you have here's the cool part if you have experience like prior experience you don't you if you don't have experience you don't actually need need education period that's it okay you don't actually need education that is a new experience it looks like disha is still you know she's still she's still in 12th grade and so forth she still learned a lot um skills fast learners so this seems like by someone who's still like in high school that which is completely fine you know but it's still good something good to learn so skills fast learner uh st things like that honestly what about what do you think about this we don't need this stuff right here i'm a certified ethical hacker i'm sports you know we don't need that you know what skills you have talk specifically go ahead daniel yeah i think i was about to say exactly what you're about to say which is talk about a project you've built if you haven't built a project go build some projects right start to gain that experience but when you talk about those projects it's what have you said before the proof is in the pudding it's like the proof is in the pudding exactly so go talk about projects if you don't have projects talk about go build projects and we have a shitload of tutorials on that especially when it comes to react javascript learn whatever that is so you could go through the channel start to build those things and you would start to develop some insane technical skills that you probably wouldn't even develop at a regular boot camp exactly sweet so let's continue on really and that's honestly that's pretty much it you don't need to change i mean honestly that's just just change that part and add add some skills add projects that is all you need for for this right so let me see add add projects right that is the most important thing and that's it guys okay so i think we're kind of we're done with this resume what do you think i think yeah i think we're doing this resume okay cool so disha you are all good let's go and continue on next up who do you think could be next next next next next next next we see we have zhanesh uh hold on we had a special request from someone in the audience what's his name uh to review theirs look up mauro mauro is it mauro mauro mau or the mau okay i like it okay okay let's take a look at this okay i like this this is cool so all right i'm seeing some zoom in i zoom into this one all right so i love honestly okay so let's see let's look at this look looks looks familiar looks pretty familiar to what maybe someone here has interesting so i got your name i like that okay i got the fact that you know it's really easy to read so number one i would say pretty pretty easy to read and which is why like right you got your technical skills your projects you know basically it's easy to follow that's that's the thing right so it's easy easy to follow right that is the most important thing right if you look at a resume and your resume and you can specifically say you guys are saying boring yes but boring boring like resumes like this actually is what gets you the job yep well the interview i mean or the interview the interview right not the job the interview here's why because it doesn't matter how fancy the resume is what matter it matters is the words what matters is how fast can the recruiter right how fast can a recruiter read your resume how fast right can they read your resume right how many how many seconds do you think they have nods or how many seconds you think they spend just looking at your resume they literally have five seconds five seconds to look at your resume and decide if it's gonna go or not that's it only five seconds and if you're gonna add some crazy colors and and and fancy and be like and animations and they'll just show them you know just like you know and everything just kind of blends in you know then it's not going to work out so well so it's very important just keep it simple that is the most important part okay continue on that's nice let's go and continue with this one i think on this one we could dive into the details just to kind of talk about you know you always talk about making them action oriented i mean also if you look it looks like he's starting off with this project instead of his work experience again so i'm curious what his work experience looks like yeah yeah exactly so let's go ahead and say so we got projects which is really cool as well and then let me see projects and then his education it doesn't have oh like work experience is on the bottom as well and it's an offset texas that's i love it i love it i love it so hold on we're seeing okay it's because it was a little lagged on without seeing all right we're good we're good you see it now yeah actually no beautiful okay great so so projects okay cool so create it looks like let me see so you got a twitter showcase react.js twitter expenses expenses tracker app so you got the twitter showcase okay snake game app okay you got the expenses yeah the twitter showcase app i will say do listen to like a twitter clone app like uh trying to change this name instead of being is this is this what is this a twitter showcase is this a twitter app or what uh potentially i don't think that's a clone one because he's using different technology there no he's still using node i don't think that's our our twitter clone i think that's a difference okay if it's a twitter clone i would say twitter clone because i'm not i'm not sure what showcase is like like what is showcase you know what i mean so that's what you need to understand so what is show showcase gotcha so the project itself has an ambiguous name exactly next up let's let's look look into the actual things he said so create a static what ui that allows users to what to search for tweets by sending http requests to an external api insert my website using node express utilize npm scripts to set up a dev environment create an internal or um an internal oh you know correct that part right here yeah correct that part make sure um api to communicate and grab data from external api utilize the twitter api to retrieve and display tweets based on the user's content search a random type tweet from a selection if i use this one put this one on the top right there utilize twitter api to retrieve and display tweets based on the user content based on based on user search or random tweet from a section of five and that's it you don't need this as well right making that sense because that is that's basically that is probably the most important bullet you have you want to make sure that's the top one all the things are like small things that you had to do for that yeah so make this on the top one okay the purpose of this app was to help okay i understand the entire fullstack process and hone in on my technical skills i like this this is i mean this is pretty cool what do you think about that dude he followed the process yeah he literally has he he literally has his resume template and then he just you probably watched our videos and did what we say to do exactly exactly so this stuff i like you don't need to have all of this other stuff honestly this right here you don't need to have all this what do you think about this one i think that's a good point because a lot of those things are kind of like you know served my website using node and express yeah it's kind of like a given when you set up a website yeah right the the creating static files especially like the html and the css that's also kind of a given when you're creating websites so i think you're right i think those last bullets yeah the ones that actually grasp what actually happened of yeah exactly the challenge of this project what was learned yeah exactly so you do not need specifically to say that like create an aesthetic file you either allows you to search for tweets or you can say for example created an application well you you said here us with api to retrieve and display tweets based on user search that's it like that's pretty much it right i would say focus mainly on that for this for example for this app so for this app and again the reason why is because you want to focus on a few bullet points instead of trying to do everything all at once right that's the whole segment exactly all right next up so what do we got create a ui that allows users to track expenses and help improve spending habits i like that static file i'm not sure what that means static file uh so i think the advice is probably gonna be similar like take up the static file yeah um create a ui utilize yeah the fourth one which is like utilize npm scripts to set up dev environment yeah maybe i don't know how important that dev environment stuff is but i don't think no it's not yeah i would say not no yeah so similar similar advice to the other one it's like you could clean out some things to really focus on the main the beef of the project yeah i would say here credit ui that allows users to track expenses and help improve spending habits that is great create application that which with classbased components and that's also i think and this as well it's pretty pretty cool too right because you talk about you know what specifically you use i think you know um well honestly i'm not sure about this what do you think about this wait which one are we talking about this one create application with webbased components difference the objects utilize props um so i feel like those are already reactings right yeah they're kind of given yeah um i think that could probably be changed a little bit more because it looks like this might have been his first react project yeah so maybe he's trying to show that that's what he learned in this project so maybe i don't know if there's a way to be like oh okay like you know if this is the first project where i did react these were the things that i learned or if it's even worth doing that but i think that's what he's trying to do with this yeah i would say so too as well so i would say for this one for example you could say create an application create utilizing um up to date react here here's how i would say here's how i would say it right i would say created an application created the application application utilizing all uh all the up to date all the up to uh all up to date to up damn it up to date react.js features that's it like components right components um props and state so what do you think about that i like that because it includes like hey these are the things that i did in this specific case and i think it could bring up that conversation yeah in in in the interview that it's like hey this is where i first learned react and i was able to dive deep into learning components props states everything that has to do with react exactly so that's why i like that so i would say remove that and then exchange it with this and then remove these other ones like we use the npm for this you know utilizing react for this we don't necessarily need that okay and then so that's all good i like i like that part let's go ahead and talk about the snake game so let's see create a classic 2d version let's see 2d version okay let me see of the snake game built with javascript html you said okay utilize for loops um don't need this again or this as well the deploy to github pages you do not need to tell me do you deploy to github pages because i know that this is on github pages you know what i mean right so we don't necessarily need this right but for something for example like create a classic todo version of the snake game billboard javascript i think that's fine what do you think i think that's good man i mean i think he was trying to showcase and highlight specific things that are already given as part of the project and those are things that he could talk about in the interview if it comes up but no one's gonna be like hey did you learn uh for loops you know what i mean yeah yeah it's exactly that's that's something a little more fundamental but i think still i think if we could start to remove these things that's great that gives them more room to add more projects exactly like an amazon clone or something yeah so awesome so let's go and take a look at now your specific uh actual job so service service direct okay i like how for example here the pros of this because i'm going to state the pros here you know it's clear uh clear dates right like clear dates and a very clear you know uh you know format so you know i know for example that you were working as a data analyst and i are still working as data analyst you know at service direct in austin texas you know since august 2018. so and and i think this is a great example of something you touched up a lot on nas but if you notice look how his his work and his background have nothing to do with computer science so he puts them on the bottom but he highlights the projects that he's built yes so he puts those on the top exactly because he was this is he wants to get a developer position is it i'm sure that that's that's the goal yeah we i mean we figure right yeah that's why he's here like he doesn't have a computer science degree and people here are saying i don't have computer science degree i look edwin said that in the chat look edwin i bet you anything this person can land a job because he's showcasing his experience he's putting in the work doesn't have a computer science degree and i guarantee he'd be able to land a job if he just keeps going at it exactly exactly cool so yeah so go ahead and put your projects up front this is why i talk so much about that specific aspect right put your project up front guys cool let's talk about a little bit now okay the text here so data analyst transform data into readable goaldriven reports for continued innovation and growth uh through google day studio okay okay i don't know what the that is but all right all right in order to draw conclusions for managerial actions and strategy okay all right so so for example here how i would do it is for example here here's how i would say here so we want to talk about results plus action right so we want to talk about results right results plus action right and i'm sure you already know this at this point but here's how i would state yours i would say for example uh helped with uh helped improve managerial managerial actions and strategies so improved remember that keyword right improved right improved and created increased decrease that is what you want to look at so we want to say improved managerial actions and strategy by by interpreting printing interpreting google data studio data there we go google data studio what i like it i just like the double right there google data studio that's it that's it right there right perfect right and then you can say for example created goaldriven reports for continuous innovation through google critic created for example you can say created created goal driven reports event reports general reports for continuous innovation boom innovation done that's it okay uh then you say uh for then you talk about developed and implied data analysis data cluster systems and also to them to to optimize statistical efficiency and quality so here i would say i would say optimize statistical efficiency and quality by develop by implementing data analysis and data collection so here i would say exactly so go ahead basically to summarize what's going on here is there's two things you always want to have in each sentence what was the action yes what was the result it makes it even better it's a bonus if you could start with the results and then talk about the action so right here moto what you have is you have the action that you took and the result that you got but if you just start with that results like any marketing thing if you start the result it's just a little bit better exactly that's what i would say i would i would say as well so so here for example what i would say is is where would i say this hold on i would say optimize statistical efficiency and quality optimized efficiency you guys might not see that at this point efficiency and quality right yeah right through the develop by implementing data analysis and data collection systems that's it exactly so the result was optimized efficiency and quality what was the action i developed he developed and implemented the anatomy and so guys if you now look at right if you look at you know when a recruiter now looks at your stuff you can see they see created they see improved and they see optimize and right away it's like oh this guy is very interesting and he created the right went ahead and created what are you laughing at bro oh this guy is very interesting that's exactly what they say so do what nazi's telling you exactly hey hey i have music here so you know hey yo you can't hear the music unfortunately bro but just imagine there's some epic music going on all right i have to buy myself that cool thing you know on the right hand side that like uh yeah what's it called let's go all right so we have went ahead and we reviewed your resume so go ahead improve it and we will see you but no actually not let's continue on that's all i'll say yo so there's two people that are live in youtube i just sent you through slack nas okay they're uh their names so i say let's uh let's try to get at least those two let's see let's see let's see let's see since they happen to be live oh oh my my computer's like struggling right now oh oh my god please don't die what if your computer dies we're screwed not don't die computer it's the mother ship right now we're relying on it oh my god

actually there's there's a few ls hold on no that's one hello whoa ella are you tricking us what do you mean you're tricking us oh i know she might have put more resumes it's a little delayed here so i can't the the screen sharing sucks dude no that's because of skype you know that's why okay yeah i have like a five second delay why is this like a hold on why is this wrong with this pdf i'm like it's like it's like not showing me everything holy i need to download that is everything no i need to download the pdf because it's like weird diego calling me out dude what latino power let's go diego what's wrong i don't know i don't get you guys you guys in your and you're uh you're funny funny missus dude la raza bro that's what it's about let's go all right so i think that's good here okay that's perfect so okay ella let's take a look at your resume right here okay so from the pro right away from the top let's talk about some of the pros that i see right away okay uh let's let's think of what what are some of the pros that you see right now some of the pros yeah he sectioned right very easily you could start to see the different sections we got the project we got the education we got the work experience even though there's some sections that i wouldn't agree with like a little bit about me it's very well sectioned easy to read or your eyes can follow through very easily okay yeah pros okay so it's sectioned right so easy to read okay next up it's one damn page let's go hey we've had one pages the whole date i know it's about time guys you know you guys are learning i like it um so okay so low so pros okay i like that i like you're also for example the skills section i think the skill search is pretty cool skill section is good yeah it's very simple like the other one talks about languages frameworks databases tools very simple ah what i just do all right now it's this one's interesting but so you hate when people rate their skills yes right i hate it because i don't get it how do you feel about the languages no i still i still say no just just remove that please for the love of god we do not what does this mean like do you like like no you don't understand bro you do not understand like tell me what does this mean does this mean that you know you know spanish fifty percent of the language what does this mean that means that if i spoke to you fifty percent of the time you wouldn't understand me i agree i don't like the bars i do however think when it comes to languages there's at least like some sort of comprehension dude you could say like all right dude i know basics you'll figure it out on the job you'll figure on the job just say you know spanish and just continue on yeah just just say your no just say your quad language how do you say that that's dope though four languages i love it that is absolutely amazing that is dope that is dope so i think i think that is awesome so languages again just remove that part image as well this is something you will hear from a recruiter you know as well do not put your picture you know you got an amazing picture you know and everything but please you do not need a picture on there honestly you know no no not necessary it's actually a lot of the times actually guys they will actually flag you down like google or something like that they will actually flag you down for putting a picture and the only reason is because it's almost like against the rules it's almost like against uh you know it's almost against uh like um the policies right you should not should not have a picture on there right to not have a picture it's almost like against policies so please remember that please understand that okay and now just really quickly here before i move on i want to show you guys something really quickly here oh wait okay hold on i'm gonna put myself here oh no because i wanna okay is language important remove reading bars okay so remove the braiding box exactly exactly it's gonna continue on okay cool next up what do we have let me see i'm gonna put myself here so i can see god there's just so many yeah okay next up let's talk a little bit about so your skills are great i love your skills that's awesome but what i think okay so skills are awesome let's talk about your let me see what else do we have so we we actually got a quick question about this nozzle i want to get your input um ask aksha asked how do you feel about the resume design do you feel it's more on the fancy side or it's just like it it has a good balance of not too fancy not too personally i actually think it's not bad what do you think yeah i was looking at that too i feel like like at first i was like oh the icons that's interesting to like dictate different things but it's also not too like though the first one that just had a lot of blue and the squares yeah yeah it's very distracting but this really isn't that distracting at all not distracted it's honestly still clean like i can still because for example i can still read i can still read intern and time stop i can still read intern and rapid post right and so forth one thing i would add to here is uh for example what type of an intern are you okay so really important here right remember keywords for example i would say for example i would say the starter developer intern intern right there that's i would say right whatever developer software engineer intern put that on there would you agree with me on that one yeah i mean how do we know you just weren't a janitor yeah exactly time soft right it could have been a parttime janitor for all that yeah so i would say remove that portion exactly no add that portion on there okay but i do love it the cleanness it's honestly honestly it is not overkill you know honestly it's not overkill one thing i would remove is i'll remove interest as well unfortunately because again it's not something a recruiter is not going to look at your interest recorder is going to look at what you know they're going to look at your skills right so once they remove interest because why right don't take that person go ahead well what's up go ahead you talk i was just gonna say hello hello don't take that personally because i also have interest in my resume if you look at it so nas also called me out on it so don't take it personally yeah exactly so they don't care about what your interests are they really care about what skills do you have they care about you know care about about projects the skills right skills you know projects and all that stuff right so that's why that's what i'll say to you you know what i mean so that's what i'll say and uh honestly and then let me see so let's see let's continue on what what does she also have let's continue on so we got intern so if we look at i'm going to zoom in on here for a second just so i can so you guys can read it as well come on zoom it zoom it oh fudge all right this is all we got so it says utilize asp.net core api and angular a to develop and the different critical modules of sba booking tool okay including blah blah okay so it's a little bit oh shoot that's that's very zoomed in it's just a little bit delayed guys my computer oh my god i know my computer is trying hard okay i don't know what's going on here it is struggling my friend yeah somebody said do you don't you think gotchu don't you think the font is too small okay the font what do you think about the font i i really don't know what size it is i mean i i feel you'd want to shoot for like the typical 12 11 maybe but if you start to go any smaller than that i feel like that might just start to be smaller than what you want yeah so i think for here it's fine honestly i think your font is completely fine what i would say to you is so let's i want to change this up i don't like what this is right here i don't like this right here utilize asp.net web api here's what i would say instead what would you say here instead what do you think for intern time software yeah okay so again first thing you want to focus on is the result so as an intern the result you got was authenticating registration using identity core and uh reservation models i'm not sure what that is yeah but i would say what is the result of this sba booking tool right think about this right so you can either say that or you can say for example i codeveloped an sp booking tool using asp.net web api and angular 8. if there is no result but if there is a result for example maybe you know a you know increased company efficiency by develop codeveloping sp book or security or whatever that was exactly whatever your project the results it actually delivered to the security did it increase peace of mind did it do something to help other people yeah that's the result you want to lead with and like how nasa says if you really can't think of that result that's attached to your project you could just talk about the project itself which is developed codevelop spa booking tool exactly and then however not steady yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's what i would say is for example i would say here and hella answer the question down below like what is the result of this right what did you do with time stop what was the result so i would say for example co developed developed codeveloped sp booking tool booking tool using asp.net asp.net dot net and angular 8 right angular 8. so that's what i would say right but if there's a result for example maybe increase efficiency or you know of some sort that's what i would say i'll use that in in that case right okay let's go and then if you have any links whatsoever to that tool drop it down below as well that's what i would say it's it's to manage a asp called lela baya okay so for example here you can sue help help management so increased management efficiency right so for example you can say increased i'm not sure increased management efficiency efficiency by by uh what's it called by codeveloping a aspa booking tool right there boom right there what do you think about that increase management efficiency yep and then what you that was the result right so then again what did you do i developed codeveloped spa booking tool and then your next bullet could be the languages used exactly so i think i think that's honestly that is great you know so and then you can say for example underneath you can say hey technology is used let jesus exactly boom right there and you can say angular comma asp.net.net and so forth and boom right there that is all you need that is all you need and do the exact same thing for these other ones as well right so do the exact same things for these other ones let me go ahead and remove that so hopefully you saved that but hopefully you can always rewatch it next time but so do that and then right so do the same thing for this one now what i do like from here i'm not sure if you guys know this but her dates are really good too these are really clear dates right and she keeps consistent dates you see this right here very consistent dates so i love that part what yeah i guess i want to just take it back real quick to the font size because it could be very different on paper than on the computer screen yeah so i would just go back to just actually see what font size it is and in my opinion i wouldn't try to go under 11. just because like i said it might be different on paper because i did notice it was a little bit smaller yeah from the beginning yeah so maybe maybe increase your fonts adjustments yeah like if it's already 11 12 then it's just the computer's looking kind of weird like it'll look good on paper yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah also i would say here you see how it says intern and then real estate market keep these same font right keep these the same font right here oh yeah yeah this is cool keep it consistent what about education where right under does that also have the scene i'm trying to scroll down it's not it's not letting me yeah education yeah this has natural font this has but key keep the headings keep them similar right so keep heading similar and yeah and all the way down to achievements just like exactly keep it the same then it just goes along with the flow of the resume exactly exactly so let me see oh why is this resume it's so hard to read so hard to go through in here okay so let's take a look at now your projects okay your projects and i'm going to go through one project right here really quickly but overall so far a great resume i just want to let you know great resume yeah sylvia asks um sylvia asks so basically resume you need to make it as clear as three or four as much as possible yes yes yes yes exactly look at the next question guys should i go for severe resume the next question yeah i don't know should i go for a cv resume so guys we've talked a lot about this okay just to recap what's the difference for those who don't know the differences okay a resume is a onepage summary of the what you've done literally related to the work a cv is literally everything you've done so with cv can be the things that are like four or five pages right in the united states literally no one asked for a cv so just submit arrest me outside of the united states pay attention to what they're asking for if they specifically want a cv then send in your fortify page cv but mostly they're gonna say cv or resume then just send in the resume because then you don't have to worry about maintaining a fivepage thing yeah so not a cds again what uh it's like latin like curriculum vitamin or something like that which stands for like all the things that you've done in your whole history oh yeah like your entire life you people like like if you worked at mcdonald's you put that there really what i mean yeah i've never had to upload a cv honestly guys only yeah only only upload your resume that's what i would say only upload your resume yeah and actually i just put what it is it's a curriculum vitae that's what it stands for yeah yeah yeah yeah i was like all right damn bro yeah that's crazy by the way guys really quickly here guys we have i know all this stuff we are providing you free content and you know free content and free value that's what we're here to do right and help you guys out by the way we do have a completely free uh netflix clone build so if you want to go ahead and learn how to build a netflix clone we have an epic tutorial down below go ahead and build that project go ahead and learn from that okay so you can put that later on in your portfolio so we completely free okay free training right completely free training on on how to build a netflix clone it's down below in description gonna click the link below check it out subscribe and you know what and then you'll be on your way to even uplifting your resume even more hey let's go let's take it to the next level bro next level okay awesome sweet so uh let me see let's get let's get let's keep going all right so i like this stuff let's go and take a look at now your projects your projects really quickly okay so real estate marketing platform okay real estate market design and development of a web application or real estate platform using spring boot framework okay so so design okay so again use talk here you're talking about design development talk about what you did talk about what you did right what did you do on and in this academic project right so did you for example codeveloped so for example you could say codeveloped dakota developed a a a real estate platform using a codeveloped a real estate platform a web application called a real estate state real estate real right now right real estate pla damn it platform uh web application using spring you can say using springboot as well that's fine all right so you can talk about what did you co develop right and if there was a really cool for example let's say you managed a team right so you can say for example is you know um kept the project on tracked on the project the project on track on track by managing no or by by managing the team or by for example by um by um i would say managing the team is that right daniel what do you think my bad i'm killing the youtube comments right now yeah i know um [Laughter] i'm just telling everyone to build more projects go check out the amazon club go check out the netflix clone go check out all the clones guys all the clothes we got you're gonna crush it all the clothes by the way i have a resume with 12 clones god damn that's gonna be insane what would you say by the way guys smash that thumbs up thumbs up button for us for the youtube algorithm we really would appreciate that let's go ahead and take this video to another level so smash that thumb up thumbs up button subscribe for more videos like this and we'll be all good all right let's continue on so gotcha so you you were asking me about this when the code development yeah for example okay so we said you know kept the project on track by by by managing the team you know can you say that i think we could maybe change the wording of the kept the project on track to maintain the projects trajectory or maintained the project's current pace or something like that obtained the product project trajectory right there maintained the project trajectory i think that's good okay perfect yeah and then what was the what was the action by by managing uh by correctly by correctly managing a team oh damn she managed the whole team no no no no no i'm saying if you did if you did i'm sorry oh yeah i was like let's go because sometimes you know sometimes you're the you're the team like you're the team leader right sometimes you're the team leader so if you were the team leader that is a great thing to put on here right you maintain the project trajectory by correctly managing the team right so that is an amazing wording to put on there it says that you it says that you manage the team it says that you lead you know how to lead people right and that's what people like that is what companies love a leader a leader a warrior leader a killer programmer yes a killer let's go okay i got a musical i got the music that's why i'm doing this but you don't got that you can't you can't dance bro no one else is hearing the music so that's unfair no they do you just don't oh damn for i feel lonely now hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey i'm gonna get back to my youtube comments because i'm crushing it here so oh look i know it's funny it looks like hella did my look this is why i showed this because it's so funny hellas like i actually did did they were all lazy asses see this is why i put this down because i had a hunch that that's probably what happened so make sure to put that down hella okay that they're lazy no not that far my god not that the part that where you manage the team okay lazy asses okay so i love that okay so next up the integrated development project led the development into integration of java development integration journal a desktop app with a mobile app webbased application uh using uh so i would say again spread this up into one word um into one sentence okay so you can put this into two three sentences but the most important thing what i would say for this one is again talk about the result what did you do did you you know let the development of a if a mobile app you of desktop what is the mobile app called or what was the purpose of the mobile if you have a name for it sometimes it's pretty cool just so it's like oh man like you know it's like it's a tangible thing not just some app let the development i like the wording led of a mobile app to improve i don't know a user search i don't know whatever i'm not sure what you did but but you get my point though you get my point right so let development of a mobile app to improve user user user search okay so i like that and then at the bottom you can talk about the technologies you used and so forth boom right there so talk about that next up education uh i would say you don't need this right here for education what do you think daniel so one is uh what is this what is this institute what is that you know what i'm not sure where she's from but i know some obviously some people have like different uh yeah education structures but i think it goes towards what you were saying before you really need to put like the last thing you're in like when i was in university i didn't have my high school stuff i just had my current university stuff because that's what it looks like the esprit that's where she's currently at right she has to june 2021 so i think unless preparatory institute of engineering studies is like the best goddamn engineering school ever like the mit or the stanford then i don't think you probably want to mention yeah then then in that case i would say just keep the latest sponsor whatever the latest one is i would say keep that one right so let me go ahead and actually remove that for some reason i crossed it out but you get my point so make sure just just get the one that you that was the latest one that's it okay okay for the achievements honestly i think it's pretty cool what do you think about the achievements portion yeah other i mean it looks like she went deep into the european innovation academy which is awesome then the other ones maybe they don't have them in details but i would just say similar to what we mentioned before just make sure that formatting is similar to the education to the projects and to the work experience um yeah yeah so somebody asked where can i have my resume for review guys if you want to submit your resume for review here's what we can do you guys ready ready you're gonna ask me your resume for review oh sh are we gonna open the floodgates just a little bit just for a little bit my god guys this is your reward you're gonna get the chance for the lottery of all these 80 resumes where we're only doing like three a week or so who knows how many we're doing but you get the chance so if you keep showing up consistently and you smash that thumbs up and leave some positive the air table so positivity and love in the comments submit go ahead and go to the air table that nas just dropped point right there let's go let me hype up the crowd because everyone's getting quiet on us let's go let's add a little rocket in there boom yo uh let's uh i don't know if uh ash cat is still on but you want to do his best yeah let's go let's go ash ashkat where's god i'll probably miss pronounce it um i sent you his name on the slack i see oh 83 e3 okay there we go all right let's take a look at this one action well i mispronounce it is action okay okay okay and you see he was smart enough he was smart oh oh no come on akshat come on come on bro oh hold on how are you gonna do this to nas bro how are you gonna do that tonight how do i i don't have assassins are you playing are you playing that sad music music oh man nas is speechless right now akshay we were literally four for four with one page resumes today or three for three i don't even know we're crushing it man what happened one page guys so let's take a look at it really quickly here this might be our last resume guys this might be our last resume so let's go ahead and check this one out okay really quickly so here's what i want to do here's what i want to do are you ready are you ready by the way how much do we i'm just really trying to figure out so we have oh guys if you're submitting a resume please redact your information how access did here yeah so you see how i did it which is really smart so that's how that's how did which is really crazy because we're not going to do that for you since uh we got no time for that we ain't got no time for that simple as that already giving you a lot of value let's go so okay pros and cons what do you think are the pros the pros again i see good sections which makes it easy to read okay so yeah i would say the prosperous is easy to read i would i i would agree with that yes so easy easy easy easy to read to read okay okay what's another one what's another pro another pro right off the bat my i mean i think it's cool that he's highlighting well actually that's not right that one's not a pro um the work experience is a pro that it's very close to being a software developer i mean it is literally being a software developer so it's cool that he's able to highlight that and it looks like he goes deep into the details but we'll go in and dissect that in a bit so yeah so work experience is nicely highlighted which i love that portion i love that portion okay okay let's not now let's talk about the cons or the cons okay okay um the projects dude like what the actual man yeah like this an instagram clone yeah you built a whatsapp clone and you created fun projects dot i n yeah and all you're like dude give me some context these are like some juicy projects that i want to know about what's going on brother this right here is your money you're on the money right here bro this is your money it's the money it's the money it's the money bro so look what i want you to do is i want you you to expand on projects i want you to not only say i want you to expand on the project just how you did here you see this right here math works i want you to do in the exactly the same way and it is exactly the same way so for example you can say right you can say insta so for example because the instagram clone right and underneath that you could say for example so created created or developed developed and you know an insta instagram instagram clone using your xjs using react.js react gs for learning purposes boom right there see so i want you to go down as deep as this and then for example you can say technology is used right so i'm not sure technologies you use here challenge is used and so i want you to expand on that okay i want to expand your projects is your value and then put down your github so then you say for example github okay and then you then then you say github then you say also you can say for example your link or your your uh your live link right and the other thing i would add to this so guys i'm a huge proponent of if you go through these clones don't just do the clones give yourself nice challenges of features that you can add to the clones because that's where you're really going to learn a lot so if you do add those features those could be the extra tabs right along with those things talk about what you did in that process because i mean if i'm being honest just because you followed a tutorial doesn't really like you get to see some behind the scenes but that's not really your project now someone else's project that you're able to follow so you actually get that experience and you get that ownership when you build out a specific feature that you thought about for example the amazon clone i'm not too familiar with all the features but imagine you built one where you get to see all of your order history yeah right i don't know the amazon already had that no no no no no no okay perfect so you build out that feature so you need a back end where you have to put the orders every time someone does a fake purchase or whatever and keep all the order history and it shows it nice now you can talk about that and be like fully integrated you know fully integrated a back end to this application using whatever firebase whatever database you use yeah yeah i would agree with that 100 agree with that man 100 good that guy so yeah add extra features to your projects okay next up let's go ahead and take a look at so your another thing that i would say remove this right here so your high school is not necessarily needed anymore just talk about your indian institute of information technology that is all you need your high school nobody cares about i do want to say this not because i've noticed this from the previous ones is they said that in india they care a lot about the academics okay so i think i think there's a caveat there i think if it's for uh work in india that might be different but if it's a work united states you don't need your high school your college should be enough for united states probably not necessarily exactly so finances part i like your for example now i do like your website here i do like your github here i do like your linkedin that is great um but though what i would say is when actually it's printed out a lot of the times like it's not actually going to be you know you can actually add proper links so add proper links on here you know what i mean so add proper links because when you print it out it's not going to be a link right do you go with me on that one yeah yeah yeah like if you want to go to the github it'd be like github.com or whatever that ends up looking like yes i agree and it's like they they can't just like press on this paper okay and it takes next up your next up your interest promote that please okay your interest no i don't care for your interest bro i'm sorry i'm sorry i just don't i care about what you've done and you're saying and what they've said exactly what not said before and they're saying in the comments for your interest that's things that you could talk about in the interview if they come up yes you can talk about that in the interview exactly but they are going to initially look at specifically what and hobbies ah you don't need that as well like pull you know pull cooker and you know i'm not sure what that means but cook pull cooker um so again all this you can remove all this stuff you can remove and that way you can actually go and make it one page okay so remove that stuff you don't really need that i'm sorry you just really don't okay let's continue on so i want to achievements oh you're a tedx speaker no way oh bro we got greatness among us wow that's insane let's go shout out yo that is insane we got greatness in the house yes so i'm not sure what you touched on but i think that is amazing so the fact that give a tedx talk honestly keep that keep the achievements as a tedx speaker that is amazing recognition at ie it um not sure kanapur my dashboard was featured on the home page okay you can talk about that as well but what i would say for example is to move this up right so you can probably remove some spacing to make sure that these are up okay vice chair and best delegate awards and multiple model united nations conferences damn holy damn bro damn that's the cp community for you brother that's insane so i love that looks like you've got some amazing projects you've got some amazing experience okay on you pretty much what you're missing a shot is you're missing number one the project so you make sure you basically expand on those projects that's pretty much all you're missing and then let's go and take a look at your now um you know let your your work experience okay let's take a look workspace so it looks like mathworks bangalore c plus plus software developer i like that so it's pretty clear it looks like you're from february to present that's pretty easy to read as well um oil enhancement so own and enhanced meth works infrastructure messaging to support async workflows with return values so i love that the word enhanced right there enhanced okay enhanced so here's i would say out enhanced enhanced so you know you know we've been going at it for a while when we just started laughing at these words dude i'm hunched okay okay so great so here's what i want you to do here literally is this own and enhanced i don't know i'm not sure what owned the means but when you own something what i would say is this right here enhancement nobody really cares about just specifically say enhanced math works infrastructure or messaging to support async workflows with return values and you don't need to have all this other stuff honestly okay okay you do not need to have all this other stuff the bug facing as well nobody cares about this stuff this bug fixing right we don't need that and in terms of data major architecture given yeah in terms of in terms of creating a major um major rearchitecture of glim i think there's something there so here's what you can say here here you can say things like and let me tell you here here you can see things like you know increased developer efficiency developer efficiency buy by re architecting glim our internal internal tool really i'm not sure where glenn is but you get my point you get my point okay and so this and that's it so we talked about just it this glim you know talking about what glim is you can talk about that on the actual you can talk about on the actual interview so they might ask you here what what is glim right what is glim and so you get the chance hey glim is this this this is this what it does and this is what we worked on right and this is why it's so important so that's what i would say is is have room to talk about something you see what i mean yeah so either someone who's familiar with math work products is gonna be like oh i've seen glimpse yeah i know what that is they can ask you detailed questions or someone who's not they might be like oh interesting oh my bad oh interesting what is this glimpting and then you just like oh cool it's this cool you know interthreading yeah messaging structure yeah used under the hood of the entire line of math works products exactly oh my god that's dope exactly so so somebody said the gist is use less verbage to highlight your experience it's as simple as that yeah use less rubbish to highlight your experience that's it guys okay next up we have let me see so that's what i would do for that specific work experience let's continue on to the next one 70 said can you please also do a live stream on how to land internship and resume critique for okay how to land an internship at google that could be a good we're live what do you think yeah for sure that could be a good live video so next up math what is this matt engineered edg um i'm not sure what this specifically means um is this you are um kind of engineer i'm not sure if you're trying to apply for develop development position you don't really need this i would say like depends on what position you're applying for you might not even need this otherwise what i would say is combine these two together i don't want to see know the same company as being two different things i want

have for an internship what advice do you have for an internship daniel i i just posted it but i'm telling everyone the same thing just build more projects let's go honestly guys if it's a job or an internship if you just build a project you build a technical skill set and the projects are something that you could show people you're gonna grab eyeballs you're gonna grab attention whether it's an internship whether it's a freelancing gig whether it's a job whatever that may be in my opinion just build more projects build more projects guys you heard it here from daniel guys so build more projects and you know to get the internship of course want to go ahead and you know and of course apply so build more projects and apply because a lot of you guys are scared to even apply to these companies so make sure you're applying these companies as well no matter how much you know how much you got if you have a few projects you're willing to to actually apply at this point if you got some experience reply okay don't think that you're not able to apply you know because you're not experienced enough and so forth not true so apply that's as simple as that okay apply okay what is the best
