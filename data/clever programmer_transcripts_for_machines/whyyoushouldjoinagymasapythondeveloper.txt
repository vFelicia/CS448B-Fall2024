yeah get the to the gym bro what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk about why everyone and specially every Python developer needs to get the fall to the gym alright what I want to talk to you about in this video is I get questions like how do I deal with anxiety Kazi how do I deal with procrastination you know they don't say that they say procrastination and how do I deal with being not productive sometimes I'm working and my brain is blank I get frustrated when I'm coding the simple answer okay and probably which not most of you're gonna like because most of you are probably like how I used to be and I hated gym and I loved being behind my computer and doing stuff that's funny Aaron just raised his hand but he's actually more jacked than I am so let's continue with this fish yeah because okay please understand that a lot of these things that happen with developers actually come from having a weak mindset and this isn't just applicable to their coding and how they get frustrated and not making much progress in coding this actually has to do with how when they're applying to jobs after a few declines or people refusing you or not responding to you this is actually what's gonna break you down a lot of the times too because you're not mentally strong most developers aren't they're really weak fragile people okay that is what's often time gonna stop you from making the progress and going to where you need to go I mean look at how Jack simple programmer is and then think about how successful he is write direct correlation I'm getting there simple program first John sunrise I'm coming for you bro what I want to share with people is the reason why some people are just way more resilient first of all read a book called anti fragile we're gonna pop it up in here read a book called anti fragile this book talks about this concept called being anti fragile and what does anti fragile mean let's say we have a box and in that box we put a glass now if we move this box that glass might actually break now let's say we put something else like a stone now if we move it a lot it might not break it's kind of weird right but but it will but if you use enough force you can even freaking crack stone right you can even break that but now with anti fragile and matching a material like glass and you put it in a box and then as you start shaking it it sounds like it's about to break but then it gets then you hit the more you move it it doesn't break so you're like what's going on and then you shake it more and then it gets harder and it doesn't break and then it gets even more difficult to break and eventually it turns into just being impossible and then what you realize is the more you shake it the stronger it gets the more you around with this the tougher it gets all right that's how you want to be so you want to be just type of person who when somebody is like around with you you're like you kind of with them back then the more the would you with them more back and then when they get in your phase lock you I'm gonna solve this and on a fix this and I have the answer so what I want you to focus on from all of what I just said is you want to become anti fragile so sometimes what that looks like is artificially doing things that make your life more difficult so some people have really pampered lives or even if they don't if they're being if they're developers they're just sitting behind their computer in a very sedentary way using a chair like this which is very comfortable we're sitting usually for 8 to 10 hours 15 hours at a time sometimes for me I'm sitting there like for 18 hours encoding or doing something on my computer or doing something with my youtube channel or coding whatever it may be so just realize that we're spending so much time doing things that are not challenging that require you to just kind of freaking chill okay what does this lead to this leads to a brain and a body that's really weak any adversity it phases faces it it stops and it fails we're driven completely by our emotions but we're we do a lot of things on a day to day basis by our emotions what we want to eat is based on our emotions we're thinking about how will make us feel who we want to meet with is based on our emotions because we know how that person will make us feel so when it comes to being a developer dad is also really driven by emotion so if you're not feeling well you're probably not gonna perform that well and if you're feeling down because you got to reject it from a particular job you're also not gonna keep applying so what you need to do and what has helped me a lot is constantly going to the gym now I've been training and boxing I have been doing kickboxing a little bit but I've been mostly doing jujitsu as well so lots of fighting skills and then also strength training like powerlifting has helped me a lot mentally okay so yes it has physically helped me but it has made me a lot more internally confident which then show and made me a lot more resilient and my grid is stronger so then when I'm coding or I'm doing something like making this video this video up I just go again I it's easy and same thing when I'm coding and I mess up I can just keep going nonstop and if I start picking up the phone and I'm calling clients I just keep going unlike a lot of you who just give up a lot of you what I want to just say is you are strong in your own ways but sometimes what happens with a lot of developers is that they go okay I cause II but I didn't get a job I didn't get the freelancing opportunity this coding stuff doesn't work for me and then when I actually get on the phone with them or actually speak with them DM them oneonone what I usually find out is they either applied to two or three or four places max and then they might have stopped even if they applied to 20 places and they stopped that's failure in my book okay you should not stop or maybe they got failed or kicked out from one inner right maybe they tried one or two interviews didn't work they just gave up that resilience is the difference between you landing a job for 40 60 80 hundred thousand dollars a year if not more versus you staying exactly where you are is the difference between you becoming a remote developer and traveling wherever the you want versus staying exactly where you're at this is the difference between you being able to provide for your family and your girlfriend versus being a loser okay so it's a very simple decision that you can make you can either get stronger and become more anti fragile or you can stay weak and have a weak mind which will lead to weak results in a weak life and weakness is actually a very unattractive characteristic the point of this video is probably this week you should get a membership to a freaking gym around you okay start with a simple step or you can start with something that's too much commitment for you you can literally right after watching this video just go for a walk okay something simple or you can do this you can do five pushups something that gets you more in your body I promise you it this is the thing the thing that will help you code better they'll help you think more effectively let me put it like this sometimes I spent eight hours coding and I don't exercise I eat poorly and my effectiveness in coding is I can't even make like a nap my brain is blanking out a lot my effectiveness and my efficiency is so poor sometimes all lift for two hours then I'll spend some time eating then I'll hang out with somebody I really love I'll come back and code for two hours and I'll actually complete that app so I will basically on eight hours of results sorry eight hours of work with only two hours of really effective work and that those are the types of things that being able to work out actually allow me to do and it personally makes me more effective so what I would suggest for you is give that a try alright what I want you to do now at this point of the video is drop in the comments below what is the one thing you will commit to doing right after watching this video I want you to take an action step right for watching this video because otherwise this video is completely useless and you have just wasted two last nine or ten minutes however long this video is by not taking any action right now so if you wash this please it would be amazing and it would be a privilege for me and and I would love it if you just took some amount of action and I really do care if you drop it in the comments below I promise I will actually reply it back all right the real me so what I want you to do is take a commit to taking action step and drop it in the comments below what's one thing you're gonna do right after you stop this video it could be doing two pushups it could be doing five pushups it could be like I'm gonna take a walk outside my apartment or my house and just come back in or maybe you will commit to actually getting even a ten dollar membership at your gym or getting a one day ten dollar pass at the Gold's Gym near you whatever it may be what is the one thing you commit to doing right now drop it in the comments below I would love to come and chat with you in the comments that's it for this video thank you so much for watching as always I love your beautiful face and this is cozy as always I'll see you in the next video
