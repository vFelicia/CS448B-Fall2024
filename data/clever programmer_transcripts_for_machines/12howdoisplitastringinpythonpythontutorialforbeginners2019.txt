hey what's up you guys aaron here from clever programmer and today we're gonna do a nice short sweet little video about string manipulation and a little bit of string parsing we're just gonna be going over two really quick Python functions split and join so let's get right into it manipulating strings is actually a pretty important in Python if you ever need to parse a CSV file which is a CSV file just a comma separated value file which means there's a bunch of things in a file and then between each of those things is a comma with no spaces that's all it is so it could be like a list of names a list of emails a list of prices a list of whatever you want it to be but it's basically the file is just text and you sometimes want to be able to do things to that text by splitting splitting it up or putting a bunch of things together into text and whatnot stuff stuff like that so that's what we're gonna be going over real quick very simple very very nifty little little functions I'm just gonna go over the syntax really quick and let's just go so let's say I have um a string a string that I want to split up let's do split first so let's just say I have yeah yeah okay let's see you say I have a bunch of problems all right we're gonna call it broke comma pale comma short comma nerdy okay and then let's say I want to actually because this list is just one long string it's not like anything like if I just print problems then um the story of my life will be displayed to the screen but if I want to make a list with all of these elements in there then you can actually split this up using the split function so what I want on what I want to show you here is that we are going to split on a very specific string called a delimiter so I'll explain that in a second let me just type it out first so LSU stands for list I'm gonna go problems dot split and we want to split on a delimiter okay so ad is just a fancy word I don't even know why it's called that but what it is is just something that goes between things so it's like it's a unified thing that goes between things so like in a comma in the CSV file a comma separated value file the delimiter is the comma with no space so it's just a comma if there was a comma space I maybe some CSV files have spaces they might be like a type of CV file that have spaces I don't know but if it does then the delimiter would be actually comma space ok the delimiter would be that string those two characters together so for us that's exactly what it's gonna be as you can see here back to the screen we have a list here and each of these words is separated by a comma and a space so our delimiter is literally going to be comma space ok you might have to escape this I'm gonna test it out real quick testing as you go like little things like this is usually much faster than trying to research it up and being right the first time just like take two seconds and figure it out it's cool so let's do this we have this string here we print it out we try to split on this and now let's print the list that we just created l and see what comes out as you can see it worked just fine we didn't have to escape it let's see if the escaping the comma does work though run it mmm no it does not so this is actually interpreted to see as you can see this entire thing is a list of one long string that looks just like that so you do not escape in here so just keep it like that umm this parameter is just a raw string you don't need any escapes at all a raw string just means it's literally what it looks like on the stream you don't escape anything which is nice alright it might look like this have you seen it before has a little R before the string but I don't think this function this split function can handle that so that's split very very simple you can take a string like this and split on anything you want also something else I could do is if I put like I want to split on short and then run it so it's actually going to take this split on here so the two elements are going to be everything here this is the first element and that everything here is going to be the second element because it's splitting on this string let's try that as you can see the first string is broke Calma space and then the second string is comma space nerdy because we split on the delimiter that was short but let's just go back to what we had before because that makes a lot more sense run it and look we have this string and we're splitting it into this list now what you're probably thinking is join the other function I mentioned was join and join does exactly what you would if what it sounds like it does it does the opposite of split it'll join a whole list together into one string so that's like if you say you had a Python list in Python or a tuple or something and you had a bunch of data and you wanted to put it and you want to generate a CSV file a comma separated text file sorry comma separated value file then you could use something like this like join to put everything on that list into one big long string of text and then stick it into a file called a CSV file and then now you can give that to anybody else whom who wants to see as you file and they can do whatever they want with that it's a very common thing to do so we'll just call this joint equals and this syntax is a little bit tricky like this actually stumped me a few times when I started I don't know why it's like this but you actually put the delimiter first just like this put the delimiter first let's just put space and space okay so that instead of just making it again what it was originally we're actually gonna do a little change on it actually let's do this let's do CSV equals like that so actually we're actually gonna do two joints so ignore this for now actually just get rid of it so I don't confuse you that was just a random idea I had on the on the fly so you have your delimiter first you have a string here and then you're actually going to call a function on that string which is a little bit weird I don't know why why that why it's like that but basically you have to have the string and then you're actually calling a function on the string so it's literally string dot join and then enjoin you put the list so list L would be L and then let's print out joined just like that and run it and as you can see it prints out one long string broke and pale and short and nerdy okay cool but earlier I said I had a different idea so like maybe if you want to create a CSV file you would actually use a delimiter of comma with no space CSV and then you call join on that delimiter string put in the same list run it this time oh I didn't print it print print CSV yeah and hit run and as you can see we generated our own short CSV text here so we could actually chuck this to a file I'm not gonna go over how to write two files in Python it's a pretty simple maybe in a future video maybe the next video but that's pretty much what this is going on here we have this joint function and the split function that either split on delimiter or joined by a delimiter I think they're both covered limiters I know this is called delimiter this might be called something else but I'm just gonna call it deliver because just cuz and I'm correct me if I'm wrong in the comments if it's called something else I might actually call something else I vaguely remember back from my undergrad anyways that's about it though for those two quick functions is very useful for dealing with strings um this will be handy for ya see you see files or anything remotely similar to that but that was it for this quick video guys thank you for watching I will see you guys next time and yeah good bye
