this very new uh session um and let's actually get started with a couple of uh presentation stuff okay so today we will be going back to the very very basics of web development amanath is going to be talking about some background stuff and uh all those things and after that we will be touching a little bit of um css and we will also help you guys set up your ultimate profit with javascript um developer environment right let me actually go ahead and share my screen with you um and now should now we should be able to see what is going on okay um awesome you guys see it everybody sees it all good okay now uh we will so you guys have uh the chance to ask any kind of kind of questions that you might have uh just make sure to drop them in the slido um form you you guys have the link and everything uh to be able to drop those questions we will try to unders answer as many of them as possible and we will be just doing that after the presentation okay all right uh let's continue so basics and background amana it's all yours yep okay so as david said make sure to drop any of the questions that you have in the slider and the drop the code will be dropped by david in a sec right david just drop it down we are the drummer like fan the zucchini yeah go on go on okay so basics and background of web development right so what is the development okay before we go into everything we need to know what exactly is the development right so web development is developing with okay web development is developing websites you know about instagram.com facebook.com google.com youtube.com all these dot coms okay and to create those websites you need to know web development right you need to know html you need to know uh css you need to know javascript then also when you're trying to make really big websites like instagram you need to know frameworks like react or angular or view we love react so we promote react okay so hopefully facebook might uh sponsor us for this week and you know all this stuff for a while so hopefully they'll uh they'll sponsor us okay so background web development what do you have to say davey guys the stage is always i mean everything on the web is actually using these html and javascript stuff okay there are a couple of websites that use php but that's kind of it um it's probably one of the most uh top growing david you're zoning in and out man oh yeah what's going on my audio we lose your audio for momentarily now you're okay okay even in youtube the stream is lagging guys oh maybe use your headphones no no i'm using my normal microphone yeah okay let's go ahead and oh good guys yeah okay i'm gonna okay before that i just and a few guys ask that same question what do you think about web developers okay because i want this to be really interactive and i don't want this to be more notorious okay otherwise go for it what do you think what's your development web development is usually just making websites and actually not just making websites it's using making use to make servers and like you can just make things and which could change people's lives in some way like you can make interactive website you can make the next facebook if you want you can make the next twitter if you want you can also pass some useful information like blogs where you can just post all of your thing which which which is which could be information informative to people or just as your personal diary or whatever like uh posting your information on internet it's good if you know web development because then you have the flexibility you don't have to use some other framework to make your website you can just make your own website and push it and that's why web development is very important and i react right now react right now is just booming everything and it's it's never been more famous than it's right now and there are so many opportunities if you just go to indeed you will find a whole lot of opportunities for react so this might be the best opportunity you would ever get for web development absolutely yeah well when joe who else would like to add to this yeah i mean web development in short in a nutshell is basically designing websites and and you know as and this course basically trains you to learn all the available frameworks technology that you can use to come up with very creative solutions ultimately you're you're coming you're trying to come up with the solution like take an example of a barber shop or a dentist there's no way for that person to advertise unless you know he puts it on yellow pages or yelp but if you as a developer can can come up with a way that they design a nice quick website he can then get more business so it's like you know developing something that will provide value to the to the client whoever the client is so i look at it that way how i can bring in more value to the person whatever business that is if it is a small shop versus a big company it doesn't matter but this like you come here to pwj to learn those skills to be able to deliver that solution so long story short awesome yeah yeah can we connect this with a worldwide web as well and yeah in terms of development yep absolutely yeah so internet it's the world wide web and every a website is how how you represent yourself or your business on the internet or the worldwide web right right rudra yeah of course yeah yeah yeah okay define what would you like to add into this uh yeah um yeah web development is uh yeah for sure uh creating a website uh yeah with the html uh structure you need to have a good layout um yeah the css for nice styling and the javascript for uh for yeah for the functions um yeah and it brings it all together but it's not only creating a website it's also communication skills with with companies or auto developers it's team playing it's it's more than just developing a website and the other skills that yeah that we are learning here in the profit with javascript uh by uh attending these new goals by getting a success coach trying to teach others and all that all of that is part of also part of web development and um yeah it's a challenge because you have to find ways to make it effect easy yeah good looking and uh and put it to the standards put it to the stands of the company that one show wants you to build their website so it's yeah adjusting in everything okay there is this one quotation about web development where it says website sells you 24x7 no employee does exactly okay so i'm gonna say what what development is okay guys web development so now you have this internet that was introduced in 1996 i don't need to go through the history but in the 21st century right i just love telling stories okay so don't mind me going all these centuries and all this stuff so internet was born and the internet is kind of like a place where you can promote yourself you can promote your business you can promote almost everything and anything right so now with the growth of the internet and we have almost billions of devices connected to it and now what happened is earlier it was really expensive to have an internet but now we have almost 120 people in here and from all around the world you guys are connected into this phone call why is it because of the internet right so internet does not only allow you to create websites and all this stuff it helps you to get connected and it's all all that that made a global village like made me to connect with david who is in hungary made me to connect with joe who was in us made me to connect with devin made me to connect with everyone in this call okay that's the internet and now with that we got some an opportunity that has grown that we can promote our business we can promote ourselves on the internet so what's the best way to promote yourself a website or connecting on social media like facebook instagram twitter those are all social media platforms that have been created for you to connect so now what you can do is you can create websites for your business that can help you reach global clients global people okay so as joe said there might be a bubble okay he he's a barber in us and he does not have a lot of clients he's getting right so now what a web developer can offer is we can offer him to make a website and help promote his business online and help him get more clients from around the city right now suppose you gotta go for somewhere somewhere okay what do you do you hit up google you go you google that place and that's how you go and what another thing that happens on google is when you search for something like coffee shop get a lot of suggestions right and suppose if your business is there and you have a website it's really easier for your customer to reach out to you or make an order or you know book an appointment so that's how you create a presence and to create that present you gotta know web development not everyone can learn with web development so that's why you guys are here to learn web development and short long story short dating websites that's for development right so we are developing the modern way of communication as well isn't it exactly there we go a modern way to communicate with people absolutely yeah okay david uh share the slides please again okay yeah just a moment yeah okay i think it's your slide again who's a web developer okay who's the web developer he's the person who makes websites like me david joe brendan shrikan gianna elisa rudra devin you guys are all web developers right yes exactly yeah yes okay okay yeah you might be learning web development but you can call yourself web developers no there's no problem in that right okay so we are web developers who create websites right who create solutions modern solutions for businesses right and another thing is not just by learning the web technologies it's not that you only can make websites right now you can create websites you can create android and ios apps with the knowledge of web development you can create what else you can create desktop apps with the knowledge of the developer there is this framework called react to create websites or web applications and with react native react on steroids you can create android and ios app right the best part you want to add something to it yeah and the best part is that it actually is going to be like actual native stuff when you develop and react okay um let's go to our next slide i guess okay so right now we are going to be preparing your ultimate developer and actually profit with javascript environment because we are adding some pwj uh specific stuff into this presentation just for you guys so if you are here and if you're ready to crush it let's everybody get a google chrome and start downloading right now all right let's go and see what we have so we have a couple of uh applications listed up here first thing first uh we got definitely uh first off we definitely have uh vs code you already know that guy um we will actually i'm i mean if you guys guys find it uh useful i'm happy to share a couple of extensions uh just shout it in if you if you guys find it useful okay okay so um by the way this is where i will be showing you a couple of uh in html and css stuff yeah so um david david uh yeah before yeah okay you show about the uh the extensions right yeah uh no not so much yeah okay so guys make sure to if you cannot install all this software right now make sure to note them out and all the vs code extension that david tells you okay so because these vs code extensions will make your life really easy okay so make sure to note them down and make sure to install them to make sure you are ready for all the future coaching calls like we knew a lot of people did not have node.js installed to get started react there were a few people who did not have vs code so make sure to make the best out of this call make sure to note things and do them to get yourself ready for all the future coaching calls okay exactly exactly yeah like these extensions have made even my life super easy and yeah and if you cannot follow up this is a recorded coaching call you will be able to um watch this later on inside of profit with javascript course okay it's going to be in there alright own that um okay and then another thing we gotta say before suppose if people are gonna leave there's this surprise that we're gonna do okay we're gonna ask you people to create and based on your suggestion we are gonna create a landing page okay so this coaching call is gonna be on every wednesday and it's gonna be kinda like a series so today is episode one of season one and next wednesday we're gonna have season no not season two episode two of back to basics so today we're not gonna get into all the coding stuff we're just gonna introduce what's web development and all what html html tags css css selectors and all these tags and then based on that knowledge we're gonna start get into coding from next week okay we're gonna make sure we aren't to all your questions everything your and make you perfect and ready to get into the meat of the program okay so what you're gonna do is you might you you guys keep on visiting websites each and every day right and then you when you visit a website you find wow this website looks amazing right and you all might know websites that are really amazing what we want you guys to do is at the end we want you guys to drop all those websites okay that you find would be really good to create with us in these coaching calls okay yeah like we could create a post in slack and they could just drop it there yeah exactly exactly drop in best websites with a great night user interface a landing page okay youtube because they're not like landing page website they're like application we need a landing page like if you go to slack.com that's a landing page so websites with landing pages make sure to select like free and out of those they're gonna select crate three or five and we're gonna run a poll with you guys and the one that gets the most number of polls they're gonna do make that website with you guys from this from scratch every wednesday okay exactly okay let's go ahead and set up everybody's uh ultimate development environment okay so uh i already started talking about vs code but first where can you get it um of course you will what's up we we will be what software did you open in the beginning uh this is vs code this is vs code okay uh so you can download it by just simply googling up visual studio um code and yeah actually that's the one that you want to download so it's just a simple google search and then the first link is going to be the one that you want to download uh we want to make it like super safe for you so you don't uh uh so you will not be scammed this is the official website of vs code this is where you can go ahead and download it and if you're on windows or linux you can go ahead and install it right from here so once you have it downloaded uh you're going to see a screen like this one uh and you want to go this uh onto this um little where is my screen brush um let me just move this thing yeah so you wanna select this thing this is the extensions um hey david hello yeah i had a quick suggestion to people i know it takes time for us to upload the videos you can also take screenshots and save so you know by the time that will be something handy for you if you want to go back and refer that's what i do if i find something interesting i quickly take a screenshot and save it so i can go back to whenever i want to i don't have to depend on kajabi because it takes a little while for the content to get there just a suggestion okay okay okay okay first up uh first extension uh this is going to be super useful for you uh when you're developing html this is auto close tag um oops i even clicked it so auto close tag is let me let's just go ahead and demo what it does so i'm just going to type in a random html tag let's say strong and i just close it and it will automatically pop in the um the closing deck for it right it just makes you makes your life so much easier uh the other don't think they have that but it's what's okay so that's because of ms bro uh even if you don't have that vs code extension you if you have image working on your vs code then it's gonna work yeah okay next up we will be using auto rename tag right so auto rename tag is if i go again and type here strong and i just uh i don't know i it kind of looks i want to uh rename it for some reason like let's say i want to go with div it already deletes it from the other one from the closing tag and it uh pops in right ahead that's right bro my point exactly yeah yeah this question uh what if we have like multi so you mean i have like three div tags this is what you mean oops yes okay so if i have it i can still go ahead and like i don't know rename it like h1 it doesn't make sense at the moment but it goes ahead and renames it right but it's still um yeah so your names yeah it actually knows which one uh which one closes which one right so it's just going to make your life easy and especially when you're like a beginner uh it's going to make your life super easy because you will not need to worry about like oh my god did i uh close this tag or did i not what happened nope it's going to take care of it even if you go ahead and rename it uh like some random stuff it's still going to update uh as well so it keeps keeps the tag closed so you don't have to worry about any of these stuff okay all clear yeah thank you there perfect now uh i mean guys actually can you follow it follow with uh follow me with this yeah that's my good sense nice nice second one is what are your name yeah what's up so first we should uh download auto close tag and then auto rename which okay don't worry about that um what i'll do is uh once david goes through everything when uh once david finish goes going through all the vs code extensions i'm gonna drop it in the zoom chest and also in the slack okay yeah okay okay i'm gonna go ahead uh share my screen once again and okay so here we are next up we will be learning bracket pair colorizer um this literally does what it says but actually i recommend downloading the second version um there is like nothing super fancy change but obviously they are going to update the second version and they are going to focus on that more so this makes actually more sense when you have a javascript file right i'm just going to go ahead and create an index.js and like i can literally like throw uh don't matter how much of brackets added and it will color all like the pairs okay so if you like have something don't worry about it don't freak out um i'm just going to type wait damn it yeah yeah why you just got changed yeah why just put a bit low oh hold on a moment uh let me let me do a quick sound preference stuff yeah even people on youtube today voices okay uh is it better now yeah no okay okay for some reason drop the volume i don't know okay so uh don't freak out i'm just going to create a an array which will be completely empty and i can just say radar map and if there's something yeah okay just one sec uh classical is asking is there any additional settings needed to enable this effect to take place in the editor no when you install the vs code extension it's automatically gonna set up and it's gonna work for for you suppose there are some settings that you might have changed earlier then it might not work so if it does not work just take a screenshot of it and drop it in the slack channel okay okay uh where's that yeah perfect okay i just threw in some gibberish code this probably like would freak out at the first moment uh don't even try to memorize this but this is just to show you how bracket bar colorizer works so up here you can see uh they've colored it like completely or uh yellow but uh if i go ahead and like delete this one and for some reason like completely forget about it i can already see that the editor is like freaking out like oh my god what's going on it's expecting a closing bracket and i can like oh my god when did i miss it right that's when uh this tool comes in handy uh so i can see that this is like purple one yeah we got the pair of for it blue one nice whoops there is an uh there's like a yellow one and there is no closing so i can just go ahead and close it and everything is going to be uh cool except for i wrote some bad code in here hi david sorry to interrupt but what does the dot map function do exactly uh the dom map is is going through the array don't worry about it for now it's actually covered in the module so if i had like several of these and like there will be something uh the map something would be covering this part this isn't just some gibberish call here just to show you how this is just for time sorry yeah no it's just it's just for demonstration purposes this doesn't even work i'm gonna even delete it okay um yeah let's go for the next uh next awesome what you call the extension that you can go ahead and install uh i think the css for matter is actually very handy it helps me whenever i'm uh like um david david david can you please be closer to the microphone okay how about now don't have mine okay okay okay so uh css formatter actually does what it says uh it's just a simple formatter for random uh css tags so i can just go ahead and like if i have a tag which is strong uh and like i don't know make it or i don't know okay tell me your class name app let's say let's say we i we have an app.header don't worry about it and i don't know uh like display um flags guys okay when we are typing code in here don't freak out ignore what the code is okay you know what's happening here i'm just uh it's for only demonstration purposes i'm going to show you every single thing uh what i'm doing here okay uh this is okay disclaimer don't try out this code what david does sometimes it could be ingenious to your computer okay doesn't prettier do that for you exactly it's the same thing uh so you can go ahead and use prayer as well that's uh actually a lot better it shut it goes ahead and and does all this stuff whenever you're uh saving the file so i could go ahead and if it's still yeah and i'm like uh okay i'm not i haven't configured it but previewer does the same thing uh css formatter is like specified on css what's up um you know why why why do you sound like you have big bass like yeah sound like you're far away from the mic oh still yeah yeah can you change your mic can you change your mic and try okay he doesn't need to change the mic just to come closer to the mic okay how about now i'm going to go ahead yep and how about now oh that's awesome okay we will go with it we will go this way then okay so it just goes and just uh does the uh formatting for you okay uh don't worry about again this code we will be teaching every single thing now another thing i want everybody to go ahead and is uh i think yeah it's visual code in telecode it's just going to give you oh yeah visual studio and telegram yeah that's right yeah uh it's actually going to come handy when you're typing uh javascript so it's like um it's going to give you more uh hints so like when i go like all these start stuff are coming up whenever um when i have this uh intel code installed right it's just giving you more options to choose from and it's going to help you go heading some backend application or you're creating a react application right so you remember npm i express and although all this kind of stuff or for example mpx create react app you know all those kind of stuff those are because we have node.js installed uh on the computer right this is the thing that you want to go ahead and install i think you can go with the lts version um current is like still under development and all this kind of stuff so it actually says recommended for most users don't worry about the other one just go ahead install this uh you can install it on windows as well so it's very it's very powerful yeah this is only for react right no no this is when you're developing for the back end so you are like doing backend development like node.js applications and when you're doing react applications right and there is a lot more uh one more functionality but this is where we are using it okay all clear everybody with me but we we are obliged to uh but we are obliged to install node.js to uh to create uh react up that's right yeah yeah yeah you know so both ways we need it suppose you are just working with html css and javascript you don't need your notepad but if you're going to work with frameworks or you're going to work from with library javascript packages and all this stuff then you're going to need to have no js installed okay exactly okay so come from here can we can we download this node.js from google yeah yeah go to nodejs.org and you'll get it okay let me go ahead and share my screen so uh you can go ahead and just type in nodejs.org and it's going like this is how it looks right so i'm just going to go ahead and drop it in the zoom chat so you guys can have it uh um yeah i just dropped it in you can go ahead and use that link uh to get to this page and you can just go ahead and hit download you will inst you can install it afterwards this call and yeah that's pretty much it about node.js but during installation they don't have to do anything other than click the exe correct exactly i think that's where people were getting that's where people had most questions is when they installed they were getting different errors so you might so just a general uh shout out when you it also depends on the type of pc what softwares you have installed on your pc there might be some issues so that can be you know you can send screenshots or if you run into issues and can do that on an addon oneonone basis so in general you should not um okay um i have a question by aaron saying can you explain how to create a react app so react will be covered on tuesday's coaching call with sunny so today's coaching call is absolutely for beginners and we are not going to cover about all those stuff okay yeah afterwards i have a question yeah yeah okay i have a question regarding the node.js version so usually we need to download the latest version uh the latest support yeah so okay there is this two versions when you go to nodejs.org the latest and the lts right download the lts one and not the latest one because the latest one it's it's like still under development and it's gonna have bugs and all this stuff for normal for you for what do you say normal users yeah for usual users you basically go with the version that has been tested and proven which is the lts version the current version is still under beta phase it's being it's being tested on different environments so it's not solidified yet so you use the lts but i guess the audible version is on the latest one because we're using in the tip calculator the model we use the import statements in node.js the import statements uh can be used in the lts fund too right david i'm not sure don't worry about the uh the other one just go with that that's perfect most stable right exactly it's more stable exactly this is uh the node beams are getting updated every time so is it also good to have nvme what's up the note version manager i mean i keep installing the new node versions and using the nvme i can switch between the nodes what's up okay okay let me tell you okay um guys let me tell you since you're really beginners you don't need to really focus on uh version managers you don't need to worry about you know i need to have all this latest stuff and all this stuff you know just what you need you need to get only the basic stuff in and then you're good to go you don't need to have the latest mpm or the node version to get started you don't need to have the latest you know the beta version of vs we are showing you the basics that you need to get started okay so you don't we don't need to pull go dive into all this nvm or code what it was called don't worry about it just go ahead and install them because later on you will be needing this in the course right that's all you have to worry about now just go ahead install it you will just you can just forget about it afterwards right and you will be just able to uh like go like super uh smooth in the course that's all this school is about helping you out to uh be able to succeed as fast as possible right and just have like a super smooth experience oh cool yeah i i have a small question related to visual studio intel code do we have a specific library for only js keywords kfk1 javascript uh keywords for the the extension that you mentioned it gives us uh multiple words keywords but some of them they are not related to javascript is there a specific tension talking about the intellisense david he's talking about the intelli whatever you're showing remember so he's saying that intellisense is not just javascript javascript specific it gives you whatever nonrelevant javascript as well which is not relevant to javascript i mean it's not always limited to javascript yeah a couple of times it throws up a couple of other stuff but when i mean it intelligent and knows that you're what you're working with and the thing is yeah the thing is you don't need to have everything perfect to get coding okay you don't need to have your intellicode to only show javascript keywords and you don't need to have the latest as i said you don't need this is the basics guys you're just starting and you don't need to fall into all these rabbit holes and you know trying to just get started like download no js install with the lts version download visual studio code install all this vs code extensions and you'll be all good to go and i think they would have somewhat tell you guys exactly thank you okay let's go let's dive in the extensions uh the tools sorry okay next up i highly recommend downloading github desktop because i have it oh yeah so if you already have it that's cool um so github desktop is just making easier for you to understand how gig version control works let me pull it up super quickly um hello yeah okay this is the first time i'm using it so when you're downloading it this is the screen that you will uh actually see right so i can just uh go in here and like i don't know uh coaching portfolio i can just go ahead clone it like it gives you uh the link if you guys are wondering when are we going to use all these tools well we are going to be using these tools in our future coaching calls on wednesday exactly yeah yeah is it going to be a specific coaching call for the front end or like css yeah so okay uh it's this the wednesday's coaching call is gonna be like this today we are just showing you all the tools that you need to get started and everything and the next wednesday based on your polls and everything we're gonna start on with a project like we've already seen a lot of people suggesting strike.com maybe we might do stride.com or maybe the one that suggested the most so based on that before we go on to everything we're going to start with basic html we're going to show you the html tags and then we're going to start the basic structure of the stripe or the website that we choose okay and then the other week we're gonna start styling and then we're gonna be more styling and all this stuff and finally on the day on the final day we're gonna deploy this website on netflix or five or something using git so you're going to be learning git you're going to be learning how to deploy your website you're going to be learning basics of html you're going to be learning about css it's going to be everything so basically it's going have a bit of frontend stuff right yep exactly okay okay so let's go now uh and i'm gonna just show you dude i have a small small question okay yep hello i think javascript intellisense comes default with vs code is that right what's up with vs code yeah everything is right yeah it's built into javascript uh uh vs code right now you know right now you know what i'm going to say yeah now most most of the stuff is okay sorry so most of the stuff is yeah it is coming uh built into uh vs code but if you want to like make uh power it up and like have the ability to be able to see more of those stuff then you will definitely want to go ahead and download um the intellicode as well right it like adds more stuff into that okay that's all it's about okay let's go back to github desktop now um like understanding how that works so boom okay everybody sees it perfect so uh you can just simply create like clone repositories add repositories create new repositories um and you can like fetch whenever you make a chain uh make a change you can just go ahead and push it uh changing branches we will show you guys everything um it's just a demonstration on that it's so much easier than having a terminal open all the time and like typing in stuff stuff like get add had thought and all those kind of stuff because for for the first time it actually uh is super hard to understand how all these stuff work and it's just a very beginner friendly way to start coding so um i'm going to show you where to go ahead and download this so let me look up the stuff from here okay um also david we got a suggestion asking people uh the list of software that we need to install and all this stuff yeah today david yeah we will do a long video after this right after this call and show how to download each tool that you need and how to make it run okay david exactly yeah yeah okay sure actually we can just snap a couple of links in there too but like this is how the page looks like just go ahead click it and you already have okay next up zoom i hope everybody has it because otherwise are you in this call i don't know if you can actually join uh from the cloud david uh yeah uh i have a question related to uh uh like yesterday and the call we uh uh sunny show uh shows us uh that there's a get uh extension and obvious code for get get lunch what do you recommend using github desktop or extension on the vs code and which is but actually i use both personally so i have git lens as well i mostly use git lens to um whenever i have something committed it shows up a couple of icons here so i can like compare what's happened uh since my last commit and i i am able to see uh what did i add and what time so that that would be my recommendation but to actually learn how git works i would definitely uh suggest to go ahead and download github desktop so i would recommend using both right okay thank you hope that helped a lot okay um what did i want to show you you have david you have already done a video on five awesome tools for develop listening youtube right yeah that's correct i mean you can go ahead and watch that too that's more like i mean this is more like profitable javascript uh specific later on we will get to those points as well i mean we're just approaching those oh hold on where is my presentation right here awesome so definitely go ahead and download zoom if you're joined for if you're joined from the cloud okay next up slack you can go ahead and if you don't know about it uh you can go ahead and join to our uh awesome slack community it's vibing and it's full of positive vibes and stuff like that so definitely the slack community right um okay um gianna you had a question this is it so we have the profit with javascript channel we have all this kind of stuff going on uh we have a huge huge introduction um and yeah like everybody is helping everybody like nasser is putting this stuff out here so i highly recommend going ahead and downloading slack and join the community okay um next up what you will be using is postman i think i even talked about this one as well on that live call uh postman you can use it to check uh if your backend apis are working perfectly or not and and if you're a front end if you want to go ahead and like work more on the front end um you can just check what kind of data are you going to grab in from the back end right okay and blue this is called loom you definitely want to go ahead and download loom because for all all this works uh yeah like i have all these stuff going on with all these personalized video feedbacks uh so loom is actually a super easy to use uh tool it records records your screen as well as your camera and it just helps you showcase us how you did your homework right so there will be a lot of times when and i actually encourage everybody to go ahead and whenever you finished a module and you created the project just go ahead shoot a loom video send it to the pwj channel and slack uh post it in our private facebook group and just like hype everybody up to do so right um yeah also another thing that we're gonna do really soon is we have seen a lot of you guys on your own creating really nice and great projects so we're gonna create a repository we're gonna create a new positive where you guys are gonna post this project and make a long video and show awesome okay great yeah okay um now let's go ahead and type into uh html basics i'm just going to show you a couple of tricks tips and tricks what can you do with html um nothing super fancy going oh my god i forgot two super important uh extensions so these two live server and live share thank you okay yeah most important stuff right so liveshare is livestream makes me able to create a link and i could just literally drop in uh drop to amana and he could hop in and we could work on the exact same code we could work on my computer even his he could work on my computer um and we could just like do the pad programming stuff which is super powerful it's going to like skyrocket your skills and all those kind of stuff so i definitely go ahead and download it and the other one is live server which we will be using i think we can go ahead and start using it right now i mean it's super easy to set up you can just go ahead download it and down here it should appear but for some reason oh i'm not in the html5 so whenever i come into the html5 um still not appearing okay um yeah it sometimes freaks out and does some good stuff but put right click right click i think you do right click right click on the live server yes yeah you need to turn it on even show up here no you can go to your documents from the extension side by the document and click live server yeah start replying no no to start a live service should have uh it will also work if you put here right then the first option i didn't even know about this one nice okay so it's super easy it's easier than i thought okay okay here we go okay uh just so i get an idea everybody put your hands up both hands if you uh if you're complete beginner web development and don't even know what html is okay leave what are you doing um everybody with the camera turned off yeah i see muhammad is complete beginner okay so we will be going ahead and just give you an idea of how how it looks like and what is it let me go ahead and share my screen and i'm turning on my screen brush and okay can you guys see the whole whiteboard okay yes okay nice boom so html boom so it's actually uh it's the abbreviation of hyper text markup language if i'm not mistaken and it's basically that is right yeah thanks you're yeah it basically creates the structure of the website whoops yeah so let's let's suppose that we have a website like this and like let's say that we got some sidebar going on here some top bar uh some let's say if it's facebook and we got all these posts going around here we got the chat uh and all those kind of stuff and like let's say this is the like uh this is where comments go this is where this uh text goes now this is the structure yeah so this is the structure of this page right and this is what html does for us it's not going to look nice it's going to be looking ugly without css and all this kind of stuff but it gives damage there's a nice nice gif for that whoa nice gift for that go to go to go yeah go to google and just search um html css javascript okay and go to google images you'll find one okay and i'll show you which one is that uh okay sorry um yeah exactly that one i love that oh yeah yeah yeah that works that works okay is it literally how it is it gives you the skeleton stuff makes it look awesome yeah guys this is how we learn here okay yeah um let's actually create our first we're not going to do anything anything super fancy i'm just going to show you a couple of uh html tags and all those kind of stuff nothing super fancy going on here uh so let's actually everybody open up your vs codes right who's ready who's pumped show a thumbs up nice okay with just a quick question yep so what is the tool that you used to draw those boxes those colorful boxes you made uh it's called screen brush okay thank you uh yeah i'm just gonna drop it in the i think it's a mac only app by the way okay that's why i got a print app on windows and even if that is a paid version right oh i see yeah okay yeah because that gives you gives me the ability for like freezing freezing stuff and i don't know all these i think even i can go you know uh yeah i mean if you go ahead and like search up screen annotation too you will definitely see a lot of them okay let me quickly check how my batteries are okay i'm not sharing my screen sorry guys yeah screen share perfect okay so how can you um okay so this is how you will actually see a uh html file without anything it's going to be empty there's going to be nothing there is one secret uh you create a little symbol that if you type in uh yeah this is going to be an abbreviation and it comes built into your vs code right so if you just type in uh an exclamation mark and just hit return it's going to pop in all this kind of stuff and then you will not you don't have to worry about all these headache right yeah okay david just a just a small introduction interruption kartika is asking can you guys also dive into some prototyping tools where we can get a bit better grip on css okay so before we actually dive into coding the next week we'll try to do something like that right you know david like create a prototype of the website on sigma or wxt and show guys you guys how you prototype and also get a better idea on css yeah yeah yeah exactly that would be helpful thank you no problem guys like this is completely driven by you so we just want to give you as much value as possible okay let's go back to uh creating a super simple nothing fancy uh html file so actually it is running on my 5500 uh port and if i was able to yeah this is my part okay so this is a sometimes uh there are a lot of people who might find it boring but we are doing this actually for absolute beginners so guys guys literally if you enjoy you definitely need to understand all these basics and you have to master these first and then you can jump into react because that's when you will get super powerful okay uh let's make this quick i'm going to create a couple of stuff on my on my screen you can go ahead follow me but the homework is going to be to check out one landing page or something that you like and try to replicate that with plain html right now you don't have to uh worry about styling and all those kind of stuff you can go ahead but don't worry if you cannot just try to make it look like that okay just try to replicate the structure okay so uh we will get this plain stuff going on here i'm just going to add a couple of stuff like i will create a div which will have a class of header uh we are not going to use bam naming for now but when you're working with a client it's highly recommended but just for the sake of simplicity you're not going to use bam and then so there is the header uh we will have like a strong um i don't know let's say a title and like we can create a button in here as well which will say uh click me so i i just want to give you guys an idea of how it all will look like right so we have a strong title up here and we have a button which says click me you can create these by just uh these two stuff right you can also if you want to like make this title like crazy big uh you can wrap this into a h1 oops sorry so you can go ahead and grab wait a minute yeah so you can go ahead and rub these into a h1 and like put these like a round title right that would make it super big i mean not super big but definitely bigger than what it was it also actually inserts a line break right so you have so you need to know all these nittygritty stuff to be able to work with the super efficient level once it clicks it's going to be epic hi head and body shows up yeah uh no i actually i added an exclamation mark that was all that i did and then boom but actually i i think you can type in doc and it's just going to be almost this i mean let's see what's the difference but i always type all the codes manually it never shows up like that like chat and name and all really is there a special extension for that or something yes i mean i have no clue it might not work i mean let's let's hop on a caller let's actually text me uh in the slack and yeah it should be a part if it not like leaf says so i don't know uh let's actually address this issue after this coaching call okay okay okay i have a question related to the what is net vs code so emma is like a tool which which will make you able to do super fancy stuff and like add lots of uh html attacks in just a couple of lines right so i can like i could type in so if i just want to create a div with a specific class name i could just type in a dot and like i don't know i have the app header he's going to pop it in here right so that was a map i i could also do uh this that i want to do we need to configure it no no it's pretty built it should be principal then and that's code okay uh i'll take a look into it and i'm not okay the next thing you can do with the math which is super powerful so you can you can like uh add a url inside of the um inside of the header and inside of the ul you could add a couple of allies let's say you want actually you want to give them a class name of list item and you want uh eight of these with just this one single line of code boom see that i could do oh i'm gonna do it again boom it pops it in i got the div uh with the class name of hatter i got the ul and i got eight of these allies with the class name of list item right how does this class thing work like i have never understood this class and you are completely so class is uh going to be so you definitely want to go ahead and give everything a class name because when you're styling you will be you will uh you will be targeting most of these uh class names right we will be covering it in this series so might be not today but definitely in one of the upcoming calls okay okay and actually one little trick uh which will increase your efficiency so if i go ahead and select class notice that it actually highlights all of them but if i go ahead and click command d on my keyboard it goes all the way down and selects all the classes right and i could actually do it here as well so it selected that one and it goes all the way down and i could like whoops like delete everything and like type hello nine times and it's going to make uh your life a lot easier uh when you're uh when you want to rename a lot of stuff which are not html attacks because of course for html tags it's super easy so that's it so class is basically like a group yeah class makes a class helps you to like target the target the tag and whatever is inside so it makes your life easier um when you're styling and when you're doing some kind of javascript stuff okay let's dive back okay so what we had was the title which was a h1 and we had a button and i also want to create another div which will be i don't know let's actually use them right now so we will be so i want to have a list of like let's say students let's say i want to have a list of all the students in this uh on this website right so i could create a div oh i could create a div which will have a class name of students list just to put it in perspective and i will have an unordered list which is ul where i actually could make an ordered list as well which is in a while and then i'm adding allies which will have a class name of student and because i say c83 i'm not going to edit the three of these i'm just going to go with five for now so i can just randomly pick uh five people out of this class so we got swan okay let me let me just put holy yeah so we got swim we got three we got uh oops we got gianna we got uh joe and we got um aaron congrats me david because you're another student see no it's a student list whoops and if i go back to my okay page boom there we go right um so it created an ordered listing the difference between the ordered and unordered list let me show you what is it uh so if i go ahead and change this like notice that it already highlighted and i change it to ul which stands for unordered list it changed the numbers to these bullets right so it's kind of just giving you an idea of how how all these html attacks work you could also like create um so if i wanted to add a link to everybody's facebook profile let's say i wanna wrap swann's profile and i wanna help uh help you guys find swim super easily because when is an awesome success coach uh we could just add an a is uh what does this a stand for by the way anchor egg anchor thank you um snap in whatever link you have it's like let's go and say google.com for now and i'm copying someone putting him here and just in a moment there we go uh it's not going to google because i haven't had the hdtv doing good that thing so now should be just to add david david just to add when you do a ul versus ol i think ul sorts the elements um alphabetically i believe can you do that can you go turn it back to our ordered list of course sure yes so people can know the difference these are the subtle differences that you should be aware or it doesn't i think it just uh no no i think it just adds like a number and that's all right yeah so these are like super easy uh and then like super beginner friendly tags that you can go ahead and like try yeah pre you're welcome of course i'm putting your name there um okay so these are like just to give you an idea of how all these tags work um one uh actually if you give type that uh another dot order list uh uh they like it will give you the specific type of it like whether if you give like orderless with capital a then the list gonna be creating with the capital a's and if you give like a star then the unordered list will be created with star as a bullet point yeah yeah yeah exactly okay um now this is only just to give you an idea of how all these tags work now one everybody um i think the best source for learning how uh to go with these hdmi stuff is we3schools.com uh and and like this thing is like showing you all the documentation right so obviously we couldn't cover it uh on this coaching call definitely but i want everybody to go ahead and create that web page and if you guys have a question like come to us well we are happy to help you and we are happy to give you hints on how you can go ahead with all these uh html ethics right by the way was it informational uh did you guys find it useful or should we go into uh into it deeper or i mean for now uh it's going to be like a touch base but definitely next week and afterwards we will be going into this super dupe okay oh cool give me a thumbs up nice awesome okay i'm just going to show you how show you guys uh to give you an idea of css and what it does so notice that we had a class here okay so um by the way uh i remove this sidebar on the left hand side it's a command b so i can go ahead and say that let's say i want the whole thing to have a green background so i can go ahead type in body and background color and i want it green right is it clear so i have this tag over here right i'm targeting the body tag and i'm setting the background color to green i think it should work for some reason it doesn't maybe it's because i think the dark body what's up oh i didn't link the two okay dark body no no yeah that's another thing uh yeah emma helps with this too you just go ahead type in link and it's going to type in this line of code but we are uh with beginners today so let's go ahead and type in links i thought i thought it was only me who used to forgot linking css files so we can see one professional mod developers also forget it's their third part yeah yeah okay uh so you can just go ahead and open up the link tag like type in rail and that is going to be style sheet so you want to define that that the type of it is going to the style sheet the href is going to be um style css i think yeah let me just close it i actually noticed that link doesn't close up it's because link doesn't have a pair right that's all there are a couple of uh tags that work like this so now that there we go okay now that it's uh connected we have it green okay now another thing uh class so notice that i just typed in body over here nothing super fancy but let's say i want to target all the students i'm just going to hit a dot because this is a class right so remember whenever i'm giving uh class name to a div i'm starting with a dot you can remember it from this thing so let's say i'm going to target the students and i don't know i want to make font font white uh to 900 front white uh makes your font super bold okay let's see what we did there we go it made we made the form super bowl uh we could also uh actually i'm going to remove the class name from here from swamp and save it again and notice that it's like so much lighter but because it's another color it might not be the best example so i'm going to remove it from pre too see so if you if like it's noticeable and gemma is bold pre is light okay that's uh that's how these glasses work but i could uh add the glass at any time whoops and i can say student and pre is going to be bold again all clear everybody everybody with me who's with me yeah sharpies or a tumblr or something nice yeah boxing is a possibility too okay just kind of push myself you know i think yeah okay so that was kind of like to give you an idea of of how these styling stuff work it's really nothing super deep for now i actually want everybody to go ahead and start messing with this like literally go to some web page and you can like snip it apart with the inspect tool it will show you everything um i can show you that too um let's see how it looks like um i have a question like the other another page how did you link this page with the background color like you had this you have both files in your same folder yeah yeah i have them in the same folder that's actually a really good question you need to have all these files in the same folder we're not going to use javascript today uh noted i created a folder called back to basics which is yeah that's the name of the folder and i have two files in it you can actually go ahead and create like random files like another html with some i don't know it's another html file so it actually adds you can create folders inside here like this is how we create the uh model and all those kind of stuff with sign right and when you're so when you have selected model uh you can add like this is where all the uh model files come right that's kind of how how we add all this stuff okay so is it like the whole page where you start doctype html it's your folder and then you created this stylesheet which is filed within that folder right uh nope actually doctype is in the file which is already in the folder so i when when i created this project i just had the folder then i had to add index.html which in which i just pressed uh the exclamation mark and that added all the stuff for me okay so basically these both are the files within one folder and which is connected to each other by that style exactly okay got it okay so um this is kind of like giving you an idea of how this stuff work and how these things look like i actually want everybody to go ahead like try to mess with these try to like make your hands dirty jump in ask questions use the community okay you have an awesome community to use uh we're always there to help you so use it as an opportunity to grow as fast as possible right and just drop all those questions okay how do we submit homework uh great question from aaron uh you can shoot a loom video like actually i want everybody who is a beginner and who is using html first today to go ahead download loom and shoot a little video that okay guys i learned this today um this is my first project using html and i don't know like just say some stuff what you learned and what was difficult and all this kind of stuff just drop it in pwj channel okay and then we submit it in select channel yeah just drop it in let's drop in the sock channel when people are going to react and all this kind of stuff okay uh it's time to ask answer questions um let me go ahead and share my screen again uh can you go with the homeless one with that real quick uh what sorry coming here oh i was saying um yeah but now the homework can go just create some random webpage doesn't have to look nice it doesn't have to look anyhow just create something make your hands dirty and start messing around with html and css that's all i think yeah david a great place to start on you know messing up with html is uh you can share free code cam.org before we go any further uh i wanted to show you one more thing uh where you can like where everything is super easily on this like okay um so these two videos probably already know who is smiling over here oh hold on okay so you probably already know this guy this is kazi from kevinprogrammer.com and fuzzy cozy yeah he actually made two of these awesome uh awesome videos these will actually walk you through all these uh with all these stuff obviously couldn't fit into this uh coaching goal because it's like four hours in total it keeps them more than four hours so but i definitely i if you're a super beginner i highly recommend going ahead and checking these out this should be enough for you to get your hands dirty and start going ahead and create something what's up absolutely yeah can you share the links um yeah of course it's on youtube yeah it's on youtube it's on youtube um we'll just pop it in like uh into um into slack whenever you're when we are finished okay yep okay okay time to answer answer questions oh yeah here we go what's up q a yeah q a okay let me just refresh the slido oh we got 40 questions nice jesus why bro are the yellow ones uh oh these are the these how to have a cool cool hair like david grow it exactly including okay which one did we already answer come enough it's more like your turn i think yeah let's go from the first one yeah okay so casey has asked how do you set up websites to be mobile friendly better to start that way or fix it after a normal build okay can you shout if you're here okay see casey left okay in case casey is watching this back uh if you're a beginner i would definitely don't worry about mobile styling for now when you kind of messed around with html css and all this stuff uh that's when you want to go with mobile friendly there are other sources for that to find how to make mobile friendly and how you want to go about that but for if you're a beginner for now i wouldn't worry about it if you're not a beginner um i always go but go like make everything uh flexible and mobile friendly and like i should be able to see the webpage uh perfectly as i'm developing it right so by design it should be flexible yeah i think like making uh you can uh if you're like really constrained on time and all this stuff you can go for a css framework which are creative mobile friendly you know so you don't have to spend time on media queries trying to make it mobile friendly because if you're going from scratch and trying to make websites mobile friendly it's a way too much of work like you gotta say okay for this for this size you gotta say uh we need to you know make this this and this look like this like it's gonna take a lot of work if you're going from scratch but you can try using something like you know css frameworks or something yeah so leave it beginner just try to get it working there we go this has a good point right intermediate add some yeah yeah deep i need yourself go ahead bro that was pretty much all i had to say you're a beginner just try to get it working it's hard enough as it is trying to figure out everything don't take on that battle right now just try to learn the basics when you're an intermediate level add a little bit of flexibility as best you can just to get a feel for it you'll find out pretty fast um i have one more question like almost as a big navy hold on i'm almost done advanced mobile first always because everybody has these and somebody most people nowadays less and less people use tablets or desktops mostly it's like tablet or phone yeah but that's it go ahead could tell yeah but you had a question uh yeah like there are so many basic things like in htmls it's like so many basic things and there are so many software nowadays like bootstrap and all which help us to skip all those basics so like how does this work david what happened uh i think i froze maybe it's in a nice pose what okay hold on am i good man you look good okay yep you're good uh yeah brother can you repeat that same question again yeah uh like in html there are like so many basic stuff where we use a different tag to style in html but nowadays a new thing like bootstrap and all which help us to skip all those steps and directly use the bootstrap to design our webpage right so like how does this thing work like do we need to learn all just all the basic things or like we can start learning bootstrap i mean i would recommend learning the basics first um because then you will be able to use these tools much more efficiently exactly because bootstraps you can use it anyways but if you don't have a good understanding about the basics you're gonna struggle in the long run like suppose you don't know much html css and you know you go for bootstrap and you find it really easy to set things up and everything suppose you come off face a client say not used in a framework you're gonna struggle a lot having a basic knowledge and going for a framework that's completely okay but without having a good knowledge or at least some understanding of how this works going for a framework is not always a good idea that is correct that is correct suggestion yep yes to answer his question i was watching one of the live calls from tatyana and she suggested something called a mobile rwd extension for google chrome i think that would be really useful if you want to design it for mobile and the pc simultaneously like you guys can use the bootstrap grid system at the start like like you're making some cool things right now so at the start you can use bootstrap grid system to make it look like responsive but do not use the complete bootstrap like do not just put every button you see in there and you just make your own things just do that but use the only few components of bootstrap like the grid system which will help you make it responsive and like that's that's okay people do that and that's normal yeah yeah all right let's see the next question we got oh these are okay we have a timestamp okay do we also learn react on pwj yes we are learning uh all these modules are coming and we already have lots of coaching calls and we are covering all the basics in pwj you will have you will have the chance to learn react but first please please just go ahead and understand the basics and master those like literally create every single project that you can whoops like create every project that you can using these plain stuff okay what are media i'm enough it's a question to you what are media queries in relation to css i keep hearing about it okay so media queries is how you create buy a new website so like they can show us a sample for them like media and all those stuff oh yeah yeah sure um i can't like maybe you could do something like when you when the screen size decreases the background changes something like that
