hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and as you can probably tell we're trying out something new here in this video we're going to cover is we're going to teach you how you go about building apps but before you get to that level you need to know how you can actually think logically about creating those apps once you get those logical skills up something I cover in my free course if you guys are in it we're going to be doing coding challenges on Python okay this is what's going to allow you so then when you are creating those web apps that I'm going to be teaching you guys in my olp course you're ready for them and ready to go okay so let's get our coding challenge started so I'm on this website called hour of Python and we're just going to do some coding challenges live and we'll see how it goes the first thing I see is it says string challenges and we're just going to hit and open it up so let's say we go to lowercase challenge okay and what I'll do for you guys so you guys can try these challenges as well I'll put it right below this video so you can actually code in here and give it a try alright so this one is pretty simple if I gave you any string just give you a lowercase version of it so let's say I gave you hello in all caps if you call what we call a goal function on it it should just turn it all lower case okay so let's give that a try all right so I go to my line 11 I don't know if I'm playing I'm probably planning wrong because I'm just trying out we're trying out this new thing but let's let's give it a try and one method and python that I remember is lower so that makes our life very simple we get a string we call our lower method on it and that just makes it lowercase so let's run this and give it a try and as you can see we were given capital art and Capital trinket but what it spit out is lowercase Targ and lowercase trinket so fantastic we did a great job there let's move on to the next challenge the next challenge is uppercase so what if we're given anything that's lowercase or any different case we want to just return it in uppercase for example let's say you're making a blogging website and you want to show the title in upper case no matter how the user puts it so let's say that you have somebody on your website a user that logs in and then creates a new title what if we want that title to always be lowercase even though the user might have put it in the lower case well that's where this challenge will help you in Python so then we're building those bigger apps you have the tools and strategies when you need them okay so let's go ahead and give it a try upper case is very simple it's just like what we did previously we can make it more complicated but we're going to do similar things so as you can see they have written some of the code for us it says define uppercase string so we're gettingwe're called creating a function called uppercase it takes in some string and then on line eleven we can do something similar and we can say dot upper okay that's again a method in Python so if we're given lowercase Arg and the lowercase trinket it should actually print it all in caps so let's give that a try boom works perfectly and in the next video we're going to cover a new challenge called switchcase challenge that one is a little bit trickier but I want you guys to give that a try that's it for this video I love you guys so much and as always I'll see you in the next video
