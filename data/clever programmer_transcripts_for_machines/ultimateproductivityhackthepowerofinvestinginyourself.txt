hey guys what's up this is ky from clever program.com and I I want to talk with you guys about the power of investing in yourself and what can it do for you and how it can actually make you a better computer programmer or a software developer now there are a lot of people that I you know talk to and and see who are trying to learn and and are really struggling with a lot of things but you know they have good intentions their intentions that they very core are genuine they want to work hard they want to improve they want to get better but most people um never want to spend anything to learn something like so many people are so interested in you know they they're they always want to buy something they'll spend on buying new shoes they'll spend on buying new clothes they'll buy suits they will buy any kind of Technology you know if you're interested in soccer you might buy a soccer ball or a basketball and people are always you know we we love buying stuff right we love I love to buy new things and get new things but when people want to accelerate their learning and get better and get better results people hesitate on buying a book A book that's worth maybe 10 20 $30 right but it has the potential to change your life that's honestly how I think of anytime I I can see a way to further my education right it has anything that you invest in that's in yourself that can actually improve you that has the that has potential the power to change your entire life and people are always trying to Short Change themselves in that regard they want to spend money when it comes to buy buying new things but they hesitate and those new things aren't an investment in themselves they're are investment that is that is superficial and it's okay right invest right like um I I bought this watch I love this watch really cool watch but I I this is something that I was you know thinking about should I get it should I not get it but I ended end ultimately ended up getting it right but when it comes to getting improving your education improving the quality of your learning skills people will be very hesitant in spending people are just always thinking about so what's my point my point is stop being hesitant when it comes to investing in yourself because that's the most important investment you can make and anytime that you invest in yourself you'll see benefits that are not just twofold or threefold they'll literally be like tenfold or more something that you can't even quantitatively measure okay so that time that it takes you to think about buying that new book that you have in your mind or purchasing that course that could potentially teach you something new you should have spent that time actually purchasing it and then learning from it okay uh a lot of people are like hey I don't know if I should get a member ship to this site or I don't know if I should uh you know purchase this book well if you make that investment would it break your bank and they'll be like no well then do it and test it out and try it out if then after you've invested in it and it's not giving you the benefit that you wanted and it's not having any impact on your life a lot of these things even have 30day returns so you can just return them and they'll give you your money back but ultimately my point is you shouldn't be afraid to invest in yourself people will all the time you'll buy buy chips you'll buy random stuff you'll buy cookies but really you're not going to buy an ebook for five bucks you're not going to buy you know uh a $2 app that could teach you about computer programming and help you so it it's really a paradigm shift that I'm suggesting that you should think about and that should you should try to implement it's a different way of looking at things but if you value knowledge you will be very knowledgeable that's it guys this is kazzy I'm signing out but here are some videos you guys can watch if you're interested okay this is uh probably the newest video you can watch my courses subscribe to the channel and don't be afraid to invest in yourself and learn something new okay do your research go out learn binge learn that's something you can't regret it's unlike Netflix I love every single one of you I'll see you guys in the next video
