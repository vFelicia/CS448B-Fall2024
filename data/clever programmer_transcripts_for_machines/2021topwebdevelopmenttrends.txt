guys frankie here from clubber programmer and today i have the honor to sit with my friend what's up aaron here from clever programmer what's up frankie what's up man you guys know aaron from the python tutorials of 2019 we killed it back in the day um and 2020 and 2020 as well don't neglect 2020 also the whole live streams and everything but anyways guys today we're going to hit on the top web development trends of 2021. hell yeah and the upcoming year that's 2018 to an end a lot of people actually released this title right and we wanted to give our own that was back here what's up nas how's it going wanna come say hi and a lot of people gave their two cents on it now it's our turn so we're gonna discuss what's in right now okay so let's get into it guys all right to begin with guys you know pay attention a lot of value is gonna be given throughout this live stream and everything that we say is very practical so actually take it into action turn off your phones exactly exactly so it's time to focus so top trends in web development i actually saw this specific graphic in one of the one article online and i thought it was good how they explained it so i kind of wanted to grab it for myself i'll give correctly the developers look like superheroes yeah jacked him in the world with development traits so you want to explain this aaron yeah so i mean we the way we kind of looked at this was um there are a lot of trends right when it comes to can you hear me it keeps cutting up but there's a lot of trends that you can follow but i mean even those they're just trends but there's a few things that you do not want to forget about when i'm thinking about web apps or i mean program in general but in this case web development is good it's good all right yeah so and pretty much when you're making an app uh this kind of is just like underlying um principles you need to follow like your apps need to be responsive like they need to be fast that's the first thing so um make sure that you always have like fast apps they also be pretty so i mean this makes sense for web development and and mobile development web apps and all that kind of stuff because you want to look pretty because it looks like not then people aren't really going to care last thing is it needs to be intelligent so this is kind of like the trifecta of things you need to keep in mind regardless of the trend like make sure your apps are fast and responsive and they look good using uh different frameworks and that they're intelligent um using some kind of backend algorithms and stuff and we'll go into these a little bit more as we go into the into the stream but uh just keep these three in mind so responsive pretty and intelligent make sure your apps have all three um as we're going along awesome and exactly guys we're gonna expound on all of these and let's actually keep it moving forward so one of the cool things about this specific you know trend list that we wanted to do is like aaron said you know they're called trends because most of the time you think of trends as things that are passenger or you know come and go but we wanted to base this list off of things that obviously are relevant that are trends but at the same time kind of have a principle right so you know the principles of this type of website you know building or development can actually you know it can actually carry you guys for a few years because we're literally talking about a bunch of principles and one of the biggest principles right now is really mobile first design and you want to explain a little bit about that okay yeah so actually i want to say that out of every trend this is kind of the probably the most important one because it kind of determines everything else everything is under the the umbrella of of this one trend right here so already look at this focus on this it's not even a trend like unique to 2021 um it's just it's upcoming year but each year it's going to be even a bigger bigger trend and that's a mobile first design so i found this again another superhero graphic yep man that's the whole theme of it you know developers are super heroes and no no go back bro okay okay i just wanted to mention this so like yeah it's super important because most users are always using their phone over their desktop so um in order to be able to like create apps that are being used by more people more frequently and more accessible like more convenient for them then mobile is taking over slowly slowly so i mean the first iphone came out what 2007 from i mean the first smartphone the iphone in 2007 and since then every single year there's more apps there's more things there's more functionality there's more models there's more companies building smartphones and it's crazy and it's going to keep going up and up so the biggest trend right now is mobile so you want to make sure that your stuff is always mobile friendly and actually prioritize that first because as you can see on the on the display here on the on the slides yep also prioritize it think about it guys like normally if you see a website that doesn't have a mobile friendly design or if it doesn't even have a mobile you know version of that page you kind of like i personally think about them like oh damn like they never got to develop this the company might not be that professional or something like that you know i always feel like there's something missing i mean things like instagram right like instagram was mobile only first and then eventually years later they eventually got the desktop version up and running that's true on the web app and so it's like and i'm glad and how big is instagram but i think there's more instagram using the facebook users right i don't know that's crazy really but i mean at least in the younger generation facebook has been debated by the adults right yeah but by the grand mom is there not trying to catch on and be hit anyways you know mobile development and sorry mobile first design is actually very important and we saw a cool article here from cnbc and they're talking about how nearly threequarters of the world right now will use just their smartphones to access the internet by 2025. so in five years and 5g is coming to you look look at the ad advertisement there that's crazy yeah yeah because yeah and with 5g coming in mobile stuff is going to be even more like prevalent like it's going to be dominating in the next five 10 years you're really going to make sure that mob your mobile stuff is on point or else you're going to slowly be overshadowed and even from there from like a meta trend level after mobile phones come by like i mean wearable tech is coming right virtual virtual reality augmented reality that's eventually going to take over the smartphones and mobile development in the next 20 30 years when that stuff is like the main drivers when you have your google glasses yeah apple apple's making apple glasses soon it's coming out in the next probably a few years and stuff like that so like once that kicks in then the trends are gonna eventually go over there but for 2021 just focus on mobile smartphone stuff yep so augmented reality is really big actually you know huge companies like ikea are using it right now so you know mobile and all of the technology is moving forward to different directions i mean i'm not sure how it's going to look in five years from now but i mean three quarters is 75 out of everything so another cool point that we really did want to hit is the fact that realtime web applications are super important in these days you can see you know big companies like facebook big companies like instagram you know have very responsive times whenever you are you know browsing their website because people have low attention spans exactly yeah and it's actually one of the biggest drivers of people bouncing from the websites yeah it takes like if it's like a boring 15 seconds you skip that if it's if it's like if it's interesting you'll like watch the first three or four seconds then you'll skip it that's true it's like this we're just the attention span you know it needs to be like fast and responsive where people get upset you know spinning beach balls people go crazy over like milliseconds and stuff so yeah i know one of the tools we actually didn't mention it here but one of the tools that a lot of developers use in big commercial projects is google lighthouse which you know teaches you or shows you how to optimize the websites you know in micro optimizations but you know ultimately it's for that note and one of the things that or companies that actually use this um the realtime web applications is all of these you know so fresh uh fresh books never heard that fresh i mean yeah a lot of these like a lot of the big companies have uh really realtime application and this just goes back to the trifecta i talked about before so your stuff needs to be pretty so i mean for mobile a lot of stuff is pretty but then these realtime things like things need to be responsive where people are just going to not use your app like if an app is slow like usually people just don't use it like if you go to like the app store on your iphone and like oh this is not working it's slow it's laggy it's buggy people just don't use it it has little reviews but like stuff like instagram like and presentation is pretty much everything but the fact is that the prettiness of things comes from the fact of you know if it's too clunky or too you know there's so much going on it's almost not intuitive how to move around the app you know so prettiness comes in handy with actual you know efficiency and results for that app so that's why we wanna you know actually focus on that evernote instagram dropbox uber twitter post mates meetup paypal and salesforce are some of the companies that use that you want to expound on this oh dang yeah yeah so another another trend that's been up and coming uh recently so a little history lesson too so if you guys didn't know um guys also sorry aaron um don't spam the chat because i'm gonna block you you know we're all here to learn and it's it's very annoying when somebody's just you know spamming same comment over and over so you know trying to deliver value here what is ponder let's take it serious let's let's do something that can change our lives guys so come on let's say we were adults here enjoy but what were you saying about it single page yeah so single page website so for you guys who don't know this is another um thing that has been implemented a lot recently it's a big trend over the last few years and going into the future this is going to be catching on more and more and it's another responsive thing so make your websites a lot more responsive so what this is is uh back in the day like when it never first started up right everything was everything's built on html and css i think most people know that if you're watching this video so uh the way it works is you like fetch a page and then you click the link and then it'll go fetch more html from the from the server right over and over again um but that takes a lot of time because it's like a lot of back and forth so there's a thing called single page websites that's been catching on recently and yeah on um websites like facebook google twitter like like the you know like the big mega powerhouse kind of websites and services and uh the idea is instead of like keep like talking to the server okay you guys hear the dog barking in the background i think some dogs it's upstairs and you can hear all the way here these microphones were that good but yeah so single page application websites are also known as spas spas yeah if you've ever heard that acronym before but basically all it is is just saying instead of like keep uh contacting the server over and over again just kind of like load all of it um pretty much at one time into one single mega page and then just kind of like as you click on stuff just kind of like get different segments of that so you really only contact the server like one time and then it makes it so much faster because you're not like back and forth back and forth you just get it all at one time and then you can kind of dynamically load it so uh google uses this i mean you can't really see it like on the surface level but under the hood it's implemented that way and that's how it can be so fast uh things like google facebook like as you click links and stuff like it loads a lot faster because then it doesn't have to like keep accessing the server database exactly so i didn't actually listed it here because i was going to list examples of multipage applications i actually think i might have skipped it but you know in general multipage applications are more like ecommerce websites such as amazon ebay all of these that actually have a bunch of sites or websites put together and you go like if you click a button or a link it might take you to an interwebs or a sub website sub domain of that website and here on the on the single page applications everything is handled on the same actual loaded website on your computer like aaron was saying but you know it is part of the development world right now it's kind of what is in i'd say you know get inspiration from the best companies that are out right now so another big point that we wanted to hit as well is chatbots and ai and as you can see here it's funny because like somebody put the adobe illustrator logo here for ai which is maybe they didn't know or something i mean they probably use google search like oh ai and then they found adobe illustrator but i mean it gets the message across yeah so right here they're explaining like uh they're saying when it comes to responses while an interface just presents options within with an ai chatbot you can type in your own answer so the cool thing about this man is like for example if you're having a service website or you know you deliver some kind of product anything like that we use it we use actual you know chat bots in our company you know cleverprogrammer.com if you check it out we got a chatbot there that you know they they serve different you know functions so for example you can collect data from the people that are going into your website i think one of the questions that we had is are you a beginner in programming are you intermediate or advanced you know so it's cool because you can get to know the people that visit your website a little bit more maybe you know make your product more towards them and another way to do it is in it's huge here it's customer support so ai and chat bots are used immensely in customer support you can see it in a bunch of websites so i know a lot of big websites even like youtube i believe doesn't have customer support so it'd be awesome if they can just have like a very intelligent chatbot yeah yeah so again remember the trifecta needs to be pretty responsive needs to be intelligent so um it needs to have all three you want to be like visually appealing to not lose people's patience but also needs to like make freaking sense yeah like get a tangible thing done for the user so things like chatbots and ai and then even things like recommended you know like on netflix and amazon they have recommended items yes so aaron was actually studying ai in georgia tech right yeah i was and then then i stopped to work here yeah so that was this guy deep into that world you know he was mentioning the recommended algorithms on netflix yeah yeah so stuff like this i mean like people probably already know about this i mean like every like software nowadays has an algorithm youtube algorithm you know it feeds you videos you've seen before netflix tells you your recommended shows right instagram shows you oh this these pictures you might like um and uh stuff like even like targeted ads you know like as people are clicking on stuff they start getting targeted by these ads so this is what i mean by intelligent apps you definitely want to have some kind of um algorithmic aspect to your apps to make it like really good yeah it's like i feel a little bit betrayed yeah i feel i feel a little bit betrayed when i don't see like for example if you're using any video website any any website in general and that like you use it a lot and they cannot recommend you know things that you already look for in that website as in like you know like how annoying would youtube be if like you're watching you're watching a bunch of like content that you really like right like uh whatever like let's say i'm watching sewing videos i don't actually watch sewing videos but like let's say i'm super into sewing let's just say i'm super into something yeah and hypothetically speaking hypothetically i'm just hypothetical but um i want to be seeing more sewing videos but if you just kept showing me like car videos or like dog videos over and over just random videos and it never caught on to my trend i'd be like what the heck youtube like okay cool you just told me random stuff show me more sewing show me how to knit show me how to use a sewing machine show me how to uh do hand sewing like and the cool thing about that is for example whatever it's um it's good because it makes you feel like you're one your experience of that website is personalized two it's not only does it like help me as a user the thing is that you as a website developer you know you want people to actually use the websites so you know people are going to lean towards your website if there it has an algorithm that recognizes its searches or things that you know other for example like spotify this is how i get to know a bunch of different new songs you know they recommend me songs that are similar to the songs that i listen to and then my they give me so much value by knowing by getting to know different types of music so not only is it very efficient for users to keep using your website or app but also it's um was it going to say it's it's damn i completely blanked out from my i lost my train of thought something else yeah i mean i was i was just saying how important it is um you know people are going to use it more and and actually it's it's almost this is what i was going to say so people don't like stupid apps it's like smart standard nowadays dude like it's it's now part of everything it should be part of everything pretty much so just moving forward a little bit about you know chat bots here's an example of how it would work as i was mentioning maybe customer support would be a good example of this so examples yeah just like communicating communicating with uh with the user in some intelligent way using a chatbot but then also just being intelligent in in a way like using like algorithms to do recommending stuff like pick up pick up their preferences and stuff like that correct yeah and we were watching a video by demind i believe and like i said you know we were talking about trends but ultimately it is going to be principles and the cool thing about this is that we do want to start out with foundations because man if you're looking for trends all the time and like i said this is based more of principles rather than trends but if you're looking for trends all the time you have to know the foundations for you to exploit those trends and some of the foundations with web development would be oh yeah so like okay really real real quick i see a lot of people in the comments are saying mern and mean um if you guys want those are then yeah these are huge trends as you can see we've been dropping a lot of mern stack stuff um recently and we're going to be continuing to do this into 2020 um 2021 and going forward um so mern and mean is just like using react and angular and some other stuff that we'll talk about in a bit but those are like the huge huge trends as well they're gonna tie in but to prelude that uh yeah you didn't you do need to know your basics so anybody who doesn't uh if you're watching this video and you're like oh trends uh it doesn't matter if you know the trends if you don't know the basics so you gotta learn html css and javascript first because that's kind of what everything's built on so we're just mentioning that i mean probably obvious but it's good to just mention i feel your voice going in and out a little bit yeah i don't know what's up with this because when you when you're silent it kind of kills the sound and then when you start start talking it like it it turns out for me but anyways those are the the actual foundations of web development and css to begin with is pretty much it's the pretty part of web development right so you know learn how to use different layouts of websites flexbox it's a great library for css as well as you know css is used a lot now for responsive design and like aaron was saying we're dropping a bunch of value bombs during our you know mern stacks or just you know the what is it the firebase with react you know tutorials and builds that we're dropping as well all of those things you know go deep into css and we use it in very responsive manners so if you guys are enjoying this content and you want to see something a little bit more technical then go into those videos and actually get those builds done and put them on your portfolio yeah pretty much all the apps we're building are trendy apps by definition so i mean we're talking about it here on a high level but if you actually just wanted to see examples and we built all those clones like these things going forward like by definition they're trendy because these websites are trendy yeah so like if you do what they do and you understand what they've built then that's great so yeah mern marin is very big um uh and we use a lot of firebase is firebase isn't part of marine one thing yeah mern is what mongodb express js um reacts and uh node.js and then mean is the anc the same thing but with angular instead of react so those two are are definitely big and keep an eye on those and we'll talk about those in a second beautiful and you know js is a huge part of the basics as well and js normally is the portion of you know the thing that takes action so a video playing so an image popping up anything that requires you know some movement is js everything else like html would be what wait on the website html would be what oh yeah it's just a structure i mean yeah if you guys i think most people know but html just like defines all the different parts of the website and then you have it all there then css makes it all like pretty the way presented and js is just like how do you like interact with the page and a simple way to think about it too is html is more text oriented css is more color oriented and js is more action oriented so these are a bunch of things that you can jump into regarding javascript and so those those would be the basics but you know maybe you're asking what about visual and design stuff you know maybe for all the front end developers out there you know what are the cool things that are trending right now and um a lot of people ask this question what the visual design stuff yeah so i mean what is a framework specifically a framework well yeah i mean we're talking about framers because like for the visual design stuff yeah it's like well frameworks are libraries whatever you want to call it i mean most people understand they get all worked up it's like react is a library not a framework like okay yeah you get the idea oh no it's both whatever you want to call it it's a thing that you can add on on top of javascript and html to um to make cool websites so yeah framework is just like an extension so i mean the main three we're gonna be talking about are react view and angular right yeah so so for example it's like if you're building websites and you're going to want to use you're you're building multiple websites you're going to want to use a slideshow on your website let's just say that instead of coding like instead of coding it from scratch what you want to do is you know people that build websites pretty much have code that they had already used in a specific sense as in like maybe a function or utility like a slideshow like i was mentioning people already build these type of things and those things are a framework so if you're wanting to build a web you know a responsive website there's frameworks for that so if you want to build maybe you know an android app there's frameworks for that and frameworks are pretty much specific code snippets or or actual you know functions that you can use so going deeper into frameworks these are some of the bigger ones right now and web development so angular is huge you know it's one of the biggest ones right now google as you can see google mr google there it was developed by google it has a version one and version two right now well obviously it's a version two and it got a little bit less complicated in version two i don't even i don't want to go so deep into it as we do mention in other videos and you know vue is is a very good one as well all of these are frontend frameworks yeah view is kind of the lagger though right now i feel like angular is is bigger than view it's used by more more people but i mean it's good to know um if you know all three i mean then you're pretty flying hive when it comes to like using frameworks and frontend design and stuff and then these of course and work into like the tech stacks where you're talking about like merge stacks and mean stacks so you're definitely gonna want to know um one two or three of these so view is also very new i think it's the newest one of them all right now and i think vue was made by a google employee if i'm not mistaken i actually don't even know though it's incorrect behind it yeah yeah it's super new yeah but a lot of people are leaning towards it i know it's catching up i know i watched a video by stefan mischook i believe it's yeah his name yeah this guy's cool he's like calm and intense just yeah i love him he has a bunch of experience he was saying that he himself prefers view um but it still needs to catch up so another cool one obviously that you guys know yeah from us a lot of clever programmer and papa react you guys know sunday react sunny what is up sonny how are we doing bro he's he's it's really he's really just zuckerberg you know but he with a with a mask on yeah that's him react yeah so we got a bunch of builds with react if you guys want to check them out on the channel react is huge right now there's a lot of market share for web development in react and huge companies like this kind of king right now angular is pretty good too but i mean react is like really catching on and it's so powerful like we created all the clones with react and firebase like we weren't even using for like a full merm stack or anything it was just pure react and firebase for a lot of it right so fast man yeah and it's just good like you can just kill it like firebase is a big trend too right yeah i mean we're going to talk about that exactly and we'll expand on that a little bit more so we'll react was created by facebook just like angular was created by google and here's an example of the one inside the cute little table or apps that use you know react so so angular.js the guardian which is one of the biggest you know news companies in the world right now uses angularjs upwork one of the biggest freelancing websites in the world paypal obviously you guys know paypal you know it's uh processing payments sony cool i think i believe sony is a chinese web um company japanese it's japanese pretty sure it's japanese whoa yeah yeah oh yeah japanese that's true sorry guys apologize for my ignorance airbnb uses react we built the airbnb clone instagram uses react uber eats oh beautiful i mean yeah like big things use these frameworks i mean like exactly pretty much every website uses javascript nowadays like oh every website like it's crazy it's just like a given at this point but i mean these frameworks like add a layer of um flexibility and uh like like power behind even that more so like these these websites are utilizing these frameworks to like make the websites really really uh responsive and pretty and intelligent yeah and although they are i mean not intelligent you know although they are um what's it called like front end you know framework grammarly uses this in grammarly like i don't see it have so much like ui or anything yeah i mean yeah i guess like view like what is it what is what is ipl dashboard i don't that is i don't know exactly um yeah you guys heard of those but i mean you can kind of see angular reactions that's kind of the bigger yeah oh my god all the express in alibaba right so now yeah let's talk about data oh yeah so going back to like the um response i think it's more like in the responsiveness part right yeah so like yeah they go into data so you want to explain a little bit about this yeah so um if you guys don't know there's something called sql so this is uh it stands for structured query language and all this means is a way to have your data in a database so of course everybody knows like storing data and databases is pretty much required when you are creating apps uh especially web apps because you want to store some kind of data like oh what's in the cart what's the catalog of all the products et cetera yada yada or your whole your social media profile um so there's this thing called sql structured query language which just kind of allows us to structure our data in a database which was kind of which is kind of the traditional way of housing a data in a database which is nice everything's nice and organized um but you're kind of like stuck to a structure and um recently what's been caching a little bit more uh nowadays is something called no sql which kind of just allows you to just dog pile a bunch of data usually in the form of json into um some database without worrying about like all the structures and having everything like oh this this record points to this record that points to this record that points to this record like it gets too complicated versus no sql where you can just be like here's a gigantic thing of json in here you just like dump everything in and then just get kind of like more fluid about it so like i guess you can kind of say sq is like the the structured organized approach and the note sql is just kind of like yo just put everything in here and just get smart about sifting through it quickly yeah it's also high level explanation it's also cool because like sql or sql um is a language pretty much and i guess for no sql databases you don't really need sql you really need to know sql i i bet you use sql to you know query through different searches that you want to do on these nonsql databases but all in all it's not tied up just to sql the sql language so that's an example of nosql yeah oh okay so here's a little graphic what is a nosql database um yeah pretty much so like i already touched on all these in the previous slide just now about nosql databases because you're not limited to like some kind of structured data that you can get faster performance easy replication because you can just kind of just like chunk everything together more bigger data capacity i mean big big data capability because you can just like put a bunch in there scalability uh that high scalability that ties into the big um capability uh and all that it's just it's just easier like we don't have to worry about um like oh having the structured language sounds good yeah okay i don't know if the audio is cutting i know my mic is kind of weird but i feel like they can hear me um yes a lot of people using nosql databases ask if they're they're actually scalable and you know other and we're about to mention a few of them you know firebase is a very known one i was talking to a developer mongodb yeah which is part of the stack is the leading no sql database so that's one of the big trends that's where i'm mentioning this because going to 2021 like you need to know you're murdering your mean you definitely don't know do we even put that in here i don't think we put it in the slides though i mean just we didn't mention this yeah listen listen to us the mern and the mean which ties into because that allows you to create um uh like just pretty apps that are intelligent and they are responsive and all that using these tech stacks exactly and like i was saying right now i was talking to a developer and he was mentioning to me that sometimes firebase is not you know used by bigger you know tech companies right now just because a lot of companies don't want to be tied up to a google ecosystem of their database and their whole tech firebase is from google right yeah firebase is from google and you know other like bigger scalable projects right now are using sql so sql is very used but you know the whole trend the whole movement is is going yeah it's living out because uh these merge stacks are just so powerful having like crossplatform capability like you can you can actually prioritize the mobile design going forward and then they also have like uh web apps that work on all different screen sizes and stuff um and then like you just have like the powerhouse and the the ease of implementation using the react and angular frameworks slash libraries whatever you want to call it uh and um node.js like you can house all your data on the backend and mongodb like like basically these tech stacks are the trends like the biggest ones that are coming up um but you uh you definitely want to um start transitioning to an oc yeah yeah yeah pretty much i mean just just learn mongodb you just learn learning just learn it check out our yesterday we went live david went live showing i believe was part two of the facebook clone and that uses the mern stack and it's awesome man that it the front end looks amazing so check that out you know this is an example of how it's used i feel like we already talked about this yeah so no sequels used more for gaming social i don't really know what l iot is yeah internet of things oh yeah yeah internet of things web mobile enterprise and it uses a key value store document base and column family store on nosql databases and on sql databases it's more like for web or mobile or big enterprises as i was mentioning and it also uses relational table storage i mean there's some overlap here like web is on both enterprise on both mobiles on both i think what they're trying to say mainly is the bottom there's like relationships between the data everything's like kind of tied together in this way and it can get complicated versus just like um no sql use like chunk at all like like i said like it's a dog pile of data so you can get smart about sifting through and then it's just so much easier like um easier to scale so this is more linear and this is more you know i guess it goes pretty much yeah yeah anything goes and you know just chunk it in as long as it's json just chuck it in bro yeah we'll be fine we'll figure it out so aaron was mentioning this is one of the most famous you know no sequel databases right now yeah mongodb is a big one so that's why is um the m in mern and mean so for mongodb so definitely learn this going forward in 2021 catch our murder clones that david and sonia have been doing in recent weeks for those and just like brush up on these and guys if you guys are enjoying the content right now we are at 134 likes on this video that is amazing let's try to get to 150 likes let's get it guys thank you thank you guys so much for being here so firebase is another big you know no sql database right now in the industry and yeah you love this this isn't part of murder mean um but we've been using it recently uh first of all because sunny's a badass using react and firebase together so this is kind of like its own little mini tech stack so you should learn merin and mean but also learn firebase because um it's just so powerful like the netflix sloan was powered by it um i don't know what other clones i haven't seen all sony's clones but i know a lot of them pretty much almost all of them are using firebase and it's it's a it's a really really hot trend it just makes it so easy to handle your data in your databases um so in addition to mern and mean definitely learn firebase we should we should uh um i have our own tech stack like r like rf react react firebase oh yeah yeah yeah rf that's cool we're an rf guys for tony the cool thing about the sunny way the cool thing about firebase is that it's very easy to implement i've seen sony implemented i myself don't have much experience with yeah or anything at all yeah but you know i know it's one of the trending nosql databases but i've seen the setup of it and it's so easy it's so user friendly so smooth it's like pretty much plug and play colleen colleen exactly so these are the bigger names and you know there's a little conclusion here for you guys yeah yeah pretty much i just want to recover again so basically the main takeaways are uh yeah definitely learn your mirn your mean and your your firebase along with that um but the idea the biggest trends when it comes to like a high level remember like do mobile first because most people um are on their phones nowadays and that's only going to increase going forward as the i mean there's new smartphones coming out every year you know like apple's releasing their new iphone in what month probably less than a month i think so i mean they always leak i don't know probably something like that but i mean the idea is you know like smartphones ain't going away and then um you know ar and vr is coming later too but just focus on moa for now uh the other important thing is just having it cross platform so this is where um the merin and mean come in come in handy because uh you're able to create um apps that are just like good across every platform so martin is for mongodb right so that allows you to house your data really well um e is the express js which is uh i believe it allows you to house data for the mobile stuff um a lot and then uh reactor angular is for the nice pretty front end and then node.js just allows you to hold your data as well so crossplatform specifically is you can use it in a lot of different mediums yeah i'm just we're just mentioning that because uh you want to make sure that your apps work everywhere or if it works on a different screen sizes crossplatform just means like oh does it work on the web does work on your phone does it work on your is your local app all that stuff uh but just make sure that you are prioritizing mobile first because that's the biggest trend that's happening here and then also make sure it's class platform but using mern and mean uh kind of covers that cross platform for you it's just it makes it nice and easy and then uh again remember the trifecta make sure your apps are responsive make sure they're pretty make sure they're intelligent uh in order to for it to be a good opportunity people aren't going to want to use your like just make sure it has all three exactly exactly so that's a good baseline for you guys to base yourself upon yeah you know responsive pretty intelligent are then using what i mean rpi or rip only love it love it yeah so let me see what you guys are saying on the comments do we see any cool comment um i would some do say i would use laravel php and node so all of those things you know guys you know do implement them right now they are trends like i said based on principles and if you guys see websites that have these points you're gonna see how better it is to use those type of websites for example single page applications or realtime website applications or you know yeah i mean okay so we mentioned the single page applications like when you use like angular and react basically this response of this stuff is built in it's baked in so we mentioned these trends but the best way to actually implement these trends is again just use mern mean and rf the the react fire yeah it'll it'll be responsive by definition um you have all of like the mobile uh functionality and everything you have like the cross platform capability all through those tech stacks that's the point of a tech stack is just being jack like across all these things that matter and um the only thing that we kind of didn't really talk too much about is the intelligent part like actually adding an algorithm stuff you're going to know something you know some python um probably to get to get all that implemented but uh that's also important too but i mean arguably that might be the hardest one yep yep so all right guys that was pretty much the whole list for you guys like i said do implement this if you guys are enjoying this content make sure to smash that like button subscribe to the channel also check out the other builds that aaron was talking about all the mern stack builds that we have been dropping these past weeks and everything even the older well i say older but it's like a month old you know all the apps that we were building as well sunny and qazi were building i think it was facebook you know google freaking instagram tinder all of these huge websites that are trending right now we show you exactly step by step how to build their interfaces and if you guys want to become a javascript developer make sure to hit the link in the description below so you guys can see how we built netflix and we've seen so many students you know build these type of builds put them on the portfolio and actually land jobs so you know if you take it serious if you do just you know want to step a little bit back from the theory and actually get into practice it's a great way to start especially if you want to learn web development yep awesome thank you guys for watching this was frankie this was aaron and um yep just remember uh pretty responsive intelligent our burn and mean in rf that's exactly conclusion just just do that and then watch our watch our clones and you'll be pretty pretty good to go for 2021. take it easy guys thank you much thank you so much for watching this was the top web development trends in 2021 yup peace we'll see you in the next video peace guys take it easy
