today i want to address an issue in the programming community and what we are at clever programmer trying to get rid of completely let me address this today is going to be a rant on elitism when it comes to programming there's this crew of weird freaking people that get their high from making everybody else feel low about themselves and they live on platforms like stack overflow they live on platforms like reddit do i mean every single programmer is like that of course not but a lot of programmers are like that even a lot of programmers on youtube and our mission at clever programmer is to get rid of every single one of them and have the most positive community in the world so i'm going to show you something i came across something pretty awesome on quora and this answer actually has 64 000 views and 370 upvotes so a lot of people and developers actually agree with this and it's basically about why stack overflow sucks j jesse james richard and here's what he says he goes stack overflow is such a piece of [ __ ] here is a perfect example i asked the question about facebook graph api that was immediately downvoted by the person let me actually just move this out of the way here real quick all right here we go by the person who sent me a link to the exact documentation i explicitly said i had reviewed endlessly before asking the question now i don't know about you guys but that exact thing has happened to me multiple times the problem wasn't in my code it inevitably was fixed because the documentation didn't note that there was a deprecated field but rather than saying i don't know the person answering had to make a fool out of himself because he didn't know but wanted to express a modicum of digital power that is such a beautiful phrase express a modicum of digital power this is so true a lot of these weird nerdy people living behind the scene they never actually come out and talk to anybody which is why they have trouble getting the jobs that other people are getting and making six figures and more and why they want to like yank your leg and pull you down and they used to do that [ __ ] to me but where are we at now baby this is the power of not listening to the [ __ ] haters and just doing what you were born to do on this planet so let's get back to this this is what people who are lower than you do to you to make you feel lower here are the things okay and now i just want to say i don't mean all stack overflow is bad right there are a lot of good people and of course same thing with reddit but a lot of this a lot of people what they make you feel about coding they make you feel patron that's patronizing their behavior they are condescending to you in ways that you don't even expect which is why so many people actually quit coding or people who have imposter syndrome who don't even want to call themselves developers even though they are pretty damn good let me keep going with this okay and it breaks my heart because i know a lot of people are beginners and this is the stuff that stops them or makes them feel stupid now he goes anytime i have a serious and i mean a serious question like i cannot figure out the answer after hours of pulling my hair out i then spend a few more hours wondering if i should even bother asking anything on that site because 50 50 i might get an answer or get immediately downvoted or closed generally with some shitty comments guys how many times has this happened to you it's happened to me where i'll post a question and they'll be like duplicated content and i'm like what for using the word the like what was duplicate about this and i used to post really good i learned stock overflow i got good at it i had tons of points but and i and it helped me too but i think for a lot of beginners it's a place that can be toxic for a lot of people and it stops you from becoming a developer a better developer once you're kind of out of that mental rut then you don't care then you just keep going let me keep going with this there are genuinely awesome people on there that will help work out a problem often taking time to work through complex issues with you that's awesome and generally when asking a question the problems are more complex than the mods would pretend so a lot of the times those mods just make it seem like oh this problem is like super simple just move past it and he goes if you're doing sysadmin db admin and applications among other things it goes without saying you're wearing a lot of hats and you're not an expert on everything so the experts need to put you in your place and destroy any meaningful opportunity to help anyone else out there solve the same problem and equally annoying is people solving their problem and not sharing the solution so on this note i mean you can't really control what people do but here we can try to control what the mods do and maybe just maybe the mods could be a little more lenient or a little bit more positive you guys look tyrannies right there tyrannies that have worked but then they're overthrown and then eventually they get taken over by democracies and a lot of the world has changed to a place of democracy and what comes with that there is a little bit of politics there is a little bit of not even politics just human to human connection right and you can let somebody else down but you don't have to make them feel like [ __ ] that is absolutely up to you and if you do that to people you my friend are a piece of [ __ ] so that is one thing that is not good to do to put other people down you'll always have a choice it's a choice to gently let somebody down to gently explain hey maybe this is not a good idea you should have done it this other way i think mods can develop a more encouraging language even if they have to let you down i think that's extremely important because remember you're dealing with human beings here right you're dealing with a person who's maybe a father who's trying to do this and then he can get a job so then he can put food on his table his family's table but that mod who doesn't care about anything might say something and it might make that person quit now what right let me keep going with this i hate that site i mean it's also funny this one because i hate that site if you didn't get that from this post and 50 of the people on it as do most people who use it for help rather than use it for a sounding board for their pathetic lives the fact that people generally hate going to that site goes to show how shitty it is the fact that people even consider if even asking a question on that site goes to show how shitty it is the fact that this is a known fact goes to show how shitty it is the fact that this is a question on quora goes to show how shitty that site is i look forward to the day someone built something that's not such a shitty piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] stack overflow man so wow this guy was really burnt i'm sure the comments are pretty good too i haven't read the comments stack exchange was started because people hated this site that's funny and the cycle continues you are absolutely correct um yep so a lot of there's a lot of hate there there's a lot of like people who are trying to make you feel low but there are also a lot of good people what my message is to a lot of you is don't become a part of anything that's toxic or negative for your mind there are plenty of other communities that are going to be helpful to you they're free discord channels free slack communities you can try to go get help there just i want you to get this picture out of your mind where all developers are extremely mean people a lot of them are not like that they're just some weird people who sit on forums all day and they don't have human interaction they turn into a little bit of nut cases and then they need people like me and other people to just [ __ ] wake them up because now we have a platform now we can do that sunny is a great example of somebody who's on the team who's a phenomenal developer but is also a good human being me i'm a great developer i am also a great human being at least i like to think so because i try to treat people fairly i try to treat people nicely and i don't do the type of stuff that people just often do on these types of platforms so if you are new put your head down do the work don't be discouraged by some of these people just know that there's a lot of positivity around if you're in the world of coding just know that you're not going to be alone that you have people that are supporting you you just have to look for them you can look for them in instagram you can look them in for them in facebook groups you could try to find them on meetups try to find them you have to actually work hard but get out of any type of toxic community when it comes to coding because there are just a ton of them join our clever programmer community come to our live sessions on youtube you will see what a healthy community looks like the cp family you guys who are on this channel it's just absolutely amazing the energy that you bring here every single day and i thank you for it guys there's a positive light out there avoid stuff that brings you down breathe in focus on the positivity get through it and again our mission at clever programmer is to help 5000 people get jobs in 2020 as developers so let's keep on going let's keep on crushing it and maybe in the comments you can let me know maybe what's a thing that bothers you about elitism when it comes to coding maybe what's an incident where you experienced somebody being an elitist with you when it came to coding did they make you feel dumber did they say something to make you feel patronized or were they condescending to you in any way i want a story drop it in the comments i want to read it and maybe i want to make another video addressing your guys's stories with that said i love your beautiful face this is qazi positivity love and kindness above everything and [ __ ] anyone who tells you otherwise there are kind people in this world who want to give you love who want to teach you and bring you value and we at clever programmer want to be that community for you we love your beautiful face this is qazi and i'll see you in the next video
