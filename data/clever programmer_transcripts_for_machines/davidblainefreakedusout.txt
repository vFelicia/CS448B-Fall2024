this [ __ ] is [ __ ] nuts fsl david blaine there's about 14 000 plus feet in the air right now i forgot emily told me yeah i would have been watching i woke up at 5 55 a.m i got one to pick up and the problem is since he's only going up it only gets worse and worse and colder holy [ __ ] oh guys we just got done with a pretty epic day i mean we're going to be going back and continuing our learning and growing it's about 3 30 p.m jonathan just gave me a good idea to give advice to beginner programmers and i'm going to go ahead and do that so if you are a beginner programmer one of the most important things i can tell you is that you have these feelings of feeling frustrated with programming like you don't get it um like you're maybe not smart enough to be able to get it or that you might not ever actually get a job or make an income with it so maybe you might even want to stop what i will say to you is guys it never stops feeling like that that feeling of you thinking you're not good when it comes to coding and programming it never ever goes away and um you know communities like stack overflow and whatnot you know it's good in its own way but they make sure of that because even when you post questions there a lot of the people in the community kind of make you feel like you're not good enough or you're not smart enough so you might feel those things happen to you but so many of you don't know that you're so close to getting that internship you're so close to getting a junior level developer job where somebody is looking for your heart and your willingness to learn coding rather than even how damn good you are right now because they're thinking man if i can pick this person up and they want to learn they're hungry we can give them guidance and make them good mostly the problem that a lot of you have is you're learning but maybe that's all you're doing so you feel like you're not really making any forward progress whereas if you were at a company all the learning you would be doing would be towards building something and the developers there would be teaching you how to do that one thing i can tell you though might help a little bit is that on our youtube channel we are building projects every single day real world projects as long as you can build those types of projects and put them on your portfolio that gives you something tangible that you can show to a potential employer all people who have never looked at technology have been able to pick up programming and learn coding it's all about not really allowing that thought in your head and just sitting down and getting to work starting to put in the work starting to see and be fascinated by what you can do with it and learning it in the right way so message you is please don't quit keep going be curious ask questions learn programming is a beautiful beautiful thing thank you so much for joining the five day react javascript challenge i'm so excited to have you in this five day challenge make sure you join the facebook group and share this with all of your friends because it's going to hold you accountable and it's going to make you be there and put in the work that's required now come closer now what i want to let you know is this challenge has the potential to change your life a lot of our students just from watching our live streams on youtube and watching us build projects like the spotify clone or the netflix clone or the tick tock because the tinder cone got jobs with all of those projects the amazon one people got jobs just with this app so what we're going to be building in here the amazon project it's as real world as it gets and you have a very real potential to get freelancing work or fulltime jobs so please bring your heart bring your soul into this and give it all you got because it has the potential to help you kick start your career as a developer with that said i'm so pumped and excited to have you in here click that button below join the group share this with your friends and i'll see you inside peace this is literally one of my favorite things on the planet that i've purchased they said money can't buy you happiness you [ __ ] bought her bro i bought my happiness it's programming is literally like having a genie but instead of having three wishes you have unlimited wishes but the only thing is you have to learn how to speak to the [ __ ] genie that's the only thing if you can put in the time to work to learn how to speak with the gene then you can create anything think of mark zuckerberg right he created facebook every time you log into facebook you are literally entering the brain of mark zuckerberg every time you log in every time you log into amazon and use it you are entering a universe that jeff bezos at some point created so that to me is really fascinating that to me is really powerful because even if somebody who's a painter you can only experience experience that painting by looking at it if you are somebody who does video you can only experience their video by viewing it just like you guys are viewing this right now but if you can build a project or an app people have to get inside of that and they get to experience what you have created nothing else has that same experience that programming allows you to do to be able to make an app that people actually get inside of where they're inside of your brain and they're experiencing that's to me that's like art but alive all right guys i hope you enjoyed today's vlog again it's something brand new that we're doing and we are reading all of your guys's comments so i know it's zacky tallip you left an awesome comment on the twominute vlog that we did yesterday and you know you were like him this is so inspiring blah blah blah so if this is helpful to you guys do let us know we read it and we care and that tells us should we put out more content like this or not and my message to you guys is one of just like positivity and love like we're in this community we're together and let's make sure that we make this family feeling with clever programmer right we keep it strong keep it growing just remember who you are as a person and keep your focus keep coding like just don't quit because you never know where it can lead you right for me coding played in really weird ways and i didn't really know what i was going to do but now it gave me an amazing life and it allows me to have a lot of people on the team and then grow clever programmers so i had a very crazy journey but i'm really happy with where i'm at right now and i can't imagine where i'm gonna be going but it's not a race everybody's on a different pace so just be patient and just put in the work when it comes to programming and coding trust me it's worth it it's worth it to put in that [ __ ] hard work and do it because most people can't so if somebody who has no experience where they can pick it up and learn and start doing things and have fun you can too with that said i love your beautiful face this is qazi and as always i'll see you in the next video smash that like button by the way i forgot to say that and subscribe to the channel turn on the notification bell if you haven't already and i'll see you in the next video peace
