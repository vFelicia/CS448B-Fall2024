coding session it's uh currently 1 to 2 a.m. I'm just coding still uh in San Francisco and um I'm going to keep on coding and if you want to hang out here and just say hi welcome I'm excited I'll be playing some music and just coding and then if I want to take on any questions I'll take on any questions so be more of a chill chill stream and I'll also play some music hopefully the stream won't get taken down we own this music it's our music be a full stack 2024 yeah JavaScript the foundation okay I just made it public maybe now it'll go live I'm not sure let's see yo we're live for sure for

want you to let me know if you like the the new one I'll play for if you like that one more so this was this this one is called road map to fullsack developer the one I just played it's on Spotify so you guys can check it out but I'll play another one for you guys this is a new one that I made um and just hear it fixing in no time for play most of my day searching this isue my but they don't understand this is my passion I'm taking a stand be to I'll go this is my life and I'll never stop no matter the yeah that one you guys like this one too somebody said it's a banger bro Bo boboho chat yeah I like that one too yeah basically what I want to do is I'm having these like coding sessions and I'm just kind of alone and sometimes I want to hang out with you guys holy [ __ ] yeah it's like so late here that it's literally the lights are turning off I got to go turn the lights on so basically what I want to start doing is just like start hanging out here with you guys as I as I do coding sessions I mean okay Kenny if you're in UK yes it's a morning for you but for me in U San Francisco it's like like 2 a.m. um the these are like like separate screens you know this here and this here they latch on so then I get like three screens pretty much anywhere I go so it's like kind of like this um so yeah it's a setup that I I think it's pretty cool and I I like it um but yeah basically I want to start hanging out with you guys in coding sometimes at like you know cuz I'm coding 10 12 hours a day I'm building a product with my cofounder Nas and we're building a new products called poppy Ai and we're going to be launching this and essentially the idea behind poppy AI is visualizing note taking and turning that into output like written output so imagine mirror board which is a Whiteboard app and Google doc or notion had a baby together and so we're building that and we'll see if it's going to stick with people or not but so far poppy AI for example can allow you to talk to YouTube videos and make notes out of that talk to voice notes and make note out of that it will soon be able to talk to images and make notes out of it and what we're trying to do is make mind maps out of it and so it allows you to think and turn all your messy thoughts on the left hand side and turn it into something that actually right on the right hand side it's not a pitch for the product by the way so I'll shut up uh that's not my point I'm like literally just coding it building it and it's not even publicly available or anything yet we're like building it right now I'll answer you guys' questions too as they come along um is is web 3 actually worth it to learn instead of AI learn what what brings you passion like for me AI brings me a lot of passion and excitement so learn learn web 3 if you enjoy poppy AI ads come on your YouTube how I don't have any ads I haven't been running any paid ads yet I'm doing coding for fun for myself but also I'm building a company a startup and so for that I have to be sitting here and coding um and I'm literally coding every day for 10 to 12 hours a day I mean again right now show you my Apple watch you know if I show you my Apple watch which is really annoying because it just never wants to show itself but yeah if you can read that it says 121 a.m. um and you know I've been sitting here this desk probably since 1200 p.m. um 13 hours today and similar yesterday and the day before that and yeah I just get bored not no no [ __ ] that it's the opposite of what I meant to say I I am I enjoy it so much but what I miss is having somebody around me sometimes cuz I'm like just coding and so I'd like to brainstorm or I'd like to you know maybe just give you Vibes while you're coding too you know almost a coworking um together and it's just fun to be able to chat with you guys as I code so I'm thinking to start doing this where I just like go live just code play some music you know and then you guys can just code along with me um and then yeah we interact in the meantime so that would be a lot of fun best AI course I mean there's a lot I have course called profit with the ey which is an incredible course so you can check that out please update the code for the challenge yeah xity for sure like just open up your laptop start coding and I'll be coding right here so we're pretty much coding together then you know you can just chat in here and let me know how's how the your code is going how it's working and all that that'd be dope yeah python is pretty good for I'll link you the profit with the ey course I just linked it to you um and you can check that out Naas is not doing that much web 3 right now so I'm going to be going in between like hanging out with you guys and then coding so I'll probably go back into coding I'm like learning about nextjs server side actions they're pretty freaking awesome and I haven't really ever used them that much but they're so much better than doing your traditional API routing so I'm looking that up and just having some much fun with that so I'm going to go back into that and then I'll interact with you guys too at random points but in the meantime just hang out enjoy the music it'll be a Vibe mod months of practice that's what it's going to take building app with AI That's the path to make qu a let a job in the tech industry got to stay ahead with the latest

skills to Hell Fire Bas for the back and keep your data tight but this more to learn the future right Jack and cl LM on the got master so I'll I'll keep sharing any new things that I'm learning with you guys so one of the things that I've picked up just now is getting structured responses from an llm and that's been fascinating cuz I mean I used to do that and I used to kind of force my llms to respond with the Json and I would do it in a hacky way where I would just do a lot of prompt engineering and stuff like that but now I'm learning ways to do that where you could programmatically force it to be in that structure and return it always returns a Json response it's really powerful um how that works and cell has SDK for it and there is a typescript first validation schema called sod and that allows you to do that and enforce it basically it's so yeah it's just really cool cuz you get you get your data back in Json which is exactly usually how you want it um instead of getting it just as a strength cuz then you can't do much with it so I wish I could share my screen and show you guys more uh which I will in the future but for now just enjoy learning from my words um my MacBook specifications I forget but it's a pretty souped up MacBook it's like 45k or 6K I don't know how much I paid for it but it's pretty souped up so it's like I'll here let me just try to tell it to you CU I always forget my specs um M2 so not an M M3 but M2 max memory is 96 gigs so that's what I'm rocking um web 3 content probably not anytime soon it would recommend for me and yes silic can chips is what I have this is the thanks for looking out for me for helping me improve my posture yes see this is what I need this what I need you guys here with me I need your help I got to fix my posture here this will force my posture to be better but no I don't get neck pain dude I'll sit like that for eternity yeah water damn that's true no I don't have anything in my bag I'll just have to be thirsty for now I'll put the chat on the right hand side is there a way I can pop chat up pop out chat there we go yeah this is a coworking space that I'm at right now not from home man I'm loving this like I'm I'm just so excited I'm learning about server reactions and I'm like this is going to be so cool once I really figure it out inside out okay let's see how this is like this is what I'm studying right now I'll just drop the link in the chat but this is what this is the docs I dropped in the link the description or in the chat that's just what I'm looking up and learning and playing around with right now I want to live stream my screen scar f so I'm asking Claude because I live stream I want to live stream and I want to share my coding screen but I get scared sometimes cuz I don't want to reveal any end keys and I'm this is a real project right this is not a dummy project I'm doing for YouTube or just like a fun project for YouTube and teaching purposes and I'm asking if I can make it where in Visual Studio code n files just do not show like even if I by by mistake like open it it just never shows and I'm wondering if I can make a script or write a script or something like that that would be really cool so I'm just talking to Chad GPT and asking asking about that for for oh I can do that there's something called exclude nice okay that's cool don't and if I do that yep it hides it okay and then if i n. n but does my stuff still work it it does whoa that's freaking cool okay so that means that if I have all my ends inside here then even on a live stream I don't have to worry about my keys being shown cuzz they will just be I won't even be able to open those files so that's great they'll just hide it from the file explorer that's really good to know I wish I knew this before I did so many streams and then I just have to mentally remember to not show end files I need a lifter screen ooh posture again yeah you're right damn how do I remember this [ __ ] I constantly keep forgetting cuz when I get like sucked into it perfect posture damn but now I'm too far so like now I can't read [ __ ] and I got to get closer to read oh yeah yeah I have the lifter

girls um I think I'm GNA call it a night I'll probably still sleep in a few hours but I think I'm going to call it a night now was a good day we did 13 12 13 hours learned a lot pushed shipped a lot of features probably a week from now this SAS product will go live and we will start to have initial people starting to use it which will be very exciting but yeah I would love to do this again with you guys if you would be down and uh maybe come along and code with me open up your laptops and let's start building stuff I'd love to build a community of people who are building things and developing apps and that would be a lot of fun to do uh kidra says I'm down yeah that'd be awesome like come on down next time and just you know let's just all code together that's the idea so you know basically my goal is to create almost like a coworking environment but just online so live and yeah you know hopefully we build stuff and we can even do something where we hold each other accountable and we set like onewe goal and so you know if you're here you want to build something you set a onee goal of like this is what I want to build this is how far I want to get and then I hold you accountable and we in the community hold you accountable and then I'll do similar where I'll set a goal and you guys hold me accountable to that and so and then we can have weekly Sprints so that would be something super fun to do but yeah I just thought today to just go live and code so I did it was fun but I'm going to call it a night and I'll see you guys soon by the way hit me up if any of you guys want to be a part of this hit me up on Instagram and then we can time it together so that'll be fun then I'll go live and then we'll go we'll uh start doing this together um and on Instagram I'm real clever programmer so just DM me there all right peace Charles thanks for coming Charles thanks for coming gor F Fudan I appreciate you Emperor appreciate you C you there thanks man appreciate it all right guys take care peace how do I turn this off
