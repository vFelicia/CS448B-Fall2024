one wrong line of code can cost you billions of dollars this is what just recently happened if you are not aware all Microsoft computers recently just kind of went down millions of them were affected by it and there was absolute chaos there was flight shortages hospitals not being able to provide medical care because their computers were shutting down everybody's computers at home were shutting down and able to use and this was not a Cyber attack but it was actually just a uh byproduct of writing bad code like here's some funny but also crazy stuff happening so this guy over here made a tweet and he's saying that uh this is the first time in his life he got a handwritten boarding pass and it's also funny to me because I'm such a Mack Advocate my whole life and I just feel part of me feels Vindicated for all those going go Mac Windows microsof so I'm Sorry by the way if you're suffering from this and if you are actually drop it in the comments below I want to know if it's affecting you as well and the problem is there's probably some developer that ended up writing this code and didn't think it was going to be that bad but one little misstep in attention to detail can cause just everything to go down and it's probably an intern it's probably somebody who's a junior developer I mean it could even be stand our developer but mostly the problem is lack of attention to detail it isn't so much all of us just writing bad code it's not fully paying attention and what's sad is to cover up that person's mistake of course the CEO and the founder of the company has to explain what happened and take responsibility and here's kind of his response when he was put on the spot on TV and look at how nervous he got single software bug can have such a profound and immediate impact well when you look at the complexity of cyber security you're always trying to stay one excuse me one step ahead of the adversaries excuse me and just one second please oh yeah take take a drink of water she goes yeah take a drink of water that's I mean what are you going to do so this is tough but this is what happens when you're not like the more we go into this world of Chad G and Claude and everything else that's right in code for you you need to also understand that you still have a big job to do which is you still need to pay attention to what it's writing you still need to verify and double check and triple check and quadruple check the code and you need to test it relentlessly especially if you're a security company especially if you're only job is to secure things so this a mistake can happen to anybody it just sucks when it happens at such a big scale and it's sad because this is what the world of Microsoft is looking like right now the Dre reded blue screen of death and we all know that and we've all seen it I used to use Windows computers as well before um when I was a juvenile when I used to play video games and then I switched over to um Apple but I just want to send you this message and it's just like hey pay attention to details you still have to learn coding you still have to learn how it works under the hood even when the AI keeps getting stronger there needs to be somebody who can still debug but your debugging is going to to start going to a higher higher level and you're going to need to start becoming Smarter with how you use these tools and I also want to show you like the emotional consequences of that code right and how it affects people so take a look at this all right now get on this all right so everyone's going to shut up and we're going to this once and we're only going to say it again CU we're frustrating as h I'm sorry and so I'll pause it but you can see the absolute chaos that's happening here right like all these people waiting on their flights missing their flights I mean one of my friends told me that uh she was she was flying out and uh uh she got delayed by 25 hours um that's how long the delay was in her flight because things shut down and there were other people now luckily for her she was just kind of flying back home but she met this one lady and now one lady's uh I believe nephew died of cancer and the funeral was happening so like she couldn't afford to miss that flight she needed to go and you know kind of just U see him one last time and so uh my friend then ended up helping them and helping them book their flight but like that's the level of impact that can happen right and you don't really realize it because you're just like okay I'm just going to do this one line of code and then I'm just going to hit push and it should go live and then that's it things should be fine and as much as I like to joke around and Raz Microsoft it's not necessarily just Microsoft you know this could happen on Mac this could happen on Linux it can happen on anything it just so happened that it happened with Microsoft understand why this happened this is what low attention to detail looks like this is what happens when you care less this is what happens when you don't really give a it's not necess Lally the consequences of being bad it's a consequence of some people's lack of care lack of attention to detail now attention to detail isn't something you can just magically develop but it can be developed if you spend a lot of time learning and learning how to learn faster because the quicker you learn from your mistakes the less likely you are to then make them later and so if you speed up your learning progress you're genuinely going to just end up making more mistakes and when you make more mistakes you look back at them and you learn from them and it's a feedback and it's a loop and it keeps feeding on itself and I was talking with a friend of mine named IOD and he said something incredible he said learning is uh just reflection and intention and that actually summarizes deep learning and so it blew my mind because if you think about how AI learns it's just reflecting and then it's setting an intent so what does that mean it goes over its own games by itself so if it's trying to get better at chess it just plays a game and then it goes back and gives itself feedback off of that chess game and then it sets an intention of like I'm going to take those learnings and apply them to the next game and then it just does that every single time so if you do that you'll start to get better so I want to show you a tool uh me and my friend Nas actually built so that it could help you learn faster as a programmer and so here's an example so let's say this video right my good friend Tim Tech with he has a video that he dropped how to practice programming so you actually get good right so this is an example of a video I'm going to grab the link and I'm going to now paste this in the tool that we've created so here's an example I po this video in here right now I'm going to create a chat next to this and and I'm just going to take this video and connect it to the chat and now I'm just going to say hey give me I'm going to click this button says get key inside so it's going to going to just give me the key insights from this video he going to say hey here are the key things that he actually says uh from this video so I'm going to say give me some examples of that with some code and so now I can immediately start to take what I'm learning from this video and get some examples with code or I can say based on his video give me some practice exercise SL projects and now you see how I'm just taking his video and I'm interacting with it so that in speeds up my learning process so much and I can go on YouTube and I can type in more things like how to learn programming fast so that way I don't just have Tech with Tim but I have other people that I can learn from so here are some other great videos um I know developed by Ed is pretty damn good and he gives really good advice so I'm just going to copy this and I'm also going to paste this so now I got his video here as well and I can plug that in and now I can say what does developed by Ed say and so now it'll tell me what his video is actually saying and so I'm getting now feedback from both of the videos and now I can say based on both of these videos give me uh one example uh project and so now I'm combining both of those videos and it's saying hey start with the personal task manager web app and you can see how you can start to build on top of this knowledge base and it's not just that but you can also pop in your own code if you write your code into here for example and then you can connect that code here as well and say hey based on the code I wrote does that seem in line with what they're talking about and then it can start to get bigger and bigger and better and it can also help you with coding projects doing because sometimes in Chad GPT it's hard to give it all of the context here you can actually make a bunch of these notes paste everything and that'll serve as a knowledge base so this everything here that's on the left hand side is essentially a visual knowledge base and you can just connect and power this up so the reason I'm sharing this with you is because you can see how making mistakes can be so absolutely devastating and like took down essentially Microsoft uh you know maybe for a couple of days they'll be back up but it damaged Microsoft it damaged the crowdstrike company quite a lot and if you have tools like these where you can learn way faster you know here you can connect multiple different sources and verify like basically what I would do if I was that developer right is on the left hand side let me take this away on the left hand side I'll have all the company knowledge base of the security stuff that like I need to know or the tests that I need to it needs to run through and make sure it's good and then when I write my code I would have this run it through um and then check like hey is this code good is this going to cause any problems and he could use this to essentially double check as well but more importantly he can use this to learn even the stuff in his own company and maybe he would avoid these null pointer type of mistakes I think that's kind of what happened there was a something with C++ that caused the problem I know I saw it on Twitter but like you know Twitter so it could also be wrong um but if you guys know what happened you can let me know but these are the types of things it could help you catch and it could help you fix so we made this tool so you guys can use it you guys could use this visual knowledge base and really learn 10x faster than any of your competition so I would love for you to check it out and I want to see how this would help you as a developer with that said if you want to check it out I've put the link in the description where I'm giving you a 3day free trial to use this as much as you want and if you don't like it you can cancel it before the 3 days if you do like it and love it only then keep it beyond the 3 days I think it's going to provide you with a lot of value it's going to be a thing that's going to make your colleagues jealous like how are you learning so fast what the heck is this thing and it just gets so damn powerful over time right where like if I have notes about my company I can literally start recording them in here so now it's capturing my voice and it's recording so as you can see on the left hand side here and if I get done speaking those notes or maybe it's this email that I just want to like kind of Speak Out Loud kind of casually if I hit end now that recording is also going to serve essentially as a knowledge base and you can see the transcript is here and it's made a title for my uh audio recording and I can even connect that now all of this is working as a visual knowledge base and you can use that to get the output that you want so super powerful I'd love for you to give it a try click the link below jump on the training uh sorry not the training but jump on the app and I do believe it's going to change your life we have so many customers who are dropping testimonials and sharing how much it's helped them I'll actually show you some so here's our slack and right inside of our slack right we have some customers here like one of our customers here is like I I'm definitely very impressed with the ease of it and the UI I like the concept more than just other normal DND like AI tools drag and drop AI tools and so this has that fory right where it's like a really nice UI and everything we had another person Curran and he goes thanks this worked this is a killer product I'm a blogger and it made many of my processes easy and he's asking if we have an affiliate program because he wants to share with other people uh unearthly use it he's like been using poyi can't stress how much I love it over all the other AI tools if you guys don't have poppy AI what are you doing um Holly used it and she said hey Nas I just got poppy this is how my brain works too it's been difficult to organize everything in my head with the tools out there I'm looking forward to being able to use Google Docs with it I really hope it can help me connect all the docs I've created that probably repeat my thoughts and extrapolate usable content from them you've just created what I think will be a GameChanger to getting the information I want to learn quickly I saw this as a possibility of a already I think books may end up being a thing of the past by changing how we get information so we got lots of students that are loving it lots and lots of testimonials and I would like for you to check it out and see how it impacts you and changes your life so super excited for you to give it a go love your face and I'll see you in the next video
