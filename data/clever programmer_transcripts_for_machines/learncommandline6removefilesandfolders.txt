hey guys welcome back to the learn command line tutorial so what if we want to remove a file that's where I I told you guys we're going to pick back up so let's jump into that so remember how we C created playground we're going to remove that from here and then I will have you go and practice that so removing is a very simple command it's just RM okay RM that's it followed by it takes in an argument so you pass it what you want it to delete so we can say RM playground okay and it says RM playground is a directory so you can't necessarily remove directories in one go I'll teach you a trick for that as well that it's a little bit more advanced but you need to pass it a switch dasr for now just do it without kind of really thinking about it but later on I'll show you guys uh how it actually works okay so I did rm R playground it goes examine files in directory I said yes and then it goes remove playground I said yes y means yes and it essentially removed it it's not there anymore notice playground is gone how cool is that I didn't do anything it was just magic I didn't have to touch the goey it just took care took care of it for me well now let's bring playground back so I'm going to do mkdir playground and we should have it back and in playground let's just add a file all right let's add a new file so um what would be the fastest way to add a file here playground new file okay kind of don't worry about how I did that so much because whoops don't need that one don't need that one I just needed to create this file here that says some example whatever uh we don't care what it actually is we just care it's a file it could have been a movie it could have been uh a picture a JPEG file a PNG file mov file it really doesn't matter I just needed to create a file uh I have again I have some other shortcut set up for my Sublime Text to open and I essentially am saying open Sublime Text or St here in the current directory which is the one period I explained to you guys in the last video two periods as Parent Directory so a previous directory but what I want to show you after creating this file is how to remove the file well that's is just simple as RM example um oh I'm sorry I have to So currently I'm in documents I need to go into playground so once I'm in playground and I hit LS I'll see example.py which is right here example.py and I'm going to do RM playground or sorry example and when I hit tab remember to hit Tab and autocomplete and I'm going to hit enter let's see what happens it goes remove example.py I'm going to say yes and it removed it and be careful be very careful when you're using these remove commands because if you remove something it's gone forever it's not going to go into your recycling bin where it's going to stay for 30 days and let you delete it and clean it up out of there or retrieve it later it's just wiped off of your your hard drive right away so when you are using RM these commands just make sure that you know what you're doing when you're running these commands now when you do RM it might not ask you like are you sure you want to delete I have set it to that so I can't delete anything by mistake uh but regardless just be careful when you're running this command okay that's how you remove files and that's how you remove folders that's it for this video I'll show you perhaps in the next video how we can rename files and folders okay I'll see you there
