hey guys aaron here from cleverprogrammer and i'm here with daniel so um he's never actually been on a stream before but daniel actually currently works at blue origin as a software developer um and so i got him on here on this call really quick and he and i are going to be riffing about is college worth it for uh programmers so i currently have my video on my screen i should be here um but yeah we're gonna be going over is college worth it for programmers in 2020 uh and beyond so uh we're just going to be having a conversation really here hey guys aaron here from clever progress pros and cons i'm here with daniel so we just kind of want to touch on he's never actually been on a stream before but um i'll go ahead and answer that with my story so yeah we're gonna guarantee that i need to call it more safer currently i am a software engineer working for blue origin if you guys don't know me having fortune is hey guys just give it some time man how long you've been working there for a couple of years now i've been working there almost for like about three years now almost three years yeah so i'll go ahead almost three years in january and it's basically my background currently i went to college is because it's one of those universities is know oh god guys i'm not going to be able to do anything i'm not going to be able to achieve much at all right but over the last over those four years that i was working i was actually not just focused on school but i was working outside of school as well i was getting externships basically externship is like an internship where you work for free and i was just trying to get i never heard that before externships right so it's just for the experience that's exactly why you do that right okay yeah and and i was like i was going to do put in the work work for free to learn mobile development because that's kind of what i was going into that's kind of what i was a little bit passionate about there but i was really active trying to learn as much as i could trying to build up my technical skill set and in the matter of the four years when i graduated i was actually able to graduate with offers from big tech companies so i had an offer from youtube google and i had an offer for microsoft and had offered from blue origin so it was crazy because what i wanted to what i learned was it's not about where you are or where you're starting from it's about where you end up and then what are the things that you're going to do there to end up so everyone and even aaron knows this what we're about to say might actually disappoint you might go against everything you believe in this life call about what college is and whether you need it or whether you're not we'll be discussing all those things but what you have to realize is regardless whatever path you take you can still build that future that you want for yourself if you want to become though one second guys they said there's voice problems voice problems 100 guys talking now let me mute you on speak again oh speak again daniel testing testing um yo guys can you guys hear me audio problem audio problem sorry guys i didn't see you guys in the chat the voices are looping oh [ __ ] voices are looping as i like feedback probably is it still looping you guys oh [ __ ] and then the stream is is uh loading um it might still be going yo is okay hey can you guys hear me it is solved now it's okay great now it's fine perfect perfect you guys hear me am i good okay yeah they're saying audio is great it's good enough awesome uh i don't know how much you got screwed up there but uh yeah i'll recap super quick got it right big lesson big lesson is it doesn't matter where you start what matters is where you want to end up and what it is that you're going to do what work are you going to put in to be able to get to that spot so that's being a freelancer what projects are you going to take on what mentors are you going to get across what community are you going to put yourself in to learn the technical skill sets to learn the soft skill sets that you need to become the freelancer that is living that free or basically that lifestyle where you're your own boss you're working on your own time you have time to enjoy with your family you have time to enjoy life or if you want to go to the corporate world and go up the corporate ladder right where you actually you know you get the job they want at big tech company you get the nice 401k compensation that they give you which is awesome and all that good stuff then what are the things that you have to do whether it's academic or nonacademic to get to that point and those are some of the things that we're going to be discussing today because you might or might not need college depending on your situation definitely definitely and yeah i think it really depends yeah it definitely depends on your situation what's interesting about you daniel is you're currently working at blue origin as a software developer which is awesome amazing but you're also kind of doing some business stuff on the side right like more freelance based uh so well first of all for for your job at blue origin was your degree useful did you already mention that and like landing the lining the interviews or or um like it being on your resume was it helpful so that's a great question and you know this is something that i've talked a lot about with my friend so here's the thing when big tech companies are trying to hire for someone the thing is they're getting so many applications they're getting hit with like thousands and thousands of applications per day that's why they're such a low acceptance rate right it's not necessarily because they only accept these geniuses they accept people who put in the work who learned the skill but it's just because so many people are applying it's kind of like the mecca and everyone's trying to just travel there and google's like hey we can't hire any everyone so we have to have that filtering process so that's what that filtering process starts with which is the resume now very often because recruiters have that system set up they'll be like hey you know maybe find me someone that has a higher gpa than whatever that may be or filter it in these mechanisms so if you do the traditional path which is what i'll tell my friend if you're the traditional path where you go to school then in that case maybe the grades might be a little bit important to get that filtering mechanism but after that no am i allowed to cuss yeah it's fine okay i mean like cussing is fine just no sensitive topics like youtube's signboard fine with custom just know like controversial stuff you know stay politically correct okay that's what i'm saying i'll say pc then look like after that like google doesn't give a [ __ ] about what your gpa was after you graduate they want to see if you can produce if you can write code if you can actually help them develop whatever product it is that the team is trying to hire you so what that means for you is you know after that initial filtering phase if you go to traditional path with high school or sorry with college if you have a good gpa at that point it's all about what projects have you developed what things have you actually done that shows that you're proactive about getting that experience that shows that you're passionate about programming and developing software now here's the cool thing right there's also other ways that you can get past that filtering mechanism if you don't have a background in computer science but you're still going to need that other component of showing that you have the experience which is building the projects which is working with teammates which is have you know mentoring people being inside of an amazing community like the profit with javascript community right and the reason i'm saying that is because the way you can now go around that is maybe you do networking you get to know someone that can be a referral or whatever that may be we could dive into those details if anyone wants to know those details but the important thing is you still need the practice you still need the experience because they're putting a risk to hiring you right they're like hey man like you've shown all these things we don't know if it's going to work out or not but let's bring you on so they at least want to make sure it's it's not to risk for them because they're absolutely crushing it with whatever side projects it is that you might have going on plus you're learning you're proactive it just shows you as an individual who's willing to take action to move forward and learn and do the things that you have to do to excel at that job got it thanks daniel yeah yeah this that's a really good point um i mean yeah from my point of view uh to to add on to that point uh personally um oh you lost daniel there for a second are you there yeah yeah yeah okay yeah i was trying to switch the camera i'm gonna mess with it a little more to switch but keep going brother got it yo so uh lost my train of thought there um what were you just talking about well uh basically so you need that experience to be able to land a job was though oh yeah i was pushing up god i got it yeah you need the experience on the job yeah so that's definitely true that's the problem that i personally ran into uh when i moved to los angeles i was i was currently a graduate student studying computer science and artificial intelligence at georgia tech like i mentioned earlier and i thought it'd be really easy to find a job you know i have i had my bachelor's degree i had my resume everything i had an eight month internship at the leading tech company in hawaii paid internship and i did some really cool ai computer vision stuff there and i thought it'd be really easy to find a job um but apparently it kind of depends on the company but people don't like considering internships as like real world experience for whatever reason so whenever i was applying to jobs like i literally couldn't land any i was i was applying i applied to 50 jobs literally and um all of them were like entry level positions and they're like oh you need this small amount of years to get the job this you need one year of experience minimum two years of experience middle which is like this weird uh paradox kind of kind of thing like chicken or the situation like how do you get the experience if you haven't had your entrylevel job and it's not even unique to the coding industry you know i'm sure a lot of industries have the same problem um but i answered that problem i mean that's actually handed off on the cover program our team because i reached out to qazi i met him in person at a seminar once and then um i hit him up asking if you knew anybody hiring but he said i could just start with him and i ended up there and was the best thing that ever happened to be honest but the point i want to make is yeah there is an issue getting getting a job even with a really good with a degree and partially partially through my master's degree at a really really like one of the top 10 20 schools in the country um top 10 for i think number i think they're number eight for computer science in the country or number seven tied for number seven or something georgia tech at the time um so it was just a struggle and i kind of realized yeah like if you have the experience you have the connections that's really all you need and it kind of just goes back into like sales and business principles of hey how do you land this job um or how do you how do you start freelancing as long as you can get the job done you can get your foot in the door and really sell yourself then that's really all you need like do you do you feel like your degree was worth it like how much like do you completely regret it or uh if you could go back in time would you have not have done it and like tried to pursue something sooner so uh i like to answer that question in this way and here's here's a reality if i look at what i'm currently doing right now i could probably pick out of my fouryear degree i could probably think and pick about less than a handful of classes that are strictly applicable to what i'm doing yes yes now yes yes that's because computers that were worth it and a handful professors that were not worth it that that yeah i had lots of those professors and those professors that they just showed up oh everyone has this professor they just show up they have their powerpoint there they turn it on and they just start reading it to you it's like yeah like it's all there and you have to go out there and learn by yourself yeah figure all that [ __ ] out to be like oh my god what do i have to do so yes those professors are out there but then there's the ones that also are willing to put in that time for you right so if you do happen to go to like that university like stanford the mit you're going to find those professors that are not only super knowledgeable they're like geniuses but they're also really good at teaching now if you happen to go to a school like that i went to which you know isn't that huge or that prestigious or maybe i don't know if you have this experience in hawaii erin but then there's just gonna be some professors that they're just there to do their thing and they're not great teachers right so then that that teaching principle doesn't come like it doesn't translate over so well and then it's like oh man well kind of sucks for me because now i don't feel like putting in the effort when i didn't see the professor putting in the effort as well yeah and this is actually an interesting thing about kazi i want to mention um if anybody who doesn't know kazzy's story i mean everybody should know kazi who's watching this channel but uh who's that yeah what the [ __ ] cosby where is that boy um no but qazi he was before he started the clever programmer channel um he was actually at school for computer science and he was taking classes from his professors but he actually started freelancing himself and was able to land a 20 uh 20 000 contract with uh some company so i don't know some plumbing company or freaking electric company i don't know something along those lines he was coding some system up for the company to like manage some stuff uh something like that and and after a bit he was making a lot more money uh he was learning from his professors but at some point he was he started to make more money than his professors and his professor started asking him for tips on how to uh like what he was doing so like he noticed that he was like wait a minute my professor is asking me to teach him stuff like what is going on and he ended up dropping out um you have some of those uh some of those professors and then sometimes you can kind of transcend them but then of course there's really great pressures like georgia tech like literally every professor i had there was just amazing the content and the the the amount of intelligence at that level of school is just phenomenal like it's the world's best you know when you go to like one of the world's best schools uh in the usa or like if you're like at oxford or something in the uk or whatever other countries like waterloo canada there's like good colleges all over the world like you'll usually have really good professors and you'll learn a lot but it's not always applicable to what you actually want to do which is what daniel said earlier right so exactly so you could start to develop those things that you want to do by exploring with your own personal projects so i mentioned before i start to get into mobile development why because aaron i don't remember but do you ever remember the game flappy bird oh hell yeah of course i played the hell out of there i was playing i literally if anybody who doesn't know what that is let me pull it up really quick so uh you guys remember flappy bird oh can you play it can you play it on on browser maybe i can put the computer yeah i don't know it says there's a oh right here oh okay so this let me change my screen there we go so here so here's okay so um what happens is when you have to click and you jump right is this is what you're talking about right yeah it was a mobile that's it that's all you have to do and you're just gonna get bounce okay okay so uh i need to story out guys okay okay let me go this is us this is the hardest easiest game you're ever ever gonna come across okay and it literally took the world by storm everyone was posting just videos playing flappy bird everyone's posting their highest scores i'm just gonna this game just went yeah keep playing man this game went completely viral now i'm gonna be honest i was a little money hungry and i was still in college so i was like man how much is this developer making turns out i think he was making like 50 000 a day or something like that and i was like dude 50k a day this is yeah i heard about that like if you have a viral app like you can make a crap money it's just a matter of getting it to go viral like now now here's the thing you know now yeah the mobile market has gotten like crazy saturated because people saw that opportunity so a lot of people went there i'm just embarrassing myself but like i can't even pass the first one but but like i just simply remember playing this in my physics 2 class i'm like screw this like i want to become a mobile app developer so what i started to do was i start to research hey how can i build an app for the android how can i build an app for ios and i started to learn at swift i learned along with xcode and i learned java and the android studio and i was able to start to build these applications and i was like you know i'll take this a step further this is where my externship came out i reached out to a local company like here i am this college kid all the experience i have is for my school i reach out to a local company who's android development i'm like hey guys like well first i try to apply for a job but then i'm like no you know what you're too new you had no experience totally fine i understand that right that's that's the chicken and the x and there you're talking about right they want every college grad to have five years of experience when they haven't even been in college for five years yeah like this so silly exactly so i was like okay well let's do this what if you can hand me off a project that is not priority that no one is working on that you guys want to work on for the future and i could just start messing around with that let me just dabble in there see what i can do and see if i could make something cool for you guys so they had an idea of an android application they wanted to have but they didn't have the resources so they handed it off to me so i would show up like i'm still in school i'm working part time and i'm sure like my only off day was friday i'm giving up my entire damn friday to show up to this office and just mess around with android development like that's the level of commitment that i had to developing the skill sets that i needed and it wasn't even that thinking in terms of a job i was just having fun i know a lot of you guys here in the stream have fun going through these projects that you know like all these live uh codings that that clever programmers putting out there's so much fun they're super amazing when sunny with knobs when kazi hop on that was the type of fun i was having i was willing to give up my fridays for that but because i was developing that skill set that was a secondary consequence now i was able to actually develop a skill set alongside with that but again that goes based off what i always say that is priority building more projects and if you could build and find projects that you're excited about then you're just gonna it's like this upward spiral you're excited about it you're learning more you're having fun and then you're getting more experience and just keep going up and up the feedback cycle just all the positive reinforcement yeah and then you end up a blue origin right and now you're putting us on on mars is that what's happening oh we're putting you guys in space it's better than mars because mars is limited yeah are you oh i mean i guess we are you guys trying to go to the moon like what is blue origin's overall goal right now i don't unders i didn't actually dive into them too much is a side tangent yeah for sure so if you go to blurring's website our big mission is filling with people living and working in space living and working right space so just end this exactly okay cool well literally in space not in planets because you know space space is unlimited versus planets being limited if we were able to somehow populate mars we'd probably only be able to double in size because mars is still a planet but if we're able to populate space at that point it's literally unlimited oh [ __ ] you mean creating like huge space stations just like yeah like like have you seen them look up o'neill colonies look up o'neill colonies oh neil was actually inspired from fictional writing right of like people and this utopia in space the o'neill cylinder right but you can just look at the images okay so basically this big cylinder that's rotating at the perfect speed to imitate gravity and then you just have this environment where you're able to actually create like a simulate a different world so like a right half and halo right yeah exactly like a halo it's just like another place you could live in space and if you can create that at that point it's like dude you can expand and grow as big as you want you don't have to worry about like hey you know if we plan if we call nate mars weapons will run out of space in mars like here in earth or resources or whatever that may be long term yeah because like getting to a different solar system is like that's like another beast in its own i see dude that's cool i was just curious i don't want to get too off topic on this topic but uh awesome so uh le going backtracking a little bit so you said um i was leading do you remember what i asked you uh before i went on this thing we were talking about i might have do you remember i think we're talk dude it might have been we're talking if college was worth it then we started talking about and then we started talking about you know how the experience plays uh so that's when the flappy bird because i learned android development because i was obsessed with flappy bird that's why i was like i need to learn how to program applications i could be rich now unfortunately that wasn't my path but i had a lot of fun learning how to develop mobile applications yeah yeah okay so um i guess to answer this question directly uh let's kind of dissect a little bit we've been we've kind of just been chatting for a bit about um college versus not uh but put it very clearly what is your opinion on having like like what scenario is college like the right decision and what scenario is college the wrong decision versus like um you know being selftaught or doing a coding boot camp or even taking a course from people like us you know um learning how to code i think i i think if i were if i were my own shoes back in the in back in the i was going to say back in the future back in the past these would be the two things that would dictate to me whether i want to go to college or not one is my finances okay so with my specific college is yeah huge my specific college case i was in the same city where i grew up so i was able to live in my house and i had scholarships enough that my first two years of college i was actually getting a 500 paycheck from school plus everything was already paid off and i had a job so during college i was in the financial situation where i finished college like with money in my bank right and not a lot of people have that fortunate situation so if you have to go twenty thousand dollars into debt and that was a decision i made i could have gone to ut it's a better known college but i would have to take a loan i didn't have a scholarship i would put myself 80 000 in debt and i was not willing to do that didn't matter what the hell i was gonna do graduating i was not willing to do that yeah it's hard like even if you land a sixfigure job at a good company it's gonna take you like two to five years to pay it off depending where you're living because a lot of the highpaying jobs too like if you're in san fran 100k isn't that much because you're living in the san fran where the living expenses is just super high so you're only saving so much a year um so that student debt is nasty so that's one big thing if you're going to go into student debt i feel like college is almost never worth it in my opinion uh i mean there's a bunch of different point of views online like here let me change my desktop so i did a search here on google earlier it says is college worth it for programmers so the first thing that pops up is degree probably not worth it unless you are not selfconfident enough to get hired without one so uh software engineering that's dockychange.com i don't even know who this is but this is the first thing that popped up can i add something to that because that's close to my second answer yeah so my second answer comes down to selfawareness okay now what i mean by that is you i would have to know myself and my past and how basically what he says how confident i am in my ability to teach myself and pay to surround myself with the right people or whether you know and i started to pay and strong myself with the right people or with people who could level me up whether it was through college or through like some sort of programming community right but i just had to have that self that level of selfawareness whether hey can i really put my you know nose to the grindstone learn everything by myself try to involve myself with communities go out there network or is it better for me if i kind of have a roadmap laid out even though it might not be the perfect roadmap for me even though i might deviate from it but at least having that roadmap gets me started to build that confidence so i want to go back to the answer i think that's the second part which is having that selfawareness in your confidence if you constrain yourself with the right community and the right mentors whether that's through school or whether that's through a programming community like clever programmer then at that point you could build a conference in either one but you have to know which one you are going to respond better to yeah absolutely yeah whatever i feel like yeah college is very expensive and there is a lot of value in having that degree because from a default perspective like they will probably prefer somebody with a degree versus somebody without a degree if everything else is the same because it's kind of like a proven track record of oh you've done this but if you're going to go into debt like it's i don't personally don't think it's worth it for me i didn't i was in debt i paid off school as i was going through it because i went to an affordable college and um i had a decent job and i worked parttime but i think at the end of the day whatever the best in learning environment the best learning and networking environment for you is good for you to achieve your goals that would be the best place to be so a lot of people in our courses here i clever programmer by the way if anybody wants to join um if anybody anybody wants to become a a javascript developer and make a living from it as a freelancer or eventually land a job at a cool company a fan company uh like like where where daniel works then we have a free webinar training down in the description you can check it out and it's completely free just watch it it gives you some value and then um at the end uh we we offer you to join the course if you actually want to pursue things further uh which is just a paid course you can join our community and you have like network of all developers and accountability so really cool um mentioning that if that's your kind of thing but if not uh totally cool too but let's get back to yeah i mean look like i was saying you have to pick your community you have to pick your mentors now the question is if it's college are you gonna put tens of thousands of dollars into a system that for programmers has been proven that you don't need or is it going to be in the community like the clever programmer community where you can learn and build projects like i said projects are king you learn to build projects through experience and you're able to network with people who are maybe a little level b above you a little level under you at the same level and you could learn from every single one you can help people out and it's just your choice who do you want to surround yourself with because everyone already knows is the most cliche thing but you are the average of your five closest people yeah right you're private and if you don't take that to heart if you don't take that to heart in five years you're gonna be in the exact same [ __ ] spot you're in right now you're gonna be in this wishful thinking like man yes i did do that where could i be my disappear because you're doing the same thing day in and day out but if you're on people who are doing ambitious things as well other ambitious developers other freelancers uh people like us that are working at companies like killer programmer or blue origin then uh you kind of you're constantly reminded of what's possible and what you can do and then you can kind of get out of that you can kind of change your trajectory you got a pattern interrupt you got to switch your way of living out of switch your way shock yourself huh exactly albert einstein said you know insanity is doing the same thing over and over again i think you're gonna get a different result yeah if you're not in the community and you're not getting results well you gotta go get in the community and then you'll start getting closer to getting results if not getting those results yeah so yeah very important about the learning environment the community that you're in um one argument for college is that because honestly i i met a lot of good professors i mean i i feel like 15 of professors were were good like 15 of the professors um and 15 of the classes were good and then that overlap was probably like five percent of the classes were actually applicable to what i was doing like learning the programming basics and everything i probably could have done that on my own uh but a class like algorithms or something could be a little bit difficult so i feel like those classes were worth it um but other than that just i mean i made a lot of good friends and made some connections that's how i got my internship but i feel like if i knew about this thing like clever programmer um or even coding boot camps which were like around ten thousand dollars were available i might have done that instead uh just because save some money cut out the [ __ ] like you don't have to take you know political science and writing and all those these other things uh but um i just it really depends honestly i feel like college was worth it for me but not for my professional uh career mainly for the connections i built and the experiences i had so it was worth it in that aspect 100 um but i from this business perspective like if like if you're more business oriented and you want a freelance or you want to do something cool or start a startup then you really don't need anything at all you just got to have the drive you got to have the right people around you like daniel said you got to have the vision and the belief and the confidence to just go for it you can learn things on your own um like do do do problems on hacker rank you know and and just get good and just land a lot of job like does google like did google look at your resume how did you land that interview with google and then get the job offer too uh with google i think i just sent in my resume it passed the filtering process and then we just went into the interview process so i had to do my phone interview i had to do my virtual technical interview then i had to do my onsite technical interview after that and then similar thing for microsoft microsoft actually came to the campus i did a campus interview then it was good enough to take me on for the onsite interview and i did that onsite interview and that's what i ended up doing for those two but so i guess i just want to take it back a little bit but you know you asked me that questions like hey is was it worth it for me would i do it again i would do college again because again of those two specific situations financially i ended up making money from college right and second selfawareness i knew that i wasn't in that spot just yet where i was confident in my ability to learn by myself so i kind of needed that road map but i would do college completely different if i was able to go back and do it right like on my side yeah during my history classes i'd be programming right yes yes finishing your coding project application yeah where you're learning about political science like that was back in the days when trump was i'd be making flappy birds bro i'm terrible at that game man my score was everyone was i don't do i think there was a single i never met a single good if you have a score higher than 50 on flappy bird and you have a screenshot from the past you better like put it on youtube or something i want to see that share it let me see if there's any questions by the way in the comments uh yeah let's do it boss yeah um i mean these aren't really they're asking like to limit questions google dumped angular is that true did google dump angular mr younabe i don't know if that's that's true or not all right guys do this right now if you have a question about college if you have a question about developing your career by the path go ahead and drop some questions down there so that we can answer them because again like i i feel this is so much value because this is literally our chance to mentor you guys virtual yeah yeah this is our chance to literally mentor you we can pick up your question right now we can tell you hey from aaron's experience from my experience what would we do in that case and now like literally you could go forward and do whatever it is that you you need to do next so guys this is a super opportunity this is an opportunity that you know you can also have inside of the community if you happen to come across us and reach out to us but again take advantage of it if not then we'll just keep playing flappy bird no i'm not gonna play flappy bird i have to keep an eye on the chat to see if there's any questions um i don't take the use so somebody says he doesn't take the useless classes in college um i mean that's that's true another good question is how to get experience in college so those two questions so i don't take the useless classes uh i mean some it depends on the college you go to i know a lot of like more modern colleges that got approved for their curriculum um they can kind of get away with bending things and but usually for most colleges you're required to let me change the camera here back to us you're usually required to um take like political science and history and stuff right like you have to and then you kind of like front load all your your major classes you have to major in something in college um but i mean you can only do that to an extent right uh so i feel like yeah that is useful but i mean you are going to bring a lot of time it's just you kind of see the other value of being in college if you really want to do it uh another question though is how to gain experience in college so i'm gonna take that as like real world experience like why are you doing it and i mean first thing for me is like maybe just land a parttime job at a small company or a paid internship or something uh the internship for me didn't work out for some reason people didn't care about it they wanted like actual experience like a real job even though i was getting paid at a real company doing real work i was confused about that distinction there but i would just i would probably just try to find a job like right away you know like user connection connections with your professors or something like that do a summer summer job or something like that um i didn't personally do it did you did you have any experience and you did you said you mentioned your externship yeah so so i mean like i was wanting to do whatever the [ __ ] i had to do to get a job so i said yeah i'm gonna give up my fridays i'm gonna work for free so that i can learn this and i can get the job and i can start to get that experience so if you happen to be oh man no one's hiring me i'm sending out my applications well [ __ ] work for free you're not worth anything yet if you're not getting hired you're not worth anything yet you haven't proven yourself you haven't gotten that experience so be willing to put yourself up for free work learn get that experience right don't do it for the money do it because you like it do it because you want to learn more do it because you want to grow more when you actually become worth something that's when you're going to get paid big dollars yeah definitely and me personally i had my internship in the very last semester of my college so my eighth semester before i graduated i took four years in my undergrad and i thought it would um i thought it would have been more beneficial if i actually landed an internship much earlier on in my programming career so honestly a lot of my early classes were kind of bad at my undergrad school and i couldn't really grasp the concepts that easily i feel like went to a better school actually would have been much better and i could have landed something but if you could land an internship like a summer internship in your first summer of college that'd be great like for free like like you're like like unpaid like daniel said just get the experience you're not worth anything prove that to yourself it might be painful but if you're doing it for free then hey it's good hop on your resume and then the next summer maybe try to get a paid internship in the third summer maybe try to get a parttime job and actually get some real experience and then do parttime work and parttime school until you finish your degree but if you can actually get some experience and degree in tandem i feel like that's actually um good again i mean how do you land that parttime job to begin with because you need experience to get that job so chicken or the egg it's a struggle but i mean if you maximize your networking and everything then you eventually find something i mean that's how i met causie and connections are very surprising so ask your professors if you're in college um if they have any and like i said you can always also be working on your own projects on the side something you're passionate about something that you want to learn something absolutely we didn't even mention that like portfolios and projects but didn't mean to interrupt you always go on yeah no no perfect perfect point like right now i'm coaching my friend so that basically he he was like an economics major right now he's doing data analysis for a company he's like hey i want to be a programmer like if you go to his github literally his very first line of code was committed in february as of right now as of august he is this close to landing his first programmer developer job how was he able to do that he put in the work for those seven months after his 40hour work week he was getting straight to programming and he was enjoying it he hired another mentor he had two people you know when the industry another mentor has helped people through that transition and he's learning as much as he can he's applying as much as he can and he's doing it towards building projects building projects and i guarantee you he's going to get the first job and it's going to be paid because of the experience he got from just building projects so here's the thing if you also take that route where you want to build projects and get the experience it's not this one project that's going to make it like oh man this whole project didn't give me my job no you better build like 10 [ __ ] projects out of those 10 projects maybe one or two are going to be good those are the ones you put on your resume not not like oh i built two projects can i get a job now no [ __ ] you better be putting in the time yeah to build out project after project after project to really learn what you have to do to build those experiences and how those shitty projects are going to have just a couple are going to be worth showing yeah definitely you want to showcase with your best foot forward and make sure you do enough of the work to get there it's like it's like anything you know working out you got to you got to do enough work to get the results so if you're serious about something like put in the effort so definitely build a lot build portfolios and portfolio is useful if you want to freelance or or get a job it doesn't matter uh hey you're you're coming out of focus bro a little bit um but um what was it saying best foot forward yeah best foot forward uh and you just want to get things on your portfolio so you can really just um yeah just put your best foot forward i think that was the whole point i was wrapping up there it's yeah perfect it's perfect yeah like if the if the program i mean if the if the applications you built are kind of relevant to what you're doing too then that's a big bonus it's like hey i've done this before uh even if you don't have different work experience if you can get through the through the interview and kind of just showcase and really show them that you'll be a good fit for the position and speak to them clearly and show them what you've done then you have a good chance of landing a job so um let me see if there's any other questions you have anything to add to that daniel yeah portfolio man i mean i also did not have a portfolio i had a resume but i'm telling like the thing i told my friend is like yo we need to build that portfolio because a portfolio is look when they're hiring you they're not hiring a developer they're hiring a person okay yeah yeah you're not hiring a developer they're hanging a person that's something you also have to understand when you go into the hiring process but let's look at the other way so what you have to understand is they're not looking for projects they're looking for a human that is going to be compatible to the skill sets and the soft skills the soft uh the soft people communication skills that they need to fill the role so portfolio is a great way to communicate that because you can put literally you can put your personality on a web page which is insane like a resume you can't put your personality like you can't the only thing you could write about is [ __ ] that you've done like hey i worked as this and i did that experience or whatever in your portfolio in your website you can pull your personality you can make like a little blog you could post content you could document what you've been doing you could document like man worked on this project i struggled a lot you share a story you share your struggle and people are able to see your transformation they're able to see your specific journey and you build out a portfolio in that manner when you show it to someone they see that human characteristic of you and it's not just a resume it's not just all these papers are coming across your desk and your coding style too they can see like if you comment code right and all that stuff exactly now someone sees it they understand if you're gonna be a good fit for what it is they're looking for because it's not just words on the paper yeah you're not just another yeah paper in the stack you know you can stand a little more with your portfolio i mean the one one counter argument to that is a lot of a lot of people do have portfolios you're competing with all them which but it just goes back to you gotta you gotta have your stuff together and get some good projects on your portfolio that's why we're so project based here at cleverprogrammer like we love building all these clones on youtube and in our in our paid courses and programs and mentoring and coaching we teach a lot of projectbased uh things everything is projectbased so you're building um you're building portfolios basically that's what you're doing when you're going over courses um or going going through our youtube content so all these are great things people have landed people have already landed jobs just by going through our free coding um clones um oh you're you're uh yeah yeah i just keep switching it because my camera is messing up my bad brother all good but yeah so we actually have people landing like 90k 96k 100k 110k jobs and contracts just by doing some of the apps that we built up together and just popping on our portfolio and showcasing putting their best foot forward it's like hey this person built a covent tracker this person built a instagram clone a netflix clone a hula clone and amazon clone and um if people see that and they're really impressed by and they want a friend of developer that usually is has a big wow factor and apparently it's been working for people so uh definitely definitely do that i think portfolio is honestly stronger than a resume because at the end of the freaking day they want you to be able to code up whatever they need to be done of course they're hiring a person so don't be a weirdo but if you're a decent person you fit in and then you also have the skill set and you've proven that through portfolio then you have a really good chance of landing whatever job is in front of you regardless of college you're not so um oh did you when you you had offers at google and microsoft and blue origin was it just those three nothing else though those are the only three i applied to and i ended up getting them so i was like damn like at first i was like like you apply but now looking back i was like dude i should have applied everywhere man because it's cool when they fly you out they pay for everything so it's like dude i could have gone all over the world dang man that's that's cool i kind of wish i went down that route a little bit but i just kind of jumped on clever program right away i guess i went down the startup route very very fast um with qazi here building the the brand a little bit more over the past two years but um i feel like we've hit most of the the the point what were you gonna say yeah i mean i mean in the end it's there's gonna be so many things that would be nice that we could do right but one of the biggest things that i think i learned from from warren buffy he's like look this is what you guys gotta get a paper happy birthday warren buffett oh it is turned into 90. this is turned 90 today for warren buffett baby this is for one buck that's hilarious but basically says okay 90. this 90 year old this 90 year old billionaire said this he's like get a sheet of paper and write out 25 things that you want to do with your life right like these 25 things that that you know in the end you want to accomplish you want to be able to do whatever that may be and then what you need to do next is you need to scratch out 20 of those and the five that you haven't scratched out those are the things you're going to focus on yeah and the principle behind that is you have to understand that in life there's going to be so many things you could do what if like right now you might be doing software like man what if instead of software i don't know i did some instagram modeling instagram modeling is the thing now you know like what if i did something else right so there's gonna be so many things distracting you right but you have to focus on those five things that you're gonna prioritize because maybe instagram modeling was like number 10 but it's off your list now and you have to focus on that top one which is software becoming the developer that you want to become whether it's a freelancer whether that's getting a job with the big tech company with the startup whatever that may be because fundamentally when you start to focus that's when you actually start to get clear by your goals and make progress in the direction that you want to go absolutely absolutely daniel thank you so much value provided thank you for having me on this call i was i was proud to just like answer questions go over myself but daniel hopped on last minute he works with us by the way clever programmer i don't think he's ever been on a stream before so this might be a new face but killer guy killer programmer um very interesting story but uh last thing we should start probably wrapping up in the next few minutes here uh one question that i want to say is somebody was saying how do you get started with a with an entrylevel portfolio as a programmer so uh just to clearly answer that question just start coding projects man like start coding some of the stuff on youtube channel join our our paid courses start building those in the portfolio and just build things that you're passionate about and excited about because that's the best way to get started you have to be excited at the beginning and eventually what the habit's built sometimes it gets kind of rough but you can keep doing it because you have the habit but at the beginning just build cool projects and upload it to your github and just have it in a presentable way and just build a huge portfolio that's why it's called a portfolio like just start with a random clone if you can't pick one here i'm going to tell you what go uh go build the netflix club go find it i think sunny and kazzy code it up it's a great app just go code it up and put that on your portfolio so go do that like literally right after this video if you don't have a portfolio and you're a completely beginner coder um i mean if you're a complete beginner coder i think you need to know javascript uh to actually go to that video but if you know javascript basics if you've been watching this for a while just go do that and get that on your portfolio like right now go from beginning to end okay yeah and i want to add that real quick what i told my friend who's transitioning right in those seven months he's built out like eight or nine projects right now let me tell you those first seven are really crappy projects they're really beginner projects like the first one was literally like a hello world he has an alarm clock when you go to a page that's ticking like he was just learning basic javascript he has that in his github but that's not necessarily showcasing his portfolio right he later did like a simple rock paper scissors stuff he has that on github because he's documenting his journey but he doesn't necessarily have that on his portfolio now he got to the point where he has this complicated to do application right it's like a to do application you can add things prioritize things you could put time around things like it's this awesome application that he did right and whether he starts to get creative with it he starts to add a bunch of things now that's also on github so you can see his documentation but that's part of the portfolio because like i said you need to build out 10 projects and 10 of them you know seven eight are probably gonna suck and then two of them are gonna be really good right yeah yeah that's how it is the other thing is when you're building out those projects if you're going and you're following sunny or your knowledge or whoever's doing them make sure you understand what the [ __ ] you're building because if you put that on your portfolio people are going to want to talk about that and they'll be like hey so tell us tell us about the kobe tracker tell us about you know the netflix club and if you don't know what you're talking about it's gonna be obvious i mean anyone could go follow tutorial not everyone could build something out on their own so here's my challenge to you after you build it or after you've built any of these things add your own twist to it i don't mean change it from black to white i don't mean some stupid css though i mean like make it challenging right if it's a netflix thing what if you can add something in the back end that can track a user and their favorite movies and then you know how netflix has like the 97 tracking or like oh this is 97 probably you're going to like this or not yeah the recommended page yeah the algorithm try to implement that try to see if you could figure that out yeah just like every time you click on one like here here's a cool one like if you if you click on one of the videos like in the netflix app once you're done when you click on a video it'll actually play the trailer for that show or movie why don't you keep a counter and then um just have like an ordered rank like oh this is your favorite show favorite movie this is your second favorite depending on how many times you clicked on it so that's a very simple thing to implement but you could do that you could even go and like okay try to create a very similar app like an amazon prime app or something like you could try to mirror a very similar app and just apply the same ideas to another project and then boom now you have two projects and one was a tutorial and one you kind of came campbell came up with it yourself so um yeah so definitely portfolios no matter what is is really good it just really showcases your skills and i think at the end of the day college is only worth it if i mean first of all for the experience i think it's worth it um and if you're going to a really good school and you kind of go down the academic route then it's worth it but and if it's if it's cheap it's worth it so if it meets those three criteria yes but other than that i honestly think being selftaught and doing some things um on your own is the better course and then you can try to get some experience and then at that point if you really want to pursue a higher level education you can but i mean once you started making once you start making money you're kind of just like you don't really want to go to college and pay money to do stuff you know and like you have to like it's just once you're in the real world you eventually get used to it and you start like pursuing the things that actually matter to you so i feel i feel like personally college uh i feel college is worth it for a year and then drop out and then go to pursue your own stuff like have have one year of the college life and then see how it is make some friends go to some parties and then uh and then you know actually start getting yourself together and pursuing stuff so that's my opinion and
