hey guys what's up so this is part 2 of the learned commandline tutorial and before we get to running the Python script what I want to tell you guys is I want you to get comfortable with it a lot of the times when people start in the command line they think they're gonna break something and they're going to hit CDs so slowly an LS so slowly I want you to get so used to it as if it's like you're just moving around the room by yourself okay or moving around wherever just get comfortable with it feel it so essentially hit LS you're not gonna break anything hit CD hit tab like a million times if it doesn't work then you know do something hit tab hit CD again get back so get used to hitting these commands because you want to go from these commands being memorized from a book and trying to just always memorize and be like how did these people memorize these commands to making it like a feeling and an intuition okay you're not gonna break anything it's okay if you hit CD instead of PWD nothing bad is gonna happen okay so let's so seriously go practice that on this or your own computer wherever but just kind of have fun with it get used to going around then coming back home go deep in some directories and then come back home you know hit CD it's your safe place one more command I want to teach you guys right off the bat this one took me a while to learn but it was actually one of the most important so what if I go forward and I kind of want to just undo one step and just go back one step so let's say that um I enter no northern meadow but what I really meant to do was enter Western forest right so I can go see Dee northern meadow and then I'm like oh I don't want to go there I want to go back one step so I can do C D and I can do dot dot that means go one directory back so I went one directory back and now I'm in the comfort of my own home which is how it likes to state it now let me show you guys how you can use the command line to learn or run the Python script and as a matter of fact after this if you guys are going to my python tutorial still a only run the Python script like this okay how I am about to show you right now don't be using that idle stuff anymore that stuff was good when you were picking it up but now this is a better way to do it so for example okay let's write a Python script and let's put it on the right hand side and we can just open up a new snoo script here okay example or sorry print hello hi let's save it and let's go ahead and save it in clever programmer okay or actually I have a better director to save it here clever programmer save it here okay and let's save it in learn command line all right so I gave it the py extension now I'm gonna open up my terminal I'm going to put it on the right hand side that's how your workflow should actually look most of the times so let me make this big all right so on the left hand side I got my terminal or sorry on my sublime text you guys can download the software it's free beautiful text editor write your code in there and on the right hand side is where you'll run it so let me show you a practical application of using the command line so we're going to go home so I just hit CD now I want to go to where that file was so I think it was in my Dropbox I'll hit LS again I'll look around me what's there I think github should be around me so I'm going to go to github I'll look around again and clever programmer is right there I can see it so I'll do CD clever programmer and then I will do CD clever programmer again I'm keep using I keep using tab to autocomplete for me now I'm here and I can see these directories I just made learn underscore commandline I'll go CD learn whoops because there are two of them that start with this it couldn't find it so I'm gonna do learn underscore C and then hit tab and it'll all look autocomplete it and I can see that file right there hello world under hello world a py so I will do Python hello we're all that py okay and let's run it and you can see that it says hello well if I wanted it to do for I in range one let's do 20 print I okay let's go to the terminal now we don't need to type in that whole command anymore this is one of them very important features of the command line you can actually you don't have to type in Python hello world anymore just hit up and and hit enter okay so you see that it's added it added the new part of the code so it's printing on from 0 to 19 and just practice that a little bit hit up and enter up and enter up and enter up and enter okay kind of you get comfortable with that so you know let's let's make a change here maybe let's print done okay and save I'm gonna hit a command tap to switch to the terminal hit up and enter switch back write more code more code save hit command tab or alt tab if you're on the windows hit up and enter okay so that's how that works and the thing that I wanted to show you guys on Windows is basically just simply go and open up a new terminal or sorry a new tab and you can go get bash download and for for Windows just download this software okay it's called get bash and you should be able to download it pretty much from anywhere I think download kit for Windows and then that's it it started downloading automatically against my will which is not cool but um you know for you it might be helpful because if you have Windows you don't have to hit any buttons woah alright guys I hope you're starting to see the practicality the pragmatic nuts the awesomeness of the commandline and I'll see you in the next video
