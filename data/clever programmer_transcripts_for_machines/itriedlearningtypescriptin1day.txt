what the hell is typescript let's talk about it so we're here in portland oregon and we are planning our first biggest javascript tour in 2021 it's taking place on august 6th through 8th so if you want to show up it's happening in los angeles and it's gonna be the best event you probably have been so far so shameless plug get the tickets now with that said what are we going to be doing today now so we came here we thought you know what why not do something fun like learning typescript in one day exactly now i don't know we might succeed or we might horribly fail hopefully we'll fail we'll find out let's go oh and by the way before we continue this video if you want to become a developer and you want to make over a sixfigure income and you love puppies then smash and break that like button right now and here's a picture of a koala bear just to thank you typescript is a superset of javascript which means you get to write javascript but with static typing in other words javascript is a little tiny baby of typescript in english typescript keeps javascript in check so it behaves like a good little girl nice so food like that now you might be wondering why should i switch to typescript and effectively write more code and that's a great question it helped airbnb reduce their bugs and their code base by about 38 by switching from javascript to typescript when they did their postmortem analysis after slack made the switch from javascript to typescript it boosted their productivity the stability of their code and according to them even their mental sanity according to the stack overflow 2020 survey typescript was the number two most loved programming language additionally developers who learn the skill of typescript make about 125 000 a year or more depending on their experience and location after doing so much research from everywhere i found out what's the number one reason really anybody uses typescript and it's this fewer bugs so basically typescript can tell you're about to make a mistake before you make it like for example hitting on a girl that's there with her boyfriend no no don't do that stop don't do that i told you don't anyways back to the video it can do a lot of things for example it can validate your javascript ahead of time typescript can also be used for both frontend and backend applications another cool thing about typescript is you don't really need any learning curve let's take a look at how we actually start up our first application in typescript so let's go ahead and install typescript using npm install typescript we'll create a new folder called typescript app let's open that folder in vs code create a new file called index.html and another one main.ts for our typescript file console log hello go back to insta.html let's link the javascript file but we're linking main.js open an integrated terminal do tsc main.ts to go ahead and compile our typescript file into main.js create a function who's a nice little boy give it a parameter name with the type string and return type of voice console log name plus is a nice little boy yay next create available best person with the type string and the value javascript let's call the function who's a nice little boy open with a live server boom check it out that is your first typescript app another useful feature that was added to typescript is something called interfaces an interface is basically you defining what object that is so let's just say i have an object named food right i can define what that object will have i can define if the object will have a color the object will have for example a taste it's kind of like when you have food and you know exactly what the ingredients are for that food might be asking at this point nasa and kazi how does it work in a browser device creating your file a different type of file well check this out it doesn't work in the browser you actually need a compiler to compile a typescript code into javascript code you're turning the typescript code into the javascript code and that is what your browser will understand and according to typescript and their tagline typescript is javascript that scales as you gain a stronger skill set and you are an intermediate level developer i think it's great to start adding in typescript and the reason is as you start to work on more complex projects that's the time you actually need typescript if you're working on tiny small projects it's just gonna get in your way and slow you down now technically speaking i'm gonna put javascript coded some typescript code side by side here she's showing an example and if you take a look at this example on the left hand side a function written in javascript on the right hand side it looks extremely similar to the javascript code except in typescript you are specifically saying that name can only be a string type and you can enforce that when you pass a array to greeter function instead of a string you can see that before you even run your code it tells you hey argument of type string is not assignable to a parameter of type string so there you have it that's typescript in a nutshell if you are a complete beginner should they learn it i would say if you're complete beginner don't bother learning it just yet focus on just the foundations of javascript but if you are more advanced you can jump into it go ahead and smash that like button for us for all the fun that you probably had watching it and of course one last thing that we have to say there is a inperson event that we're doing it's gonna be the first one we've ever done it's gonna be one of the best ones happening august 6th through august 8th it's going to be in los angeles jump in buy the ticket fly in this is going to be an event of a lifetime it's going to be a totally lifechanging experience you're going to pick up all kinds of crazy skills html css javascript build relationships of a lifetime with other likeminded crazy amazing people just like yourself i mean we'll just have so much fun in general i mean you've been stuck in covent land for so long now at this point time to get out of it so show up and let's show out we love your beautiful face we want to see you in person click the link below sign up other than that this is your boy nas and we'll see you in the next video i hit recorded
