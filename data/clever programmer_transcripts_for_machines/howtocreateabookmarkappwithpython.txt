hey guys welcome back to the objectoriented programming course in Python in this video we are going to continue what we were doing and what we're going to create is something called a bookmark app so remember in the last video I talked about we're going to have a frame with buttons and then when you click them maybe it'll take you somewhere so let's call it the bookmark app and I've created a file up there if you can see that and uh so far let's just see what we have just so we can uh refresh in our memory uh where we're at so essentially it's this app when we run it and if I hit 10 it does nothing if I hit doorbell it detects and it says you rang the doorbell and it essentially runs this function that we wrote on line five cool uh now what we want to do is we want to see if you can try to do this so like pause the video see if you can create a button that detects something else okay if you haven't done that from the last video so let's go ahead and do this now so I'm going to create a new one and essentially what my button is going to do is it's going to take me to the clever programmer. comom website it's going to open up a new tab and take me there so first of all what I have to do is I have to go at the top and import uh the web browser Library so essentially we're stealing code from people who spent hundreds of hours writing it by using the import magical command and we're going to leverage the web browser code and it's going to make our lives very easy and and essential what's going to do is just say web browser. openen new tab and this function takes in a URL so we're going to give it a URL uh we're just going to type it in here https clever program.com for you you can have this button be whatever you want okay and I'm going to say um yeah that looks pretty good to me I'm going to add this as button to bind and I'm going to bind this to the left click as well of The Mouse and the left click short key of the mouse is um this button essentially right here it's button hyphen one and now I'm going to attach this button to the second uh function that we just wrote so this function is going to be called um click CP this function should really be called open CP so I'm going to give it a better name I'm going to say open CP okay all right that looks good to me and uh now instead of the text on it saying 10 let's call it clever programmer and now let's run this code let's run it and as you can see it just created a new frame um that like it added the new button called clever programmer and if I click it in my Chrome it should open a new tab that says clever programmer so let's give it a try I'm going to click it and indeed it did open up clever programmer so that's pretty cool now what if I wanted to add another button that maybe takes me to the blog page so see if you can add that pause this video see if you can add that right now again if you're not pausing this and doing this on your own and really deviating away from the examples I'm just giving you if you're just really only copying the code you're not going to retain any information that's what happens when people take code academy they're not able to retain that information it just gets lost because you might just copy what they have and then not do anything on your own so the more the farther away you go from my examples the better you'll become think of my examples as just an implication of what you can do and then take that and run with it so what I'll tell you is that think of it as your assignment okay take what I've currently given you already in the video and use it to create something cool and add that in the comments below so other people can check out what you have done and it might give them new ideas as well so you know kind of surprise me and everybody else here okay so that's what this does now I'm going to create that blog uh button okay so first of all I'm just going to create the function open uh or let's just call it CP blog takes in an event and we're going to say opens new tab and essentially what it does is it does here let's make our code a little bit better so I'm going to take this guy and I'm going to say URL is equal to that guy and here I'm just going to replace this with URL and here what I'm going to do is I'm going to say URL plus and I'm just going to add blog to it okay so it's going to take this URL here and all it's going to do is it's going to just add blog in front of it that's it so this way I'm reusing my code if I keep having to create new tabs I don't have to write that entire URL over and over again I can do it in a simple way let's go down here I'm going to uh create the third uh label so I'm going to say C label uh is equal to TK label text is equal to whoops blog we can call this home uh C label. grid let's go column two on this guy and let's stay in row zero and then we can say button three is equal to button window add that in the window the text for this should be CP blog and button three for grid let's put that in column I think we can put this button in column two and for row let's keep the row one and now let's go ahead and bind this guy to the left click of the mouse and now we're going to throw in the function CP blog and let's give this a try so I oh I got to end my previous session okay so I just ran my code and you can see I have doorbell which if I click it just says doorbell if I click clever programmer it'll take me to the homepage and for the blog if I click this button it should open up the blog so let me click this and let's see what happens and there you go it just took me to the clever programmer blog page so if you want to learn how to do this in a lot more like for example creating a game of pong or creating a calculator from scratch and creating apps on your own using python python so you connect your python coding knowledge to actually creating apps and you want to learn more about this I've put a link together for you below that you can actually click and just put in your first name and your email address and I'll send you five free exclusive pieces of content from the Learn Python objectoriented Programming course okay there no cost to you and in that course I'll show you how you can do these things by yourself all right so go ahead and put your email address and your first name in there and I'll see you on the other side
