excited to be here with you guys today and we're going to be talking about this is day two of the youtube challenge and we're going to be talking about how can you break your first 1 000 subscribers and how did i get to let's see over here lifetime i'm taking you behind analytics how did i get to 836 000 subscribers on youtube and we're going to talk about your first 1000 all right that's the part that's actually really really important so we're going to be getting into it in just a little bit first of all if you guys are here and you're excited drop it in the comments below let me know if you guys are pumped up about this and we are going to be getting into this right away all right so i'm gonna pop open the facebook group if you guys want to be in this challenge the uh this is day two of the challenge where what we're really working on here is helping you start your own youtube channel and helping you get the same freedom financial freedom and impact that i was able to have with clever programmer and now what i want to do is i want to work with you guys to figure out like help you guys start your own youtube channels and make that impact because for me the impact is what is addictive for me what's addictive is taking a look at this and going oh man we provided value to 34 million people oh man we have helped the world move forward by 2.6 million hours which comes down to about i think like over a few hundred years right we help the world move forward so that to me is exciting and i feel like if we do this together and we help the world move forward that is the biggest fastest way to make an impact and it doesn't matter if you're a developer it doesn't matter if you're somebody who is into cooking it doesn't matter if you're somebody who's into like nighttime stories it doesn't really matter right we want to be able to help everybody with this and so i'm excited a few things i want to share with you guys is the best way for me to give you value because this is live is for me to get your questions and for us to engage and have a back and forth i think that is the way i can deliver the most amount of value so if you ask questions that make them good my team is going to be taking out those questions and they're going to be putting those questions in my slack i'll be able to see them and then i can actually address all those questions and concerns that you guys um have so let me go here i'm refreshing the facebook group and i want to see it who's on this live okay beautiful so we are live in the facebook group man 29 people hopefully we'll get on more people here joey says i'm a musician and a drawing artist all right we got people watching on youtube as well beautiful amazing guys awesome all right so uh we got joey we got zephyr we got hafiz fernando from mexico let's go i'll bring this up here as well all right let's click into this guys yesterday was crazy like when we went live it was absolutely insane the live stream that we had we got so many comments on that live stream it was kind of ridiculous what i don't even know where that stream went though can't find that stream but good thing that this stream is on so let's keep going ricardo says me here i'm excited joey said let's go day two gabby says yo hello so glad to see your beautiful face all right guys so let's get into this now i'm gonna go back and i think the best way i can share this with you is how did i get my first 1000 subscribers right and i just want to kind of recap this i want to talk about how i went from zero to 8300 subscribers i want to talk about how i went from zero to over 30 million views and i'm going to talk about how i went at the age of 26 from zero to 2.6 million dollars under the age of 26. for me the catalyst that allowed me to change my life you know a boy from pakistan who came here and had nothing and completely transformed is because youtube allowed me to help and make a big impact in other people's lives that as a result led to a lot of other people's financial freedom just from viewing our youtube content for free and led to my financial freedom and our teams because we gave value to the world we got value back it's just as simple as that and i want to help you guys do the same thing so i'm going to show you guys what the journey in the start like entailed let's go here beautiful how do i click it for where okay got it okay comments oh wait i can just make it full screen like this okay cool there we go all right beautiful so there we go now i'm able to see um all your guys's comments and everything that's going on that way i can address everything all right beautiful guys so um i want to show you guys what it took for me to actually get my first 1 000 subscribers so i'm going to kind of get into that let's go to 2016 and i'm going to show you guys right here so i was at 472 subscribers in my first 10 months right if you take a look at that in my first 10 months oh that's a great question and i'll address that too dixon asked all right now let me go to just a little bit ahead of this so i can show you guys where what it was that i got my very first thousand subscribers let's go here boom hit it 5 000 subscribers okay by december so i imagine it happened right in december and we're gonna go here and we're gonna move it down to let's say december 2nd see what happens yep and let's go december 3rd i want to get to the exact date boom exactly december 3rd was when i got the first thousand subscribers and then everything just took off so you guys can see here 1 000 subscribers and the date is about you know this was a 10 month long journey all the way from march to december let me ask you guys would you guys be interested in finding out how you can get your first 1 000 subscribers would that be something that would be exciting to you you teaching people what you know or what you love or what you want to share and then people following you for it and then getting on that journey and then at some point like following you and you know even you're able to then make a living would you guys want to learn how to be able to do that thomas says kudos thank you brother i appreciate it all right beautiful so a lot of people i know started their youtube channels yesterday which was really exciting um and if we can find the yesterday's stream then i can probably even go through is it yesterday's facebook yeah it's gone yes all announcements um are you able to just give me a link in slack okay thank you all right cool so i'm gonna take your guys's question matt says hell yeah carol says yeah beautiful raul nice critic says did this today critic made a youtube video let me actually check that out wow this is so hi everyone it's kritik here from criticism makes you look professional like to make sure you're like for as little as 370 hmm okay cool um so all right critic good video a few important things one i think look at the camera you come in i want you to comment on my each and every okay so you're wanting too many things but you're not giving me enough value and then it seems like you're trying to sell me something also i would use your voice like i wouldn't recommend like speech to texting because as a human being i don't want to deal with a robot right like i actually want to deal with a human being not a robot so that's important anora yes this meeting is being recorded uh okay great so here's a question that we got so i'll bring this up by dixon he says hey what do you recommend on social media accounts before i become a developer i was posting anything on my facebook twitter and instagram do i delete all start afresh or how do i go about it so never delete anything ever i mean unless it's like really something horrible that you put up that you know it's either you're discriminating against somebody or it's hate speech or bullying or if it's not a violent sin or a crime never delete anything always just move forward before i become before i become a developer i was posting anything on facebook yeah so all you need to do dixon is just keep sharing the part of the journey that you're at that's all so when it comes to like making a youtube or making a facebook or making a twitter or an instagram it's all about just sharing the part of the journey where you were at all right that's it and then you just go forward that's everything you don't need to go beyond that okay if you then want to go to the next level and really truly focus on providing value for people making content for them you can do that as well but in the start if you just document your journey and what is happening in your life you're good all right let's see if we have more questions all right we got yesterday's live that sick because that means that um i can give you guys feedback on your videos like look at this this is insane 907 comments thank you guys for that that is huge this is my latest video so let's check out ricardo's video it's a pretty cool start oh [ __ ] damn boy that's nice um i would say something here because i'm not understanding what is going on so far and there's a lot of time being wasted on this like still frame that's not moving still you're not talking to me about what's going on okay i see what's happening so it's just like you're showing the park okay um it's not entertaining because i get to watch the park but it's kind of like your dad making a video of like a park with a cell phone and just like sending it to you and you're like dad what are you doing so the reason why this channel isn't breaking a thousand subscribers is because it's just footage it's just like random almost like stock footage so that's not gonna blow up unless it's truly just like an 8k resolution and like the best thing on the planet to watch you know so here what would make this entertaining is a voice over you know a story behind this park or why is this park so valuable why should people go to it context behind this i think that would make it entertaining to watch and in the start i wouldn't waste so much time on this because the start is where it's the most important so if you can't get people past your start you're not going to get people much farther than that all right cool nice i see people are now dropping their things cool cool cool i didn't get a notification yeah it's kind of sad i don't know like why we we weren't able to send you guys an email for some reason um and you know like we sent the text to you guys and hopefully that got you guys here but yeah i apologize about that we have coding paradise and he wants feedback on his last videos let's take a look at it nice yo yo yo what's up this is gilberto from calling paradise my youtube channel and i am a man with one only one mission to teach people how to program and i want to thank cassie from clever programming yo yo nice and well if you're interested see you soon beautiful okay awesome i have a surprise for you guys um on days like day six of the challenge where i'm gonna be announcing something really special um we're gonna be launching our like i'm gonna be launching a youtube program and i can't wait to share that with you guys and we're gonna go into all kinds of details in that now in this here what i'm seeing with coding paradise this is a you have a really engaging personality you're very like entertaining and i actually found it funny like especially here program from one only one i like it you're very happy and smiling i love that uh again make sure you look at the camera most people are usually always looking at themselves in the screen so like don't look down here make sure you're looking at the camera people um it makes a big difference okay so make sure you look at the camera yo what's up this is gilbert hernandez nice dude you're gonna be good if you keep going you got good titles you got a good thumbnail and you got music you're looking right at the camera and this one and talking paradise and today we are going to install visual studio code okay there are a lot of code editors out there and i think the best one is visual studio code so let's keep looking at the camera we are here in google chrome you can use whatever you want and we search for visual code okay so we enter to you can download it everywhere you can choose here the pot and you enjoy it make sure to subscribe if you like and next video we will see ya bro you got a future bro you got a future with this [ __ ] keep making content your thumbnail game is down way better than mine way better than when i started i mean now my game is pretty good but right that's good even nas is like sitting there he's like that's really good so thumbnail is good the title of the video is great your presentation of it when it starts is great um you have a very like unique charismatic engaging personality which i like so keep using that to your advantage i would go i would go all all in bro i would go all in i would just make more content and you're gonna only get better with time all right so i love i love this bro nice job let's see uh more people i tried to improve my video based on your guys feedback what do you guys think kristen said hello guys and welcome to a new video on this channel oh [ __ ] son dude oh wait was that you yesterday game trips are festivals and build a community and it's very important oh wait i'm not showing it i'm looking for clients or if you're developing a game by your own and want to publish it hey los angeles nice bro all right let's take a look at this i also want yo if you're in los angeles you should come hit us up because we're looking for developers who want to create content a clever programmer publish it as a kind of portfolio for ios device this is your best video so far i can tell you that this out my games but today i want to talk about some great news as well okay um unity also but that's the new macbook yet and you kind of lost him but i don't know what's happening anymore made out of it there's only one project okay i lost you're lost me uh and don't do that that's a weird intro like stop using so much text use your voice keep it simple simplicity is better okay so watch peter mckinnon like peter mckinnon and watch him um when his [ __ ] starts shit's simple okay so let me go to this one what's up everybody peter mckinnon here welcome back to yet another video today we're reacting to the recently aired apple event cinematography not the product so there right like that is extremely clean start uh you're like using way too much text which is like annoying as a viewer to see it hello guys and welcome to uv yeah i can actually do live streams like this like just sit there on twitch and [ __ ] and have people like give me your youtube channels right like literally i can sit there for [ __ ] eight hours giving feedback hey yeah that is that's really exciting um okay so yeah i i don't understand what's happening it to me just seems like you just put this clip and then you just like start saying really random stuff over it video in times 20 where i create or develop an app for myself and i also want to publish it as a kind of portfolio for ios devices i'm actually so impressed what they made out of it like the new mac so much better like i like where you're going with this you're talking about the macbook talking about this but like why not just show your face then like why is the code like maybe the code could have been cool showing for like two seconds but then it should cut to your face and you should be talking um like i don't know why i'm looking at code i'm like am i trying to follow this code i'm trying am i am i making this app but it doesn't seem like it it just seems like you have like something playing and then it's almost like it's just in the background and then you just have a voiceover on it which is like completely it's not very it's not relevant at all like your image and what you're talking about has no relevance to each other it's almost like if you came to my coding channel and i had zebras running and i was like talking about like apple ios or something crazy so i would say that i would just show your face and i would just sit there and talk in front of the camera like you can do that another thing is you're very low energy dude you're very like chill and like low energy which there's nothing wrong with but your strength is then um then you got to sit there and edit your video you got to make it tight i'm wasting a lot of time between guys i think um your ios is pretty good and then if you have thoughts and you're going to speak them in a low energy way then you need to use editing to keep the pace up cut every single like pause out keep the pace up increase the volume on it and don't drown out don't make music compete with you your music right now is competing or almost louder than your actual video you think for me for now i just would say that right the music is so loud i can barely hear it you enjoy the quick programming in the background as ios developers and doesn't matter if you do it with swift directly or to unity also it's for yes so there's coding going on so i'm looking at coding and paying attention to coding there's loud music and then your voice is very low the three things are completely separate from each other and they're competing they're all competing for my attention there's very little of anything i can pay attention to focus keep your [ __ ] simple um look at the camera and talk if you have to talk if it's going to be a talking video have graphics or broll come over it to support like your main point whatever point it is that you're trying to make right when you're talking about unity maybe a graphic of unity comes up if you're talking about c sharp or ios apps their logo pops up if you're then talking about their commissions the commission thing pops up right if you have trouble with editing use slides just literally use google slides and do it you guys can crush it with just google slides not even show your face have slides that'll keep you on script and then just like have images in each slide and then just talk about them and just keep going so that's another way of doing it uh great cool cool cool all right let's keep going it's the beginning i'm looking at your guys's comments okay cool yep kristen you can you can i'm glad you can improve a lot bro yeah i'm i'm glad that you're not taking it personally and you're actually using the feedback it's going to help you tremendously uh background music keep it very low like juan is asking uh crap let's bring it right here and let's bring that right here okay cool so juan is asking hey what about um background noise should i have that in my music or or should i have that in my tutorial or or no i would say that keep it very low keep the background noise music very low during tutorials very low almost like you cannot hear it and in the start keep it high so the energy is high and it's like what's up this is one music is going and then it just like starts to vanish as time progresses okay uh beautiful so yuri says my video will be out tomorrow i love that i'm the amadeus says can you give me feedback okay so let's go here and see if we can give him feedback so welcome to my channel i have decided to take part in a 5day quiz challenge so i have done thousands of ecommerce courses and for the year i've been doing this on the alligator platform in poland so now i decided to switch to shopify and increase my possibilities so guys i love ecommerce and i want to share this love for you guys for you with you so now what will be my strategy and purpose of this channel i will i want to inspire you that age it doesn't matter on this field so if you only have a vision and dream everything is possible so something weird is happening to me in this video i'm like almost getting hypnotized watching it so who i will follow it's extremely important to learn from people it's like a mixture between like ecommerce asmr and hypnosis you are where you want to be guys i have a question for you do you want to what to go to your destination in a fiat multipla or for ferrari both will get you to your destination but at what time so ask yourself what is your choice but my choice is of course i want to be in ferrari so [ __ ] multipla and let's go regarding fbs is the mass of the course who teaching it i made thousands of them in total in poland such as pl etc etc no one of them could match the value he gave for free kevin zhang so on this challenge i will follow his instruction and his setup for a facebook ads i know that's worked because he made over 20 million dollars from this what's happening oh wow oh i can't wait to see julio's where on youtube or where in facebook group um so okay so basically for this what i'm gonna say is um it's uh there's something really weird bro here that's going on here it's very entertaining to me i don't know why like i kind of wanted to just keep listening like i feel hypnotized to listen i don't know it's really amusing to me in some weird way um i think because this is not an audio platform and it's a video platform have if you're not going to have your face at least have like google slides and just have a presentation so then images move here so as you're talking it goes to the next slide and the slide after that and slide after that uh so i think it could be a really interesting channel and just and just the energy you have man is like it's kind of it's it's kind of magnetic so keep going like i i kind of like in a really weird way believe in this uh but yeah that's those are my thoughts on it just produce more give it some structure and then have slides or something that visually moves broll stock image and then actually give valuable stuff and and keep going might be a weird channel it just blows up all right we got julio in the house let's go julio let's see what you got brother and guys is it okay if i can get like brutally honest with you guys like is it okay if i start roasting people and [ __ ] what are you guys okay with what do you guys accept time to roast julio that'd be fun bro right yeah i mean that'd be fun i would love to roast other people's code yeah imagine like if i'm the simon cowell like oh the youtube roaster bro for eight hours a day live oh [ __ ] oh man i don't have a appreciation all right guys so let's talk about breaking your first 1000 subscribers right so one thing you guys saw was the mindset it requires and right now we're just going into and breaking down what it is that you guys need help with in the meantime guys if you're getting value out of this make sure to turn off your phones lock in this is day two of the challenge by day five you will have your own youtube channel by day five you will be on track to being able to have financial freedom on day five you'll have a fullon blueprint to be able to create whatever it is that you were dreaming about or grow in a successful way so if that excites you make sure you're locked in make sure you're committed drop in the comments below i'm [ __ ] committed and let's go all right so i'm excited let's um let's go ahead and take a look at this video intro the start of my new youtube journey nice so just looking at this channel so far the only video i want to watch is this one i don't want to watch any of these other ones the reason is this is just weird but that's okay don't delete anything um this i'm not sure could be pretty good but the title is not it means anything to me and then here this one i also have no idea what's going on so i'm not going to click on it this one looks like a youtuber's video so i want to you know and i would take away the word intro i would just call it the start of my new youtube journey i think that'd be cool and let's click on it and watch what is happening uh julio says i just posted an intro for accountability so no music or cuts but i play with the vlog format a lot would love to know if you have any suggestions for me talking to the camera and because i know uh julio he's on my instagram i love his energy so i think this vlog is gonna be pretty uh entertaining and he should keep doing this but let's go guys let's get things started hey already it's like a good youtube video all right i'm excited so we're not in the weird territory anymore so as i said on my instagram i've decided to start a youtube channel pretty soon so this isn't actually gonna be my first video it's just gonna be an introduction of what it is that i'm planning on showing or what content i'm planning on creating rewarded uh based on their importance we can actually uh we can actually rank our importance it's a public rank where the artist knows who we are as fans and then can reward us personally so that i help you now when you're small and you're emerging you buy equipment make it in the industry i help you promote and then if you make it then maybe you can return to me with some rewards knowing that i'm your top one two three or f fifth fan right anyway so that started and i really really wanted to see and yeah and what i think i know okay so my thoughts on this is it's a good video i know that you did it just kind of like to do it um i would like if you look at me more and talk to me more um like in the start it felt very warm and like almost like you care for me and then here it feels a little cold like you don't care about me you're just like telling me what you do that you're good at or something like that um outside of that i think that this is a really great channel i think that if you keep putting out content i think it will work for you you have a really good personality you have good communication skills so i would push harder on it for you i recommend learn video editing spend time i think you're a fast dude i think you learn quick uh you have very high energy so your videos will bang your energy combined with learning editing and storytelling whatever it is you're trying to do you can do it faster by being able to have those skills so love it julio all right stacy sent me something so let's go ahead and take a look at that what is happening here um so i'm not sure what's happening here but it is fun music um okay this is a brand new channel for showcasing project oriented programming okay we share replit and github thanks for watching okay cool i would give it some kind of face or some kind of direction because right now it seems very faceless and generic and random and almost like a almost like a computer generated this video doesn't even seem like a human generated this video so um also i don't really understand what is happening here like i don't get it discover why our customers love pop code maker nobody cares because nobody knows about a pop code maker uh so you have to find a way to make me care you have to find like nobody cares about your stuff at all like nobody's here to watch your stuff about you and what you offer there's never a video where it's just like you guys come in like for coding right i can't just drop a video on my thing it's like come to our service profit with javascript profit with javascript you get oneonone coaching you got oneonone coaching and it's just like tries to hypnotize you buy our product there's no video like that because we know if we made it it would get like two views even though we have a channel with 830 000 subscribers nobody cares about our stuff for us people want to watch stuff that they want to watch that will be actually entertaining to them so make stuff that's um ha guys get rid of this like nonhuman [ __ ] that people are doing like put a [ __ ] face in there if you're scared like get unscared and just put your face in there talk look at the camera just some normal like human communication skills like i think are really important guys so i think it's one of the best ways to grow your channel all right beautiful miriam says yesterday i didn't follow the stream but i'm here now so i'm going to shoot on saturday 20 7 pm edit on sunday beautiful exciting exciting all right let's see joey you're up joey oh i got a good feeling about this one joey um this will do well if you're modeling channels you know that's a good idea i think that your fastest way to blowing up is ticktock i've seen [ __ ] like this on ticktock and ig reels blow up so i would say focus on that and then funnel people to these youtube videos and i think that'll be your fastest way to grow especially guys when you don't add your personality into it it's really hard to like grow it on youtube you know like i think one big thing that you can do is just by simply adding your personality in here and you now got a much better chance of winning on this platform all right cool uh julio says nobody thank you boss and yes i'll get to editing on my first video soon beautiful uh we got muktum here let's take a look at what's happening all right you're already wasting a lot of my time still wasting my time hey guys cool this is how it should start welcome back to learn with mathum so before we start today's session i want to thank you everyone for supporting me and helping me to reach 1k subscribers nice thank you very much for supporting for that happy news i am going to introduce you one more topic which okay then information nice that is the data okay cool so i love it you're providing very valuable information and then you get through it so technical videos like this is always will always work will always always always work you can't go wrong with like technical power points that's like one proven method of success the only way i would improve this video is what happens in the first 15 to 20 seconds i would instead i would instead do the video like this what's up guys today we're going to be talking about computer basics and we're going to be breaking down what is a computer electronically what is a keyboard and how does it work what is this i would give the hook and the what's included in this video in the first 30 second 45 seconds once those people are hooked then i would take 15 seconds to thank the for the subscribers and uh add in like subscribe to the channel so that flip for you will be very helpful your retention rate will go up and then these videos will start going up faster all right radiance i would be happy to review my channel olivia okay let's see she says can you do mine okay let's take a look at it but other than that good job hello my name's olivia tops and welcome back ocean channel oh [ __ ] that you don't have anything hold on because i'm doing work hey you do not have to play hey let's go and if you're not familiar with me or haven't come across any of my content hi hey my name is olivia ty and i have a mindset let's go manifestation coach entrepreneur and mommy of two beautiful little boys let's go though we are so i actually really like this i love the music and the vibe and like the boss attitude i have a store but the difference between people like oprah people like tony robbins people like people like gary vee oh [ __ ] tony robbins oprah and gary v okay i'm hooked like me and maybe people like you is that we don't play small we somewhere along the way we realize just how valuable being us truly is so if you have a dream or appalling or something that's inside of you [ __ ] feel this bro i can [ __ ] with this video maybe you so very well maybe you give great advice bro i would literally work out to this video tomorrow burning in love for society and humanity for you played children you've played extremely small you got to stop it cut it cut it period because that's not who you were meant to be and that's you see my my son dude you see my my son in the background my son that's not who you should be and you say i'm going okay olivia you here have i would actually watch your channel over even mine like uh are sitting on a gold mine so like i need for mindset [ __ ] is so [ __ ] important and like i literally subscribe to your channel i don't subscribe to [ __ ] um i this is the voice that like is actually helpful and these voices are everything to have this in your head you can have the devil's advocate [ __ ] the devil's advocates and the [ __ ] um everybody who's like too deep in their head and they have to analyze everything and think about it that is a disease this is what the world actually needs right like overthinking doesn't actually ever really help anything so for me personally if i just get very real with you that voice i need it i need more of that voice and even in our team right now we're creating that voice together as a culture and that and we're protecting it and preserving it and it is already changing everything so just like listening to this is amazing and then just like the beat and everything because like for me even when i listen to motivational stuff like i'm always like damn i want to make my own motivational stuff just so i can add a trap beat on it or like hiphop or something so i can vibe with it this i can vibe with so [ __ ] hard and then you're talking about mental wellness you're talking about overcoming adversity you're talking about personal fulfillment you're talking about stop playing small you're able you're trying to help people with depression this is something that the world truly truly needs here are the areas where i want you to improve okay olivia this is important because you're sitting on something where if you keep going with this this will actually become something and there's a reason why i followed and i'm sure people on the stream uh they're gonna hit subscribe as well um i want you to work on a few things lighting so i can see you okay um i wanna see you better and then maybe if you can get a yeti mic so i could hear you better because right now i'm very distracted between here and here and like looking at what's happening in the background and looking at this vent so that a lot of it okay but please hear me on this i want you to keep making videos even with the bad quality quote unquote not the best quality so don't let my words stop you from making content because you're like i will wait until i get the best no no don't do that i want you to keep making content i'll give you some simple tips if you shoot in daylight where the window is pointing to you already your lighting problems are solved it's like already ready to go if you just put up a light on you that's like clear and then you just sit there and give me the words you're gonna give me heavy hitting because the whole thing is about mindset and voice it would really help me if the audio quality is better so if you can actually you know get a yeti mic or something something cheap you don't have to really go like go overboard but this is awesome that you have something special here and thank you for sharing this actually this was this was so cool um okay qazi i would love your feedback this is my newest channel so gabi sent this so that's how you're gonna break your first thousand subscribers uh olivia you gotta just go and you gotta like make more content honestly so let me see how many videos you have you already got the thumbnail game down you're gonna grow you're gonna grow you just gotta go now you're gonna grow you're already talking about loa law of attraction you already know about that gary vee gang and tony robbins and oprah and like you're you're dialed in you know the titles you know that like you know what you're doing and then you got the value bombs and then you got the mindset work and it's boss

dad padre rico padre pobre hey let's go uh okay got some broll here i like it i love you know what i love the fact that the fact that you didn't even pay for it like i mean don't get me wrong i love paying for services and making sure their businesses are supported but like i love that you didn't let that stop you is what i'm trying to say like it just says shutterstock and you put it anyway so many people get into their own heads about this type of stuff you got broll okay this is great you're sitting in different locations you're moving on to an excel sheet oh oh my god you you finance it's on finance you um you are about to blow up if you keep going the thumbnail game is down too okay 70 subscribers already 109 89 views 132 views 51 views the titles could be better all right let me see let me go to english all right what do banks and finance companies take into account bear buying debt and financial horror story what is the capacity to pay okay great job i think keep going um yeah she is a pwg student yep gabi uh the only thing i can tell you is keep going and make more you're you're on the right track you just need to make more content the only things that could like improve um audio quality maybe investing in a better camera at some point but for now don't let that even that stop you just produce more all right oh man let's see what's happening because i'm like way above in the comments so i want to see like what is happening down great olivia says great job i'm a pwg student gabi oh i'm liking the comments you guys got a good engagement going okay yeah i've been playing small yeah got me motivated uh okay do you guys have a by the way if you guys pick out a channel too i would i i will jump on it all right let's see here so here rafikaze saw you mentioned more about showing revealing physic is it so necessary essential to show face it helps because humans watch content it helps um if you don't want to show it then produce good [ __ ] content then that's the only play you have then just make it really good and people will still watch it there's tons of people doing broll voice over over content you can make it good do a voiceover and it'll be good okay got it and he wants to get this one he wants to get roasted all right let's go roast all right the youtube roast whoa i don't even need to eat food today yeah you guys want the dark roast or the light roast let me know that too ahead of time how are you guys wanted medium roasted dark roast or light roast you guys let me know when you drop the link so if you're gonna drop the link to your channel you want me to roast you then give me what type of roast do you want um you can also get a decaf if you don't want any roast you can get a decaf all right here we go so um free editable invoice pdf format okay apparently blew up [ __ ] um ecd three free save the date cards photoshop pst what kind of [ __ ] it's like we gotta make this content now creating an android mini car park app okay let's take a look at this hello guys um okay today i'll be creating a really simple car park application for android um it's actually universal right outside of troll but then what i can okay i got your problem okay so let's see i'm just gonna take a look at one last thing when was the newest video one month ago our body that's called elevation right elevation is how high do you want it nice so here is the main problem okay this is what difference between professional youtubers and amateur this is how i know you're an amateur youtuber my friend all right let's get into the rose session so you have these videos that have clearly gotten 34 000 24 000 views but the last time you dropped them was five years ago three years ago five years ago so um that's the number one way that's how you not not grow your channel to 1 000 subscribers this is how you do it guys you find what works and then you decide deliberately you premeditate and think about it you decide not to do more of it that's the number one way to not grow your channel so the the best advice i can give to that is don't do that don't find what works let the market tell you that it works let your channel blow up and then go okay i'm not going to do more of this anymore so that's one thing i will say make more content like this that worked right this should give you an insight into the things that are working what i would do is i would make more content maybe make a react app where you're showing how to build an app and it'll kill that's what we're doing a clevver programmer and it crushes it so you know i think that if you do that along with post consistently i think you will win because you get it you're already past the 500 subscribers you just got a few more subscribers right now while we're on this all right cool cool make good content on popular titles on specially stuff that is performed well historically there's a number one way to not grow by not listening to the historic um historical data so there you go salman that's my feedback for you bro make more of the stuff that worked vicente says that was a light rasquazzi hey rafikaze decaf please radion sent me one and goes dark dark roast me boss i [ __ ] love this let's go all right radion wants a dark roast let's give him a dark roast yo what's up everybody welcome to tnp and welcome to my first react video here in this youtube channel so this is my first time coding on react and i think i'm going to do more videos using react because for me react is the best framework the best javascript framework if you don't know react react is a framework built by facebook is used to create web applications with one page or multiple pages using routes but you you gotta keep it moving bro and the start like you can't just hold it and not do anything in the start um so make sure that in the start you're keeping it moving like my visuals if they don't change for more than two seconds i'm already out but definitely if they're like not moving for this long then i'm definitely going to be out to build a youtube converter app if you don't know what is a youtube converter we are i'm going to search right now on google and show you so youtube have that [ __ ] prepared beforehand bro don't waste my time on it like if you want to show me what a youtube converter app is have it open already or put it on previous slides like have slideshow or have it prepared so then when you move to it you can move to and i can see it right away because like it's taking me too long to get to what we're going to be doing and why we're going to be doing it i also don't care about like what react.js framework is if i'm not like sold on the idea of what we're going to be building so the right way to do it is start it with the app be like we are going to be building this youtube converter app with react.js if you're excited smash the like button let's get in right into this video that's how you respect my time that's how you actually get me to pay attention and go to the next seconds if the video starts with this where it's like five seconds of your [ __ ] intro with nothing um i'm out you just wasted my time i don't care about what how fancy your [ __ ] logo is or what kind of graphics you have behind it it's it's a waste of my time it's not respectful to me right so five seconds in i don't know what is happening or what this is about or what i'm gonna get out of it what's up everybody welcome six seconds in welcome eight seconds in 10 seconds 12 seconds i still have no idea what it is about i think i'm going to do more videos using react because i don't care because um it's my first time so i don't care why you're gonna do more videos on react or this is your first time doing a video on react for me react is the best i don't care about you i care about me i still don't understand what's in it for me framework the best javascript framework i don't care because i don't even know what the app is that we're building and maybe i already know about react if you don't know react react is uh i probably wouldn't click on a video with react js if i didn't already know what it is so right now it might not be the best time to explain to me about react.js is used to create web applications with and then i mean by this time i'm out bro so um how to improve it get into the app really really fast as soon as you possibly can your first five seconds should be extremely relevant to what this video is gonna be about so i'll give you an example right if you go to clever programmer look at how we do our live streams this is one hack we learn and it helps us dominate so let me actually show you um let's go to this video right us reacting to apps and um qazi and sunny react to mindblowing react native apps let's see what the intro is lee from cleverprogrammer.com today i am here with your boy papa react how's it going guys super excited for today's video kazi what are we up to today guys we are going to be reacting to some insane apps on react native so within the first 17 seconds you know what we're going to be doing right do you know what we're going to be doing yes or no i've done that in the first 17 seconds because i'm respecting your time in the first year with your boy in the first four seconds i cut to the screen and i start even showing and demonstrating what we're gonna be working on i'm getting your trust if you don't see me get your trust then you're not gonna like follow it right let's see what happens in this video everybody hope you get so let's go down to let's pick out some other clone oh [ __ ] frankie and amana 25 000 views bro i want more of you more of you on the channel because you're dropping views all right so let's go to ones that are i mean this is like i think really crazy because we've edited this but um what i'm trying to find is i'm trying to find like our live stream so let me go to not live now let's go to uh past live streams and i want to go to like some of the some of the stuff where we're building apps for you guys so build a tinder clone build an airbn so this one let's click on this good boy sonny how's it going guys good to see you again and today we're gonna be building the react clone of airbnb so there 10 seconds in and the scene is set right the stage is set you know what you're going to be building you can see it you can visualize it you can touch it taste it smell it and now you got it now if you want to leave go ahead and leave but you visually see what we're going to be building i'm not using so many of my words to waste your time and you're like dude i don't know if it's going to be [ __ ] actually good or not i might as well just leave so in the start it's extremely important to put your hook and demonstrate truly why i will stick through and watch your video so that's that other than that i think the video is pretty good this drink so and again you know maybe volume up energy up um if your energy is not that up then maybe a better job with editing and better audio quality so i would invest in a better mic because there's a lot of noise i can hear in the back and i forgot right i can hear your computer fan running or your room fan running and leaves a bad taste in my mouth all right cool let's see who else we got nice hopefully you guys are liking this love the contrast calling your thumbnails of your videos thank you all right so the real secret guys to breaking your first 1000 subscribers right on youtube is really oh what did i do oh [ __ ] close everything all right so hopefully we'll get everything back up and running in a second oh wow all right sorry about that guys so the real secret to growing your channel and getting it started and getting it past that 1 000 subscriber mark is really keep posting more content so one is your quantity of content so you want to keep posting more so let's say this is what happens when you post more and then let's say this is your views right so you want to post more content and you will keep increasing linearly most of the times if you post more banger content then you will improve a lot faster so if i go into my journey of what happened i'll show you behind my analytics if you guys want to take a look at that and i'll go to where i broke my first 1000 subscribers literally was april to december 3rd right so you can see very little subscribers for a while and then boom december 3rd was was the exact day i hit my 1 000 subscribers so that's my friends how this took place is because right here i started making a lot of content so if you look here there's a lot of content right almost none of you guys that shared with me your channels very few of you actually had this volume of content and then when it comes to the content it's very precise niche down and then like on banker titles so because these titles i knew would get a lot of viewership so then it's tons of viewership and then i just made sure that the videos are good so let's go to my channel and i'm gonna go to videos and by the way guys if you're enjoying this smash that like button if you're whether on your face facebook or youtube this way the video goes out to more and more people julio says this is definitely a dope format reacting to channels live is interesting to watch even when you're not the one getting raided yeah so there it is right boom going through this and i made a bunch of these videos right the codecademy tutorial and it was a popular title then i launched a python programming series which like and eventually just blew the [ __ ] up uh this put me on the map right three or four thousand views 288 000 views 157 000 views um and then i made some random content that ended up not doing well because it was just too random for people like ufc 205 reaction snooker and amazon fba business people like what the [ __ ] is going on programming and life in chicago after 2016 election so oh [ __ ] was that when trump became president i think so right so after that my views started going down i'm kidding so that's what you can see happen and there were a bunch of really weird videos i started making and then i got back on track with how to teach yourself to code free code camp learn python did python programming so wherever i got off track and started making random content you can see how it like just didn't provide any results and it kind of like sucked right i talk about coding and provide valuable tips 20 000 views i talk about some random stuff 540 views importance of finding a mentor 1 500 views so this is where like it really matters that you're talking about valuable stuff on a regular basis right i go to sql then the views go up i talk about coding views go up all right if you guys have more channels for me to uh rate i will go ahead and do that so just says decaf what's up so it just says decaf please so let's see what is happening here cool thumbnails actually right yeah like good thumbnails like seems like a good channel 189 subscribers it's a good sign and we're playing apex legends ranked okay i got my boy right here in case i think it would be really cool if i can see you what's good did you start it yeah i did buckle and this time the audience can hear you how about they can uh i'm just gonna make sure real quick just just give me a second let me just make sure real quick okay yeah do that do that all right so the start this is one thing i notice a lot with streaming and streamers and this is where i where they [ __ ] up a lot and this is what allowed my live streams to do really really well your start is one of your most important points if you have a poor start your replay value drops essentially to zero so then if you don't get views during the live you will never get more views on that video because the replay value is killed because the start is like the start is always like hello hello can you guys hear me can you guys oh is my mic on hey hey we're starting right now are we started yet cool cool all right um okay uh checking the audio are you guys hearing this hello okay cool cool cool all right bro all right so that is the number one way to kill your replay value because when i'm watching now like [ __ ] this like they're not prepared this is not gonna be good this is gonna be garbage and it's a waste of my time i i it's so much better if i just don't watch this and waste my time on it so the hack is just this man like like i know that what's holding you back there's a lot of like self confidence and self the same stuff too uh and you have to be careful about that and just work on it yourself you might be with a friend you're like if i try to sound professional my friend is going to make fun of me thinking that i'm like trying to be so official and so i might as well just play it cool and laugh it off so then when my friend says something i can just be like yeah i was just like joking you know like i wasn't really like commit to your [ __ ] videos so like next time it starts i want you to be like guys this is nova place and today we're gonna be playing apex legend season six intro it look at the [ __ ] camera and if you're gonna hide your face which i don't know why everybody's trying to hide their face like it's like um it's almost like some kind of like epidemic with lower selfesteem that is going on around the world and i want you guys to work on that because it will affect you in so many ways in the long run i want you to get confidence out of this that's what my number one thing is why i want you guys to get on camera show your face show your videos not just so your youtube channel does well so you improve your confidence your speaking ability because if you're hiding on a youtube video how many other places in your life are you hiding you're probably hiding at your work because you're scared to have the conversation you're scared to show your face you know in those meetings maybe when you're in a group of friends maybe you're not saying your joke or your punch line because you think nobody's gonna hear you maybe you're hiding in your relationship and not saying what you truly need to say and own up to your [ __ ] so it's not just you hide on a youtube video you're hiding in many [ __ ] other places and that's what that gives away when i watch your video so guys more confidence mental health is very important this is why i even like really appreciate olivia's channel because she talks about she's talking about mental health so selfesteem selfworth selfconfidence extremely important people especially for streaming bro people don't watch your stream because of audio people don't watch your stream because of what game you're playing people watch or stream because of your personality and who you are the laziest people the the weirdest i've seen the weirdest people have big followings and streaming because people want to follow weird people but they just own it that they're [ __ ] weird the people who don't get followed are the people who don't show themselves or don't share their voice right like so i want to follow somebody who i can build a relationship with it's really hard for me to build a relationship with just voice don't know what you look like i don't know what you sound like i don't know who you are i can't read you like it's so much more entertaining when i can read your micro expressions if you're playing apex and you're like in trouble or you're like at a difficult level or you're playing with somebody and they're [ __ ] you up i want to see what happens in your expressions i'm going to see what happens when you're playing the game so um if you're especially streaming i think that's important the second thing is when the thing starts give a solid intro to what is happening as soon as you know you're live the second you hit live don't do the checking test test test don't do that just full this is nova place you're watching apex legends season six uh six ranked gold grind guys today we're gonna be grinding it out and i'm playing with one of my buddies and we're just going to go all in for you guys it's going to be super exciting i'm so glad you're here hit that like button so this video goes out to more people subscribe to the channel because we're going to be bringing you game play after gameplay and you're going to see us grind our faces off in apex legends all right let's roll and then just roll with your boy go right and start playing the game or whatever um so i think that will add a ton of replay value to your videos and then it will grow that way so i know it was probably not that light of a roast but all right matt short says roast me all right let's go to match short okay cool python short intro to python syntax i like it um five seconds in i think i would like it better if you even say it like with your voice but just keep in mind for intros long time so i recommend not having an intro just getting to it and then adding the intro later i recommend adding the intro later not the first possible thing hey everybody what's up how you doing today good energy very good energy hey so in this video uh we're going to talk about a little bit about python syntax and it's going to be a short introduction and i know trust me i can see the excitement on your face all the way through the internet so i'm gonna do these examples in idle which is python's integrated development and learning nice i like the joke i like that little like connection point i would like it even more i mean i feel like you got good personality i would like to see your face somewhere environment and here you can see it over here on my screen and if you're coming to python from another language the first thing you'll probably notice is that python statements don't have an any delimiter meaning some languages have some i like that you even edited it make it made it punchier that's really good thank you for that some kind of symbol to signal to the computer that they've reached line so we could just write something as simply as you uploaded this today great uh the only thing is why is it unlisted bro make this public this is awesome print and then it's indented four spaces and we'll get to the indents in a minute but for right now i just want you to understand that the code blocks each start with a semicolon or i'm sorry a colon and then into the block so we can say cool a varying different amount of spaces you got it you got this if you don't stop and you keep putting out content your channel will grow channel will grow everything we have you don't need to put your face unless you want to um you know it's a cool intro but i would i would start it off first and then intro it i think the things you can improve is add your face in the start what's up guys today we're gonna be giving you a short intro to python let's roll the intro and boom the intro then rolls so like imagine right how many seconds is that so what's up guys what's up guys today we're going to be talking about python let's roll the intro so that's about three to four seconds right when i counted it's about three to four seconds roll then turn three to four seconds and then boom get into the video i would make the intro even shorter try to get the intro like really really really short if you can just because it's it's not the best use of somebody's time um and yeah so that i think is gonna be good i think if you improve your audio quality so there's less background sound i think that will improve i'm liking that you're editing this that's a real that's really good too just a bit all right we'll save that so in this video uh we're gonna talk about a little bit about python but if you keep going with this you will grow so good job great work you put a put up a video i'm i'm happy roast me alive all right cool let's see who else is there test run um what type of roast are you looking for jesus if you don't say anything then i'm just gonna roast hey what's up chief yo the best audio quality so far now this is the first setup this is not gonna be you guys notice that right when the audio is right it just comp million times the difference like i would sacrifice video quality over audio even though youtube is a video platform i actually put sixty percent of the effort uh emphasis on audio and 40 of it on actually video so you guys notice that right as soon as this audio is good you're kind of hooked and you want to know what's happening in actual video of um that i'm going to put on youtube this is just a test run video and basically what i'm going to do with this is going to be like a trial and error i want to you know play a lot play with this two recordings because i'm using two cameras oh [ __ ] son most luckily i have two of the same kind and i'm gonna you know pull put this all right he's ready to blow up make sure your comments are turned on bro don't turn comments off because of insecurity i mean i don't know if you did that or if it automatically bro i'm gonna um mess around with the lighting i'm gonna mess around with the sound also and uh i'm going to send it to you hopefully you see you see this video and you know you can give me some good um criticism some good try to so uh a simple hack i'll tell you to improve the video so video is like 90 about lighting if you can get the lighting right the video just solves itself very few times you truly have to upgrade to a new camera um when you have light behind you that's a bad idea you should sit facing the other way so that light coming from that window points to you i wouldn't put more light behind me because now i'm paying more attention here than your face so if you sat the other way where if you turned around and were looking out the window and then you had the camera pointing to you from there then your face would be really lit up and i'd be able to see you a lot better and then it would like look much better uh second thing is i think there's a lot of like extra headspace so i would move the frame down so your head is like close to touching this more but outside of that brother i think if you make content that's valuable and you give valuable tips or suggest suggestions because i'm using two cameras you're on a winning you're about to win because you got good setup you have a good voice you have a great personality good confidence if you give valuable stuff and keep going you will grow a channel out of this radion says he's like owen cook right yeah kind of uh shubham says roast me if you can all right let's go youtube roast javascript here we go so hello guys this is welcome to the channel one of it so ask my video functions and functions nice good i like it in javascript or any other programming language so guys let's start the video nice that is great good audio quality good that he gives you what this is gonna be about and then he rolls the intro this dude respects my time i respect him back there's a reason why he has 16 to zero like the dislike ratio programming language and he already has things up he's already even giving you an insight into what's going to be happening in the video so guys let's start the video cool intro i speak urdu as well fluently um i mean you're speaking hindi but they're very similar hindi or do so i like the hindi and english mix mix and match that's pretty cool i speak with my family like that because i'm fluent in urdu uh slash hindi i'm and i'm fluent in english obviously so this is a cool way to do it and you're just keeping you're very clean and to the point so that's really good for example alert this is the first channel i've seen that is clean like when it comes to hindi and urdu most of the times it's like most of them they're not clean it's just like really weird people talking and sort of really weird videos this is like a clean video it's almost like it's literally a channel that was made in u.s and it's like banging but now you just mixed hindi with it and you're off to the races so this is gonna do well i think um i would improve the thumbnails i don't know why you have 7 8 9 10 numbers in there like i would not have those uh yeah i wouldn't have numbers like most of your views will come from somebody new right so somebody news coming in they don't care about your numbers most people watch videos based on what is in their home feed and recommended right so if i see a two um it will actually make me even really less likely to click on it what the [ __ ] is happening it's part two of something i don't wanna watch it because i probably haven't even seen part one so i would recommend um yeah more thumbnails like that i think that's good this one is too much it's kind of ugly it's just too much text this is a good thumbnail this is cool and then yeah let's click on your most popular videos oh nice web development in 100 seconds let's take a look at this 48 0 this has got to be pretty good let's see so hello guys and welcome to the nice so web channel in 100 seconds so then bootstrap is a css whatever you like so first is frontend all right more of this type of content bro people are loving it so more on this type of content dope all right awesome love it guys so i'm glad that we got to take a look at some of your channels and break them down i think we're gonna do this we're gonna keep doing this for you guys and give you guys feedback i really hope that you guys enjoyed that and you guys i hope you enjoyed what it actually takes to break through your first 1 000 subscribers now here's the homework for you all right the reason why you guys are here is not just to watch me roast other channels you guys are here because you want to start your own channel and if you start a channel and you get to 1000 subscribers then we can keep going so tomorrow just to give you guys a feedback of this again what's happening is day one we talked about the opportunity to grow a youtube channel day two we talked about which is today how can you get 1 000 subscribers right post good content post consistently that's pretty much the secret for that right day three where tomorrow we're gonna talk about how to get your first 1 000 from youtube so that's where we're going to get a little bit more technical and we're gonna even start talking about some other things like what kind of product or service you might be able to sell day four we're gonna plan out your first million dollars with youtube this is where it gets intense and then day five we're gonna create your blueprint okay so i hope that you guys got value out of this i hope that this was exciting to you or it something clicked or there was something that you really enjoyed about this i certainly enjoyed it a lot what i want you guys to do now is for day three who's excited for coming to day three guys day three we're gonna be talking about your first thousand dollars with youtube if you're excited about day three let me know in the comments below vicente says i mean i like the roasting part don't mind being here for that joey says i loved it thank you so much muktum says told you i will add what you told to alter radiance has really enjoyed it oh frank ramos wants a light roast okay all right i'll do one more for frank hi welcome to our video series we're gonna show you how to build the store in 10 minutes yo you guys saw that in the first six seconds he told me what the [ __ ] we're gonna be doing that's so cool the only thing that would improve this is if i could see the actual store in the first six seconds like i think it would be a lot cooler if you didn't have any of this text and instead in the background you actually had the store open that we're going to build we're
