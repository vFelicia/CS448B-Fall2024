what's up this is quasi from clever programmer college degree versus a coding bootcamp versus being selftaught which one is right for you in this video that's what we're gonna talk about but before we start please do me a favor smash that like button do that right now subscribe to the goddamn channel if you haven't already and let's get right into the video what's up guys this is qazi from cleverprogrammer and what i want to talk about today with you is what is the right path for you because you have so many choices that i couldn't even list them all out you have coding bootcamps you have a college degree you have the route of being a selftaught developer and not to mention you have unlimited youtube resources you have coursera edx same treehouse the list goes on right and there's so much that's out there but everybody has a specific situation a specific need and so let's address those and go down the list okay so first up let's start off with let's start off with let's take being a selftaught developer let's start there okay boom selftaught developer that was you know i would i would say that i was mostly a selftaught developer myself that's a path that's really close to my heart that's the path that i took now for me to get up to speed it did take a long time for me to like really become well versed in programming but a lot of it i picked up on my own how did i pick up most of these skills i took tutorials online from youtube i watched videos and blog posts online i went to coursera i went to udacity edx and many other platforms i remember doing the cs50 course that was freaking hard but also a lot of fun and i also remember i went to through this book called a little schemer okay fantastic book by the way if you want to improve your problem solving skills get this [ __ ] book it is so good it's called little schemers and it changes the game for you when it comes to learning recursion because recursion is such a difficult concept to understand and master and i would use this book to just keep going down the list of recursion keep doing practices i remember the kadur which is cdr and you it's a very primitive language right so there's not much you can do there's no like for loops you can't append stuff everything has to be done through recursion whether you're adding or subtracting whether you're dividing whatever it is you're doing like everything is done through recursion and it gets you so practiced in that concept and so good that then you can actually do things like whether you're trying to solve a maze you're trying to solve some type of recursive problem you get very good at thinking like that so fantastic book but you know kind of besides the point but yeah i mastered tons of things all by myself so that's the selftaught route i would spend 10 to 15 hours a day coding all by myself the great things about selftaught is i'd have to spend a lot of money i got to just practice and kind of learn on my own another great thing about being selftaught is you know i do feel like i got a lot of confidence from it because i you know taught myself all of these skills i basically taught myself how to become a developer now the downside of being selftaught is this i could have gotten my job as a developer a lot faster my skills could have been way stronger because i remember when i started being able to afford real developers i would go on platforms like code mentor and pay them like 70 an hour to train me they were [ __ ] good and they were just like [ __ ] slap me you know like no you're doing this wrong fix this fix this no you shouldn't do a commit of every single file all the time that's stupid commit one thing at a time okay so like i would always do git commit you know and like do dots like i would do commit all i'll be like never do that commit each file with like a specific message with that and i was like oh that's so smart and like little practical things or when i was learning python and django and the way one of my instructors her name was jessamine the way she would tell me i should name my models and every time i was actually adding when to actually migrate my data versus something else and i remember learning each of these lessons and they were so technical and so precise and i became so [ __ ] good and clean as a developer and i would test everything so rigorously and i was learning so many professional software developer skills from her had i been able to afford her earlier 1 million percent that would be the way to go it's kind of like if you wanted to learn basketball michael jordan was your coach and was coming in to train you two four five eight hours a day you just become so so so damn good there's no [ __ ] way you could get that good all by yourself like it just doesn't make sense it's not gonna happen right you get that training and then you become so good it's like tyson just becoming good by himself in a room right he could have probably become good but not great and that's kind of what happened when he had a coach so that was one of the things i always wished i had and i didn't even when i was doing chess and i became pro at chess in my high school at niles north i became so good at chess but i always wish i had a really good great coach but i could just never afford one that was the biggest problem so selftaught that's those are my thoughts on selftaught i think it's a great way to go but i think if i could have invested that's what i would have personally done okay next up we have a college degree so here are my thoughts on the college degree i think college degree is [ __ ] trash when it comes to becoming a fullon developer okay and let me explain why it is so grounded in theory it is so deeply grounded in theory it just never plays out to actual practicality of becoming a developer now with all due respect it matters what you're doing now if you want to become a data scientist and you need to know all the computer science theory and you need to have all of that other stuff handled yeah maybe it makes sense if you really need a deeply theoretical background it might make sense outside of that investing four years and putting in sixty thousand dollars or forty to sixty thousand dollars in those years and having to go to a chemistry [ __ ] class how the [ __ ] is chemistry gonna help you with coding like help me explain that that never made sense to me they said it would make sense at some point but it never made sense how is public speaking and help help me how did uh investment class help me with coding how did my history class help me with coding to this day i never understood maybe one day when i become smart enough i'll [ __ ] understand but until that day it doesn't make sense to me and when things don't make sense to me i make a [ __ ] decision and i just stop that's why i just stopped going to college so you know there's there's a limit to it and another thing that i really dislike about college is that a lot of the material is outdated you're not going to be learning react.js in college you're going to be learning php and wordpress which was like popular 20 years ago and now react gs is what's popular wait 20 years and then maybe they'll start teaching it so they're so far behind the actual practicality of what is going on in the job market versus what's going on in the professor's head who's been teaching there for 30 years and his only thing to worry about is whether he's gonna get tenure or not it doesn't make sense to me so for becoming a developer it doesn't make too much sense to me okay so between the college and selftaught i would recommend going selftaught and just like picking up these skills okay number three you have a coding bootcamp all right now let's talk about a coding bootcamp and the benefits of it and the cons of it okay so unlike a college degree a coding boot camp is between six to 12 months depends right some of them are three months like you have hack reactor and general assembly and whatever else is out there right leson lei wagon and a bunch of other ones right they are between three months to 12 months some of them are fulltime some of them are parttime most of them however require you to quit your job so you can focus on it and you know really change your career most of the coding bootcamp students are people who are looking to change their careers i think that's the first important thing to understand about who a coding bootcamp is generally for another thing about a coding bootcamp that i wanted to i wanted to go to coding boot camp way more than i ever wanted to go to a college because for me i want to learn in an extremely immersive way when i was learning jiu jitsu and lifting power lifting and kickboxing i did it for five to seven hours a day and i just became really good at it when i did chess i just did it for seven to ten hours a day four hours would be spent at the chess club every single day from 3 p.m to 7 or 8 p.m every single day except for saturdays um and maybe sundays so whenever i look at all the things i got good at whether it was ping pong or chess or bowling whatever it is right business it was a lot of time and immersion not i'm gonna do some chemistry and then i'm gonna do pe how the [ __ ] does that make sense to anybody like somebody please explain to me in chat maybe you're smarter than me and you can [ __ ] explain it because i was never able to explain it so what was i talking about coding so coding bootcamps right let's go back to just talking about coding bootcamp so immersion is the thing that i loved about the idea about coding bootcamps i remember i wanted to go to um i think one of them was hack react one of them was galvanize or something like that i really wanted to go to it because i just love the idea of immersion i love the idea of like learning just intensively in a couple of months time and i love the idea of you kind of come out and you're looking for a job or you're getting a job it is like this very defined goal so for me that was something i wanted to do but just like i couldn't get afford to get a chess coach i couldn't justify or afford uh you know spending 15 or 25 000 at the time but if i was one of you who has the money who is currently going to a job and is looking to career switch one million [ __ ] percent without any hesitation in my mind coding boot camp is a really intelligent decision to make because you're making that career switch happen in three months six months 12 months that's what you're looking at okay now with that said here a couple of things to keep in mind regardless of whichever track you're going okay so if you're going a very so just to recap so far if you want to go a very heavily theoretical track college might be really good for you if you want to just be extremely practical and you're looking to get a job and you're a student who has no income right now or low income and there isn't you don't have a parent that's going to invest in it or a family member that's going to invest in it then for you go and be selftaught okay look for resources network with people make friends learn from them it's going to take you a couple of years but you're very realistically going to get a job and not have a [ __ ] huge loan okay so get out of that loan and like just learn by yourself now if you're in the category three where if you have the money and you can actually that that's income that you can actually invest you just accelerate your process okay you're gonna go from like spending three years to like very realistically within six to twelve months have a possible career change okay so that's honestly what i would recommend and especially if you already have a job and you're looking to make a career switch i believe that's the fastest way now here's a couple of things i want to say to whichever camp you're in you have to work your f it's okay we're already in you have to work your [ __ ] ass off okay there's no getting around the actual work whether you spend fifteen thousand dollars in a code in boot camp or you spend sixty thousand dollars in a college degree or you spend so much time and effort being a selftaught developer guys please just drill this in your head you need to be spending like five to ten hours a day coding you need to be spending minimum of 20 to 40 hours a week coding minimum whichever direction you go because here's the thing unlike buying shoes or buying a cup of coffee you can't just buy skills that's something nobody ever teaches us we're so used to being consumers and just buying things buying things mice you're not gonna [ __ ] invest 20 to 40 hours a week 15 i don't care if you spend 300 000 on a coding bootcamp or a college degree nothing is going to happen i want so i want you to please get out of that mindset because that's very dangerous you can't buy skills write that [ __ ] down you cannot buy skills skills are earned and what happens at a college coding bootcamp self talk whatever you have mentors or people around you that are guiding you to learn those skills it is your job to acquire those skills so whichever way you go you're looking to spend 20 to 40 hours the only reason i recommend people invest is you're now exchanging money okay you're giving money to somebody who's already been think of it like a sherpa on a [ __ ] mountain okay if you want to go to what are some of those himalayan mountains mount everest okay if you're going to [ __ ] mount everest if you go alone by yourself you might actually die right so you pay the sherpa for his skill experience knowledge take you by the hand up there so you don't die and didn't know the path okay because the cost of error there is very very expensive let's take another example people are like hey why can't i just why can't i just do this selftaught like this sounds great like that sounds amazing to me well think about it like this okay it depends your current situation if you're a college student nobody's relying on you you don't have the income do it selftaught i think that's fantastic if you're somebody who's who has a family who has people depending on you if you really are ambitious and you want to do it in a shorter time there's a lot [ __ ] lying on the line now you have to do this quickly now you do need the support think of it like this okay this is the way i explain it imagine flying a plane would you rather have a textbook with you or you'd rather have a real pilot right there sitting in the cockpit training you that's the difference okay when you have things on the line and you have dreams on the line and you have you're very ambitious the time has a cost selftaught two three two three five years you'll get a job you'll pick up the skills and then at the job you'll learn at a coding bootcamp what you're doing is like hey i'm giving the money up front so i can get that same job experience that i would get from senior developers so they can just train me right here and then i come out getting a job so then i cut my time from three or five years into six months that's all that's happening okay so you're p you're exchanging monetary it's a monetary investment but you get time back everything always has a cost even a free thing has a cost the free things cost is time the thing where you pay money that has a monetary cost but now you just save time so you have to start thinking about what's important to you right when warren buffett probably doesn't go to get his own coffee even sometimes probably right he probably has somebody he pays somebody who gets some coffee now he's saving time by exchanging money so you have to start thinking in different patterns what's right for you but again if you're somebody who's looking to switch careers i think coding boot camp is the way to go that's it guys that's what i have for you today i hope you enjoyed this video i hope it gave you some freaking value and if it did smash that like button break that like button okay uh subscribe to the channel if you haven't already i love your beautiful face and here's what i want you to do drop it in the comments below what path is for you okay selftaught college degree boot camp and why okay so for example if you're a college student or whatever write selftaught and be like hey i'm a college student it helps me save money and i can just like blah blah great i'm going to heart it and i'm going to respond to you if you are the college degree camp right now i'm going to call it i'm going to get a college degree let me know why i think that's fantastic maybe it gives me some insight into something completely new and i'm always looking for that i'm a student and if you're on the other side where you're like i want to go to a coding bootcamp make sure you write coding bootcamp and then tell me what's your reason for wanting to join a coding bootcamp okay i love this [ __ ] community you guys are so brilliant you help me and us do what we do every day thank you so much i love your beautiful face and i'll see you in the next video
