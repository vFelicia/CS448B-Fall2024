hey guys what's up this is ky from clever program.com and today I want to talk about how you should use and think about your money so one tip I would like to offer you that will hopefully change your perspective on how you think about this is like a lot of people think about it as this very like static thing that you just pile up or save and then you use it for whatever reason like purchasing something but you should think of money as something that you can trade for another thing right and I know it sounds obvious or like duh yeah I trade my money in to go to Best Buy to buy some electronic equipment or trade it in for a car but I mean that you should start focusing on trading your money for skill so one thing that helped me a lot and how I was able to get a lot better in programming in a much shorter amount of time was as I started learning about programming I would do my other job where I would do where I would coach people in chess and then I wanted to get better at programming so what I did was I was like okay if I'm making certain amount of money money from teaching my chess I can trade that money trade that skill for the skill of programming so I'm using my chess skill and then I would take that money and I would give it to somebody else so they could teach me about the skill of computer programming and while I was learning on my own I was using this thing to help me boost because then I was able to work with like professional software Developers and learn the uh skills and the trades that they had or if I wanted to vice versa learn about Chess and I already knew programming I would start using my programming money like in a dynamic way to trade it for a skill so we a lot of the times use money to purchase things purchase static things which you know a lot of the times don't have a return value on them like you don't have an Roi or a return on your investment you'll just purchase some kind of liability or or maybe sometimes you purchase an asset you'll purchase a property or uh put it into stock most of the times we'll spend it on either buying clothes buying a jacket purchasing gloves or whatever right some random thing but if you start using your money to trade it for skill now you start getting to the next level and what a lot of the times happens is that you'll think okay I'm I I just got paid like $30 or $50 from somebody else I don't want to put that much money in but essentially how you should think of it is I just gave somebody my time for chess or for something like Photoshop and now I'm trading it in for learning about a skill in Final Cut Pro or I'm learning about a skill in some kind of business thing or cooking or arts and crafts painting whatever right you're trading one skill for another and this way you can start adding on and boosting up your skills really fast and again when you invest in learning and quality learning right not just I hate to say it like this and I don't want to sound like I'm against all schooling and colleges again I think there's a lot of value there but when I for example paid $1,500 for a course at my college where I knew more than my teacher and a lot of people did as well and that teacher really wasn't even a computer science teacher in the first place now that's money that I'm not getting my value back on right but if you trade it in with somebody who's skilled at that task and even if it costs you a little bit more you're now getting value back and again how I thought about it is if I did computer programming right and I worked at like for example I got a computer programming client who I worked for and they paid me money for Designing their website designing a invoicing system and a calendaring system for them for example right and when I would get paid by them I would trade it in and to to learn from a professional developer because how I thought of about it is like I'm trading my really you know crappy skill set for a much higher and a crazy higher level skill set right I didn't think about it like oh let me just keep my money I got my money and I'm just GNA keep it for myself right like whatever money I was getting I was like I'm going to use it to learn from somebody else and if you can hire somebody who you're not paying so much for like you can even hire some people from different countries there are websites that allow you to do like upwork.com for example you can hire people for much cheaper because they're they're in a different country and so if you pay them in their currency it's a lot of money so so essentially like let's say you're getting paid I don't know $10 an hour or $50 an hour $40 an hour right let's say you're getting paid $40 an hour or whatever if you hire somebody else from another country and you're paying them 20 bucks or 30 bucks an hour I mean think of it like holy crap I'm trading in my really terrible skill set you know for a really high level skill set and I'm getting two hours from this person so essentially I'm just learning a new skill becoming an amazing aming programmer amazing whatever right whatever things you're interested in Better Business person for free and as a matter of fact I'm making more money on top of it right even if you're trading in literally 100% of the money you're getting and then giving it and acquiring a new skill but I understand can't do that you got to pay your bills you got to pay for other stuff right that's fine but if you have money left over and you trade it in for a skill I mean you'll be increasing ing so fast in the things that you do because you'll save years of your time and sometimes it's more than years of your time it's a lifetime like when I was Landing my first Consulting gig for software development I had a mentor his name is Nick and if Nick ever watches this video Nick I love you you're awesome I'm still in touch with Nick uh he's actually one of the teachers at full stack Academy uh which is a programming boot camp and it's a really good boot camp um and how programming boot camps work is that in 3 months you spend some money there like I don't know a few thousand $10,000 or something and then they pretty much change your life and they will do their best to land you a job and a lot of people actually did end up getting job right off full Academy and Nick helped with that and Nick was one of my mentor who I didn't even you know I wasn't paying him but just because I was such a good student I was crazy I would be like working learning programming and coding skills like 20 hours a day so when I had Nick to help me out he helped me with my Consulting gig and told me what rate I should charge them and because I started off with a really high rate cuz thanks to Nick he told me what to charge I just saved five years of my time maybe more and I had a head start in front of everybody else and it was because I wasn't afraid to take my money give it to somebody who knew much better than me right like I had such a you know shitty skill set and I traded in for a superior high quality trained professional skill set so that's amazing it's essentially like I worked for one hour and somebody with the trained and a high level of skill set was essentially when they give you one hour of their time that's like 20 hours of your time or more so I was almost thinking of it like oh my God I'm earning time I'm saving so much time I'm literally like getting 10 to 20 hours or more per day and I could use that time to either hang out with people I liked and had fun or take that time and just boost myself so much so I could catch up with people who are years ahead of me right you'll hear most people rely on their experience as something that's very important you'll go to a job and people will just try to uh show their super superiority based on their experience and that's because that's how most people learn very linearly right like like this very linearly in one day their skill set is here in two day their skill set is here in three days skill set is here but when you work with somebody who's really good or you trade in your skill for another skill to improve and somebody who's a professional can teach you you're just learning exponentially like your curve is almost like absurd so you catch up to those people they're very fast and and then you end up becoming better than them and then it's not about experience anymore but that's the only way they know how it works that's why sometimes you'll hear in jobs like oh there's so much politics going on and these people think they're better than me even though I'm more skilled and that's the reason why it happens people are like well he spent 10 years you spend one year so it just doesn't make sense how you could have caught up to him but if you think about the skill set and if you use this way of learning yes it does make sense how you caught up to this person so again for me I just spent relent time I'm like I'm I'm a borderline obsessive right when I am learning about a new skill like if it's JiuJitsu I'm just watching JiuJitsu videos while I'm eating I'm just watching JiuJitsu videos while I'm walking around thinking about things I'm watching JiuJitsu videos when I was on my train on Metro like that's what it's about I'm ordering books on JiuJitsu I'm talking to JiuJitsu coaches I got a JiuJitsu membership like it's like my whole world is that and so I just I would pick it up really fast I would try to get a mentor in JiuJitsu as well with Pro programming you know you could use that to learn very quickly and don't be afraid of investing a lot of time in one place because then your rewards are so much better too like you don't have to go about it in such a systematic way like one hour a day for like the next 30 days you can do that that's fine but then just understand that the results you're going to get are also going to be in the next 30 or 60 days rather than in one week or whatever right so trade your skill set think of your money that you can actually invest it to earn skills that'll put a very different spin on how you think of money and how you can use it uh I hope this video wasn't lightning I know some of the stuff may seem obvious um and it might be I don't know that's just how I picked up a lot of the things really fast in whatever field I worked in or or started enjoying that's something I wanted to share with you guys maybe you'll find it helpful maybe it'll help you let me know if this helps you uh maybe I can speak more on this subject but the video is getting long so I'm going to stop but thank you guys for listening thank you guys for being here and I can't believe it we're over 10,000 subscribers that's amazing and you guys are amazing I have released a new course where I teach you guys how to to create python apps in 30 days or less so if you're wondering if you want to create learn how to create apps or you know um without having to know a million things about theory in Python and start to do some practical projects that's a great course for you to start taking we have a community of coders in our slack channel so everybody who's actually part of that course is also in the slack Channel and then they you guys can talk with each other so you don't get stuck I am always in that slack channel so I'll personally jump in and help you out if you're getting stuck on anything and yeah just check it out you know um I also have bunch of free videos in there that you can like click preview if you don't want to pay for the course that's fine there's a Learn Python course that's free we have thousands of students enrolled in there so you can check out the Learn Python course before you know if you before you want to jump into the oop Learn Python oop course which is a paid course and yeah you have 30day money back guarantee so if you want to get in there for a few days test some things out if it's too advanced for you you know you can um you know get your money back or you should just ask me first like hey is this too advanced for me but if you know basic python like for this course honestly we haven't even jumped into statements yet in this course cuz we're constantly adding more videos more modules more exercises and projects and we also have live webinars soot live training we haven't even jumped into um like lots of things that have to do with if statements or whatever but if you do if statements and if you do some functions like basic function knowledge that would be helpful to you so those are like uh things that are very supplemental but I think you can pick up most of those things while you're taking the course as well so check that course out out if you have any questions ask me about it we have about I think 20 students in that course now so you can ask those students questions about it as well and how they're doing they built some really cool stuff so far uh that they're shared and I'm going to put that actually in the course so like what the students are able to create they're learning like professional development workflows so like how do you put Sublime Text on one side how do you put the command line on one side and then how do you run python script rpts and how can you start working on GUI development into ker how do you install packages and libraries so lots of practical knowledge that will be something that you can actually put on your portfolio as well because that's where I would like to take it you know you go from basic basic basic python like where you don't know no anything don't know nothing it's called and Learn Python and you learn some basic things then we build projects and then maybe you know I want to put some course together for you guys that'll show you how to actually uh like step byep create a website where you can take those projects and put it as a portfolio and then how you Market yourself and how should you train for interviews and how should you position yourself so you have a much higher chance of get getting and Landing either uh independent job as a freelancer or Landing a job at a company and how you can actually use the briefcase technique and help them as well so lots of cool things coming up check it out again thank you for everything thank you for being here um and yeah so let me know what you thought about this video if you found anything helpful and I'll jump in there and talk to you okay I love you guys take care and I'll see you in the next video
