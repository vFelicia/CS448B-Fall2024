hey guys whats up this is kazi from clever programmer calm first of all I came in with a sexy hair cut and this new thing that I got for my seat it's pretty nice pretty comfortable arm today I wanted to talk with you guys about this amazing software for screenshot eng if you don't have it i don't know what you're doing with your life also i want to teach you how to actually ask for help from anywhere in the world to the point where it's so easy for people to help you that it doesn't even make sense for them to not help you okay so let's cover that kind of one step at a time so first of all I just want to talk about the help thing if you were trying to post it in the forums or you're trying to ask somebody for help and I don't care if it's about coding or really anything in life the person you're trying to ask for help you want to make sure that it's extremely easy for them to answer your question so if your code is broken don't just go my codes are broken and just panic or if some if there's something in life just go there's something wrong I don't know what's going on because the more vague your question is the harder it is for somebody to help you because they really don't know what's going on so if you can make it very specific with what you need help with and I know sometimes it's annoying to do that but if you can do that you will find out that you get help many many times and also another thing you'll discover is that you'll end up answering your own question throughout this process so that was the first part about how to kind of ask for help and the tool that i want to show you that is an amazing productivity tool and also it can take your asking for help game at just a completely next level like after this tool i literally talked to so many of these services like i'm using from our website and if i get into some problems I'll be like hey what's going on man like I need help with something they'll help me instantly so let me show you now the tool i'm talking about is called drop ler it's spelled dr o PL r and essentially to screenshot tool so most of the times when I would take screenshots what would happen is that it would sit right here on my desktop my desktop looked so hideous over time because it just filled up every single space because I just take a lot of screenshots right and I want to share those screenshots and it was also taking up a lot of space on my computer so my computer was getting low on space this tool allows you to take screenshots without them actually being stored on your desktop it essentially gets stored right over here and also it saves the desktops for you those screenshots for you so you can come back and retrieve them at any time and it can also record videos for you and this is the crazy part because what's the normal process for recording a video and sending it to somebody you have to record the video on your computer using a specialized software once it's done recording you have to edit it or whatever and then you have to export it and you have to sit there while it exports and it just takes so much of your time and then you can share it with somebody else and so nobody does it from their desktop nobody wants to record a video and share it but what this tool does and let me just show you really quickly so for example let's say that I got this piece of code from a student and they needed help on this here's how I would give them feedback on it okay and I'm going to hit on my computer I'm on a Mac I'm gonna hit option shift five and i'm just going to drag like this part and let's just do this live so i'll hit start recording okay so now i'm actually recording this alright so i'm going to pretend that i'm recording this that video all right Brian your code looks pretty good to me list some is a function that accepts an input list of numbers and you essentially go through it and you increment it by a blah blah blah and then now you're calling your function passing eating passing in this list with 10 numbers in it everything looks good to me now I just ended it okay and I'm going to tell it to record it as a movie I think you guys were actually unable to see that part and what it did is it just added it to my clipboard and now look the video is done and I can actually watch it ok so now I'm actually recording this all right so I'm going to pretend I'm of course and i'll just post this video in the link to so you can see it so look at how easy that was and now it's actually just a shareable link and this is what the link is it's just that link so nothing got uploaded to my computer nothing I've saved on my computer and I'm essentially able to share this with anybody in the world so it really lets me speak my mind without having to write down all this crap that I don't want to hide down to be honest with you and it just lets me share instantly for screenshots what's super cool is like I can do option shift and three and like take a screenshot so like here's my screenshot and again it's not saved on my computer and it's very easy to annotate stuff so I do that I do this and I say uh your code looks good now like let's say I want to move it so I'll move it up here let's say there's something sensitive about this maybe your credit card is showing up in the video maybe your driver's license is showing up or I don't know your face is showing up and it just doesn't look good you want to hide it click this blower button and then just go like this and it's gone okay like this is rocket science to do in other softwares and it's just this easy here and that's why i love it because of how fast it is and what you can do is just hit upload so now again this is just a shareable link and this is what the link is and look here's a picture and i'll post this picture in the video description below to so you can just check it out this software exists for both mac and windows so if your windows for the first time in your life you don't get screwed and you get an awesome software and another thing is that um it's free if you're only taking 10 like screenshots or 10 videos in a month and it stores up to one gigabyte of storage so that's a lot but and again it's HD videos you can even take animated gifs you can compose notes it shortens your URLs I mean it just has so many benefits but I have the ten dollars a month version and to be quite honest you should just get it because it takes your productivity to the next level and if you value your time think of it like you know the payoff of this and how much you use this you'll save hours and hours of your time and one good way i like to think about these things is like i'll think ok how much money do i make in an hour and if it saves me at least two hours am I making up for this right so like I don't know if you're working somewhere and you're making eight bucks or ten bucks an hour think of it like okay well let's save me one hour in a month and if it saves you that one hour then you can justify getting this and this is so useful that like don't have netflix and have this instead to be honest with you okay so that's the version I have the pro one and I don't know it's just awesome I want to share with you check it out if you don't like it you can cancel it within the first 30 days okay guys that's it that's another hack for you i want to show you today and as always love you guys so much and i can't wait to see you in the next video
