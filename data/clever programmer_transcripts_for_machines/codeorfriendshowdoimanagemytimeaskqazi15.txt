hey you what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and I have a very special video coming for you guys tomorrow it is going to teach you how you can use your current skills or your skills in any other thing aside from programming and then actually combine it with coding so I think this video is going to be very valuable for you and it took me a long time to kind of put this together it has a little bit of the chess stories in it as well that I covered at the chess state championships tournament so if you watch my live streams and maybe you saw that and if you didn't that's totally fine so I wanted to kind of tell you guys about that another thing I wanted to answer was nickels question which I'm sorry to kill I couldn't answer for the last few days there are tons of questions I have to answer so I am very excited I'm very happy that you were very patient with me but I'm gonna take a stab at an answer it now so nickels question goes friends or coding okay I broke his paragraph question down into like three words essentially so he's just wondering okay if I'm dealing with coding then I kind of feel bad that I'm not spending enough time with friends I'm gonna answer this question figure out how much you want to code right for me I was like 20 hours a day 18 hours a day I just go crazy whatever skill or whatever new thing that I'm learning I just want to go crazy in it and just learn the hell out of it so for you figure that out once I figured out that I'm gonna be spending massive amounts of time coding what did I do become friends with somebody or I turn to my actual you know my friend at that time who it was a really good friend I turned him into like my coding friend so I got him on board into the coding world and then we both just would code like all the time so we were best friends and then we were coding at the same time so that way I got my coding time in and I got my friend time in so whenever you're trying to develop a new skills get friends around that skill set so then you're not missing out on friends time and then you're not missing out on the skill time that's the massive 10x way to increase your skillset become so immersed that even your friends are in that industry but let's say that you have a best friend that does completely something else and they won't change and you don't want them to change and that's totally fine too that's the point where you have to sacrifice a little bit so if you were gonna do a 16 hour a day you can't do that anymore do it and these are ridiculous examples I'm gonna make it more normal humanly respect your schedule as well so let's say you walk we were gonna study for one hour or like learn computer programming problemsolve or work on building an app or whatever for one hour then 40 minutes should go into let's say your app building or your project and then maybe 20 minutes you can spend with the friend or 50 minutes can go into working and then 10 minutes with a friend and that will slow you down but that's a good way to keep your whole life balanced because I think it's very good to spend time with your friends right spend time with your friends because you don't want to lose those just normal human things about yourself because people don't like the person who can't be friends with anybody else and to quantify it for you I've worked with developers who are incredibly skilled and I paid them next to nothing to work with them compared to some other developers who were ok but I paid a lot like I'm talking like 80 90 dollars an hour or more some of them were actually hundred twenty dollars an hour it was their soft skills because they were able to charge so much not their technical skills so because you need you know people don't want to work with those people and that's just me quantifying it right but qualitatively looking at it subjectively you're just not a fun person to hang out with with from other people's perspective they don't want to spend time with you and that affects your relationships that affects your emotions and that affects your drive ultimately in the long run you need a way to kind of relax one good way is you can code work hard at the whole day and then at night you know go out with your friends and either go to a party or go out and eat something if you spend nighttime with your friends what I've seen a lot of when I wake up I'm really motivated to kind of get going for the next day so that's how I would answer that I'm gonna end this video keep it short because tomorrow's video is gonna be awesome is I took a lot of time to kind of build it I really hope you guys enjoy it watch it all the way through and yeah I'll see you in tomorrow's video I love you guys take care and I'll see you in the next video
