hey guys what's up this is kazy from clever program.com so up until now I have been teaching you guys about coding command lines python objectoriented stuff in Python and everything has been related to coding besides some Vlogs and life advice of course I love to give life advice but today I wanted to share something different with you guys what I thought would be really important for you guys is some productivity apps so that's what we're going to talk about in today's segment we are going to hone in on one particular productivity app and I think that this is by far the best productivity app of I don't know 2017 and 2016 and probably the previous years as well however one disclaimer this is for Mac but if you see how the app works maybe you can get something very similar in Windows as well so we're going to talk about this and see how this app works so this app that I want to talk about today is called Alfred few things that are really awesome about Alfred that I think are already kind of built into Windows is the search functionality because while I like Spotlight of Max the annoying thing is that sometimes it comes in the way when I'm doing math or it's a little bit slow when it comes to finding things and it's not as intelligent but with Alfred it finds things very fast so for example if I want to find py chart P oh oh oops py and then it just comes up like it just comes up pretty much instantly like as soon as I hit p and then it starts to rank the apps based on how you use them so the more you use the app the quickly the quicker it would find it so if you use QuickTime Player all the time the next time you put Q it wouldn't put the qu quack app in front of you it would put the Quick Time app in front of you so same thing with my software that I use for coding is called pie charm now while this is great A few other things that are really important about this is because it doesn't look for all the things at the same time like your folders and your files instead it'll just by default look for apps that's its Secret Sauce that's what makes it so fast now if you want to look for a file or a folder just simply um type in F before and then after that type in what you're looking for so now you can search up contacts or you could search up folders like Doc doents or downloads and it does a very fast job of finding those as well plus it can do a ton more but the cool feature about this is the my favorite feature about this is something called the clipboard now when you copy things around the internet you want to be able to paste them at some point but what happens when you copy two things can you go back and paste that first thing that you had initially copied not really so what do you have have to do you have to go back get that thing and then paste it now maybe you have a clipboard manager great however what if you need to go back and I mean really back in time to pull out something so let me give you a very quick example my website right it's called clever program.com and if you see my theme and you see that orange color at the top that's a specific color that's the Branded color of the website so I need to use this color when I'm making new kind of Graphics or new kind of um I don't know web page templates or whatever I need to keep the brand consistent there is something called a hex code for each color it's essentially a sixdigit code that uniquely identifies any particular color well I'm not going to waste my time trying to memorize that so instead I use my clipboard to kind of save that information for me and then later I can retrieve it at any point let me give you an example so I pop open my clipboard and it has all my previous things right in here so you can see for example it has my links and you can see that if it's a chrome link it has a Chrome icon right there and if it's a zoom link it has a zoom icon right there it's searchable you can navigate through it but more importantly it has its own search functionality up at the top so now if I type in let's say I'm looking for my color code right let me open up my uh let's see Color Picker app and maybe I'll go Color Picker and then in here if I want to put that code and get that orange I'll open up my clipboard and I will simply do actually let's type it into the search bar hashtag and you can see that it came up okay and if I type in F and then it comes up again so there it is that's my color let's go to prove that that's the color that we were looking for and I will simply go back to my Color Picker extension on my Chrome and if I put that color in m the hashtag symbol at the end you can you can see that it gives me that same exact orange nothing different so that's just one example of it another example of it uh another reason why I use it a lot is for uh pasting things that I need to use repeatedly so it could be an email template but for me one thing that I need to paste pretty like kind of like all the time is this so let me give you an example let's go to stack edit. this is like my handy text editor that I use from time to time because I think Word document kind of looks ugly and I don't like to even in Max Word documents I don't like to write in there I I use my own kind of things so if I go in here um and I kind of let's let's just delete all this for now okay if I do this equal equal equal thing my all my safe stuff for my YouTube comes and so then I just put that into my YouTube Channel's description right away so if you actually look at my description that's how I do it instead of having to save it somewhere particular or then have to go look it up later I don't have to do that my clipboard manager does that and the shortcut to that is uh command shift V and I think you can get something similar like that on Windows but what you're looking for what you need to search up if you're on Windows is something called a clipboard manager but if you on a map you should have Alfred it's faster than Spotlight it's better and again it allows you to do math without kind of opening it up all the way and blocking your view so that is another very cool reason for it and then there are some crazy things you can do you can create workflows you can create Snippets that automatically expand so other few benefits I love about this Alfred app that just are so amazing so let's say that you go to your video right and you're trying to respond to a hate comment no I'm kidding you're just trying to respond to somebody's comment right and you just click like let's say reply so many times you're trying to write something and then what happens like you try to reply or something breaks and you refresh and then everything is lost so you wrote this whole like reply to this person but everything is lost because of some stupid refresh or whatever so one thing I like to do which is practically like essentially how I'm I save things is I just go command a command C command a command C like as I'm writing things I'll just do command a command C and then just keep writing okay so what's the point of that well check it out it's in my clipboard forever and that way I never lose anything so the so this ends up being very handy because trust me so many times you'll be in a forum or you'll be somewhere you'll write stuff like even emails sometimes and you'll just lose but this is essentially a way of just copying things that you won't lose like for example this person says not to be nitpicky but English is relatively hard to learn well that's a good point uh maybe let me just copy that and maybe let me just uh copy something else and so later when I go somewhere outside of here I have everything so that's essentially my way of just going crazy and just saving whatever I need and then later on whenever I need to use it I'll have it forever and more importantly it's searchable so I can be like oh I can't find it but what if it was like not to be nitpicky right so it seriously just improves your workflow and it's so useful for coding cuz uh you have those beautiful on liners or you have that be beautiful piece of code that's working and that's doing everything but you want to not change a few things about it and add new things but you're not sure if it's going to break everything that was what you had done in the past so if you keep copying as you go and if you even change something thing now you can just always have whatever data that you need so those are a few key things I constantly use it for in my daytoday stuff that is probably the most productive app SLS software and I wanted to tell you guys about it so then you can use it and increase your speed and especially if you're coding all the time you have to copy like two or three different things you don't want to lose it you want to keep track of it so then you can just go to the next place and copy paste them and have a history of what you've copied pasted this app Alfred goes back three months of time okay so if I showed you how I set it up so if you get this app you can set it up the same way okay so if you open up Alfred I've saved my command space thing to open up my Alfred menu uh for searching and in the features you can see it has a ton of features right like um one password system terminal shell the common one I use are is calculator and probably clipboard I don't even use contacts that much but in here what I've saved the hotkey to instead of doing command V to paste I just did command shift V and that's one more modifier key but then it opens up my entire clipboard and then I just go through what I need and I go ahead and paste it I set it to save 3 months thing and then it just saves them so you can be doing things for a very long time and then have this like save things for you from the past and it just not having this is a huge pain in the ass I cannot imagine going back to that time when I didn't have this so honestly uh the reason why I was inspired to make this video was because I got to use my brother's MacBook Pro and while it was a lot better than mine I felt just so restricted I couldn't get anything done at least at the speed that I am used to getting things done and simply by not having this clipboard and Alfred so that's it for this video hopefully this will help you find a good clipboard manager improve your productivity improve your workflow and therefore your thought process and your coding skills and all of that stuff all right guys that's it for this video love you guys so much and I'll see you in the next video
