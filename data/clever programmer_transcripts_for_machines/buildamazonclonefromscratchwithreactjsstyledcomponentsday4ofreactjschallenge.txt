today as well you guys know this is the amazon clone nothing too crazy okay we've got of course the coding booth cam guys the first prize guys gets a coding bootcamp full stack mastery coding boot tech bootcamp this is a bootcamp that will take you from zero to actually being a full stack developer and actually letting a job as a full stack developer that is the goal so if you get this like the output for you could be a fullon job that pays you seventy eighty thousand dollars ninety thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars and more that's what this is worth i'm not kidding it's a very valuable okay if you as you guys know one sec one more time because harsh has uh donated 40 rupees that he's a beginner how should he start so what did you say though you should start by just being in here that's that's a good start right this is a good start start with like a challenge like this start out with learning the fundamentals that's the most important thing right build small projects you know a lot of fundamentals do not be afraid to invest yourself and do not be afraid to put in the time so number one put the time that's a very important aspect right so putting the time um right putting invest in yourself for example paid that being to courses or whatever it be because the end of the day just watching you tutorials the whole time is just not gonna make you a fullon developer right it's a good start but then you have to take this a lot further just so you know okay so make sure you do that that is a very important aspect that a lot of people get stuck in they get stuck in the youtube tutorial hell don't put yourself there all right awesome so all right that's amazing thank you so much for the donation you are the best okay next up okay who's ready to play and win it

yes cp team is the best thank you so much for such a great session enjoying tech teaser apo apocalypta i don't know how to say apostika and a beginner can go with it yes the computer can go of course guys nikhil says i joined yes i'm here a car says i joined a webinar yes okay sir exactly yes let's go all right guys full on let's go ahead and get started with with our application today all right so let's finish this up we are very very much close what do we do yesterday well yesterday what we did is very very cool right because what happened is we have this application looks a little bit kind of like this right and as you can see this allows us well we can go to the cart page we can you know go to the car and so forth so it's pretty pretty cool right now i can add the card which increases my number of items to 23 to 23 as you can see right here but now i want to take a step further and now let's go ahead and go to the next section which is going to be okay let's do this the next part is you see this card see this card it says four but technically you should say a lot mark right because look at this we have quantity here quantity here doesn't make sense correct so like we should technically get the quantity right here right yes or no correct of course yes so what we want to do is actually be able to get get the what's it called get the actual card get count of the card now to get count how do you think that should happen like in order to get the count let's think about this here for a second okay i want to get this count here okay guys think about this what do i need to do well we have these card items right right multiple car items correct we have the quantities for them right here right so if what if what if we think about this right just think of su this is called pseudocode guys this is called pseudocode right right so for example in order for us to get the card the the full so let me see let's think about this get uh let me see get cart what git card items uh get card count get card count right and so to get that really what do we have to do well what get all the items all the card items correct okay what else do you guys think right right so so then what for each card item card you get the quantity right right add the quantity quan to t to the what to the to the what to the total of card items correct to of card count there you go it's honestly that simple guys right literally look at this we have john just done a very very what a very a very kind of simple you know it's called pseudocode right you went from get card count get all the card items right there i spell items wrong but that's okay then right so we get all the card items now for each card item all we do is add the quantity to the total the card count right so that's pretty much it guys so let's not think about this all right let's think about this i'm gonna remove this stuff awesome so let's do that right now now to be able to actually fully what to let me oh right there to fully show that number properly what do you think that we should show that and which in which store and where because i know where it should be what do you think david huh what do you think i mean i would put it in the head there oh oh no how does good is good you smart david they're is smart guys right put on the comments if they be smart guys you guys think they're very smart i think so too sometimes most of times yes go on so guys as we thought about this if we go to the header right let's go ahead and create a function called get count okay let me go remove this all right so const const git count get count is equal to turn turn turn turn now now let's go and initialize the count to zero right now in here we need to go ahead and loop through all card items but here's the question where are these card items where do they go like how do we get them right that's a good question the way we get them is we need to pass them as what guys we need to pass in the car items is what as props because look at this let's go to app.js boom voila look at this we have what oh i don't know what happened here at the gs the card items are where here correct so last test let's pass them in not just into the cart i card but also into what the header so we're going to say card items is equal to what card items good good good and then what we do is we go to the header and here we're going to pass in the props so again we'll go we'll it's called this is called uh what's it called what is this called what did i say the last time uh the structuring structuring thank you i forgot what i thought car items right i know so we're going to destructure props to have the card items understood good good good good good and what are we going to do at this point well we're going to loop through every card item so look through all card items and to do that what we will do is very simple we'll say card items dot four each check this out for each and so what's going to happen is for each card item for each card item we're going to the following task think about this guys okay we're going to go ahead and do count right what what add what do we say add the quantity what at the quantity of the card item to what to total correct yes or no yes or no guys yes yes of course right so what are we going to do so the count plus equal to what item card item i will say item that what the what quantity and that quantity or how does well depends okay so i'm about quantity so again but that depends again it depends on okay so i got quantity okay let's see that under quantity beautiful so now all we got to do is think about this to call this function here's the cool thing if we get the count we loop through all we can do is return the number now return count boom right we return that count guys we are 155 likes that's cool guys you guys are the best let's get to 200 guys all right so we're going to return the count and what's going to happen now at this point we will go ahead and say what get count in here we'll say like this right there get count this will call the function and actually return the data think about this guys look at this it will call the function and and return the data and return your data exactly something do we need to use use date that's a good question we don't need to use use tape because here's why here's why here's why you'll see here's the thing card items is already is a state right card items is going to change automatically correct right so as car items changes this function is going to reran every single time the card items change and the get count function is going to be rerun every single time this portion changes because the car items is a state understood so that's why so sometimes you have to watch like do you need to use state or not so in this case we don't really need to use state now now let's go and save this and look at that what do we have we get an nan [Laughter] right what do you think it stands for guys what do you think it stands for tell me well it's very simple what it stands for is that we screwed up that's what it stands for we screwed the heck up now let's think about how do we go ahead and fix this right that's the question when you want to ask for something right very simple well let's think about this all right if you think about this one of the ways we can take a look at it is let's go ahead and console the actual current item so consult the log car items beautiful items okay okay let's go inspect down but on this one let's go to console because you know how much we love the console good let's go to console right here awesome let me see let me go and refresh the page here let's see it has nothing and now we have these two but then it says receive nan for the children attribute oh that's interesting why why why why you're covering the whole uh console by the way i know that's it there you go thank you so look at this same thing you represent a value something is not right guys you see so i actually think it's because of the kind because here's the thing guys if you go to cart items let's think about this wait uh isn't for each uh a thing a loop that doesn't return anything so basically we lose count in there we don't need to return anything we don't need to return anything because we only need to loop through we're not trying to return anything here but here's what guys look at this guys i want you to pay attention here real quickly guys you see this product right here this product well what do you think look we're trying to get the item.quantity but the item is this whole thing right here and the item has id and product not quantity we have to do item dot product that quantity that is will give us something that somebody gives a donation hold on who gives a nation who give me the nation who gave us donations oh dear ignition yo let's go 500 500 rupees thanks cp team keep up the good work love you guys appreciate you thank you so much whoo awesome so you see that's the issue so all we gotta do is do item dot product i'm thinking though what oh wait no no nothing nothing and there we go we have solved the issue right here let's go whoo you see 37 exactly right there see that's 37 right there so now if you think about this look at this all right here's the cool part let's go and remove this console.log we don't need this anymore okay let's remove this let's go to amazon if i click add to cart you see look at that the third it changes to 38 right away you see that guys holy moly how cool is that right that's a card here boom 39 that's a card here boom 40 boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom you see guys so how sick is that you tell me now you tell me now huh damn that work said yes dance oh somebody said this is out of frame okay let me make sure it's in frame actually i'll make sure is this in frame now yeah it's not right now i think yes yeah now it's in frame i think so thank you there you go now it's in frame i think right yeah it's in frame now whoo so natalia says coding is magic yes cars are stream guys no i think you should be in frame now is that correct yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now it should be yeah there we go good good my bad guys my bad mo all good we've saved we said we've saved the world here that's okay all right so it's going back to the card and so now that was our first part now what i want to focus on is let's go ahead and create the second part which is the card this proceed to checkout portion right here you see this producer check oh i want to start off i want us to focus on this portion now so this portion has a few things which just has a subtotal and then it has the total price so let's go to cart total and actually work on that that should be pretty pretty pretty cool all right let's think about this what do we do and so forth all right subtotal go react up all right to do that what are we gonna do guys very simple let's go to cart total card total and you notice how cool it is that and you can see for example uh well we have the container and we already have the subtotal his david's typing is already we have that there in there which is really cool let me see now one really cool thing that you notice right you see how we are working in little small components right we're going from one thing to another thing right from one thing to the second thing and so this allows us to really really focus on specific components and just build them one by one so trying to build this whole humongous thing that is the beauty of components and react.js okay so i want you to keep that in mind all right awesome let's go and continue on so what's next david what's next is actually we should be going into cars just smash that like button is what that's what's next oh yes oh i'm sorry yeah you should smash that like button like let's stop for a second and everybody make sure that like button down there is blue and it's smashed okay yes of course of course of course awesome so let's go and continue on all right uh next up is what are you gonna do we gotta go to car.js because obviously we need to pass in the card items into uh card total uh why why because we are we need to calculate the the amount that we are going to okay but not yet because i'm going to put in a fake amount first so far i'm gonna say let's say i'm gonna say two items and i'm gonna say and then after that what's gonna happen so let's say it's just two items and then we're going to in that we're going to actually put the what the the price correct okay good the price so you come with that beautiful that's going to be the price that looks awesome that looks really cool and then we're going to have a button a button a button that's going to be proceeded to choke out right so let's create a bouton so check out bouton good good good good so again he's going to use style components for this guys right so check out bhutan so const right there check out bouton is equal to style the div do you know oh start a button you see he's smart he's learning also i made the mistake and i used h2 here so i'm just gonna say uh subtotal that's fine good subtotal so the reason why he did this because he realized that we needed to add what we need to add some style into it and so with that he said subtotal which will allow us to just do style.h2 and actually give it a style at the same time so let's give a style to the bhutan right so let's think about the bhutan right the baton has what well i like you like my bhutan thing oh yeah i do so the first thing is first is the bouton has the the keyword what should it proceed to check out what what should you say proceed to checkout so proceed let me see proceed to to what to check out like this is that correct yes yes good pursue the check i think oh god so check out i like that okay i like that person check oh that's awesome and then what's going to happen is very simple is let's go ahead and add a background color so we'll do background background actually it's going to say this so we have we see what we got oh check out but it's not defined how uh i think i made a typo i think you did checo buton wait wait ah okay how do you spell checkout let's go hey you go now you get the patone right there okay you like my button you know name so background color background color we're going to give it a color of i have a copy for you okay fine you can just copy that's fine boom there we go awesome so save this and boom now it's an orange okay next thing what i want to do is i can make this this bit of a bigger a bit of a bigger what's it called a bit of a bigger um button but given a width of 100 so what this will do guys is they will stretch out this whole div by 100 so let's go ahead and do that right now yeah exactly all right right now so good good good so did you do it yeah i did let me see did you save it let me see save it let me see ah now it's there now it's there also i'm going to make it bigger hold up man you're tapping way too fast hold on hold on ah come on oh no i want to make it a little bit bigger so i'm going to say padding padding guys padding 4 pixels 4 pixels and and an 8 pixels so what this means guys just so you know no this is not trouble actually this is actually or this is actually vertical and horizontal right so this is going to apply so if you can see here it's going to apply four pixels to both the vertical axis which is the top and bottom and horizontal is going to be eight pixels that's going to be left and right that's another shortcut you guys can learn as well okay so boom right there so you can see this makes the button a little bit bigger right there you see that okay right there guys beautiful this makes it a little bit bigger awesome next up let's go ahead and do this let's give it okay fine border thank you and whether i want that first hold on yeah yeah that's fine and we are 200 likes you guys are all right beautiful beautiful all right so we got the border 2 pixel solid right there that's going to save that that's going to give it oh look at how good this looks now look at this procedure checkout looks so much better now what's up magnificent he added a border radius guys the reason why is to add a little bit of this concave shape right here correct and that's pretty much it now of course you see it doesn't doesn't feel like a button because it doesn't have this hand thing right on it so what we are going to do is we are going to do a cursor pointer to add no not type yeah there you go good cursor pointer that's going to give it that specific kind of like uh you know button automate automatic on a button i know the ui is the case that's interesting okay and now it's going to happen guys it's very simple is we will do a font size so we'll do a font size on this one 16 16 pixels as well pixels good so so much bigger also let's go this when you go ahead and so if i click on this if i go and hover this it should technically change some kind of like uh what's it called um you know some kind of uh meaning that it's you know it's a hover state so let's do hover on the hover of this on the hover of this button i'll just boot on okay you know what's funny buton in in ukrainian actually means bread literally means bread really so now you're basically saying bread all the time so this bhuton we're going to change the background color of this bouton all right right all right like so right here so that way when i go ahead and actually hover over this boom right there you see it's a little bit better now you guys see that yes or no understood understood good good good good good good but now the bread well now when you hover over the bread it actually shows that little thingy exactly exactly awesome so now next up let's go and focus on this subtotal so subtotal i'm going to do a margin bottom to maybe push what's up we got to stop here for a second on wants to see you dancing for a lovely donation where yo aung what's up hey um i hope you're dancing on here too i hope you dance and do the same time man let's go all right let's go on thank you so much man i appreciate it let me say lip chick guys so beautiful beautiful beautiful hey dance can you please be the founder of dance class oh my gosh guys whoa we have another donation holy moly came to for the coast state for the dancing holy moly james let's go that's funny that's awesome overall this whole course is better than college that is amazing you guys ready for this oh beautiful i'm so cringe i know it can be cringy sometimes you know what can i say all right beautiful beautiful beautiful guys so let's go ahead and do this margin bottom right num holy moly somebody said that's funny that's funny so what we'll do we'll do margin bottom 16 pixels for this one 16 pixels boom right there hey that pushes the procedure check a little bit more and one thing i want to do is i want to kind of make this i want to make this a little bit bigger i'm going to make this 0.3 boom all right that makes it a little bit bigger beautiful awesome more beautiful so that's good so we got this also it's going to remove this specific height because we don't need this height anymore as well good save that wait good now check this out you see how for example this now where right away stretches out the whole thing why is that guys what do you think is you see how this subtotal stretches out the whole way out right why why well to fix that it's actually a pretty simple fix check this out guys if we go to the cart page cart page right this is display flex if i say here align items align items and i just say flex start right meaning basically align them all the way to the top of the page look at this boom right there you see so i say look align all these items card items and card turtle to the top of the page flex start it will align to the top of the page which is here and guys that is pretty much it right there boom boom boom boom boom right align it there and so that will be it will this right here this car total will take up as much space as it only needs understood understood yes nice nice beautiful all right so we got that portion now second part to this this is going to be the interesting part guys we have the card item let me go put this to the right side boom boom awesome we got that's all good now the items look at this we have the price and we have the items in here is that correct yes or no yes correct now the question now becomes is very simple for you and for me guys okay how do we get the total here what do we do like i said we need to pass it in that's it what do we do well but just like we said before right here are some of the steps that we should be thinking about doing right again what are we going to do right loop through loop through all the car items correct then what for each item item what right add what at the price what example how do we get the total price okay we add the price of the item item multiplied by by the quantity right because think about this think about this right if there are right now if there are two macbook pros and they both cost let's say a thousand dollars then the total price is how much guys the total price is what two thousand not one thousand but the total price of the whole card is two thousand because two macbook pros each one costs a thousand dollars right so we have to not only include the price which is right here the price but also multiply the price by the quantity that's in the cart understood because somebody said for each item take quantity multiple prices exactly stefan beautiful job that's exactly and then what we do is what save what save the what save what save the total save the total save the save the price in the total or add the price of total at the price of total add to the total exactly right actually we just received a suggestion from david he goes like if we put the uh card item loop from the header and move it to a standalone function file and reuse it that way we can reduce i like that that's actually pretty smart david that's actually pretty smart we can do that for the get total price yes you we can do that for the get total count we can reuse that one right we can use that one i think so right now we can reuse that that that functionality right but they get total price that will be fully used in the actual procedure checkout and that kind of stuff right so but yeah that's awesome i like it i like it i like it so in here i kind of just want to add it to here for a second right now right so what i want to do because i'm focusing only on i'm focusing only on the what the well let me see you can there we go i'm focusing only on the the price right now so i'm gonna say const get total price is equal to what boom it's a function now correct so let's think about this right this is what we need to do right so for loop through each car item so the first things first need to do is we need to actually pass the car items into here is that correct yes or no of course uh jason jsx what's going on here no no it was just uh there was another closing thing and it's so good i just fixed this yeah cool cool so look at this now so we got that get oil price now it's passing the car items into where the cart as well correct so let's do app.js let's pass in well we do pass in wait it's in the closet in so he actually means let's move it to the cart to the functionality of the card section um i kind of like that actually maybe that's better even so we don't have to pass it in every single time hold on hold the phone hold the phone let's do that here's we'll do this get to a price instead of having a bean in here guys i'll teach you this really something really quick here okay instead of having it being inside the car total here's what we'll do we'll go the cart and we'll we'll find it we'll we'll create it here boom right there so we have to pass in the get the car items everywhere all this thing every single time okay so now let's think about this get total price that's good good good good and now let's go ahead and actually calculate the total which is really simple right we need to loop through what loop through let's go and initialize the total so let total is equal to zero good and what now what now what are we doing to do card items correct why what yeah right what yeah yeah card items okay let me see where's ecam hold on ah that's not what i want there we go think about that okay there we go we're going to do card items for each boom boom boom so for each item right just how we've done it before we're going to do we will go ahead and do total plus equal to what plus equal to what item the product the price times what times the item the product.quantity item the product that quantity boom right there right there that's going to be your your total guys total plus equal to somebody said why not use reduced why not use reduced because people do not know reduce just yet so i don't want to confuse you guys too much with reduce you want to start from the from basics and then you can use reduce after that guys okay so total plus equal to item the product price times item the product that quantity right so that is awesome and all we do is return total boom right there return total save that and now to do this all we got to do is very simple guys let's think about this right let's think about this let's go and pass in the get total price in here so we'll do git total price price right there is equal to what ins simple get total price see right in the cart total we we're going to pass it as a props and then we're going to use it now so so get total price right there okay and now all we got to do at this point is just get it to a price look at this now here call that function do get total price but i gotta call it an actual function right there like this boom oh would you look at this guys whoa look at this right some we just iterate through all the prices in the object and find the total exactly guys look at this this by the way yes this is called the structuring of course we passed in the ghetto price from where from the cart in here we pass in the function itself from the card total in here pass it into what the cart total right and then all we need to simply use that function that's honestly guys that is it that is all you need to do okay that's all you need to do guys beautiful so we saved that portion so see that person that's all good all right now let's think about this now so we got the total price now let's think about let's go back to cart let's think about the ghetto count right well that's inside the cart item so if we go to cart items here where's actually now where's where's the gittle account it's in the header it's in the header that's what uh that's what david said we might be able to put uh grab it and export it as a as an external um like it's a like a component ah that's okay and actually no you you don't wanna know components components it can be a component um components you you don't want to make functionality components guys components are only for ui ux elements okay just so you guys know very very important okay for components it's only about dividing up every ui ux element functionality wise that's how we use components okay you can use things like redux for that and so forth okay but inside there you should not use that okay beautiful so github price we pass it into here that is amazing now last thing we're going to do is we're going to also create a get uh what get total count right so let's do git you can actually that's going to copy from the header so head to the gs i know technically it's copying uh technically it's you know not the best way of doing this but it's okay so we'll do go to here go to cart we'll copy the get count boom boom get count right there boom boom right there right there so we also now have the cut the count functionality as well since we'll do a card total plus what get count get count right here is equal to what guys is equal to get count boom right there so get count is equal to get count that's pretty pretty pretty much it honestly so cool we got that portion car items get count that's all good comprende all is bueno correct yes or no yes let's now go to the card total good inside the cartridge will also pass in the the get count functionality the account good and inside here guys what do you guys think we knew tell me tell me in the description what do you do guys what do you guys tell me well we just do get count in here that's it yeah count and boom look at that we got 40 items boom guys look at this we got 40 items we got 5 1737 1 5 100 51 735 that we're gonna spend on 25 macbook pros and 15 ipads who want 25 apple bros guys huh tell me i like that i like that you can ship it to me you know my address yeah yeah exactly exactly so you can see i know right so now we got this we got this but there is an issue here there is one issue guys here there's one issue here okay let me let me load this down okay the one issue here uh two so guys one issue here is very simple okay anybody sees an issue here guys you see how this number is not formatted it doesn't seem like it's a real number that's actually a form of that number how do we format that number bro oh dang that's where you come in yeah that's where i come in so look that's some ninjas so to form this number we can actually use a react library guys or a library so for example if you type in for example react number format all right think about this are you kidding me you're just gonna do an np i'm installing get it done that way of course why not that's that's all the solution for everything so react component you see everything guys you can find with react any any solution that you want anything you want to find out for example let's say you want to build a slider or let's say you want to build anything else you know in react there's a component for it there's something that's going to help you do it all you got to do is search up on google that's pretty much it guys so i will do react number format in here okay and this one for example says react component to form a number in an input as a text boom right there look at this guys this will give an example here's an example you see i can format it as a value that's pretty much it look at this this is literally all i need look i'll put look dollar sign like you know what i mean you got the answer right there you got this somebody said just somebody said that just use display flex that's funny so so here's what we'll do we've been saying all the time i know i know i know so here's what we'll do we'll do npm install react number format right there so npm install react number format so here's what we'll do let's go and go to here let's open this up inside integrated terminal boom npm install react number format so install that right there guys google is the master everybody says yes it is always and now all we got to do is use it okay now the question is how do we use it pretty simple right let's go and figure out how do we use it well you need to import it first so it's going to import it using this using import number format in here so as we'll do we'll import it in here oh another format and now we just need to use that number that's pretty much it so so look number format let me see let me see where's how do we do it look see we pass in the value which is a number we can say what text separator and so and the prefix if you wanted to it's as simple as that and exactly what we're going to do actually check this out guys yep display text thoughts are pretty good so look right as we'll do we'll do number format we'll copy this actually fully boom copy this boom i'm showing you guys how a developer does this honestly there's nothing crazy to this guys i'm just gonna i just want to let you know there's literally nothing crazy to something like this just so you know okay guys let me see go to here good let's go ahead and uh what just happened actually i don't need this at all good boom you see now there's number formats now this is what we were get ah where'd it go yo what's happening man oh no just happened all bad guys it's okay i got under control do you i think it's because i click hide that's why oh yeah so it's a good door this has happened to us multiple times so now to us it's like okay that's fine so so let's go do this right so we have look at this number format value is this display text is this okay then we have thousands separate that's true prefix is dollar sign so here's what we'll do all i gotta do now is just change this right here and we'll see what get total price call the function let's see it now oh would you look at this guys oh crisp whoo look at this guys 51 735 you can see that this becomes like a very readable number right instead of having a number that's like you know 51 and not without a comma right this is an actual clean number which is amazing amazing right that's pretty much it guys look at this and this you see you see how fast we did this guys so fast super duper fast super super super duper fast okay good so now we got that portion okay next up what i want to do is very simple guys look at this so we have this is working the at the card is working the card is working itself that is amazing the next thing i want to change is to be able to do the quantity portion i think that's the next thing that we should be focusing on uh up next pretty much let me go and take a look at this yes how do we go ahead and actually change the item quantity guys that is the question right how do we change the item quantity what do you think david so i think we should be doing something in the card items.js file where we have uh where we have all the uh select thingies okay so let's go do that and what i'm thinking of doing is actually no it's actually in the card item instead of card items because that's right item are you sure yes i am okay we have the select right right right because again this portion right works on the actual individual item so we should have a function that that basically allows us to change the quantity inside individual car item understood exactly and what i would do is um going into the select uh over here and then hit add and then just fire off an unchanged right yeah so what does that mean tell me so that means is whenever i go ahead click that quantity button and select something else than the active value of the select correct it's going to fire this function off right correct let's do that so let's go go ahead and do something about it all right so what i'm what i'm gonna do here is actually before before i get that started i want to create a brand new function uh we're going to get it done in just a minute but what i want to uh have is a new function that will change the value in firebase so it will be co i'm going to call it change uh quantity so change quantity good and it's just going to be a simple function i'm just going to leave it empty for now and what i'm going to do is unchange going back to the select so on change um there is obviously a an event that is actually fired with the um with the function correct okay awesome yes and that will have a value now i want to make sure that that value is going to be passed in the change quantity uh function right good yes so what i do here is i'm gonna say change quantity and event dot target dot value so what does this mean guys just so you do as you guys know okay event the target value look at this so what this means select so this select option right here right this side option right here what happens here is that when you click on change it receives an event in the event here this event is actually that you click from 2025 to quantity 12. exactly now it has a value the value is going to be the 12. right so right this event has a it changed because for example here's what here's what we can do if i can pass it think about this guys i can do pass and change quantity e okay let's just i want to show to you guys and then i can do console log for example if i do console log on here oh yeah i saw the log let's just say e okay now you guys can see exactly what we're talking about right there's nothing nothing to hide right oh yeah e right so that's the event and then let's say for example i go to the inspector on here and then i go to my console okay can you hide us just so we can see the terminal good good good so here for example let's say i click on this look see that's an event that gets fired up automatically by javascript itself and look at this this event has a lot of stuff right a lot a lot of stuff one thing has look the target oh the target you see that and this target has look at this target go down go down good stop too there's a lot of stuff like html and html software node right keep going keep going op rst there's more stuff holy shiz nick st value boom boom right there you see that guys that is the value that we clicked on okay value e dot target dot value so if i want to go ahead and get that value i do either target that value and now for example when i go ahead and go to here console log the the the new quantity i can call it whatever what should we call a new quantity that's fine yeah i'll call it new quantity something's like holy shiznick [Laughter] good so consola log new quantity ah oh what you know what see ya what cg boom there you have it oh my god okay fine he's trying to be fancy out here you guys i mean snippets bro speed okay cool so inspect them on this again guys let's see okay console console right if i go ahead and i'll clear this out if i click on this boom 17. see i click on 17. 10. boom oh oh oh let's go that is what i'm talking about you guys see this is how you do it little by little by little and you get yourself the answer right there's always an answer to everything all right beautiful so we got that portion this is exciting stuff huh what do you guys think oh yeah yes now so we got that portion guys now now let's actually now change the quantity now to change the quantity we need to actually go to the database now so do db.collection.com items right because of course we need to what we need to go to the right change the quantity the quantity in db right that's going to be our next portion okay oh good good nice good it's it it's called card items right just like that and so what he's doing here is he's getting the collection for the card items okay and then he's basically he's getting the individual card item by the id right because why we pass it into here you see that guys the id is in here okay and then all we do is we do the update the update and we give it the new quantity which is the new quantity right here and we do parse in because we want to make it not a string but an actual integer right not not a string but an actual integer number right because later on we need to be able to add them together right so that's how we do that parts and i think it's already an integer but it's just a good practice to just make sure every single time that you parse it to the correct format exactly next up you have is db is not defined no problem whatsoever so you need to import db so import right here db from what do you not see my type david firebase right there awesome so right there awesome so we got that portion and now guys when we go ahead and change the quantity in the cart items what do you think should have it's going to like chain through the whole application what do you think should happen are you guys ready for this are you ready for this yes or no are you ready let's go let's think about this let's try this out this is gonna be really cool so now okay let's think let's make sure this actually works if i go to now the quantity here let's change this to now one oh pay attention to it i would change it on the header look and then the subtotal as well look and leave the price got up guys guys look at this guys look at here look at here look at the price ready for this bro boom already boom boom boom same thing with this same thing with this whatever i want let's get let's get 19. let's get 19 of these ones 50 000 let's go ahead and go boom shakalaka is how we do it guys how sick is that now how does this all work you might be asking yourself huh how does it work like how what is it what what magic black box is this and look there is an explanation for everything right the question is do you know it right so guys let's do it guys let's explain how this actually works i want to show i want to show you guys some magic okay i'll show you some magic here okay understood beautiful there we go now here check this out guys i want to show you something really cool really cool the reason why this all this stuff works is because of state and because of firebase it's very simple if we go for example guys i want to show you something if we go to the home page okay right we get product if we go to the cart page what do we have we get this if we go to the app.js page what do we have we have cart items so the whole magic is actually in partially in here and inside here and this is the reason all these numbers are changing just this right here okay so i want you to pay attention really quickly here guys just pay attention really really quickly here and and trust me and if you understand it now if you are like holy this is crazy i want you to smash the like button on this video and i wanted to share this with your facebook friends i'm not kidding with you right now right if you're like holy this is so good you will i want you to promise me you'll do it can you promise me you'll do that guys can you promise me can you promise me you'll do that i can promise you good so so here's what we'll do guys check this out this firebase on the snapshot of the card items you see that right there right right on the snapshot of the card items if i for example look at think of this this right here gets you the card item see that right there this gets the card items from the database right yes or no well this right here is actually a live connection right so if i wanna if i'm gonna draw this out for you the way it kind of works very simple here's the database right here okay uh database is right here right let me actually make this to the righthand side so we have it here boom okay all right database is right here this is your app correct i'm going to say this is app this is db correct let's check this out what happens here is very simple oh what happens here is very simple this right here the unsnapshot creates a continuous connection between db and your app so i want to show you something it's a connection look like this app goes to db and now db has a connection to back the app it's called a webhook it's called a continuous hook right it's a hook basically right and so what's going on here is there and this right here is is live so this way is a live connection right so what happens here is very simple if there's a change if there's a change on change in the database make this smaller in a database what's going to happen is what it's going to tell back the app that something has changed in the database so look and when it has changed the database what that creates is that what that fires off to the south guys this fires off this again how insane is that i want you to think about that here for a second okay right how insane is that right right this fires off that and so you actually see i can actually put a console log in here and you can see that that's how it works and so what happens then is this guys updates what the state if the state updates right if the state updates then what happens guys right on the change of the state that causes a what a rerender off page of components components yeah rerender what i say when i say rerender guys just refreshing right it's hitting it's almost like hitting refresh on your browser basically but it's like you just hit refresh on on that particular component exactly on that particular component right right in the state updates it tells the children to up exactly so if the state updates then all these children for example that are using the states for example this is why we have things like what we have the header right here right the user that thing and then we have the card items right here right for example right right these things these numbers actually these numbers get refreshed again because these state card items was changed again db triggered this whole thing right db triggered this function again right and think about this what makes db trigger this well because what when we go to the card item we say hey update the quantity boom that means there's a change here that means we that means db saw the change in the quantity and that is when it fired off and told the app that something has changed live this is why firebase is something called a live database do we understand that yes or no how sick is that i want you to tell me guys how cool is that that is a pretty interesting explanation a very interesting way of the way things work right and as you get more deeper into react everything works like this yes everything works like this this is why things happen so fast now of course now i'll take you back to here not saying that this is going to go ahead and actually right it's not not saying this is going to go ahead and actually fully like update uh what's it called um what's it called it's not it's not doing a hard refresh but react is very smart exactly what it needs to refresh so iraq is very smart that's saying okay well i need to refresh this and i need to refresh this it's us it's usually called a virtual dom it's because something called a virtual dom yeah exactly and that's the superpower of react and and just firebase working together yeah it's like just making everything it's super efficient if you know how to use it right exactly it's just like everything is up guys we've got the quantity do we understand that yes or no so if you promise you're going to share this video on facebook big promise do right now do right now wait no i smash that like button of course so guys so that is amazing amazing what is this a nas should teach the intro intricacies of using sound effects while coding since he is so awesome at it thank you so much adriana adrian that's amazing wow so yeah that's really really really cool stuff okay so let's do this now guys so we've done some amazing stuff at this point okay now what i want to do is the next thing i want to focus on is the delete portion here right which is delete delete section okay same thing here guys let's go and delete and actually create a delete section so to make sure it deletes let's create a function called delete delete item right so or let's do const delete item delete item in here okay that's going to be a function inside here boom boom boom and delete and again what are we going to do we're going to what going to pass in what what uh we need to press in the item right wait why no well no no what do you think we need to pass in the lead item well pretty much no it's very simple guys on delete item we just need to call the function under the item look at this guys let me see let me do this so here delete stop it hold on let me see i'll stop watching you david so here let's do boom so delete item right there this is what we got right here i'm gonna make this a little bit cleaner so we all we all have this okay oh on the click of this button very simple guys unclick unclick what you just want to fire this up okay okay delete boom that's it yeah we're going to pass on the e because there's always an e value that gets passed in okay oh yeah actually you want to make sure that if you do this you want to do uh even prevent uh default because by default react sometimes wants to refresh the whole page and you can prevent it this way okay that's fine that's fine it's fine it's fine okay that's fine okay good so now let's do this so what he's going to do now david is he's going to go to the collection database right here just how we've done it here in the card items but instead of doing an update he's actually going to do a delete so here's what he's going to do he's going to do doc just how we did it here but do dot delete and honestly guys that is pretty much it that's all you guys need to do and that is it that's it yeah and so look now if i click on the delete right here it will delete the full item from the card items and of course as we know that triggers what that triggers a change in database the database triggers a change in the app and of course then what the whole app refreshes understood yes so let's think about this guys ready for this guys ready for this let's go wait for this let's go so here's what's going what's going to happen now at this point very very very very very very simple let's go and do this let's go refresh on here make sure it's all good all i gotta do now is release at this point if so again connie changes that works boom okay this works as well i click delete ready for this bro boom look at that not only is it removed from here it's changed here and changed here again the power of firebase and the power of you state sorry okay you see holy how crazy is that guacamole guys at this point there's one thing left to create i'm sure you know what it is i'm sure you know what it is guys you know what it is because i know and it is called a login we are now going to create the login functionality oh okay anyways you gotta have some fun with that there we go so now let's do this guys let's do this let's let's dim this down a little lower so the longest will be very interesting guys just so you know the login is going to be really really interesting you're ready for this bro i'm so ready i was ready before you okay so the login page now that's going to be the interesting portion okay um well let's now think about this the login page number one needs a logo functionality as well but it also needs a login button okay so number one we should be able to see the hello nozzar that's partial that's part one and then of course we should be able to log out no problem okay understood yes or no yes yes good so we're almost at 300 likes away let's go let's get to 300 likes let's go david says keeping it in no open connection to the base is that risky no it's not that's actually something that every single website does um this is not connection it's a secure connection right so uh every single for example you're you know i mean think about this your messenger makes the connect has the connection like the your messenger app guys has the connection literally right 301 likes that's what i'm talking about beautiful and i think it actually um closes the connection when the application is like yeah yeah the application is off i close the connection but anyways so now what i wanted you guys to do let's go ahead and do this the first things first that we're going to do we've got everything working now what i want to do is i want to create the login page all right ready for this bro i'm ready let's quit the looking page that's gonna be sick so we'll do source new file we'll do login.js okay simple as that on the gs okay now we'll do rfce r r f c e right there boom login page so now we have the login page and we'll have the login page okay now good good good good good good good good good login page is gonna be pretty simple guys so the login page now for the login page to fully work it should be a few different things that we need to make sure that it actually like fully fully fully works okay here's gonna happen so he's going to create he's going to import style components as he did here then he's going to go ahead and do the following right he's going to the container into login here and then he's going to continue constantly style that div inside here understood yes or no pretty simple all right good yes all right so we got that portion then what's going to happen is well if you think before we do that before we do that before we do that though okay let's do this login hold on oh come on i know i know i know you want to rush i know i know i know i know i know i know i know so don't let height i know i know i know so let's go to app.js guys and what i want to do with you right now is very simple is i want us all together to for the router is actually create another route called the login route for now let's just do this for now route route and we'll say what path is equal to what logging to login good oh okay i know you try i know i know bro and then we're going to create the login functionality inside here well well right there that's going gonna be the login component now the log component needs to be imported so we're gonna do import login from login okay login liquid is like you don't let me type that's like that's like david yeah it doesn't let me type [Laughter] that's funny so look let's now go to login login boom now there is a login right there beautiful right there see but of course there's an issue here is that we still have this amazon thing that should not be there don't worry about that just yet that's not too big of an issue that we need to worry about okay guys just so you know all right comprende comprending good so now login page let's actually design it now now the login page hit the login page now it's gonna it technically in the end it will not have this header in the end it will not don't worry we'll fix that in a second here but for this let's do the following login page will have a few things let's go go to our login page in here boom right there okay it will have a few things the first thing you will have is what um the first things we'll have is the content image no content oh okay you wonder okay yeah that wasn't me i know i don't know so content the reason why is look at this what we're going to create is very simple right we're going to make it look like a little bit like this you have the login page it will be like this it'll be the full screen then you have a smaller screen and that will have a button that will say login and this will have like the logo the amazon logo in here that's gonna be our goal for this okay oh yeah okay that's gonna be our goal so the content is gonna be this little kind of small portion so if you think about this the content is going to be this little small part that's going to be the content okay that's the content just so you know you guys know okay understood good so all right beautiful let's go and refresh this content is not defined let's do content style.there let's save that amazon logo is not defined no problem whatsoever that's completely fine amazon logos will be the image correct yes or no yeah style the image beautiful nice nice nice nice and then there's going to be a login button and then in the login button there's also going to be the right there h1 actually sign into sign into sign in amazon sign into amazon right i mean why do we need a h1 because why not okay let's do it then yeah and then the login button let me go ahead and do it a little bit better better for you here the loginbot will have the following that will have the sign in with google so this will be here so we're actually going to guys sign in with google sign in with google google how sick is this guys sign in with google okay i know it looks hideous for now don't worry so much about this just yet okay we will go ahead and fix this in a second so now for the container this container the following things will happen here here we're gonna have the width of a hundred percent of a hundred percent boom good now after that what's going to happen is we'll have a height so we'll give this container a height check this out a height of 100 v h this means a hundred vertical height that's the full height of the web page guys just so you guys know okay okay then we're going to give the background color looks a little bit more like this boom right there that's a it's a little more grayish color right there so you can see right there that's the color right there looking for right there right you see then what's going to happen is the following will say then we'll actually in this case well oh no should we use grid for this one no we'll use display flex display flex nah i mean let's do grid this one time and then just let's use place items center okay okay okay display grid just fine right and then we'll what we are going to do is very simple is what place items items center holy moly that was quick quick and to the point look at this guys boom sign into amazon it's as simple as that understood there's still yes or no awesome next up next up what are we going to do tell me so next up i just copied a amazon logo um to my clipboard and what i'm going to be doing is i'm just going to be passing it in uh to the top uh if you okay let's think about this so here's what we'll do you have the amazon logo here so he's going to do the amazon logo he's going to pass it as an image right here that's awesome so save that oh that's huge don't worry don't worry we got you we got you we got you okay because here's what you do because the amazon logo and all we got to do is we got to give it a height so we say what we'll give it a height of 100 pixels oh yeah that's it okay all right all right now let's go to the content section okay let's go to the content section guys in the content section somebody said no flex display grid is like flex okay so this is great it's actually display flex vertical and horizontal combined exactly so we are still using display flex exactly so don't worry about this so far okay so now for the content here's what we'll do we'll give it a padding let me go ahead and show this to you guys so you guys have a little better padding of 100 pixels okay don't worry about that and then we'll give it a background color of white actually you'll see why in a second a white boom so you see there's a small little thing going on here okay like a color of white awesome so a bag okay good that's so that's good that makes it look really good and i'm going to give it a border radius of 5 pixels and then i'm going to give the box shadow a small back shadow box shadow okay that's going to be let's say well let's say 2 pixels now let's do zero one pixel three pixel that's going to be more of the background so black or maybe gray yeah i like that okay amazon send it to google i like that that's that's pretty good okay so that's good okay i like that guys that's amazing so now we got the amazon logo there that is awesome okay some said box show this this is good that is all good so now the question that becomes is going to be the following in the actual content i'm just going to give a text align center line center to align everything centered okay boom right there so amazon logo is centered assigned to amazon is also centered as well now the big thing that becomes is this sign in with google button that's the one thing we need to know really kind of focus on as well now for this image for this image well i want you guys to focus on let's go ahead and make it a margin margin bottom 40 pixels just to add some space into the bottom boom okay and let's get that room to breathe for the button as well and then yes of course and the login button of course will give it a margin top margin top of what 50 pixels um yeah that sounds good good good look at that so that's that's going to look a little bit better so that's amazing sign it to amazon sign in with google awesome now let's not change the actual button itself so we'll do background color this one right here actually um what would be the color should be orange no i it should be the usual amazon color so this one and we can give it a border radius with a border wait what does it say oh why does it not do what something was supposed to do let me refresh this login button right let's see wait what did you do oh okay just put a lot of css on this okay background color module top what is this right here what is this weird style that button margin why what's up margin top is not working oh wait there we go that's strange background color what was the color you told me uh it was f o c one four place it in here basin here paste in here oh okay one sec boom boom boom oh somebody say you committed oh i forgot to do a semicolon that's why that was the issue what ah okay okay okay okay okay that makes sense okay good good good so let's get back okay let's give it a height of 40 pixels okay nice i like it let's also maybe what is it let's do the remove the border two pixels solid with that okay good hashtag three eight eight seven three four good nice okay let's do a border radius on this as well of course we're gonna have a border radius god oh look at that we'll do padding four pixel eight pixels okay okay let's mix it a little bit better better better go and cursor pointer as well beautiful and let me go ahead and remove myself here so you guys can see it as well you see right there so this is what we have so far look at this guys signing with google right there that looks awesome i'm pretty proud of what we've done so far so amazon logo sign into amazon now how do we actually use or how do we actually create the amazon sign up what do we actually do right so that's going to be ah what the heck so how do we go ahead and actually do this now so guys we have assigned into amazon that's so good what we can do is check this out guys okay check this out we can use firebase to sign in this is the the magic of firebase just so you guys know so let's think about this let's go to amazon not amazon let's go to firebase right there that's a good authentication okay everybody right now everybody goes nice get started good good we can do google we can do facebook pretty much anything you want we're going to go ahead and go and do google disabled we'll click enable all right that's so good let's go ahead that's the email we want to use that's fine click save turned on the backend for the authentication so what's up it's just funny to say that we just turned on the back end for the authentication exactly with a click of a button exactly with a click of a button right that's pretty much it so look with a click of a button now we have authentication through google guys that is it now of course we're not done there yet we have not finished it fully right we have to do the following now check this out okay to be able to use this we need to go ahead and fire us that gsm to be able to import this and actually use it properly so what we're going to do is we're going to do const auth so we know how we used uh db now we'll do we're going to use auth authentication so to const auth we'll say firebase dot what dot off boom right there firebase.auth and then we're going to now import the provider of the firebase auth which is going to be google which is looks a little bit like this book see right there provider is equal to new firebase off the google auth provider and all we gotta do now guys is we we export db and we also export provider that's it that's honestly pretty pretty much it we export the db and we export the provider as well that's guys that's literally it guys how sick is this huh that's pretty sick bro natalia's like fireball is so easy to use i love that i know trust me i love it too exactly okay cool so we got that so firebase off that looks amazing that looks amazing what we are going to do now is let's go ahead and go back to what go back to home.gs uh actually add that gs and the sign is going to happen on the login function login portion here so to sign in we're going to create a function called sign in this is going to be a function called sign in with google so go sign in so we'll say const sign in correct is equal to what boom right there awesome and we need to now go ahead and actually get the auth and the provider from firebase so as we'll do let's go and do this so we'll do this import import auth correct comma provider from where from firebase now yes exactly so from fire base beautiful on firebase now one thing if we go to firebase can i actually check this out if i go to firebase we are not exporting we need to be exporting auth comma db comma provider so we should be explaining all of these three things understood good good good good so save this so okay let's go ahead and go back to our app.js i see actually the login.js that's awesome okay so let's go ahead and do this now to do google off for example firebase firebase firebase google auth i'm going to show it to you guys boom this is so sick this is so cool web hold on look at this this is create email password this is google sign in you see this we created a provider right right and so forth now to sign in look at this guys auth sign well we're going to sign it with what sign in with popup sign in with popup look at this you see and then we need to pass it what provider we're going to use the provider is actually the google provider right there you see that right there and look at this when we get the result we get what we get the access token and we get the user right see the user right here guys the credentials and the user so how sick is that that's exactly what we need right so let's think about this right let's go back to our amazon clone okay okay oops all right boom boom awesome sign up let's go and save this to make sure it's all good mmhmm does it say const what are you saying tab items as it before before it initialization i cannot access db i think it's probably because of firebase let me see oh i think wait no what oh because i do okay i know why actually export default tp oh but then we need to uh imported it that way that's fine that's fine let's go and go to our card.js i mean everywhere we imported it no but sure wait wait if we do export db off and all these tips shouldn't we tend to get that no yeah it should work let's see no no it's so good okay right there so db off and provider so that's all good right there so that is oh my water so that seems to be all good i think it's just probably a refresh that had to happen that was it that's pretty much it okay so that is all good that makes me happy and then look let's go to app.js now actually let's go to login.js which is pretty sick and then we'll do sign in with popup we'll pass in the provider which we imported from firebase right there awesome right there and then look at this we're now in the result we'll get what the result.user see result that you chose to var user or let's user is equal to result.user boom let's console.log it log what user right there okay console.log user and now on the catch for example let's say something happened and we did not sign in on the catch of it let's just say we have an error here you basically it's just here just an alert or maybe alert for example you know uh the error that message so error dot message boom so you can see right there look at this guys i'm i'm fully looking into here look at this here the message right here the credentials it's telling me pretty much everything i need to know okay so this is um about being a resourceful developer this is about to be a developer who knows how to read documentation okay it is very important part of being a developer just so you guys know okay okay awesome so we got that portion that is amazing uh let me see so we got the that's awesome now to go ahead be able to call this function what do we do guys we do on click on this here so we'll do on click unclick is equal to what so on click um yeah we just want to fire that uh even like that function off right exactly that's it that's pretty much it so unclick sign in so do that all right let's go to our react app let's refresh our react out to make sure oh would you look at this let's go ahead and we'll sign in for example with rafa kazi guys now nothing happened but check this out nothing happened correct but check this out guys right let's go ahead and go what let's hide us huh just so we see it yeah can you hide us so let's go to console here yeah oh where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it this right here guys is the user right there look display name rafikaze email rafikazejima.com and there's got to be even an image here is there isn't there an image or something or something like that url what is it yeah it says it says image url there is a uh there should be a property that says image url and photo right there photo url right there oh photo url right there look at this guys there's a photo there's pretty much everything guys holy boom chickalacke is everybody saying cheeky that's pretty insane would you guys say so i would say so so look so we got that portion that's awesome so we've signed in here that is amazing that is amazing so now let's think about this now okay let's think about this now how do we go ahead when do was the right time to log in when is the right time to actually show the user and everything that is a good question we're getting the user that is amazing but we actually need to be able to now set the user properly right that's going to be the quick question so this is where we used it comes back in again so now we need to actually go to app.js again and we need to actually create a state for the user here's we'll do let's do this so we'll say const oop go to show myself and me and you saw user set user is equal to use state state and so far it's just kind of nothing so far right so you state you know user just kind of so far as just you know there's nothing here let's just make that like that okay so it's an empty object okay okay simon says stephen says i love this yes thank you guys 358 likes guys guys share this more let's get to 400 likes because the more you help us the better this will be trust me trust me okay so good we got the user now the question becomes what do you do with that user well it's very simple guys right in the login functionality we need to set the user to what we just got from here it's as simple as that set the user to we just got from here so let's do this let's go to app.js how do we do that well in the app.js the user is here well let's pass it into the login so here we'll do your uh set user is equal to set user that's the ability for us to set a user right inside the app.js fully right set the user say user beautiful okay all right set user site user and what's going to somebody asking what is the program the program is amazon cloud guys just so you know so look set user say user and what's going to happen now in the login functionality will do what set user to what i mean say usually yeah like result that user right but not just that i don't wanna do that because i wanna be very particular about what user i want i don't wanna have all the data i don't need that but instead what i'm going to do you must say let the new user i mean what we can do is say uh user dot uh display name and user.email okay so here we'll do we'll do name right and we'll say what is it user dot dot display name display name comma boom okay and then what photo email i mean email to emote what is it user.what user.email okay then and then uh photo or yeah photo user dot i think it's photo url photo url yeah photo you are like this url full capitals yes yes correct yourself undefined that's fine so look at this now right so now guys we passed in the same set user okay we pass on the side user we need to be able to catch in the props here so we'll do set user right we cache this function inside here and now all we do is we do set user guys guys look at this set user to what the new user boom that said done right so send user to new user now here's the cool part okay here's the cool part let's think about this now app.js okay set new user okay if we let's go ahead and now console log the user just so we have it so console.log log this is so much fun guys how who here is having fun as much as we are user comma because i'm having a ton of fun parting with this stuff right so user user user good all right let's think about this now so let's go ahead and do this let's go ahead and inspect that one on here let me remove us so we don't have thus console good good good good good let's go and refresh this see user object is nothing so far no problem whatsoever but if i click on here if i go ahead and click on rafikaze think about it think about it boom right there that's our user right there see email is this name is this photo is this that is what i'm talking about beautiful all right so we got that portion guys that is epic okay somebody says having so much fun yes of course guys we're always about having fun so look now we've got that user guys check this out well look at this let's now use that think about this right we have this hello account nazari okay can we use this to be able to set the user hello nazari can we do that let's do that so look this is inside the header so last passed into the user into the header so say user is equal to what user boom done okay if we go to the header.js yes we're going to use the inside here okay boom voila and then now what let's actually use the proper name are you ready for this girl instead of pedal nazari you want to make sure that you just switch it with user dot name or yes user dot name user dot name oh look at that i know it looks a bit odd here because not totally user friendly look hello rafikaze guys how sick is this how sick is this this is amazing now we're not done yet okay we're not done yet because think about this we're not done yet right because of course we want to be able to one thing we need to want to be able to do is we need to remove this header portion very simply okay we want to be able to this does not need this portion right here you see that we get there so to do that it's going to be very very simple i mean it's not that simple but it's you need to understand it so here's going to happen here's the flow of this application right think about this if the user exists if the user is there that means that means what that means we are logged in if the user is not there it means we are not logged in correct so what we're going to do inside here in the router we're going to check for the user basically i'm going to say if there is no user so basically if the user state is not there we'll do the following we'll we'll show the login page the login page which is this one however if if guys however if we don't need this right here bro why oh i mean i mean that that's the whole point like that's fine too right boom right exactly let's go ahead now look think about this if the login is look but hold on give me one second let me get some water hold on this is so cool i want you to listen up really really closely okay all right now think about this guys if the user is there right there if there if there is no user if there's no user we just show the login page however if there is a user we show everything else right there you see so basically this prevents them from going to any other pages if they're not logged in it's as simple as that and now we don't even need this where is it where's the login route i already removed this man don't remove it i want to show them don't show it to them okay then it's not magic hold on what was it what happened here wait uh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i got it i got it i got i got it i got it it's fine it's fine it's fine i got it it's right there good so we used to have this login right here you see there's root path login we don't need that we just need this right here set user is equal to what user user exactly oh that's it guys and actually um notice that i did this squiggly brace over here and over here and it basically just shows that we are writing javascript in the html portion exactly and then i'm using html again and here as well exactly exactly so that's that's the power of jsx exactly right exactly but guys just so you know this right here is a shorthand for fl so this for example if yeah if for example here let me show it to you um so i mean we could we could have done this don't change don't you don't change it i got i got it don't you just typing it above okay i'll i type it i'll type it using a screen brush oh okay yeah so here if there is no user no user then look show login else show everything else that's the other part understood guys yes or no understood good show everything else this is a shorthand for ifl statement right there if this is true if this portion is true show this otherwise so now look at this guys if we say this uh let's put the token let's see if i don't know i would i was just uh gonna show them like exactly how uh the if works but no it's all good now look guys now of course look there's no login of course right here because why because the user exists yes or no yes or no right because exist remember how we logged in right this says this should say that i mean it should say hold on technically you should say what wait what oh don't worry i got it i got it so look i think let's go ahead and do this let's do user null oh yeah there we go so look at this right now user is nothing right they're null that means this will not fire so it's going to take you to the login page right there it's very simple okay right clean and clear then what's going to happen now there is no more header exactly exactly now if i go ahead and go i go ahead and go to sign in with google boom boom look at this we are in right there oh let's go how sick is that guys how cool is that now what i want us to do i want us to be able to create a the log out functionality as well right so let's go ahead and do this do it let's go and sign now function now now the signup functionality how how would that work out tell me guys what do you thinks think so what i would do is actually go to uh the header and then um are you following me yeah no i'm not have following you hold on i'll go to the head.gs yeah header.js and where is it this is it so what i would do is on click of this option line one oops right here oh yeah right here where is it on the click of this right here actually i would do it uh on the on this header option so one click unclick one click i would fire off a sign out function i would function now but the question is where do we get the signup function it's very simple guys you see first we need to create a signup function here so here's we'll do let's go to app.js let's create assign a function in here inside here we don't need we don't have to create it there we can create it i actually want to create it here because i want to pass into the whole header you'll see why later you'll see why it makes things easier so we'll do const sign out sign out right is equal to what is equal to sign out is equal to a function we're not passing oh yeah yes exactly and one way to do this is for first we actually need to sign out of the auth so the first thing to do is actually we need to in the firebase we'll do auth right here firebase and we'll do auth.sign out to remote to actually sign us out from the authentication of the actual in firebase in the database that's very important portion as well of course so that will fire that out and then guys no hold on hold on hold on bro hold on hold on hold on when that is all good when that is all good we'll do that then oh like that yes hold on oh yeah boom right that right there sign up right there see and so on success of the sign out what would you do say user to no not it yes sir so right there so the sign up function is this function right here okay now it's going to pass this into the header so go into the header right here i'm going to make this a little bit easier for us to read we'll do sign out is equal to what guys sign out sign up so now in the head of the gs let's go to hit the gs guys let's go ahead and and be able to actually catch that so do sign out okay and that's what that is going to do what that's going to make sure that we fire up the function what's up look at this and now we're going to click uh sign up on this one and that's pretty much it now you can see that it took us back to assignment with google no problem whatsoever since we'll do sign up google again let's go after qazi boomer in now if i click on this boom we're signed out understood how cool is that guys look at that we've signed out let's go sign in again boom boom right there look at this guys let me go on the on click of this one let's go back to uh i heard that yes here for a second okay let's go ahead gs let's go ahead and do where it's like for example this header option let's do this should be uh cursor pointer pointer all right that makes sense boom right there awesome so that way if i click on here oh again how satisfying is this guys how satisfying is this i would say it's pretty satisfying would you say so yeah exactly it is and it's actually more secure though oh something happened there's an error there's something here please try again later that's all we know another google let's try again let's do nazari now oh there we go hello nazare domanski hi good to see you [Laughter] you know what i mean so there you go that's pretty awesome so look we got that portion we're gonna get we can sign out again right send it with google again we'll do one more time just double check to make sure it's all good good it's so good now here's the issue guys if i refresh it takes me back to here oh here's the issue see here's why because the state the state every time i refresh the page the state gets cleared out that's it so the state gets cleared out time refers the page fully right so this is where we need to be careful we need to use something called local storage guys okay local storage is your browser storage imagine this guys your browser has a storage kind of how think about it as almost its own state as well right but this storage is there for a really long time so check this out here's what we can do we can use something called local storage let's go to our app.gs and actually go to log in the gs and here's what we'll do guys when we log in we'll do it like this this is going to be really cool guys pay attention to this right now really quickly guys okay when we do say user not only we're going to say user here we're also going to set it inside the local storage so look at this local storage dot set item this comes directly from uh from the browser it comes it's a functionality we can use directly from the browser right side item boom set item right and what are we going to say user right there we're going to set the user and to actually set the user of this one we'll use this right here oh right there you're gonna pass into yeah so now what this does is very simple it takes this new user object and it's going to create it into a string into a json string it's as simple as that okay because the local storage only accepts strings just so you guys know okay it doesn't accept objects this new user is an object and here we're going to convert to a string right so look at this now right and then what's going to happen after we see that in local storage now we can get it back if i go to myapp.js inside here you see how we initialize the state to null what if what if instead of doing that we initialized it by what we get from the from the get item so here's what we can do we can do this let me show it to you guys here look okay here it's a good item right boom oh boom boom local storage decay item so we'll get the item back from local storage of the data of our browser and we'll parse that string into an actual object okay so that will that we can use the object and now this will allow us to fully fully fully use that so let's think about this guys let's go and do this okay ready for this bro ready i am ready let's go so sign in with google boom let's use nazari domanski okay good biannual damansky all is great awesome okay now look if i refresh oh we're still in the zarya dumansky look at that now here's local storage guys here's the local storage check this out i want you to pay attention to here really quickly console this console console where is it uh no you need to go into storage don't you application no oh application oh it's in safari that's boom look at this user is this person this is my name my email and here's my photo url guys it is as simple as that how sick is that you tell me how sick is this huh wow that was new for me too that was pretty awesome i would say so huh guys that's super cool that's pretty cool right so and now look at this now now of course the thing is here look at this if we sign out it's not going to work actually it will work nope won't work yeah it'll take me to here but it won't work here why because on the side now we need to clear out the local storage don't we exactly because we're not cleaning local stores so what do we do inside here on the site user here now not only was a user to know but also also we set the local storage so let's say local storage storage the what item remove item oh wow and uh i'm just curious like it just came to my mind like uh how long does it actually store my user so if i log in until you click until you clear the storage in your browser until you clear cookies and you're stored in your browser until that wow yeah so it's gonna be there for a long time wow exactly so look let's try this again boom see so now look no matter what page i go to guys look at this guys i cannot access this page it will take me straight to login i'll just sign in with google cheeky peaky god oh oh oh oh look at this everything is working on our end we have got ourselves pretty much everything we wanted add to car look at this boom boom boom boom delete this if i wanted to everything it is working guys it's just as sure you've created the amazon clone boom boom boom boom boom boom for yourself guys how epic is this who's excited with me i know you are because i am as

well guys by the way also let's get it let's get this to 400 likes guys come on we're 387. we're touching the light that's something guys i don't know what you're doing all right so the last thing we can do is now let's upload to firebase are you ready bro yeah let's do it so what you were thinking i know i know so let's opposed to five now firebase hosting how do we do firebase hosting you tell me the uh you go to hosting correct that's correct all right and what do we do we do get started you want to get started that's correct okay click next let's next accept install so we do firebase login firebase init you can see right there click next click we'll do it continue to console all right now you want to go back to um the application the we as code yeah and just hit a command j let me see let me no i know i know i know i know okay oh right there okay so let's go and do this so command j oh that's how you bring your brain up oh i did not know that the whole time oh yeah okay cool so all right now uh just just to be um frank with everybody from github yes guys there will be a link after this i will push this to github and you will have the link to this and github guys don't worry about it okay it's already in the description okay it's in actually it's already in the description guys beautiful yeah all right so just to be at the same level with everybody let's do a firebase logout um firebase logout yeah firebase logout exactly and now it's going to yeah now it's locked out don't worry about that that's just an update good and everybody who is uh who hasn't done this before you want to run npm i g so you want to uh install it on a global level or if you're on a mac you want to do sudo npmi g firebase tools yes good yes yes that way you will have the cli installed now uh if you're there you want to go ahead and type in firebase login and that way we will be logging in nas do you know which account is this uh firebase connect yes i do actually okay and now you want to hear let me double check to make sure this is what this is return yes this is rafikaze not kazakh probably rafikaze okay that's the one that's on okay i do not know that portion so now you want to go back to vs code and just hit return uh on that story and okay so that's actually it is actually a rougher guys okay good so let me make sure it's all good awesome good sorry guys let's do yes on this one and it's this will pop up a new page in the browser um in one second and then you just log in as normally yeah log in with the same email that you look that you created the project with okay because now you're logged in successfully again you guys can see that okay okay you awesome see that you're good now um now at this point you want to type in firebase in it now don't you do run a build uh no no no no that's that's later on that's coming down and you want to select hosting so hit space space go and hit enter and return yes good please select a project use an existing project correct exactly yes okay cologne march there we go amazon clone march 21st that's the one we're going to use you see that right there just click enter from that what do you want to use now this alert like yeah you want to change that to build don't move forward until you've changed that to build very important guys this needs to be this right here guys needs to be okay that needs to be built okay keep that in mind build build build build okay if you miss that you will have to redo the whole thing again yes delete all the config files too much hassle make sure that it's set to build okay so build hit enter yep okay figure it out you have to configure it as a single jab once again type in why stay uh uh yup no need for this one that deploys for github no need to do that nope and you don't need that that's it so it's initialized now this is where the build process starts so you want to type in npm uh run build that would just basically go ahead strip out all the developer stuff from the application like the hot reloading and all that stuff um and it's just going to create an optimized production build and once that's let's see let's see let's see see there's the build folder you see so what it's doing guys what's going on here is very simple guys it's taking all this react that you have right here it's putting into javascript and it's putting into the build folder right here so it becomes like a normal just page app okay exactly so that's little with that you see right there it created this all these files so if you go to build folder look at this we have the inside html you see this is all minimized and it's all minimized and then what we have here is we have static and these are all javascript files right there all these look at this too look at this guys all of these are javascript files right there you see it's all one huge line but it's all there guys it is literally all there you see it's called minimize javascript but it converted your react
