speaking about what are the top laptops that you should be using if you are a software developer so let's jump right into it guys there's gonna be so many different options that you would be you know lucky to use but at the same time i feel like it does depend a lot on what type of outcome you want what kind of objective you want and that's going to be interesting so right now what we're going to do is jump right ahead the best laptops for programming and really guys we are dropping fire content on the daily it's insane we're making crazy builds next week coming up on actually this week on wednesday thursday and friday we're going to be building whatsapp and also amazon and youtube i believe it's not amazon one of those i have to double check it with everything but at the end of the day it's crazy crazy top tech companies that we're helping helping you dissect so that you can build them from the ground up with the mirn stack and sunny and david are going to be teaching you that so make sure to like the button if you guys are really enjoying this type of content also if you guys are enjoying it and you kind of want to keep up with us because we're going daily not stopping for anybody is smash that subscribe button and that like button as well so let's carry over guys you know to go into more details about what type of programming computer you should use let's read a little bit about here yep we already built amazon my wrist nice man people people are are noticing what type of builds we're leaving we're you know putting live for you guys that's amazing and yep so you know the end goal is pretty much what's going to dictate what type of laptop you're going to be using for your career as a software developer let's say let me open up my pointer right here so this is you you are a developer and let's say you want to build i don't know maybe android apps or ios apps so if you're using android apps the cool thing about it is that you can either use windows i used to program for android on windows that was pretty cool but at the same time it was the getting setting up the coding environment on windows was a freaking pain in the butt it was insane but if you do want to do maybe ios development you are going to need a mac so depending what you want to do you're going to need a different computer android you can use both because you can develop android on mac so that's pretty cool so but if you want to do ios development in swift you need a macbook computer because that's the only way that you can actually download swift not swift sorry xcode which is what you use to write in on write swift that's the not the text editor but but the ide if you want to build games you might maybe want to use well you can use different ones i've seen people run run actually what is it called the csharp engine unity engine and you can use it either on windows or mac i believe but ultimately this as well you know if you're a gamer you're probably going to want to use windows because we also use those same laptops for other specific things right so it's not just coding and it does affect the experience of coding if you can't let's say play a youtube video or something as simple as that so you know you want to build whether that's windows apps or mac apps then at the same time it's going to you know dictate whether you use windows mac or even ubuntu in that case i know a lot of companies use ubuntu um what are they called the virtual machines instead of their windows just to actually you know make it easier for them to develop in using a windows computer but using the ubuntu operating system so all right guys this is how i'm feeling right now we're going to go into the best laptops that you guys can actually use and remember guys the end goal that you have in mind is going to dictate the type of laptop that you're going to use right you're going to do swift you need mac if you're going to do android you can use windows if you're gonna do anything else i mean you can just use either windows mac or ubuntu but it does depend so going back into this guys one of the most important things in my opinion is just because of the fact that you're gonna be staring at code for a long time and it's it's you know some coders code for about eight hours to 10 to 12 to even more 14 to 16 hours of a day depending on what project has to be you know whether that's it has to be finished it has to be just worked on or you have to cowork or quote or what is it called you know dual coding with somebody else at the same time excuse me so most laptops already come with a 16 by 19 screen ratio that's the regular ratios that mac computers use actually so that's something to take into account i normally never see just squared four four three screen ratios but i see this one allow on a lot now popping up because a lot of times i guess we have a laptop but what we do is that we we actually connect an external monitor just like this one and the 21.9 ones are gonna be a little bit more kind of like the lg you know widescreen ones that are maybe the 27 inch the 32 inch and then then even the 34 inch so in my opinion 16 by nine screen ratio is the most important one that you should get and all macs are done with that screen ratio so and yeah jimmy mendez said pier programming yes pair programming is what i was thinking about so thank you so much for that my man people are on top of it i love it how many monitors are recommended i'd say two men at the same time you can have three years or so but i just feel like those are too much maybe maybe three of you have a big setup but if you just want something minimal that actually you know raises your efficiency i say use two monitors instead of just one monitor so the screen size you know talking about monitors right now is going to be very very important i didn't even list anything under 13 inches just because i think it's so hard to look at those screens it's insane like the 11 inch macbook air or the macbooks man they're so annoying to me i i can't even believe they're real computers they look like toys to me but the 13 inch what i like about it is that it's a very very portable you can take it pretty much anywhere it's insane you know like you you actually do feel like it's a laptop that you can take while traveling but other than that you know if you're thinking about the 15inch i don't think it's much of a huge difference i know that you know you are able to feel the differences between the 13 and 15 because 13 is just so small in my opinion but it's it's also kind of decent but i think like man if you are coding a lot you're not going to want to look at that small small screen so 15 inch to me might be the classical one the most the one that would fit most cases for you either whether that's traveling whether that's you know just in general just just coding somewhere also the the 15 inch is beautiful so that even if you want to make graphics or watch videos or do design like ui ux design it's better than looking at 13 inches and in my opinion the 16 16inch macbook pro is really really good and i just want to say that this video is probably going to be a little bit biased just because i've used all three types of operating systems and i've had experiences using windows i grew up using windows then i switched to mac and i grew up also using ubuntu because i would have a dual boot with ubuntu and windows and it's cool and everything so i will dive a little bit deeper into that as the video goes along so you know one of the one one of the things that i did want to say is 15 inch is the preferred one for most people and 16 inch is kind of perfect in my opinion because the bigger the better screen wise at least so off the bat we're going to talk about ram i'm seeing a lot of these laptop videos where people talk about ram not being so important because of code ram is the most important thing if you want to open up more than one you know softwares or programs at the same time man what are you saying bro like i i even get mad to be honest with you because it doesn't mean that just because code is so lightweight because it's text doesn't mean that you don't need that much ram there's also you know fun being thrown around about a few ides that just eat up all your ram but dude google chrome eats up all your ram so if you're programming for a living that pretty much means that you're on your computer most of the day and you know going back to ram if you cannot use your computer to entertain yourself whether that's maybe netflix if you want to watch netflix every so often or even youtube or maybe you're like oh no i'm too i'm way too productive for that for that i don't want to even do youtube then whatever you're using man pinterest whatever you're using dribble for inspiration for your design envato and button anything like that it's going to be you know affected by the size of your ram so right here i did a little bit of an explanation of the ddr ramps so right now ddr and ddr2 are not even really used all we're using right now on the more modern computers is going to be ddr3 and ddr4 but now even ddr5 is out and i believe ddr6 is out and the the faster the newer the ram is the faster it's going to be really so make sure that if you do buy a computer right now make sure that it is at least ddr4 and up because it's gonna affect everything let's say you had let's say you're just you know coding in your visual studio code right and then you got maybe dribbled open up as inspiration because you're trying to you know copy a design or something like that maybe you're using the inspect tool in a google chrome you know web page so you're you have like five google chrome tabs open that is already eating up your ram a lot so if you have less than eight gigabytes of ram that that is just gonna kill you i wouldn't recommend anybody that is doing programming to have less than eight gigabytes of ram i'd say eight gigabytes of ram is going to be the very very least that you can have just because i mean i see it and and and i see the differences and it's insane so right here i put a little bit of the difference i'd say 16 gigabytes is really ideal in my own opinion so you know going back to ram right here you can see the differences in speed between 8 gigabytes ram and 16 gigabytes rams so off the bat you can see that you know the bigger the bar is the more time it takes to load so here is an example of the gray one is going to be 8 gigabytes ram and then the green one is going to be 16 gigabytes ram so lowest hd with um so they're they're actually testing hard drives with with ssds right so this is the ram with the lowest hard drive option and ssd is better with that sorry uh 16 gigabytes is better with that hdd hard drive so you can see the same here even if you have this lowest ssd if you have if you have 16 gigabytes of ram this is how fast it's going to load if you have an ultra high you know hdd which is a hard drive then you can see here that the eight gigabytes is actually going to be faster in the 16 gigabytes wow this is interesting so ultra hd these are actually popping up a lot and they're going to be pretty pretty new so gaming hard drive settings ultra hdd at 16 crashed changed high texture to low texture so using ultra hdds and ssds apparently the the actual difference is not that huge but if you're using lowest or mid tier ssds and hdds then it's it's just apparent i mean i honestly believe that even here just because of the fact that 16 gigabytes of ram you can have more random access memory to open up more programs just by nature it's going to be faster so i'm not completely sure about these specific experiments right here but all in all you can see that 16 gigabytes is going to be way faster than 18 gigabytes this is an example right here too of the difference between ddr4 and ddr5 so even though they're not so many years apart it's going to be kind of crazy to know that ddr5 is almost what is this 15 almost 10 10 gigabytes faster than the ddr4 if you're using the 1.3 1.36 x type of of hard drive right so this is the speed this should be megabits if i'm not mistaken or gigahertz sorry and 1.87 the ddr5 is about still this is 15 this is almost 30. so this is almost double as fast ddr4 versus ddr5 so like i said you know the faster models of of ram are going to be the ones that you're going to want to go with just because if you're still using ddr3 right now versus the laptops that are using ddr5 the thing is that software gets updated really fast and the newer that it is the heavier that it's going to be on your actual machine so make sure to get something that's kind of time proof okay so i know that maybe the ddr3 rams are going to be maybe you can get a 16 gigabyte ddr3 i would still advise you to get maybe a 80 gigabyte ram with a ddr5 and that would be better for you actually in that opinion in my opinion so you know that's a little bit about rams let me see what you guys are doing here so how much ram is needed to do all stuff fluently abinav singh asked and in my opinion man let me actually pop this comment here so i think it's uh let's get it from this screen and put it i actually cannot pull it but let me see it says abinav singh so i think to do stuff fluently on the computer at least you need 16 gigabytes of ram if not man it's just gonna take you so much more time your computer is going to get fro
