for this live stream because we know we are so richie tom what's the agenda and what we're going to go over today yeah so today's live stream is highly focused on top eight common interview questions and we are going to be showing you the exact answer formats that you can use in your interview to kill that resum to kill that interview and to land that job and i think there are those these are the top eight common questions but a lot of time people uh usually make mistakes in this top eight questions and that is the reason we have came up with this topic so that we can help you land that job and plus if you stick to the end we have the bonus to land jobs 10x faster and i promise that this tricks are going to help you a lot guys please so let's get started yes and guys please stick to the end because richie did an awesome job putting this all together and we're going to deliver as much value to you as possible so go ahead richie give him that disclaimer awesome so the disclaimer is this eight questions are for general interviews like you can use that for any interview but we have used example for the answers as uh for software developers because they are rockstars and dick to go through a lot of trouble what do you say daniel yeah no no this is great because the thing is there's always a lot of general questions that get repurposed for a lot of things because the interviewers might get a little lazy like hey what other type of interview questions are there so they will be very helpful in your interviews potentially potentially yep so first of all let's start with why answering interview questions properly is super important like so drop down in the comments guys that what do you think are the reasons that why answering the proper questions are necessary so go ahead and danielle just gave you a hint yeah yeah sorry i'll wait a little next time but go ahead drop the knowledge on them richie yeah so i think the first reason why do you want to answer proper questions is proper answers will increase your chance by 90 and i think that is one of the most important thing that you guys want to do because uh you might apply for 300 400 jobs and you can definitely learn 10 uh definitely learn 10 interviews maybe but when you land those interviews what matters is that there are going to be competitors for you and to be that competitors answering proper uh answering that questions properly matters a lot and it will increase your chance 90 percent if you do that properly exactly so what happens is these companies have a job opening and they know the type of person that they want to work on that specific technology or with that specific team so they try to tailor those questions to see if you are that specific person so by properly positioning yourself and answering those questions correctly you can show whether you are that type of person but if you kind of just throw some weird answers and they're not the right answers then you might show that you're not a good fit which is why we want to show you these things so that you make sure we make sure you're giving the right answers so what's the second reason awesome and before we talk about the second reasons guy if you guys if you want to know about a real uh free training on how to build the whole netflix clone the link is in the description make sure to subscribe to that it's gonna be a very useful clone and you can put that project on your resume and you can land those jobs so make sure to subscribe for that uh free training it's completely free and you guys can subscribe to that and get that free training for you and have that resume have that project on your resume awesome so let's talk about the number two reasons so second reason is proper answer will prove you have strong skills basically most important in north america probably all over the world but most important in north america people see people focuses a lot on soft skills as they focuses on technical skills because obviously they wants to know that if you are a good team member or not obviously they don't wanna they don't want someone who is not a good team player right daniel so i think that is one of the most important things soft skills are as much necessary as you as much as technical skills look put very simply put yourselves in their shoes if you're trying to hire someone for a position do you want it to be someone who's hard to work with do you want to be someone who doesn't communicate his ideas right do you want to be someone who gets angry if you don't understand what he's saying right it's like you don't want to be working with someone who's not fun to work with so by having these strong soft skills you become that person that's fun to work with easy to work with if anything people feel excited and energized you have a lot of positive energy and that all happens through your that your transfer and your development of soft skills amazing danielle very well said i think so let's go forward and let's move to what are the types of interviews so uh guys drop it in the comments what do you think that what are the types of interviews that uh hiring managers uh usually uh takes so uh i think let's uh talk about the first interview daniel oh yeah yep yeah so go ahead yeah so i think the first and i think uh the this this is gonna be the first interview and there are gonna be like some sets of interview but i think that this is gonna be the first interview that's gonna be a general and soft skills interview where their goal is to learn about your attitude and mindset before they go through the technical interview dave wants to know that if you are a good fit for the team as we said and the goal for that interview is going to be to learn about your attitude and mindset so they are going to be asking you a couple of questions in that way they can know about your mindset and the way you answer those questions matters a lot because that's going to prove that you are way more smarter than other 10 people who are who they are going to be interviewing right daniel so that is what a general and a soft skill interview is exactly and this is also sometimes called the behavioral interview and again they just want to see if you have the right mindset the right attitude if you're going to be fun to work with if you can connect with them on a human to human level and if you're able to do all those things then they're gonna be like man like now if he just has this second part which is gonna be the second part of the interview then he would be an awesome and amazing fit so what exactly is that second part richie so the second thing is the technical interview now the goal for that interview is to learn about your technical ability though if let's say like if you apply for a frontend position that requires a reac js developer the goal for this interview would be they are going to be asking you to show your code maybe they are just going to give you some example to solve this problem they're going to ask you questions like states and props and react so that's going to be a technical interview but today here we are going to be focusing on the soft skills into the general interview that's gonna be the first interview that you're gonna be getting when you apply for jobs exactly exactly so like how richie said it's if you get that first part which we'll be going over today then there you go okay he's awesome he's great to work with he or she is great to work with but now do they have the technical ability can they actually develop software and that's what this is but like how richie said today we're gonna dive deep into the first part which is the behavioral type interviews and we're going to give you every single tip that you need questions that you might get asked and how to answer them so what you want to make sure is that in this presentation you want to take screenshots and you want to take notes because richie laid out some amazing examples that if i were to go back to my interviews i would definitely take notes on these i would take screenshots i would probably just have those in my head so here's a little trick about behavioral interviews i know i'm talking for a long itchy but a little tip about behavioral interviews is they have patterns they have trends it's not like the technical interview where it's always gonna be a different question it's these might be the same question or the same type of question so if you prepare for these before the interview when they ask you a question you might already know exactly what you want to share with them what story what experience that shows a specific attribute about yourself so richie let's go ahead and dive deep into some of these what do you say yes yeah for sure and most important thing is that you guys take screenshot because we have laid out the exact answer format that you can use in your interview all you need to do is like include your roles and your positions and your note and your name and also make sure to take notes because being and being ready for an interview can get you a very good job so let's get started without wasting any time daniel so guys you have to ask him richie you think they're ready yeah guys so if you are ready drop down in the comments if you're already it's gonna be one of the more personally for me it's gonna be one of the most exciting live stream as a lot of people wants to know how they can answer those common questions and it's like the questions are going to be like tell us something about yourself and that's where a lot of people bluff they don't know what to tell right so that those kind of things that we are going to be talking about so question one is gonna be tell us something about yourself and this is where a lot of people tend to believe even me i have went through some interest and when in the beginning when they used to ask me like tell us something i'm like i used to bluff that oh okay i'm rishi and stuff like that but let's see that what most people answer is okay so what's the wrong answer then rich well richie would show up hey i'm richie i'm a full stack developer i live in canada i'm trying to imitate ritchie i was born in india and i love playing sports and reading books now richie why do we feel that this is the wrong type of answer exactly i think when i started i used to answer this question just like this but this is a wrong wrong question if you answer like this the chances are that you are not gonna get higher now the things that you could avoid in this question is do not ever interfere your personal life they don't want to know what you read at that point because uh they don't have that time they have to go through a lot of participants so do not include your personal life and do not include anything that is not related to that position that is not relevant only and so now uh go ahead daniel and go to the next screen and tell them what are the tips they can use to answer this question exactly so just to reemphasize on what richie said right here they're trying to see if you're a good fit for the position if you're just telling them about all these random things my personal life don't relate to the position it's not going to help so instead what you want to do is potentially tell a story because us human beings the way we relate is by telling a story and if you're able to include your achievements your work history things that you've done things that are related to that position then they're definitely going to relate to you that's how you build that soft skills you relate to that human but then you show how you're right for that position then what you also want to tell them is what you know about that role because you want to be able to show that you have been doing the research that you do understand what it is that you're playing for and you feel like you are qualified for that so richie let's give him what a great answer looks like go ahead and read it for me brother awesome let's so i think the proper way to answer this question would be something like that that okay uh if someone's asking you tell us something about yourself you can start like that uh i started off my career as a freelancer back in 2019 and i had the privilege to work it clear programmer since almost six months now which has been a great experience joining clear programmer was an excellent opportunity for me and there i'm in charge of focusing highly improving uh student success with a team moreover i know you are looking for someone who can lead a team and i think with my experience in finding gabs and developing a clean and easy process for improving student success i believe that i will succeed in the role you are hiring for and guys make sure to screenshot these answers now what i did in this answer is first i introduced that how i started my career how i got into coding and then i'm also showing them that what i did or what i'm doing right now or what i did in my past and in the end i'm also showing them that uh uh what they are looking for so i told them that i know you are looking for someone who can lead the team and then i'm telling them that why i'm a good fit for that role and that is how a good and there are different ways i'm 100 sure that there are different right ways to answer that as well but this is one of the ways that you can use to answer your question exactly and guys just like how we said in the other slide he's telling a story he's getting them engaged like oh my god this is so cool he was working for them and then he was able to learn all these different things and he fits the position he's the perfect match now let's see well hopefully that's what they say [Laughter] so what's the second type of question that they might get richie so i think the second type of questions they might get is like why do you want this job and when they ask these questions what they mean is that why do you want this specific job at this company why do you want this specific position at this company because they wants to know that what is the one reason that have pushed you to uh apply for this job right and that is the reason they might ask you this job exactly and specificity is key because you don't want to just give bad motivations you want to show that you have the right intrinsic internal motivations but that you're also you know doing things for the right reasons so richie what does a wrong answer look like so i think a lot of people and even me when i started as i said a lot of people would answer something like that that uh as i'm looking for a fulltime job as a web developer i think i will be a right fit for this job based on my education and experience that is not a wrong answer that can be a good answer but this is not good enough to get your job just think about this like this way there are 10 people who are attending that interview who are they who are the hiring managers going to be entering 10 people and probably more than uh seven people are gonna be answering the question like this that i want this job because i feel that i'm the right fit based on my education and experience but they they hear this kind of answer a lot of times every single participants they go through they hear answer like this so there are a couple of things that you can avoid while answering uh this question so go ahead daniel and tell them what are the things they can avoid so the first one is you don't want to just show them that you're doing things maybe just for the monetary value the reason is because money is not a great incentive and it's not a great motivator over someone's longterm career span they want someone who's actually motivated by learning who's actually motivated by challenging themselves and developing code as a developer and as a programmer so look here's a reality maybe you do want a little more money maybe your financial situation isn't right and becoming a developer is going to help you there but here's what i challenge you if this is your case i challenge you to see if that's really the only reason that motivates you if it's not perfect because it probably isn't right like coding is too hard my opinion is programming is too hard for oh let me move programming is too hard for you to just slowly be motivated by money and go out there and crush it because you're going to be disappointed you're going to see that your code doesn't work because of some semicolon or some crazy they'd be like man it's not worth that money but if you like the challenge if you like challenging yourself and there's a lot of other things or you're doing it you have a bigger purpose then you want to talk about those things you don't want to talk about money because money is just like this thing that no one cares about right and what's the other one richie so and also i think very well said that and i think uh i think one thing to take away from that is that you should love the process of going through this interviews you should love the process of uh applying for this job because that is something that will let you grow a lot and that will help you to understand this process in a better way so that in next five years or maybe next in two years you will correct the formula to land those jobs so and the second point you might want to avoid is that never show them that you will leave that job for a better job you don't this is like so much crucial that you don't ever ever want to do that like don't show them that you're gonna leave that job if you get a better job next time show them that you're gonna stick to that job and uh i think let's talk about the tips that you can use to answer this question that why do you want to stop so that's gonna there's only gonna be one tip and i think this is like one of the most important thing that you want to use that show a direct connection between you and that specific job period that's it uh just show a direct connection that why do you want a job and i think uh that is one of the most important hiring managers want to know because they get all this kind of answers that i want this job because of my education and my work experience but no they are looking for a react js developer then why do you want this job you want to show them that okay i might have work on the projects they are working in their company right now and i can show them that okay i was working for this kind of project and i'm pretty much interested to work on those kind of projects with you so that i can bring amazing ideas on the table from my experience so let's see a perfect example uh go ahead how to answer why do you want this job exactly so look i realized that this company's name whatever company it is google microsoft whatever is working on building websites mobile applications for educational purposes and institutes that personally fascinate me you see there he's connecting it the motivations that that company has are the same motivations that i have right clever programmer uh where i always looked at uh was more of an online so now he's showing his experience of why right he's like i worked a clever programmer it was one of the online education schools we had different courses and my responsibility was working directly with students to improve their success so in this answer go ahead screenshot it but you'll see how rich is putting himself in the position where he understands the motivation of the company he understands the motivation of the person who needs to be in that position and he's literally just picking himself up and putting himself right there and just positioning himself as the person who needs to have that job what do you say rishi yes for sure uh i just want to read this to them because i think this is uh something important for them so i just want to read them read it to them so let's take an example so you would go like this that i've realized that if it's microsoft let's say i realize microsoft is working on building websites and mobile applications for educational purpose and institutes and that personally fascinates me a lot as my previous company clever programmer where i worked at was more of an online education school where my major responsibilities was to work directly with students to improve their success and i believe which gave me the skills to bring some of the most amazing ideas on the table at microsoft now what i did in this answer is that i figured out a correlation that okay clever programmer is more of an online education school and that company is working on an educational purposes stuff right so i would say that based because i have the experience in students i they know that i can bring some amazing ideas on the table of that company and that is how you can answer that question sorry about that a little technical difficulty here uh here we go what is the third one richie the third one is why do you want this job now how do you try to not want to answer that right go ahead richie show him what's up yeah so i think a lot of people when they are trying to answer that they are going to be like i'm a hardworking talented individual with strong interpersonal skills and i think i'm the perfect person for this role and i think that is not how you answer that a lot of people also i think the second question the third one is the same so i think a lot of people would answer like this as well and i do not think that this is the right way to answer that question so let's talk about the things that you yeah go ahead no go go ahead i'm just gonna lead on to the next one what do they want to avoid rishi so they just want to say you don't want to you never ever want to fake this answer you never want to show that you are perfect now there are two reasons like you don't want you don't want to show perfect because that no one is perfect in the world you can show them like if you are if you do if you like some skills just be honest to them that okay i might not know the skills but tell them that you are keen to learn and you will make sure to them that you are gonna be you're gonna be right fit because you're keen to learn and you will learn those technologies for them and uh and and i think when you lie that you are just perfect and when you fake this answer they're just gonna catch up like this what do you say then you know yeah i mean everyone knows that nobody is perfect right so if you start lying about you being perfect they're going to know you're lying and now they're going to ask themselves do we want to work with the liar and the answer is obviously no nobody wants to work with a liar nobody wants to work with someone with negative energy that has insecurities that they have to lie about their own things they love transparency they love honesty so make sure you do not try to fall into that frame of being perfect so richie what do they want to do yeah so the tip is gonna be that show them why you are unique like based on they are getting like thousands of introduced so you want to show them why you are specifically unique and why you would be a good fit for that job i think that is one of the most important thing you want to show them like why you are unique and the second thing that you can show you uh show you can help them solve their problems and i think this is one of the most important then you'll go ahead and explain why the second point is necessary exactly because the reality is everyone has problems each person has a problem each company has a problem right and the reason the company is opening up this position is because they need someone that's going to help them solve a specific problem maybe they don't have a website maybe they don't have a backend maybe they don't even know how to develop things maybe they just need more bandwidth so if you could show that you can help solve that problem then again you're just putting yourself in that position it's like with these soft skills with these answers you put yourself in the position that they want to hire you so richie what does that look like for them so i think uh just to add to some add something on the last point like as a developer they always see you as a problem solver right and i think that is the reason you want to show them that how you can because honestly just uh frankly speaking no one gives a like how many uh technologies you know and stuff like that they just want to know how you can answer that how you can solve their problem they're facing right now they're if they're lacking a react.js developer who can lead a team how you can show them show them like how you can solve that problem now maybe the right way to answer this question is that you can start by saying that i understand like now you're going to be showing that i also understand that what what is the requirement so you can say that i understand that one of the key requirement for this position is expertise in react.js you should hire me because i have a unique understanding of the latest uh latest concepts of reexists such as redux and hooks i realized that knowing react native is an asset for this role and i have been working with react native since almost over a year one thing i do not have in my skill sets that you are looking for is react bootstrap but i'm eager to learn it from amazing people and i do not believe it will be hard for me to catch up uh and i also learned that your company values leadership and i know without a doubt i will sustain the company's standards and lead the team to a greater success now go ahead daniel why answering a question why answering this question this is important like what are the important things they can what are key takeaways from this answer again guys look richie puts himself in the position of i know react.js i know redux hooks you know i'm in the latest trend i know what's going on but look how he also shows the imperfection was like but i don't know react bootstrap which is something that was asked for with this project but then again look how he shows that he's openminded he's willing to work he's willing to learn he says he would be willing to work harder and try to learn these new technologies to be able to do what he needs to be able to lead the team and solve the specific problems so i think this covers all the tips that you talked about richie there anything else you want to add to that no for sure i think uh that's it but make sure guys to subscribe screenshot this and if you want a free training on netflix clone the link is in the description go ahead and subscribe that it's a complete free training exactly now the reason why we're telling you to go get that free training is because it's hard to get this interview if you don't have awesome portfolio build up like the netflix clone like the amazon clone like all these other clones that we're building so guys go ahead go to that link if you want to get that first step into getting these interviews so with that being said richie what is the fourth common question the fourth common question is what is your greatest weakness and as you can see that meme at the bottom i would say nothing i wish it was nothing right what is your greatest weakness daniel what is your greatest weakness let's let's apart from the interview things like what is your christmas weakness exactly so the way that i like to approach this one is i like to very similar to the other ones is i might specifically talk about something that you know i'm transparent i'm open i'm not going to lie to them but it does take a lot of selfawareness right like maybe it's like oh man i'm a perfectionist or i do something like that right but you have to one note why that's a weakness like what are the downsides of that and then two or actually when i get into this but two i talk about how i'm improving that so richie go ahead and dive into some of these wrong answers and expand a little more a lot of people like when they're answering this question is that my greatest weakness is i work super hard and i guarantee you on that that there are like a bunch of lot of people who are answering like this and that makes like i i and it's completely okay like when you are when you are beginner you like i used to answer uh questions like this and that's completely okay but it makes me laugh that i used to answer like that that i work super hard and i think that's like a no no no if you're gonna go to an interviewer and let's uh and you're gonna say that my weaknesses i work super hard just kidding it makes me laugh right now so they're just gonna be laughing hard inside but they cannot definitely show you but yeah they are gonna be and uh maybe like there are different wrong answers for this that uh some people would say that nothing i do not have any weakness and when you say that what you're trying to do is that you're trying to prove them that you are perfect you do not have any weakness and i would say that there is not a single person on earth that would not have a single weakness in them because no one is perfect everyone is still learning and everyone wants to learn and you want to show that part instead of just showing them that uh you are perfect and you do not have any weakness what what's your take on that daniel like you have been uh working with uh blue origin which is a company from amazon and uh that's a great company guys um so what is your take on that why do you want to not show them that you are perfect look exactly the first one very like we're talking about soft skills with soft skills is how you communicate with people so the first one just shows you're completely arrogant right like if you're going to say that you work super hard as a weakness it's like no this guy's not like he's arrogant he thinks he's like that's not confidence that's being cocky right it's like nobody wants to work with someone like that the second one you just straight up blind again like we said we all know that nobody is perfect so if you don't talk about those things that make you imperfect they're going to realize that you're not open you're not honest and you're not transparent so what else do they want to avoid so uh they want to avoid never to fake this answer because like you should not fake this answer that doesn't mean that you should hide some stuff but you don't want to fake this answer at all because as daniel said you want to show them that you are perfect never ever do that because the hiring managers interview like thousands of people in a year and they would just catch up like this that you are faking this answer so do not fake this answer the next thing you want to avoid is never show a witness which is harder or impossible to change now i think this is one of the most important thing you don't want to show like also you at the same time when you're not faking this answer you don't want to show them a weakness which is harder impossible to change let's say that let's let's talk about that i'm a very bad temper person and i think in order to change that weakness of yourself uh it's gonna take years i mean it's probably you can change that definitely but it's gonna take years because you have been bad temper since maybe childhood then they're probably gonna feel that no no for this person because they have a weakness which is very hard or maybe impossible to change in real life so that is the reason you don't want to show them a weakness which is almost impossible to change you want to show them something that is possible and that can be changed right daniel so why don't you go ahead and talk about tips they can use to answer this question exactly so again if you show that realistic weakness you're not going to come out as cocky or arrogant you're going to come out as vulnerable open honest and they'll be like all right that's someone that i could connect with that's someone that i could talk to now if you show something you can change you could talk about how you're trying to change those things and what you're currently doing to try to improve those things because again we all have weaknesses just not everybody is trying to improve their weaknesses so richie let's go ahead and get into a right answer yep awesome let's go ahead and write read the right answer so i when you are answering this you want to make sure that you show them that there is a weakness in you but that can be changed so let's focus let's i'm gonna read out to you make sure to screenshot this that i'm gonna read out to you i realized with my experience that my greatest weakness is that i get overwhelmed when a deadline is near and then it is very hard for me to manage time and complete it before deadline now i'm gonna i'm showing them that there is a weakness in me that uh when there is a deadline i get overwhelmed now but i'm gonna also show them that but i have been working on them on that since last month and i'm even doing some courses on time management which has strongly helped me to improve my weakness and i believe with time i will be able to improve it completely so uh now i start by saying that okay i do have a weakness and i'm gonna i'm showing them that i have a weakness that can't be changed that uh that i get uh tends to i get overwhelmed i tend to freak out when there is deadline near uh but uh when there's a deadline near a job when i have to submit a project to the client but i have been working on that and i'm doing some courses on the time manager as well so they are like okay this guy is honest that he accepts he have this weakness now they're also thinking that okay at the same time he's when i'm showing them some proof i'm showing them them some social proof that okay since last month i'm even doing some courses on time management so that they know that this guy is very openminded and he wants to work on those weakness that is the reason he's working on that and then he also says that i believe with time i will be able to improve it completely and when i say the last sentence i believe with time i will be able to improve it completely they would believe it because i i'm honest with them and when you're honest with them and then when you tell them that i'm also working on something there there are chances that 99 or 0.99 they would believe you what what's your take you know because uh you have been working with a lot of amazing people and they have a lot of weaknesses right they have a lot of weakness and they would always be open mind to confess that with you right so have you been in a situation or something like that where you know that this guy has this weakness and he's very openminded and he's eager to learn even you can talk about yourself right that some weakness you had yeah i mean this this is also just a the perfect answer if you're seeing this screenshot it write something like that but yeah when i've had conversations with coworkers it's just about being open it's just about being transparent and it's about being honest and trying to see how him or her or both of you guys could come to the right solution because in the end of the day you're problem solver that means technical skills that means people skills whatever that may be so guys take a screenshot of this picture and richie let's go ahead and get into the next one what type of question is that richie awesome that is what is your greatest strength obviously you are not a super man but then how do you answer this question what is your greatest strength what strength do you want to show them what strength do you want to hide from them and how do you answer that question now let's go ahead then you'll go ahead and tell them what is the wrong answer a lot of people would uh use well the wrong answer would be my greatest strength is that i am able to complete every task on time and i feel i am perfect at whatever i do because i'm superman right and that is the wrong answer again because you're expecting perfectionism from that person so what do they want to avoid when talking about these answers so i think you want to show a strength which is not a real no you don't want to show them a strength which is not a realistic again like just like weakness you wanna you you wanna show a strength which is completely realistic not something that no one can be perfect and i don't think that every no one can uh submit everything on time yeah there can be some people who would have done that but there is no one perfect so you don't want to show them a strength which is not realistic another thing that uh never shows strength which is not related to that to that role so maybe like if some person is asking the firing managers are going to be asking you that what's your strength and you started talking like my greatest strength is that uh i can't run like at uh 30 miles per hour yeah probably like i make some bomb ass hot chocolate so i'm not gonna be like hey uh what's your greatest strengthening because pregnant oh my hot chocolate you should see it i put the right amount of milk the right amount of cream the hot chocolate is amazing i mean it's strength right but it's not related to what they're looking for so what are the tips that we need to give them yeah it just makes me laugh that you're talking about how to make that hot chocolate you probably don't want to know that what kind of chocolates you make so you probably want to avoid that but one tip you want to take in consider is that show a strength which you have which matches the job description now what how you can do that is go through the job description read it carefully like even if it take one hour two hours doesn't matter you need that job if you have that interview go to that job description like and then read out all the things that they need from a person they want to be hiring and then you figure out that okay they need a react.js developer what are your strengths that you can show them because they just care how you can help them how you can solve their problem again back to the agenda that how you can solve the problem so you want to show them a strength which is going to be which is going to help them and not just help you to maybe just market yourself about your hot chocolate right so what does that answer look like richie okay so i'm going to read it for you make sure to screenshot this uh yeah so i that's how it starts i feel my greatest strength is knowing the latest react hooks and debugging the code when using react.js in my previous role i was responsible for highly using and teaching latest concepts of react like hooks and giving feedback to students on that code which helped me to have a better understanding of debugging the code with minimal errors moreover while studying mobile application development in my college i learned the importance of react hooks and had the opportunity to work on some real world projects now when i'm talking this uh when i'm answering discussion i suddenly start with my greatest strength is what are the greatest so i know that they are looking for someone who can work with rex and they also want someone who knows react hooks and who is good at debugging the code so that's how i start that okay i had this trend in me because even if they start asking me some questions about hooks and debugging i can answer that so that i have this strength in me which is directly correlated to the job description and that is what i have exactly shown here and then i'm also talking about that why i have this trend so most important thing while answering the question uh daniel is social proof i'm saying them that i was responsible for teaching the latest concept of react in my previous job and giving feedback on their code so that helped me to understand uh debugging the code with minimal errors right so this is the social proof that i'm providing so make sure when you answer every question you provide them a social proof that why you are good at this thing not just showing them that because it's it's important to answer that question in a proper way that you know we know that you know that you are you have this trend but the most important thing is why do you have discern how do you develop this trend so you want to show them that i developed this trend from your from my previous job or something like that and also just uh some extra bonus that uh while studying this uh in my college i also get to work on some realworld projects so what do you feel about this and said daniel what are the key take away from toys answer it's like i said great answer because you're showing the strength that is related to the position you're putting yourself and showing them that you fit this exact position right and then you're giving that social proof which just furthermore reinforces that they should hire you for that position so i would say screenshot it awesome answer and let's go on to number six which is what is your expected salary and we're gonna be there like danny devito throwing dollar bills at all of them ready to just make it rain cash so what does a bad answer look like richie uh probably when you're asked like what is your expected salary like a lot of people would answer something like i do not have any salary range because they don't have done their research uh they would be like i'm happy to work on work for whatever i get this get at this time as i'm starting my career and just want to learn okay that is okay that you are happy to work for whatever you get at this point of your career and because you are just starting out your career you just want to learn but that does not mean that does not mean that you don't provide them a salary range and for that you need to be prepared so so daniel uh you might have uh you might have got a question like this that or you might have even like hired someone uh with your job that uh and you guys might have asked questions like i do not have us uh what's your sell what's your expected salary so what do you think that there are other wrong ways to answer this question uh instead of just saying that i do not have a salary range what do you think about that there's multiple wrong ways but maybe what's important to start to go towards is the right answer and that's i mean you just want to at least have some knowledge some knowledge of how much you should be worth what people are paying for so you want to make sure you prepare for those things but what are the things that they do want to avoid when answering these questions richie so uh let's go ahead and talk about the thing so the first thing you want to avoid is that never show them you don't uh never show you don't care about money you want to show them yes you do care about the money uh of course you are not just there for money uh but yes you do care about money because those are your skills those are the things that uh you have worked on you have spent like hours and hours and years and years to learn those skills now you don't want to show them that you don't care about money of course you don't you of course you do care about the money but at the same time you don't want to make them feel that you only and only care about money and the second thing uh you don't want to show them is never sure you can also you can work you can also work for less money now these are the two most important thing i have realized because uh a lot of people uh they just uh when hiring managers are asking that what is your expected seller they always try to feel that okay like uh maybe they have a budget and what if like i answered that answer uh give them a salary range which is not into their budget and they're just not going to hire me that's not true you when you when you show that sometimes what happens is not sometime most of most of the time what happens is that if you have a good technical skills if you're a good soft skill what they're gonna do is that they're gonna make you do the same job for less money they might have a budget for like eighty thousand dollars for that job but if you show them that you don't care about money maybe they would just make you do that job for seventy thousand dollars or maybe even 65 so you never ever want to show that that you don't care about money you want to show them of course you do care about the money but the same time you don't only care about the money so if you want if you want to like um if you if you want to know like how but you'll be like how do i figure out that uh how the hell like what's my salary like i don't know i never worked before like how do i know so daniel like why don't you tell them that how do they know that like they don't if they don't have a salary range what they can do i mean if you don't have a salary range you could easily just go to dr google and you go to dr google and you figure it out you put in what is the salary range that is expected because you need to know what you're worth what your skills are worth and what your value is worth so what are some of these tips that we should give them richie after they go to dr google and figure those things out actually that's one of the tips right yeah so as daniel yeah so as danielle said that you want to go to dr google you want to ask google that you want to go and just search for like if you're searching for a reac js developer in usa you want to go to that what is the annual salary uh fresh reactions developer would get and you will find tons of like a salary uh you will find a tons of website that shows a salary rate now if you are like if you have some experience and you want to go with an average salary with you just because you have like you got couple of three or four years of experience in reach chase and then uh you just go to google and you search like what is the average salary of react js and in united states and i think it's probably 120 k and it's a huge right daniel vhs is picking up guys by the way it's picking up super fast and that's why our papa reacts sunny aka sunny is uh making those amazing clones and just to make sure like we have also uh organized uh if you're watching this if you have joined this late we have organized a completely free training for you guys we are going to be building a netflix clone in that free training and uh as then you'll say that you if you're if you land those interview first of all you need those projects so go sign up the link is in the description go sign up for those projects uh and uh for those for that netflix clone completely free training and make sure to have that project on your resume now let's talk about the tips before you answer questions before you answer that question ask questions about the role because you just don't want to give you even if you know salaries you don't want to shoot a salary in air because you want to know like what is expected from that job maybe they're giving some bonuses maybe they're just giving because like most of the time in uh in canada like a lot of people a lot of jobs they provide you uh uh even if you're if you're not a permanent resident they provide you with a health benefit so you might pro when you provide a salary range that might be you might think that they were going to provide me a health benefit now if you if you you might want to ask questions about dead role right maybe like what if they are expecting someone who uh who can work overtime for them who can work in weekends for them so before you answer that question you want to make sure that you know almost every single thing about that role what do you think about it daniel because i think this is very important i think we should i it's really important to uh talk about this yeah for sure because if you don't understand what you're signing yourself up for then you you just can't be throwing random numbers right like if you're gonna be putting in a lot of hours over time working weekends then you might actually want to ask for even more than the regular salary range if you're gonna be working less there's already a lot of benefits included then it's not unfair for you to ask for like a lot more money than way more than the market average right so just understanding what's that position that is open for you so then the second tip again would be researching the current market for your specific position and again goes back to question one or the tip number one which is understanding what it is that they are looking for and that role specifically and what's that fifth tip richie or sorry third trip tip so the third tip would be always ask for five to ten k more because they will negotiate and that is something that you should always do like if you're in north america probably always go for five to ten thousand dollars more because they are always always going to be negotiating i swear to god that you're always gonna negotiate and he did don't good for you you got five to ten thousand more than you expected right so uh because that thing happens a lot because talk about something that daniel that how how do they negotiate like why do you want to tell them that uh if you if you are like if you if your expected salary is 60 000 you always want to go with that i'm expecting something around uh 65 to 70k why do you want to why do you want to do that go ahead and explain them briefly like they want to do that because look best case scenario if you give you know a 10 case 5k more or whatever they say yes he's like all right cool now you have more salary for the year now if they say yes right away maybe they were already giving you a super low expected one regardless but regardless when you negotiate you always want to aim higher because they're the ones that are going to start lower and then you want to try to find each other in the middle if you go to your expected range or what you think you're going to get right away and they go lower it's always going to keep on going down so if you add that 5 to 10k cushion and it make it goes down to the middle it might go to that original salary you first expected yes for sure and one thing to note over uh one thing to note is that the first uh tip tip number one before answering and ask question about it that is important make sure because like once you give them a once you provide them a salary range there's no go back there is no go back like if you tell them that i'm expecting something around uh 60 000 and then they're gonna negotiate and you might settle for 55 and then you don't have health benefits you don't have a lot of stuff you have to work in the weekends you have to work overtime so then there's no go back so you want to ask them questions before before you are answering or the question uh how what is your expected salary now let's go ahead daniel and let's talk about what can be the perfect answer for them uh for to answer what is your expected salary so i'll just read it straight out and the first one is before i answer that question i would like to know more about what that job has to offer me including bonuses insurance and would like to know my responsibilities briefly again this is going back to tip number one so once they answer those things for you you now have a better understanding of the job you now have a better idea of the job so now you could relate how you would fit that and based on my experience current market and what the job has to offer me i would say i would like to go between 75 to 80 000 and if this is the job that is offered to me i'm sure we can come up with an agreement on the salary so again you're saying you're open for negotiation you already did your mark your research the 75 to 80k might be an extra 5 to 10k from what you originally expected and you're saying you're open to negotiating so they're more than happy to work with you if they want you for that job yes and last sentence in this answer uh in the second answer is must must think that you you want to say that i'm sure we can come to an agreement on salary because when you're providing them similar range okay now you got your uh all you know all the responsibilities about your job briefly now you know that what salary range you're providing you're providing them a five to ten thousand dollar more salary rate but sometimes sometimes hiring managers uh they don't feel that they want to negotiate so if you provide them 75 to 80k they just have a budget for like 60k or 65k they'll uh they're going to be like no i don't want to hire this guy because he has more budget so at the end you want to add this line that i'm sure we can come to an agreement on salary if you can say something like if this job is offered to me i'm sure we can come to an agreement on salary and when you say that they they know that uh this person is ready for negotiation so that is the reason you guys want to say that awesome screenshot this don't forget to screenshot that guys screenshot it right now i'll give you a couple more seconds all right your couple seconds are over next one so like four i went fast i went fast man number seven they're gonna ask you what are your goals and you're gonna be like man i got lots of goals man what's the wrong answer that some people say richie uh a lot of people would answer something like i see myself in like i i think and it's it's not wrong like a lot of people would answer that i see myself in a managerial position or i dream to have my own company for what i learned from here in next few years boss the wrong thing over here is again you are showing them you're going to leave that job even though you want to own your company next few years even though you you see yourself in that manager position work hard but do not show them that you're going to be leaving that job what's your take on daniel i just want to talk more on that because like a lot of people when they ask about goals like they try to be smart but at the same time like they don't know that when trying to be smart they are making a mistake showing them that you will live you are going to be leaving the job so what are the things they can avoid for sure so like how we just said you don't want to show them that you're just trying to use them so that you could leave them right sometimes you're looking for someone who's going to stay there and who's going to have a lot of impact on the company so instead of trying to be like oh yeah i just i just want to use you guys for a couple years and then leave you guys i mean maybe that's the truth but that's not how you want to go about it so instead what are some things or what's this no they want to see you are in their company for long term and wants to hire someone for this job only so i'm not saying lie and say i want to stay with you guys for 50 years if that's not the truth right that's not the truth don't lie about it but talk about your couple years that you plan on being with them which is you know in those three years those five years or whatever you don't have to specify but say with my time with you guys i want to be able to do all these different things so that is exactly what the tip will lead them to which is what richie yes so exactly uh just so the tip is that show them that you will improve this position and how you can improve this position and how you can improve so the thing is that the thing is that any hiring manager in the world you can pick up any hiding manager they want if they have posted a posting if they have posted a job uh on whatever platform they're posting they want someone for specific that job they don't want someone uh they don't want someone for the who's gonna be managing the next five years or next three years they don't want someone who wants to have their own company next three years they want someone for that specific job and that is the reason you just want to show them how you will improve this position and you want to show them that you will improve this position and how you will extend the capabilities of this project so daniel before we get to the right answer i want to ask something that because blue origin is hiring like a lot of amazing people like you so what do you think that uh do dick i mean uh probably i want your take on that so do take consider people who have dream who have bigger dreams like they want to have their open uh they want to open their own amazon in next few years or open their own blurry do they consider something like that or it's just a false thing that you want to avoid no i mean they in the end they would probably if it's a company that doesn't support your longterm goals it's probably not a company you want to work for plain and simple right it's probably toxic it's probably not the right environment there's probably people there who would hold you back as opposed to trying to help you propel forward so when i worked at blue origin it was completely different it was people who were encouraging it was people who wanted you to succeed whether it was with them or not now here's the thing when i showed up to the interview i wasn't talking about the things i was trying to do without them i was talking about the things that i was going to improve in there in that position and those kind of things but again if you if if it's a company where you talk about like oh yeah and i also want to have a business in 10 years and they're like oh we don't want you well good don't be with them they're probably very toxic environment to be with so what does a right answer look like richie awesome let's go ahead and uh let's read the right answer go ahead brother okay so when they're asking like what are your goals you want to show them that you're going to stay into that position you are perfect for that question you're going to expand the capabilities of the position so here we go make sure to screenshot that uh here we go in the next few years i see myself greatly improving my in my role and be an expert in developing websites in react with latest tech i plan to immerse and understand areas and gaps that can be improved in this position and expertise on how i can guide the new joiners in the right direction moreover i also look forward to utilize what i learned from here and help other department department as well now what i have done here is that i have shown them that okay they are looking for a react.js developer but they also want someone who can stay at the latest 10 trend so i'm telling them that i see myself to be an expert in developing websites with react but with the latest stack now i'm also showing them that i plan to find the areas in the gaps that will be lacking uh what improvements that we're needing for this position where and that is how i can improve that position and be an expertise on how i can guide the new joiners in the right direction because i and i can also tell them that as i love teaching uh i have also been teaching educator programmer and as i love teaching i would be happy to to guide the new joiners in the right direction because that is something that i'm passionate about now that is again one social proof right and more then again in the end i say that moreover i look forward to utilize what i learned from here so now what i learned from you there they also they'll know that the things you're gonna be learning from here you're not gonna let it go in with so how are you gonna use them so you can say something like i i will from what i learned from here i i'll try to help other department as well maybe like something like marketing or something like that so then they're like okay this guy is a great team member he's ready he's openminded to work with other department he's openminded to uh also guide the new joiners and he specifically wants to improve his role not he wants to go for that managerial position or something like that and probably uh even if you're going for that hide that hide that so well that they don't know like just improve and i think most of the hiring managers would know that definitely did they know that you're not going to stay there for like 10 years for sure but you want to answer it well that they know that you have or you aim to extend the capabilities of that position and you also and how you can do that you can help other department you can help the new joiners and you also show them a social proof that okay i have been working with club program i have been teaching and i can also teach the new joiners once i'm comfortable with this job so daniel go ahead what's what's the key takeaway dude it's it's just a great answer overall like everything just talked on all i could say is screenshot this slide because it's a great answer guys and i say we now go to the last question of the top eight questions which is the company asking do you have yeah go ahead go ahead do you have any questions for us and here we go what what movies i forgot what movie that's from but yeah they want to see what questions you have right and what is the wrong way to answer this richie most of people would be like i do not have any questions okay that is like that is a wrong wrong question and i think okay at certain level that is okay but that's probably a wrong question you want to avoid that you don't want to show them that you don't have any questions and something else that bothers me a lot is that sometime i'm not saying a lot of people but sometimes some people would be like i have a question what actually does the company do now here if you answer this question like this you are not going to get that job for sure 100 because if you ask something like what does that what what actually does the company do they're like holy this guy like he went for it he came to an interview for this company and he did not even did his own research what the hell so you don't want to answer you don't want to ask questions like what the because if you if you are going to an interview probably you should be knowing that uh what does that company does right daniel because even if you're like daniel when you started with blow region you did all your own research right yeah yeah exactly like i knew exactly what the mission of the company was i knew what they were doing what they were hiring for those were the things that i was doing right so i wasn't when they asked me that what were the questions that i had i already had an idea of some questions showing up to the interview because they always ask you like do you have any questions for us so i wasn't afraid to start to ask them questions right and i it wasn't like what does it say no if you're running next to next with another candidate yes so i wasn't afraid to ask questions because i knew i was giving that advantage and knowing more about the position knowing about what they were looking for and positioning myself properly so again i was showing up asking the right questions and i was avoiding this big thing that you want to work which is don't be afraid to not even ask the right questions but don't be afraid to just ask questions in general oh yeah i see them not now she always say the right questions because obviously the other one was a bad question so what are some tips they could do to prepare to ask the right questions richie yeah before we go to the tips like just just to note to make sure that the reason why you want to ask the right questions is because that if you are running neck to neck with another candidate let's say that there is one other guy uh who is there for interview with you and you guys have like done a great job entering and you guys like you guys go like same similar points in that interview and if you ask the right question you will land that job for sure like i guarantee you that that asking the right question will lend you the job if you are running neck to neck with another candidate so so one thing that matters is you all you want to ask you don't want to you don't want to be afraid to write i need uh afraid to ask the question but at the same time you also want to ask the right questions not want to ask like what does company actually do right so that is how uh that that is something that will matter when you are running through a candidate which is like a proper competitor with you now let's talk about some tips how do you answer this question so before you answer that create a list of questions in advance do your own research go to that company's website get the hell out of that website whatever they are looking for go to the job description spend hours looking for the job description figure out what the what kind of person they wants to and go to that company's website figure out like everything that company is doing what are the types of project and based on that figure out like maybe two or three important questions or maybe four important questions that you want to ask them it doesn't matter even if you want to ask questions like that right now we were talking we were just talking with nas before the live stream and he we were talking about this question and he was like uh i think uh probably nas what he used to ask when he was interviewed with google uh twitter and companies like that he also asked questions like what's the team like right uh how does the team work what's the environment like so that kind of questions is necessary because that kind of questions you cannot find on website right but you can always find out like what does the company actually does on the website and that is the reason you don't want to ask questions like that what does the company do and they're like what the hell what does this guy do no no yeah so like you're like are you serious like i swear like people are gonna be like that that uh they're gonna freak out if you don't know about that company when you enter that interview so make sure to do that now so the tip is that create a list of questions in advance like when you go through that company when you go to the description maybe like if they are asking in description they're asking that uh you might also have to uh work on some other technologies so maybe you can have ask questions like what other technologies do i need to work on right so you want to ask that kind of question so but prepare a list in advance so that you don't bluff out at that point now why don't you talk about tip number two daniel go ahead yeah so tip number two is make them feel you want to make sure that you are the right fit again when it's an interview it's not just them seeing if you're right for the company but it's you seeing if you are right fit for that company or for that position so by asking these questions now you're flipping the tables around and you're saying huh okay well like obviously i'm answering these questions super well because i saw richie and daniel's powerpoint so i'm super prepared for these and potentially i'm killing the technical interview questions so obviously i'm a great fit but my question to you company is are you the right fit for me so you flip the tables around and now you're trying to ask those questions that they're gonna be like man we really want this guy and we're gonna try to answer the questions the best of our ability so what's the third tip and the reason why you add on to that yeah before we yeah before we go to the yeah before we go to the third tip the reason why you want to show them you want to make them feel that you also want to make sure you are the right fit because you want to show them that you do care about this job you want to make sure that you are the perfect faith you are not choosing the wrong job and you're just not here for the money even though if you are do not show them and probably i think you won't be but do not show them even if you are but when you when you do that when you ask questions and when you make sure that you are you're right fit from your end for that company they'll be like okay this guy does care about this job that he also wants to make sure he's the right fit and that will make you stand out so this kind of small things that we are gonna we are telling you this kind of small tips make sure you take those notes because that will make you stand out from a lot of candidates it seems that this kind of these are common things but we usually see that people making this common mistakes and uh and it's like it tends to get nervous and they bluff out and it's things get weird in an interview so make sure to take notes of this tip screenshot this and whatever you want but take these tips because it's i think it's pretty interesting and it is based on our experience because we have been interviewed with some companies and the third tip is that show them you are interested in drawing into the role and the company now you also when you're making sure that you're the right fit for the company you also want to show them that you are interested in the role and the company and how you can do that is that you also ask questions like uh maybe the values of the company shares and stuff like that and about even about the role be specific about it like even if you have like uh some questions about a role that okay like if it's reach js developer you're like okay i see that there's uh the role describes that uh if you know uh react native it's an asset so you wanna ask questions like are we gonna be working on mobile applications because it's just a web developer position and that is okay to ask questions like that because that shows you really care about that job you really care about your role and that company and that makes you stand out from a lot of people rather than just answering that no i don't i don't have any questions or uh it's just asking some basic question ask questions related to that role and the company so let's go ahead and daniel read out for them what a right answer looks like so example number one i was doing my own research and i realized that the company is highly focused on building websites and applications for the educational purpose but does the company aim to enhance on other categories as well so you're showing you're interested you're showing that you want to know more about the company and you're also trying to see if they would be that good fit for you what do you want to add to that richie yeah so okay so that is some tricky stuff that that's going on in this answer is that like when you're asking that now the hiring manager gets into mindset that okay this person cares about the role and he's making sure that does the company and hence is to sorry uh and hence to work on other categories as well because uh maybe like you you want to work on other categories as well instead of just educational purpose right so they will be like yeah this person cares about that so that when you ask questions like this that and the one thing that matters in this question in this answer is that they would definitely know that okay awesome this guy knows what the hell we are working right now this guy exactly knows what the hell we are working and he also wants to know what we will be working in future so now you that now the tables have turned they were asking you like what are your goals now you are asking them what are their goals but you're just being more specific and it's completely okay to ask them questions because they want to see how much you care about that job and they want to see you are just not another person who are just here for uh just you just don't want uh you're just a person who just want another job you they want to see that you want to help people you want to help people and you want to make their lives easier in a community who share the same passion for technology right daniel exactly exactly so let's go and head over to example number two and that would read something like apart from the skills listed on my uh cover le or cv curriculum item what other technologies and skills will i get to learn from this role so similar to what rich just talked about which is you're flipping the tables you're trying to see if you're going to be a good fit for them they're going to try to qualify themselves now they're going to try to answer those questions and they're seeing you're interested they're seeing that you're right for the position and they're just trying to see if now they are right for you anything else reaching for sure and when you yeah for sure 100 and when you when you show something like this that yeah you are like now the way i think this is something that i think a lot of people should start asking and introduce to the hiring managers because this will this will show them that you are like eager and you are keen to learn new uh new technologies and new skills right so you're asking that apart from the skills listed on my cv so those are the skills that i know what other technologies and skills i will get to learn from this role so not just it's just not one way thing like you it's not just that you are providing them skills you're also asking them what what are the things that i will be learning and definitely it's very good question to ask because uh they will be like okay this guy is like so openminded he is very smart that he wants to learn from this role as well and he is not he's now when you when you have answered the previous questions just like how we did they're like okay this guy is being honest the uh this guy's uh is not lying he is not proving that he's perfect he has shown his weaknesses and now he's also say he's also showing that he wants to learn now like i think probably no one would like ever wants to not hire this kind of person who is honest who accepts that that person is not perfect who shows the realistic witness who shows the realities realistic strength based on some social proofs and also shows that he wants to improve that weakness and he's working on that weakness and he also wants to learn from that role now i don't think that there will be uh people who would not want to hire this kind of people what's your take yeah no i i mean i completely agree because you're showing why again by asking them questions these type of right questions you're showing them why you are the right fit honestly because again you're putting yourself in that situation where they want you to work for them so richie that was eight of the most common questions right oh we're still on the question one so what else do you want to know richie yeah so uh so one thing to note from here is that don't ask too many questions obviously you want to ask them questions but you don't want to spend like half an hour or hour just asking them questions you want to ask them like three or four questions but just the most relevant questions that will make you stand out and that can that will for sure help you to land that job but do not ask like 15 or 20 questions or even 10 questions and i think that's important because like then hiring managers will be like what the hell is going on this guy is interviewing us yeah because it's not that interview it's your interview and i think uh something else that yeah and you don't want to ask questions like do you pay by check i mean you do care about that stuff i'm not saying that you don't care about that stuff at this point you don't want to ask questions like that do you pay by check are there possibilities of promotions would you would i have to work after hours now like don't ask questions like this at this point and even if you want to ask something like that make sure you phrase that in a more better way that they feel that okay this is relevant not just a random other question so you don't want to do that just don't keep on asking questions one thing i just like realized daniel was that me and daniel guys before we run into bonus me and daniel were like just preparing for this live stream we're doing just testing and then danielle was just doing some testing with nas and then you're like he was testing out the live stream and i was like what the did daniel just go live that was like the funniest thing that ever happened right daniel we're gonna have to show them the bloopers comment comment a thumbs up if you want to see the bloopers of richie panicking because he thought we were going live yeah so i was just like sitting over here and like daniel was just testing out the live stream with all his mic and camera and stuff lighting and he's like uh he's just checking that hey guys this is daniel and it's like uh we have here with us rishi and i'm like i was just sitting over here i'm like what the hell daniel are we alive i didn't even knew daddy i started laughing so hard because you you guys missed that face so comment down thumbs up in the in the chat if you want to see the fire yeah um it was it was like that that was some bad communication on my end because i didn't tell richie we were just testing and that's why communication is important you want to communicate well with the people's interviewing you want to communicate well with your team you want to communicate well with everybody so richie i think it is time for some bonuses so we can make it rain how this meme is making their brain on that i'm the guy in blue and the guy in green is richie [Laughter] so what are some frequently uh questions richie go ahead awesome so uh i think you just went to uh the second question can you just go back is it second order it's the first question well it says okay okay so uh the first question a lot of people would ask us is that should i work unpaid if i have no experience and we get a lot of this kind of question because we have this great community profit with javascript quick clarification richie so these are the frequent questions that people ask us about you know the interview process right not that we're like we're done talking about the interview questions so this is frequently questions of like someone's like hey all right i understand i saw these eight common questions and then they're gonna come with us to these questions so sorry go ahead richie start for interrupting no no no another problem so we get this kind of questions in our community we have profit with joshua we have more than two thousand plus students and it's an amazing course even if even if you are like even if you are if you don't want to buy that course just go and uh check out that course uh just go and search and google clear programmer profit javascript just check out that course uh you'll find a lot of value from that as well and if you are if you have just signed up for uh if you just joined the live stream we have an amazing netflix clone free uh building netflix clone completely free training for you guys so that sign up it's in the description go ahead and click the link in the description sign up for that get your free completely free netflix clone training and we'll be showing you exactly how you can build a netflix clone build that clone learn that skills put that on your resume put that project on your resume and go for that job now let's focus on the question we get a lot of should i work unpaid if i have no experience i think for it it completely depends like i i think i have seen a lot of people who says that no no no there's always a value for your skills in the market i think when you are starting out when you have zero experience and uh when you do not have uh when you're just starting out i would say work for free that doesn't matter because i think when even when i was talking with nas when he graduated from his high school he was working with a sarah for free and i think that's not a bad thing what's your take on that yeah i mean i worked a lot for free because in the beginning i didn't have the experience and i wanted to get the experience so i was willing to put in the time i was willing to put in the effort the blood the sweat the tears all of those things absolutely for free but that allowed me to start to build momentum that allowed me to start to build experience then once i actually had those skills i could charge people whether that was through job or freelancing or whatever that can be yes and so now if you're talking about this when you're working when you're a beginner when you're just starting out and the reason why i can be the perfect person to advise you because i started two years back and i know this even when you're a beginner and when you're starting out like you should work for free because at that point you don't want to work for money you want to work for knowledge in exchange of you want to work there in exchange of knowledge and skills now i think the one advice i would on my end and i have i have been a big fan of tom billow and uh i have this is something he says that like one advice he would or probably even i would give to someone who is just starting out is that like if you're starting out just find the find the find a person you aspire you you inspire you get inspired from that person and who is your idol like if you want to be like someone find it out whom you can contact go to that person tell them that i will work for you for three months or probably two months and i promise you that i will be the best person that you will have ever came across even if i'm working for free and i promise that i will never let you down even if i'm working for free and at the end of that two or three months if you feel that if you want to pay me we are good i will be a team member and if you feel that if you if you don't want to pay me we shake hands but in exchange we share knowledge and connections right daniel and i think that is one of the most important thing and that is the reason you want to work for free for knowledge and connections and connections matters a lot right daniel exactly once you build that skill you could definitely say no and start charging and making sure that you're getting paid so with that being said let's go to the second question we get which is does reference matters what are your thoughts richie completely i think um 90 percent or maybe like not 90 that's a huge skill that i just said maybe 70 to 80 percent of the job that people get it's because of the reference that's what i believe like even though they have the posting on those websites excuse me so the reference matters a lot because even when i'm trying out like if i have a friend if i know a person sorry who is working in that company i would just reach out to that person and i would be like hey bro like hey daniel i see that you're working in blue origin and i was wondering that i have i have been doing a couple of stuff in the past and i can send you my resume and i would be i would really appreciate if if you can get me an interview in blue origin and but at the same time you need to show danielle that why you are responsible because if daniel is taking the responsibility of mine to get me an interview he wants to make sure that i am a smart person so you want to show that person and i think and that is reference matters a lot and reference will will get you a lot of interest now one tip what you can do with reference like if you don't have reference if you want to build up like that is something i i learned from nas is that like uh if you are in that city like let's say that in usa you are in new york and you studied from uh uh the new york state university or whatever nyu uh so you want what you want to do is that you want to go to linkedin you you first of all you guys need to have a good linkedin profile strong linkedin profile so you want to go to linkedin and if you don't have connections just like if you and in new york if you have the headquarters let's say for example for a company and you want to apply to that company go to linkedin and there are filters so what you want to do is go to filter and select nyu and that company in that filter now linkedin is going to show you all the people from your college and from uh that come who are working in that company now what you can do is like reach out to at least five five people that hey bro uh i was in your comp uh i was in your college i we i graduated from uh the same college you graduated and i would really appreciate you if you can help me on few things that i'm looking for a job and i think out of five people at least two people would be happy to help you what's what's your take daniel yeah exactly and the reason uh richie's saying that is because in the end it's not about what you know it's about who you know when you start to network with people when you start to connect with the right people you are going to have the right references to land the right job so again it's not about what you know it's about who you know and maybe you're not happy with that but too bad that's the reality of life if there's two people that you know have the same skills but one of them has a reference in that company the other one doesn't honestly don't want the reference is going to get the job because they already understand or at least one person inside the company or understands how the other person works or they already have that like he said he takes that responsibility of taking it upon himself to help that person get that interview so it's absolutely important to understand who you know and references do matter is there anything else you want to add to this one yeah and when yes yes yes definitely and i think one thing that i would add is that when you are getting a job because of a reference let's say i get in get into blue origin uh because of daniel then if i if i get a job i don't want to let daniel down i don't want to quit the job in one week then it's going to create a very negative impression on daniel i don't want to be like a jerk who don't work who don't submit everything on deadline i because if i i have been referred by daniel it's his responsibility for probably not directly but indirectly it's his responsibility so when you join a job because of someone make sure you don't let them down exactly exactly so if you get the reference don't let them down now the next faq should i lie in my interview and here we got the classic friends joey saying don't you lie to me all right why should they not lie to me richie i think this is pretty obvious but go ahead and tell them why they should not lie because i uh hiding managers are trained of catching lives uh they see in your eyes they're gonna have like even when you're talking to hiding man just see them in in their eyes and they're like they're like so good at catching the lies like if you're gonna say that i'm perfect they'll just catch it and it's just basic questions that they'll like catch your lies in seconds i'm not saying that you should uh completely not lie you might want to hide few things that you don't want to show them that is not relevant but you should never lie in your interview if you don't know some skills like let's say if you don't know uh bootstrap and react just be honest that uh there is one thing that i do not know from the skills but i'm eager to learn because everyone knows over here that like probably if i own a company or probably if someone even just think about that if you own a company if you're looking for a job would you expect that person to be perfect no because no one can be perfect so do not ever lie in your interview never ever do that try to hide few things that are not relevant but that's not same thing as lying yeah it's not even hiding just just don't talk about what you do but no no it's it's all the clear don't lie be honest be transparent nobody likes liars if you lie get the out of here next question what if i mess up in my interview oh man richie i went to my interview i screwed it up i feel bad about myself blah blah blah blah blah poor me what are you gonna tell this person richie when they ask you this question i think uh it's it's this person was me when i started because like when i got when i said when i got some rejections from my interviews and i feel like what then they asked me like some questions and then i mess up and then i block out and then when i messed up i'm like when i closed when i'm done with it i'm like holy what the hell like what kind of person i am to answer a question like that that i'm perfect i don't have any weakness and it's like if you mess up in any in your interviews that is okay because you go through several interviews to land that one job it's okay like you but the key thing is that you learn from every single interview you learn from like if you if you make a mistake uh in that interview and if you keep on repeating that mistake then you are not growing then you should care then you should worry about that but if you just make a when you're a beginner and when you when you mess up in terms that's completely okay no one cares like okay what's the worst case scenario and uh they won't hire you that's okay like i mean still there are hundreds and thousands of jobs waiting for you so don't worry about that just keep your high hopes and but write it down from write it down in a piece of paper that what mistakes you made in that interview now once you have the list of the mistakes work on that mistakes and that's how you kill that next interview you go for in the first interview you make like four mistakes you write in a piece of paper and you try you try to improve that you go to the next interview out of four in the next interview make only two mistakes in the next winter you make one and there will be one interview that will be perfect and then you'll start just killing out so don't worry if you mess up in the interviews that's completely okay you're a human exactly exactly so if you ask us what if i mess up in my interviews i'm gonna say good learn from it don't do it again next question all right what is a super trick to write those big and impressive words on your resume so that when the person reviewing the resume the person interviewing you is going to have this exact same face of shock and amazement and they're going to want to hire you right on the spot richie what we got for them i think this is like a trick that i'm not sure i have seen this post i won't take the credit for this i have seen this post on uh instagram or linkedin by some guy and that guy has a very good trick because like when you're beginning like when i when i started my career like when i had to write that resume i was like holy like when i asked for people like nas and you and that can you guys send me a resume and when i see your resume like nasa's resume and i'm like holy how does this guy have this much of vocabulary like those words are amazing like reduce the productivity by 80 percent uh and reduce the errors and stuff like that like those big questions so how do you write those big impressive words in your resume when you're starting out it's so hard when you're beginning you don't know so go ahead daniel next to the next screen and i will explain them how they can do that go ahead richie so the first thing you want to do is like go to google go to dr google and search for the top 10 jobs from those big companies for the specific position you're looking for let's say you're looking for web developer or let's say you're looking for software developer position so go to google and search for software developer in facebook now you go to the facebook page you go through the descriptions and you figure out like don't just go to facebook go to tesla go to microsoft go to google different kinds of those big companies that have posting go to that join 10 jobs for software developer now read the description the second thing you want to do is first thing is search photos job second thing is read the descriptions and find out 15 to 20 impressive words from those description you can definitely find out more than that but i'm just going to say 15 to 20 those have that impressive words because they always because this company always this kind of big companies they always focus on marketing good so they will always have that clean fancy words on their description so pick out 15 to 20 impressive words paste that in a google document and use now use those in your resume now when you're using that don't forcefully use that just try to figure out a sentence where you can use that just you don't want to use a word that's just um uh that's just not relevant at that time in your resume so make sure you also use third words which are relevant so out of 15 to 20 even if you use like five to ten that's okay so what's what's your take like what do you think about district daniel yeah no that is an amazing thing to start to do and up your resume game basically right because you want to make sure that you know you're not just writing at a first grade level with like like talking like donald trump or whatever right you want to make sure that you can properly communicate your ideas through words through text and when they see the resume they can get an understanding so i think these are some amazing great tips so super trick to land jobs 10 times faster is there anything you want to say before i go into the super trick richie in the next slide no no no no it's gonna be a very good day for you guys to make sure you take notes of this kind of tips but let's go to the next slide bro do it go ahead okay awesome so yep uh awesome it's just uh the last slide for me okay it's gonna be some lag because of youtube but sorry no no it's fine now i think it's just it might be the lag or something but uh yeah so uh first thing you wanna do is that read the description of that job 10 times now the reason why i'm saying this is this trick that uh i i was just uh i went to toronto to one of my relatives and he is a senior software developer and he also sits with a hiring manager when they're hiring developers when they're hiring junior developers because he also lead a team and he knows like what kind of developers they want so he told me this trick because he also sits with those hiring managers when they're entering people so this is the trick first of all read the description of that job ten times even if it takes four hours or even if it takes five hours that's okay it won't probably take four hours it would take probably one hour but read the description of that job ten times like figure out what kind of person they are looking for like what kind of exact person they are looking for second thing is figure out the code relation between you and that jobs responsibilities now you this is very important when you figure out a direct connection between you and that job then 90 chance that you will get the job for sure because you have a reason uh that they should hire you because you are directly connected to that job the third thing that is use those and make a resume and cv that has exactly all the qualities required for that job now the first thing is when you when you read the description you figure out that what kind of person what kind of uh what are the requirements of that job and then based on those recommend you make a resume which makes you an ideal candidate for that job like you have all the skills that are listed or probably if you know all the skills put down all the skills if you don't know all the skill uh maybe uh just don't put that skill but let's say let's say 90 of the skill and uh if they're looking for a web developer you have all the projects on your resume that consists of all the websites you made and and then apply for that job so then if you have a perfect resume and cv and that that and there's a human connection right they will feel that okay i see his description in his uh cover letter and i feel that this guy would be ideal candidate for this job so these are the four steps you want to do with the job description figure out the correlation between you and that uh that job use that to make a resume in cv and then apply for that job and i swear that this will help you to get that job like 10x faster than a normal uh normally because you just probably what all people would do is that they would just use the same resume and apply to like hundreds of jobs right daniel what's your take hold on bless you thank you yes i agree if you do these four steps you're gonna stand out because no one else is doing these things like if you are the one guy out of 100 people who does this you're going to stand out you're going to get the job you're going to get the interview if you do these things that we talked about you're going to crush that interview and you're going to land your job as a developer freelancer or working in corporate america whatever that may be so do these four steps take another screenshot go you know go through this whole thing again to know exactly what you need to answer for every single thing so give them that tip in this last part richie yep awesome sorry so the tip is that uh this is a great tip that i realize so if you are all so always always have a local address if you are applying to a different city or province so let's say that uh i live in uh in canada i live in ottawa and i want to apply for a job in vancouver and so what happens is that uh when you send out their resume you probably have an address that you live right now so i would probably have an address that i live right now that is uh for ottawa and when i apply to that job they would first consider a person who is in vancouver so what you want to do is that figure out uh figure out if you have a connection in vancouver and uh tell them that hey bro i just want to use your address on my resume now this is not a bad thing that's completely okay because they personal most of the times they hire local people because that that has happened to me like applied to a job in category and then uh those people would really like my resume they had an injury but they told me that they are looking for someone who is local over here because then i also told them that i can move but still it's not gonna work out so they always gonna want someone who is local so this is a very good team always always always use the local address of that city or province you are applying for awesome so that's the tip and that's the last tip we wanted to give you and i think uh one note you can take from here yeah you can take from the here is that different job requires different resume and cv like you cannot just apply with the same resume in cv for every job if it's like a react job you can you would have to show some react skills and react project if it's a javascript then you would have to show javascript plain javascript but it requires different resume a different cv for every job don't use the same ones make some changes to that so i think uh that is all from me and daniel we created this presentation for you guys and i hope you guys enjoyed the top eight common questions and i i think now you guys have a better understanding of uh what uh understanding how you can answer those questions in a better way and it's okay if you have joined right now if you have missed it just go back and start screenshoting those answers write down in a piece of paper practice it but make sure that when you're answering those they should not feel that you are just like uh reading a written text be natural when you're answering that pre get prepared for that obviously uh uh but don't be 100 natural don't be uh someone who just read something that is written in a piece of paper so you also want to make sure about that so i hope you enjoyed that and i think uh if you uh we we would take some questions at this point so guys if you have like any questions uh please drop it in the comments and before you are dropping it uh i just want to say that the people who have joined right now um we have organized a free netflix clone training for you that's completely free go sign up the link is in the description and it's completely free get that project on your portfolio so i think one question daniel uh i got i i realized that uh that i we need to answer is that there was a guy who asked like it was couple of times back that a person asked that uh do you need a degree to get a job in web developer what's your take daniel you do not need a degree to get a job as a web developer what you need is experience so sometimes a degree can get you some experience but other times going to clever programmer and building a netflix clone could get you the experience you need to be able to land your first job so you do not need a degree a degree might help be helpful for some people depending on your situation if you're not one of those people that can go out there and learn by yourself or if you're not willing to you know put the time in with clever programmer to learn the right applications and it might be worth going to school so that someone could tell you how to do it and what to do but even then that's not guaranteed because in the end what's guaranteed is experience so even if you go to school and go get your degree make sure you're getting that experience make sure you're building out the portfolio make sure you're building out projects and getting your hands dirty so that you actually show your problem solver is there anything you want to add to that richie awesome so uh i think no that's a very good explanation i don't think that you need a degree to get a job in web developer because i think most of the successful developers are selfeducated so i don't think you need that i think another question another important question we have from here is from nikhil nikhil satis he says that what is a role of a portfolio website for a developer i think it's mandatory nowadays uh i think even a lot of people have started asking like when you go and apply for a job for jobs in north america uh most of the companies have started asking for a link that is for about your portfolio because the reason why they ask this because you cannot show them everything on a resume you cannot have a 10 page resume explaining everything you do right you can have only one page resume and a cover letter and then you link them to portfolio that shows all your projects that you have done in previous that shows all other stuff like whatever you want to show them but i think it's very mandatory right now and uh that will also make you stand out from a lot of people so i think it's mandatory right now so yep uh i think uh if you guys have more questions uh so there is one guy who asked that is it important to have a degree of engineer uh for computer science so as as daniel said that it's not necessary it's all about experience so get your experience like start building those projects like my advice if you're a beginner my advice would be like if if you don't have a degree and if you're a beginner my advice would be like start investing in yourself with those ten dollars or fifteen dollars instead of going into that ten dollars or fifteen dollars courses start investing in yourself like if the more you invest like i understand like if you don't wanna go for that like even if it's like start hiring a mentor even if it's not me even if it's not anybody but not now start hiring mentors and if you have that budget go sign up for a profit with javascript course and and even if you don't want to buy that course there are going to be a lot of free resources like just stay tuned with clear programmer we are providing some value bombs we are building some amazing clones so uh you can definitely learn from that but the key point is keep on learning and keep on having that uh practical experience instead of just going to the theoretical experience and also work for free even if you have to like in the beginning exactly that's how you can get that experience see we have another question which is how to connect with people in linkedin out of 100 people only 10 respond so richie gave a great tip which nas gave him which is find people who have gone to your university and then request friendship from them because usually because there's that connection of hey we went to the same school and they work at some spot that i want to work on they're more than likely to say yes but you can start to get creative don't just spam everyone be creative ask for people that happen to be in the company want to work at or ask for people that have that same common uh work experience or school experience or whatever that may be is there anything else you want to add to that richie no no for sure 100 so i think yeah yeah go for it awesome yeah so i think there is a guy who says that uh what projects do you recommend for a backend developer i would say that for a weekend developer do projects that are that we are building right now with uh sunny we also built an amazon clone and we will be soon releasing an amazon clone whole big tutorial uh and there are a lot of things that you can do but even if you're a backend developer try to even if you're backing up front end doesn't matter when you when you applying for a job don't have that projects like uh calculator and a small website and stuff like that i think it's good i'm not saying that you should not build that it's good when you're learning but don't expect a job based on those projects how does real projects like amazon clone if it's spotify clone or something like that and even in amazon clone we have built the whole uh back end and front end where we had the challenge so build projects like that instead of just having those small projects it doesn't matter what projects you build exactly i'm just looking for another job so there's a guy uh atishai jane he says that from where can i start the freelancer job so there are different platforms that you can go to start your freelancer so i first thing i would recommend is that uh do not go to upwork because it is something that you want to transition after you are professional first go with freelancer.com and maybe if you if you want to go with fiverr fiverr is a great website as well it's picking up right now so uh you can go with fiverr as well and it's freelancer.com but even when you're when you're freelancing you need to learn a lot of stuff just make sure that the initial two or three months is gonna be hard because uh you don't know how to reach out to clients you don't know how to bid on projects so it's gonna be hard but make sure to invest and learn all those stuff once you learn it it's gonna be like this any other questions richie or is that it so uh yeah so nikhil has uh another question as well that uh you did talk about a local address now how do i actually show a local address like of course i'm gonna just relocate there based on getting the job or not how do i show a local address so probably and there was a guy even uh he said that you guys said that you should not lie in uh in your interview and uh you are saying that you should add a local address so that's that's probably like so it is not lying we did not say it is not like you're you're putting up a local address you it's not like you're probably gonna move there so it's not lying it's completely okay it's gonna increase your chances it's just that you're putting up address and then nickel answering your questions uh just find out someone who lives in that city probably you can definitely find out someone who can live who lives in that city so i think that's how you can do that uh yeah i don't think there's another way you can do it and honestly if you can't then there's no big deal just put your address and then you know i mean you just don't get that extra advantage of if that company happens to be looking for someone local but if you look if you try to apply for big tech they don't give a what city you live in right i mean that's only more like a local little company so don't even stress about it i mean if you can find someone and they're comfortable with it sure go ahead and do it if not then who cares like it's not a big issue it's just a little extra tip and then in terms of again the point about lang if i mean if you're not going to relocate then yeah that's i mean then don't do that right but if you're willing to relocate then you can just go ahead and do that like there's there's really no harm because you're just putting yourself that extra little advantage that that it's like if they search locally you get they're gonna look they're gonna find your portfolio yep yep and uh there is a guy priyanshu sheriff i believe he's uh he's in pwg as well and he says that he's asking that which is the best platform for tutoring so uh for i think i believe that what he's asking that what is the best platform from where he can start teaching people i think there are a lot of a lot of platforms where you can start tutoring but uh personally i think that uh there are a lot of website but personally what you can do is that you can reach out to people on facebook just go to just find in the search bar just go to like just type html css and javascript if that is what you want to teach go to those group those groups make sure those groups don't allow promotion so go to those groups figure out what people are looking for those tutors like they're not going to be direct that i'm looking for a tutor they're gonna be like uh i want to learn html css what are the best resources they might ask questions like this so reach out to them personally do not comment on that or something like that or maybe even if comment on that and help them out and then when you provide them on value reach out to them personally direct message them and have a marketing message something like hey if you are facing problems with building website with html css javascript i can help you but first like provide them a free call and if they feel that it's valuable then they would take uh uh call tutoring with you but i think that is something that i know and i have used in past but there are i believe there are a couple of websites that also does that so if you if you think that you want to do that on high scale go for it i think in the one video kazi also talks about those tutoring uh uh websites and i think it's it's with uh sunny that he talks about i'm not just sure what do is that cool i think so uh the last question we can answer is that asuria saxena she says that uh algorithm and data structures knowledge is necessary to correct coding interviews what what do you say daniel on that it depends on who you're interviewing with you're going to interview with big tech like google microsoft and all those things yes you do need to know the big technical algorithm type interviews because that's gonna be a big part but very often if you're just gonna interview at a local company sometimes they really don't even ask that they just care about the stuff that we talked about today which is showing your experience making sure that you're a nice person to talk with that you're gonna fight well with the team and they're gonna love working with you and they might not even ask you a single algorithm question so reality depends where you want to apply to and where you're trying to get some jobs yep and just to add to that i had one of my friends she was my classmate and one thing that fascinated me was she got a job as a web developer and in toronto and that person that company is a transportation company that company didn't even ask her a single technical question it was just a soft skill and at that point i was not able to believe i was like how the hell they like they don't even know their technical ability so sometimes like when you are starting out they don't care a lot about technical skills because you know that they know that if you're graduating uh if you graduated uh and if if you are here and if you have the skills listed you know a lot of stuff if you have that portfolio and if there if if you lack on some stuff they have the people to train you right so sometimes they would not even consider or bother having their technical interview if you are really good in those soft skills into you exactly exactly cool man so awesome so i think yeah i
