so firebase is a suite of tools by Google and it allows you to do a bunch of clever things so you can host your website you can have a database you can have authentication in the previous session we did a bunch of authentication stuff so that'd be cool if anyone's interested in that to go check pal but here you just want to have a gmail account log in and click on add project and once it once we click on our project you just need to give it a name so in this case we'll go ahead and call it internet and Netflix Club there we go Netflix go awesome and this you can enable or disable based on if you want Google and links there we go nice so now we're setting up our backend so right now for today what we're gonna be using firebase for is for the deployment of the app so that we can actually host it so when you guys were actually checking out the link that we had previously which was this one so you can see it on the screen so the one that I'm highlighting at the moment on the code panel that link is actually a real link so that's a real link that's been deployed and we used firebase to do that which is really really powerful and it allows you to pretty much get the app up and running and live this really really quick so yeah nice let's go ahead and click continue mmhmm and now we're gonna do is if you just tap that little web icon at the top I will and just to be very clear we're now set setting up set up firebase hosting right yep so now exactly now we're setting up firebase hosting keep going Netflix climate everything that we've done and then you want to take that little box yep okay so let's register okay so the next step where it says add firebase SDK we don't need to worry about that because we're using node modules but this step you do need so you're going to go ahead and copy that and then go to your terminal so I think this open up a new terminal and do that command yeah so you just simply enter that command I think it might not work so if it doesn't work you might have to add a sudo whenever you install something we've G you need to actually have admin rights you need to write a sudo and sudo basically gives you admin right which is why I asked for your password and then you pretty much run that command and everything should work as it as it needs to now guys will be we will be moving on to deploying to firebase a little bit hosting our app online so yeah let's go ahead and I think we don't actually even need to go into firebase con so at this point we set things up idea yeah have enough yeah we can go into our terminal yeah we can pretty much set up a terminal and in this console most people if you haven't done it you're gonna have to just run firebase login so in our case firebase no yeah so we're gonna log out to show you guys to run a come on to say firebase login and that will pretty much so Devon gray said is there some fancy CDC I get related set up for the point to five ways so actually it's super teen and you're gonna see it right now all you have to do is 5/8 login is the first step and then what we need to do is pretty much go ahead and go to the terminal and do firebase in it alright so this is the bit that we have to be quite careful about guys we have to make sure we do it very carefully and correctly so let's go down to hosting and let's go enter let's get use an existing project and you want to make sure you find the right one so netflix clone there we go and here you need to make sure you type in build yeah it has to be built for react guys you know so you make sure that that is built not and you don't just spam the Enter key because this is really important configuration yeah I always find myself spell spamming the Enter key so that's important build right over here guys pay attention yeah so make sure that's build and then what you want to do is for the next step you need to configure it as a single page app so you're gonna put why that's another important things to put yeah that's a let me actually just in case it's not visible they're just but why yeah and hit enter yeah exactly and then and and then that's it so that's what the configuration done and now we have two things on most people actually end up deploying it but they see this default firebase page and that's because you need to run npm run build you just open up the directory Kazi and we can show everyone what it's actually gonna do so they open up build say you see so right now the build is empty as like a indexation amount okay okay cool yeah so it's empty you'll get to this point and it'll just have some one file in it which is nothing so at this point you want to do NPM run build and you will see what will happen once we actually type that command in as this will start to build out right here yeah and what we need to is well what this is doing guys it builds a production ready build of your react bundle so like your react app is basically stripping out the developer stuff like the hot reloading all the expensive sort of stuff that takes up a lot of space and stuff like we don't need that in the actual production build so when it goes online we just need to be as lightweight as possible all right we need to be a long way and just quick as possible so that's it so everything goes into that build folder and then we set up firebase to deploy it from that build folder so I think I think we can we can get ready for this big big big release now as we can say fine here we go guys are you guys ready for this we're about to deploy this app online and all the hard work that we have done up until now is gonna pay off and you are gonna get access to this app and you will be able to actually use it right now all right let's check it out I'm gonna hit enter vamos we're getting let's go in all kinds of languages that's what I'm talking about Laura and John is deploying its deploy it and hold on I think it just deployed let's go alright let me click this now hopefully does your ass in the link oh there it is guys that's what we just built my side drop the end the chat go check you out guys let us know in the comments what you think and give it a resize try and break it you know play around with it you
