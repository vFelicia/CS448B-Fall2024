and we are live what's up you guys how is it going let's wait a tiny bit while everybody's jumping on and i just put some sort of background music all over the place because why not and all right as you're coming in just drop a message in the chat uh let me know if everything is okay and we should be good in a bit oh okay okay that was loud all right what's up y'all nice dope amazing welcome in the house and we can just sort of get started all right okay we're gonna be doing some sort of music in here and with that said we should be getting started in just a second okay all right hey okay hi i'm the somali guy okay that's amazing we were on a call today dope all right how are you i'm doing great how are you doing hello hello everybody welcome on this stream welcome everybody hope you guys guys are doing amazing and we are 90 people live so i just want to grab the attention of everybody what's up you guys it's david here from coverprogrammer.com and today we are going to be building the google drive clone so i just want you guys to take a quick look at what's gonna what we are gonna be building right here right now and this is actually the working google drive once again this is something that you guys asked in a uh form which is by the way down below in the description you so you guys nope this is a 100 live black ops 2 20 000 i think yeah so yep this is 100 live um and this is act this stream is actually something that you guys asked i got a message uh by one of you and so that's why i created this so today we are actually going to be building this very google drive that you can see here using react.js and firebase so we can actually like we could actually say that normally for a free google uh account you get 15 gigs of storage now you as a developer you can pretty much create a new one which is going to be add adding an additional five gigabytes okay so that's that's an unfair advantage for developers but whatever okay uh okay so i got this question should i code along yes please code along that's the uh that's the most but in case um because i'll be going a bit fast but in case uh you you can't uh can stay like you're not fast enough how do you say that um whatever i'll be dropping down a github link down below in the description once i finish this live i'll just push it to github and you guys can go ahead clone it and then just play around with it um what's up florida i'm gonna watch it when you're done okay sounds good all right with that said let's get straight into it so what i actually went ahead and done already is in this terminal uh i've already done the npx create react app uh part of things i missed a dash over there but that's not a problem so uh i've already done that and because i'm using yarn i am super fast with this so i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead and installs yarn and by the way just uh quickly a massive massive shout out to amano we are actually on a call and he's going to shout in if uh something's up with the stream so yes and yeah exactly just how pronounced says npx create react app google drive clone that's it and while we are actually there uh it's actually a good idea to go to firebase right away and let's just get get that set up uh in the meantime okay so now it is time to follow me if i'm a bit too fast not a problem this is recorded this is going to be once again massive shout out to kyle our amazing editor uh he's going to chop this up and we'll make a shorter version of this vera video so you guys can go ahead and just quickly run through the whole thing so with that said um i'm gonna go go into my firebase console create a brand new project which i will call uh google drive clone live i don't need google analytics so i will be turning that off and yes we are going to be using database and oh the auth egypt says hello what's up egypt how's it going and yep so it's finishing up we got the project up and running and okay we got 120 people live that's amazing guys so if you guys aren't uh pumped about this build because i'm sure i because i sure am make sure to smash that like button for that youtube algorithm and just make sure that it looks blue okay so that's something super important that actually helps you become a better developer i'm joking um all right so in here because we have already the project we're just gonna add a new application uh we can just call it like i don't know google drive and whatever you can also go ahead and set up firebase hosting in this video i'm not going to mess around with that um because i just want to get this done fast and so you guys can uh have the most value in the shortest time what's up peru and how much knowledge does it l uh how much knowledge of react does it require actually not a lot okay so don't worry about that um just go ahead try to follow up and you will see where it gets problem problematic all right so we will need two things here to do uh right away one of them being is going into authentication and we will just need to go ahead and turn that on so we will be using we were just hitting on get started and we will be using google authentication so i'm just going to turn it on configure it so that's going to be my email then what's up uzbekistan hi nigeria what's good and yes we will be using firestore oh yeah actually we then we need to do three stuff bang amanda's got the point that's what's up all right okay let's continue so in the cloud file store i'm just gonna go ahead create database i will start it in test mode so make sure you know that uh and us central is amazing so oops i click i click that of it so next us central and enable so what's up ron ed welcome to this channel i see you are new uh i'm super pumped that you're here make sure to check around in the channel because we have a ton of tutorial already and we have a ton more coming up i personally have like 20 just i could uh tell you on top of my head so make sure to stick around and why come on welcome to the channel all right so that's it for our firestore for now and let's go into project settings and copy that config file from there before we do anything else so make sure to just copy that and and yep hey what that's amazing front end you just subbed amazing all right so uh okay what we will do is because i already done or i've already done this uh so what i've done here is i created a new folder and said ntpx create react app space dot so that actually went ahead and created a brand new react application for me okay so i just have have it done and because i'm using yarn and i highly recommend you do that too uh it was super super fast uh yes sketch wearers you can you can learn a ton of useful skills from here uh even if you are a complete beginner uh i am trying to i'm trying to keep it as beginner friendly as possible and help you guys with as much stuff as possible so make sure to stick around and try your best doing the whole thing okay you might get stuck and that's 100 okay can i hack nozzle with html if you try hard enough yes you can so going back into our vs code i think i'll zoom in a little just so you guys can see everything perfectly in there and i might move around a few different windows on my other screen uh hi kyle i'm new here and i hope i learned something new you will definitely learn a ton of new stuff all right and i just made the music a little bit louder so you guys can hear it too and okay so what i will be doing here is i'm going into source folder all right and going into app.js now there is a ton of unnecessary stuff so if i go back in here start a new terminal in that same folder and just hit yarn start that will go ahead and open up the react app that i just created in this folder or in this browser window hopefully oh yeah i need to okay because i have something running on 3000 i have to open it in 3001 there we go so wait just a little bit or for it to low uh load and nope i am not going to use the redux today but i have a ton of stuff coming up that uh will use redux so yes i actually what watch the one hour of the new 2021 python tutorial that is amazing guys if you are interested in learning uh python and ai then definitely make sure to check that video out yes oh my god thanks bro all right so with that said let's continue uh so i have this basic react app right over here i'm not going to be able to work with this too much so i'm just going to go ahead and delete everything inside of here and this extension is dying okay so i'm not going to use the logo anymore uh but notice that i keep the app css import over there next up i'm going to delete all the test files so app.test.js and setuptests.js is going to be deleted and how do i go about learning react from scratch you can learn it here if you know a little bit of html css and javascript this is the perfect place for you to start and i will also delete the logo.svg file going into the app.css file i will just delete everything that way i am just getting rid of all the styling what's up liam i remember okay guys i just want to stop here for a little bit uh liam amanoth and i were actually on a clubhouse zoom or clubhouse room this morning 8 a.m pacific so guys if you're interested in that make sure to check out uh amanoth and myself on uh clubhouse and just give us a follow so you guys know that we go live there every single day you can ask us whatever you can just chat with us this is basically you just bring your coffee tea whatever you drink and then just get started and we just shoot the right so that's an amazing way for uh anybody to just reach out to us uh nope i do not have a youtube channel i only create content on this very youtube channel and how much time does it take to learn react from scratch not a lot um i mean the more more hours you put in the faster you will get all right back to the code i deleted everything from the app.css file so this is amaze that's amazing uh i pretty much reset my css right now and my styling and going back going to index.css file you guys can see it up here uh i will be just going ahead and add a star and a margin of zero that means uh everything is going to be shrinked to the side of the window oh i should i maybe should make this circle a little bigger um okay i'll play around with that all right github profile of course um i'm not sure whatever uh so let's continue so i added a margin 0 and if i go back to app.js and add a h1 and just say what's up clever programmer fam and a rocket okay i sh okay where's my rocket mog okay that's a rock is even better so if i go ahead uh hit a little bit of the refresh i actually don't need to because react has automated refresh uh no i am not using obs studio i'm using ecam it's actually a bit better all right so now as you can see everything is on the top left corner so that is amazing we have our css set up back to normal so that's something cool and let's just get started right so quickly uh what are we going to be doing here so let's just uh start with a little bit of outline over here so first thing first uh we will need to authenticate the user so we will definitely need to have some authentication up top authentication right there uh and inside of here what we actually want to show is in case the user is not authenticated right so not or no authentication then what we want is we just want them to log in uh that's just going to be a super simple just a google drive logo and a button to log in that's going to be all it now in case the user has already logged in so auth equals true then what we will do is we want to have a sidebar we want to have a files uh view and we want to have a side icons now let me show you what i mean by that okay so if i go back here uh we obviously have a header on the top so that's something i forgot to uh right there but we would just put it there and we will also so this is the sidebar that we have here this is some sort of the main area this is i called it the files view this has a two uh two things one of them is these file cards on the top and the list of the files and if i go ahead and do this that's actually the side icon so by the way if i haven't showed you like i can pretty much go ahead and let me just switch back to my face and find a good image okay so if if i have this image over here and i say choose to upload and i hit upload it's actually going to start and go ahead and start uploading so this guy this guy's this is functional okay and it should be somewhere around here so i i think this is it uh this might be yes that was the image that i just downloaded so guys this google drive is actually functional you can upload and you can download files with it so as real world as it gets all right so we got 176 people live that is amazing guys give yourselves a round of applause oh boy i don't even know where my music is okay all right that's it okay uh so with that let's actually jump back into the code uh one question i'm new to front and side please suggest me how should i go uh should i go with view or react to land the job as a force that guy at first i would 100 suggest going with react easier to learn better future proof and everybody is on react so if you have react on your portfolio or resume or something that is almost guaranteed having a job already by the way we have a ton of people who have landed a job like landed jobs as uh react developers inside of our course profit with javascript so that's something to keep an eye on because we had jen who had who doubled her salary we had uh frank who got a 100 almost 180k uh project we have devin who is now working at paypal so just something to keep in mind all right uh let's go back to the build so uh i forgot the header i'm just gonna add it here and not worry about that so actually we just we are going to uh get results with uh uh get started with the header okay so uh for that what we will do is we will actually go ahead and create a few different uh folders because otherwise it would get hectic so i'm just gonna go ahead and say i will have a styles folder that's where all the css will go i will of course have a components folder and inside of that components that's where i will have my header okay so if i just go ahead and actually add another folder that's going to be my header and inside of that header folder i will have an index.js file okay make sense and guys this is a point where i want everybody to stop for a second and go into the extensions bar search for es7 and get this this is the number one best friend that you will ever have as a developer this tool has saved me so much time and headache and all that stuff so guys now go ahead and download that okay with that done i'm just going to go ahead and type in rafce hit return and that's why it's my friend because i typed in four letters and it gave me 12 lines of code this is a full working react component by the way all right so for the header we will have a few different stuff going on we obviously have a logo on the left hand side so let's get started with that uh contacts or redox go with redux always redux always try to future proof for yourself okay hey what's up dark spot academy welcome to the stream amazing to have you here all right and with that said right now what we will do is i'm just gonna give it a class name so when i'm referring to this uh in the css file i will know what's going on so uh let's just add the header over here in here and inside of there i will have a header underscore logo as well as later on a header search container right and we obviously have we will obviously have a few different icons so if you guys take a look at what's going on in here okay i need to log in okay so this is how we log in okay i just showed oh you show you guys how i log into this one so i'm just gonna go ahead hit my yup and with that said so on the top on the top that's my logo then we have our search bar and we have these icons okay so this is three different uh pl pieces these are the three different pieces of the header all right uh i'm just gonna reorganize my windows dope and so that's what we are building out now so i'm just gonna say header icons boom so that's pretty much how we outline the header so let's actually go ahead and do that um so what i will one so what i want to do is i want to have an image tag in here and a span which is going to say drive okay so that's pretty much how this is built up okay so for this file i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead and search up google drive icon okay so if you just go and google it and go to the images you will want to select this icon okay the second one file colon google drive icon 2020.svg okay and you can just go ahead download it and work with that but because i have it downloaded i'm not going to waste too much time on that and i'm just going to grab this folder and put it in uh my source so i have this media folder right hear me out i have this media folder and i'm just gonna hit google drive icon and that's the file that i use okay so that's literally the one that i just showed you okay uh that being said though we can come back here and what i will do is i'm just gonna go ahead and import that google uh logo okay so the g drive logo is actually located in the media folder in as a the google drive logo.png okay all right who is actually with me just uh i don't know you can't show your hands but like just drop a yes in the chat if you are with me okay let me know where you guys at if i'm going too fast or what's going on let me know in the chat uh where are you guys at so yes yes okay amazing okay um dope that's good okay all right everybody okay dude i'm not i don't speak spanish bro amigo all right okay going back to the code then and what we will now do is because i have it imported i'm just gonna go ahead and copy and but guys by the way if you're not uh here with me don't worry i will put a github down below plus i have a faster um uh faster paced video of this very live uh soon up all right so and i'm just gonna put it in here between squiggly braces so that is actually gonna go ahead and import that and add it in there now i just uh opened up the app that i'm working so you would expect that i would have that logo in there but i don't the reason for that is i haven't actually imported it in here so what i will do is i'm just gonna go ahead and uh i'm just gonna add the header all right so let's just say header and close it now this is going to freak out now because i still haven't imported it i just added the tag right so that's not not how it works you need to import it so i'm just going to go ahead hit import say header and i'm i'm going to go ahead and say four and in there in the components folder in the header that's where i have it okay boom that's it and we have the drive and we have the logo so that's amazing uh i can see the code even 480. that's good all right so with that said we have a working header now let's go back and finish that up because it's by far not finished so for the logo part we're pretty much that's that's all what we will be doing um we only need an image and a span tag now for the rest um we will have a search bar right so let's take a look at how it would look like so we will obviously have a search bar in there in the search container because the containers actually strips out all the way let me just let me show you let me show you so as you can see in as in the normal google drive uh this is the search bar but the icons don't start all the way just on the right hand side so all this space is actually filled up with the pretty much nothing but that's where the container takes place because that's going to push everything to the sides and then have the uh search in there okay uh i mean that that's a good point that you just made i can change that like why not okay we let's actually do that real quick so if i go into public go into indexes html and go into here and i'm gonna say google drive clever programmer bank there we go that's a good one that's a good catch okay so that's a good catch all right so if you if you're into that you can go ahead and do the same um not really necessary but it's a good catch all right so inside of there we definitely want to have the uh header search bar uh as a separate div right make sense and in there we will have a few different things that we will need to add in we will need to have this search icon this uh i don't even know what this is yes it is the google tribe clone okay and what editor do i use i use vs code but with a fancy theme and for that to know which theme i'm using you will have to wait for another video and you will obviously need to add the search and drive text now for this this is where actually material ui comes in if you guys don't know what it is material ui is the design language of google so all this is actually using material ui and so material ui okay it's the design language of google and it has a bunch of icons uh what are amazing and we will just use those so going back to my browser uh what we will do is you can just go ahead and search up uh material ui icons and that will give it give all this stuff for us am i really crap yes i am thank you yes i am and you know who's clever who smashes those like buttons right all right going back here uh the first one is the one that we want to have yeah dr drop down that's a good good name okay uh so we definitely want to have the search which is going to be this so i just want to go ahead and save it and it's actually called expand more i think yeah expand more icons and those those are the two that you want to save now this isn't everything that we will be using because we have to go into the terminal and we will have to install a few different stuff so i would just type in yarn add at material dash ui core and this is not enough because we will need to install the material ui icons as well but those come after the course so make sure that you first install the core and then the icons all right so let's actually wait a little bit uh anu yoshi asks if he's late no you're not bro uh we already started but don't worry uh you can just continue where we left off or you can just go ahead and watch it uh but we will have a chopped up version of this video up in a few days or something uh but this is actually a good way that you can ask questions if you're here live and i can answer those so with that said i have installed all these stuff uh what are my advices for younger developers just start bro and just do it stick with it 14 hours a day you can do it all right uh is the search work or just design it's just a design for now but you can make it working like the the the reason why we do all these builds is that you can get these and understand what's going on and how to build these sort of stuff and then later on you can take this into your own projects and maybe if the client if you're a freelance developer wants to ha uh once they have the ability to upload files and then list them this is the app that you will use and you can you you already have an understanding of what's going on all right so actually we might as well just go ahead and build a search engine sometime all right in here we will just go ahead and uh add these two so the search icon and the expand more icon are going uh are gonna be coming in here and i will wrap this inside of the search search one boom and the expand more where is my expand more icon that's it um i messed it up okay i want this to be here and in between i want to have an input yes an input come on okay input type text and placeholder is going to be search in drive yes all right okay this is how you want to build it so inside of the search bar i will have the search icon the input box and the expand more icon okay um yes i do recommend yarn and no i don't have kobe 19. what's the kind of question bro uh so yes if you if you're debating between yarn and mpm just go with yarn that's more future proof that's newer uh not a lot of developers know about it but if you guys if you just like speed is everything and the art is faster that's it uh you will spend 20 uh plenty of times uh debugging so that's my take on that okay search icon we have all this stuff ready so we are pretty much the functional functionality of things are getting together so yeah there we have all these things now we want to go ahead and add those icons in there as well and this is where things are gonna get crazy uh because we will have a few different kind of uh i don't know styling going on here so what we will do is okay first let me actually show you what's happening in the original one is i actually cloned it from the real google drive so yeah but we have these two icons over here yes and a little space and this icon and that icon okay so that's how um um that that's that's just how google drive is okay so we will clone that we will add a little spacing in there but that's it so inside of the icons what we will do is we will add a span tag and in there we will have two icons and another icon and an image so the image tag will actually use the uh user photo that is actually logged in okay so if i were to go uh log out of the other one and then just log in with the with a new account that image would be showing up but uh that's gonna be used later so uh what's the name of the color theme used make sure to stick around for my ultimate 2021 top 10 extensions that will make you a better and more effective developer uh with these extensions video i'm still coming up with the name kinda uh that's where i will be releasing that all right so we will have a few different icons coming into play we will have the help outline the settings icon and the apps icon so these two are actually going in the span and we will have the apps icon coming right under again these are coming from materia ui and obviously we need to uh insta and import them okay so you can go ahead check those out and and yeah uh that's pretty much how it is built up uh okay so we have all these importation uh i don't want to spend too much time on it and yeah let's continue so why do i have two index.js because notice that i have the components and inside of components i have the header and this is the index.js file of the header component okay so that's actually a that's actually that will actually come into place when you will be building bigger projects than this one or like huge stuff and then you will thank me for putting showing you this kind of technique and organization of files all right let's go ahead check back to our application hello hamza uh okay so that's pretty much how it looks like for now don't worry about uh it it's kind of ugly but we will just go ahead and take care of it so if we go into our styles folder and just hit the header i think hold on a second yeah so if you're just gonna go ahead and add a new file called the header dot css and we're just gonna start adding in stuff so if i target the header and add a display of flex everything is going to be uh next to each other i will add a height of 60 pixels and a border bottom of one pixel solid i said solid and rgb 219 219 and 219. that is actually a nice little grayish tat um it's still okay i haven't imported it okay so one thing that as a react developer you don't want to miss out on is importing the style files otherwise your application is gonna look ugly even if you've created a css file so that's something you to keep an eye on i just made the mistakes uh so yeah that's something so what i will do is i'm just gonna go ahead and import the file using this line of code so it says import i will go up a folder into the components one and then go another one up into the source one and then go into styles and grab the header.css file so uh always use up the you can use app.css but then it's get uh super cluttered yeah um all right so now i should have that uh something happening okay so if i zoom in here a bit this is the display facts that everything is getting next to each other and i have this nice little border bottom uh 60 pixels below the top of the screen so i have this plant on my desk and it's on the way of my mike's boom arm so excuse this uh stuff uh if you mention i sorry about what's your ide it is vs code i am using vs code i am trying to move away from vs code because i hate it but this is the best it's a little crazy but that's what it is so going back to our header.css file uh i actually want to make sure that the width of this is a 100 view width and we are pretty much done styling the header as a whole uh thank you so much uh he uh that saying my content is useful i really appreciate your being here so that's uh that's amazing and i'm super glad that i can give you guys value so what i will do now is uh next up i will trigger all the divs inside of my header and i will just add a padding of 12 pixels and going down uh i will trigger my header logo and i will get a bit faster because this is gonna be the most boring part like this this is just not that right okay uh so my header logo i want that to be display of flex i want to justify the content to flex start and i want to align everything so align means that vertically i'm aligning everything to the center what's up clever programmer uh and we will align everything to the center so let's actually check out what i am doing here so i'm trying to fit that uh icon in the middle uh but for some reason it's still too big okay so we will just address that issue right now uh so what i will be doing is i will just uh target the header logo and inside of there remember we have this image tag okay so that is the logo uh i would just give it a height of a 100 percent so that will take up 100 of the parent's height okay so the parent is the header logo and the image is going to be as high as the header logo okay and i'm just gonna add something nice an object fit actually let's let let's just let let's just take a look at how it looks like now that's not not really good but i want to add in object fit contain and now everything is going to look much much nicer i'm just going to add a little bit of uh spacing in between otherwise it will look ugly so let's do that so inside of header logo i will have this pen uh which will have a color of gray okay and we will we will all also want to add a font size of 20 pixels right 20 pixels a font weight of 500 and a margin left of 16 pixels okay let's take a look at how it looks like now so much more like google drive okay so like just notice the differences like it's it's grayish it's uh it has those little bit of uh span in there so yeah like i said your css components with style components for example uh in this tutorial i am not using style components but i will have a few different tutorials but i will be using style components so i just want to diversify the content that we have here um so yeah for now i will be uh going with different uh css files all right let me actually drink a bit what's up ben burn is coming back all right so now that i have styled that drive logo uh let's move on to the search container okay so this is going to be the part that we are building out this over here so everything from there all the way here i hope you guys can see that all right going back i'm just gonna say uh dot header and search container and it will i will give it a flex of one display of flex and by the way the flexo one is actually going to stretch out all the way to both sides and it will just smash everything just like you smashing the like button but it will smash everything to the sides and yeah so that's why i do that and what i will be doing is i have made the tesla homepage that's very good thanks for teaching us amazing i'm super pumped that you've made that all right and so display of flex and next up i will align the items to the center so vertically i have everything to the center added and i'm adding a padding of eight pixels i turn the like button blue for the mirror coming back that's what i'm talking about guys be like ben smash the like button make sure it looks blue just like my background and make sure to smash it in an uneven numbers okay because otherwise if you smash it like two four six eight times it's actually going to end up being unsmashed and that's not the desired outcome okay all right enough of me talking about smashing the like button so uh amazing kyle i love uh i'm so pumped that you find it enjoyable awesome yes we will have a twitter clone that's an amazing one thank you so much uh why are you not using sass i will be using sas in other tutorials this one is plain css so search container and now moving on to the header search bar and it will have a width of 45 a height of 120 percent a border radius of 6 pixels and a background color of rgb and this is going to be 237 237 oh my god what did i mess up i messed something up hold on rgb once again two three seven boom two three seven boom two three seven two that's it okay now it's cool uh will you do view streams nope i'm not planning to do view streams but guys if you really want to i will do view streams why not but uh i actually don't recommend uh learning view it's just such a pain in the ass but whatever for you guys i'll do anything next up uh we will be aligning the items to the center in there as well so you might be asking why am i aligning everything to the center because i want everything to be in the center makes sense right and we will be we will be giving it a padding of zero and eight pixels now what's happening here uh on the top and the bottom i think that's the zero and on the right and the left that's going to be eight pixels i think that's how that's how it is yes yes yes and guys please make sure that only talk in english in the comments um because otherwise i will feel insecure and uh run away from here what about the discord clone we actually have one but i can't make it better if you want to inside of the uh like it's going to be a little bit of global but i want to set the color of these icons right over here to be great by the way let's take a look at how our app looks like kind of getting there right kind of getting there not ugly not that ugly as it was okay we have this nice little background area and and we are getting there okay so now we're just gonna set the color of those svg icons and that actually has a specific uh class which is uh available at material ui icon documentation but it is the mui iconroot and i want to set the color of rgb828282 also what about a clone that hosts a website what do you mean like uh hostinger clone uh yeah okay so we just set those colors those just turned a little grayish i don't know if you guys can see it i just barely but yeah all right next up let's actually get rid of that ugly uh search thing or input while making it nice okay so advice to upcoming programmers do it bro put in the hours work for it and it will be amazing next up why isn't all right here we go so next up i will be uh targeting the header um search bar under sq uh and inside of there the input and it will have a flux of one a height of 60 percent a font size of 16 pixels a color of light gray and yes and a background of none because we want we just want to cancel that out like it's actually a bad bad thing that html inputs have those ugly background and it's a good way for you to learn how to remove all that ugliness oh we also want to cancel out all the borders and the margin left is going to be so margin left is gonna be 12 pixels let's take a look at how it looks like now okay nothing has changed so far something's up um yeah oh yeah i added this d there okay it was a typo it's always a typo okay we have that thing okay and for some reason the flex one not seem to be working but we will take a look at that it's important to put root yes it is important uh because otherwise it's not going to target that specific uh item okay so uh header folk header search bar and in what we will do is once again we will uh get that input but we want to get rid of that ugly blueish border once we focus in there so we were just gonna say outline it's gonna be none and a color of black because that's what the uh tags that we type in we want that so we want the text that we type in to be black okay and yeah so if i type in here it's going to be black amazing dope okay something's up all right whatever uh we will take care of that in a bit um okay so the header icons let's actually i'm gonna go ahead and do this okay yeah same okay there we go dope all right uh so next up we will move on to the header icons so header underscore icons and in there we will obviously have a this play of flex and a align items dot center and a margin right of third minus 30 pixels so that's good and once again we will target all those icons inside of there uh oh yeah i could have forgotten that that's a good catch uh so we will add a header icons and inside of there we want to target those mui svg icons actually i think that stands for material ui because that makes sense and going down font size we will give it a 28 pixels a color of 82 8282 just like how we had it so once again i think the autocomplete will give it to me yes that's it you want to be as efficient as possible as a developer guys who can follow me who is with me drop it in the comments drop it in the chat i want to know who is with me come don't say that come on yes i do all right and inside of there we will also want to add a margin of 4 pixels i just got here what's up omera hey let's go massive shout out to everybody who's was here and okay you guys are with me i'll make sure the mixing is gonna be better next time whatever all right uh we got the margin of four pixels that is amazing and going down a little bit uh we will have the header icons and inside of that we obviously have that span okay and that will have a margin right of 20 pixels and guys this is only for to make it look amazing um so i will be linking the github below uh you can take it in a bit i want the github clone okay uh you guys get we'll be able to take it after the stream a few hours i will just upload it and just put it in here so by tomorrow the latest buy tomorrow the link will be in the description make sure to come back check this video once again and again and again and just understand everything that's going to be happening in here all right dope next up uh we will have a header icons and we will tag target that image which will will give a border radius of 50 percent a height of 100 percent an object fit of contain and the margin left of five pixels taking a look at how we got it uh we still have a little bit of fixing to do i think i forgot some sort of uh display flex somewhere whatever let's take a look at it i i think i think i forget it here display of flex let's say let's take a look if it fixes my problems yes it does there we go so once we pass then once we actually set up the login over there there will be a icon from google that one okay boom okay let's let's actually use a dummy uh something that you guys can go ahead and use too uh i will be just i've actually have this on my clipboard right now and over here i'm just going to add this in here remove the comment boom and i will obviously need to import uh the use date you stay stay with me for a little second and i will explain what i'm doing right now so this is only for demonstration purposes you guys don't have to watch the uh watch this whole thing i'm just going to show you guys what i am about to what i've just set up and we will have a user image user photo user photo one second and showing what i've done uh user dot photo url bang and then copy this go here the structure boom and and then add that here boom all right so uh you see this icon here that's what i added just right now okay so quickly what i've done here uh i actually built this project earlier and i have a snippet of code that contains a login data for my uh account so we will actually add the authentication at the very end because otherwise you will have to uh always keep signing in which actually slows you down and i don't want you to uh you don't want to do that so for that i just added that icon here so i can show you what's going what's going on and what's happening over there and why did i do all the styling that i did now and we will add the styling later on so don't worry about that we will get there just soon enough okay yes i will reveal my code themes and fonts inside in one of my next videos uh want to learning rjs help learning i'm a php developer um just stay here on this channel we pretty much give you a ton of stuff that you can learn from all right guys we are pretty much done with the header just saying uh this is amazing if you are here with me who actually has that head already because this is actually one dope looking header now we can go and continue on yes is the it's the full app yes it's the full app okay and uh we will now add the uh sidebar okay so for that i'm just creating a new folder and inside of that i will have a few different things happening obviously i will have any index.js file right dope and i just want to make sure that everything is imported so we will be importing it right away but first first i would just create a new component with r a f c e and for that and what's gonna happen here is that we will have a few different things happening i want to make everything a component because i i kind of want like uh i i want to break down every big problem to uh small little problems so we will have a component that will be the add new file button then we will have all these little bit little buttons right over here which are going to be brand new uh items okay so that's actually and actually if i hover over all these uh this have that nice little google drive effect you have done a youtube channel yes we have uh going back in here so what i will do is obviously i add a class name which is going to be side bar that's dope and this is where my new file component will go okay and yes i will share the project source code down below in the description check back later tomorrow uh later today or early tomorrow and i will have it there okay so next up we will have a sidebar i damns container boom and those will contain all the sidebar items so those are gonna be imported little uh components as well so now we will add a hr which is going which is actually stands for horizontal row line or something and we will have an other sidebar element in here so uh we're good there we have created the structure now let's go ahead and make those new files and all those stuff ready so first thing first uh what we definitely want to do is add a new file in here which is going to be the new file the new new file which is going to be in the new file oh it's funny uh so the new file is actually going to be another component just like the other and we will add a class name which is going to be new file and that's dope and that will have a new file conte trainer and so yeah that's good and we will add a plus icon in there i actually guys i don't know if it helps you but it definitely helps me a ton um if i just comment out what's happening in here uh just search me up on whatever social media technology android apps uh if you want to communicate me just literally search me up and that will be it yeah and we will obviously have a text of new that's it now this will actually pop up a model in a little bit of later pro please explain where to store the client input data uh we will be storing that in a i'm not exactly sure what you mean but if it's the files we will be uploading those to firebase we will get started with that soon enough um we are actually using firebase okay let's go ahead and continue so that's kind of how it will look like but let's go back to the material ui and what we will have is we want to grab a something called the add icon and that's what we will be adding uh in there okay so we will have the add icon boom so that's good and that's what we will have here so that's pretty much a plus icon we just need to import all these stuff so so we will say new uh oops a new a file yes it auto imports it as you can see on line number two and i'm not sure if i've imported sidebar but i guess i haven't so i'm just gonna say import sidebar from dot slash component slash sidebar which is dope because now i can add the sidebar under here and for now i'm just gonna be uh at oops like that so for now i'm just gonna be adding those there so we can just uh mess around with all that stuff and once we add the uh authentication we will be finishing things up and making them looking nice uh and we would have the we will have the ability to um we will add the ability to sign in and then different stuff will be showing up so for uh for here we will have a start step we will have a sidebar items or sidebar sidebar item.js file which is obviously going to be another um component and yeah that's pretty much how it will be so rafce once again dope and we will be adding a class name of sidebar item like this okay and it will contain a sidebar so sometimes okay so if you actually go to the normal google drive some of these icons have that little bit little thing right before and we will have to do some sort of conditional rendering so for that we will be doing this uh thing so this means we have a div anyways uh but if we pass in the arrow then we want to add the arrow right arrow right icon which is going to be imported once again from material ui so that's amazing but in case that's not the case we just want to render out the icon and the label so we will be passing in the icon and we will be passing in the label uh sorry guys what is the plugin vs uh that serves the file size import uh that is something that will come in a extension video it's i think it's by the way input cost i think uh but you want to make sure just uh stay tuned for that because i have new uh i have other stuff that just make the code go crazy if i uh mess something up so yeah why do i structure my files like that because uh if i would have a big big project i would need to make it make it look amazing make it easily uh see if i can just navigate easily between those files okay so with that said we are pretty much done with the sidebar item we just need to throw in a few different stuff which we obviously destructure on the top so we will have the arrow the icon and the label so that's cool and coming in here uh we will be passing in a few different things so if i go ahead and do this uh i will be using the sidebar uh sidebar item right so for the first two i'm passing in that arrow thing so once the arrow is being passed in i will be rendering out this error right icon and i obviously pass in the icon that i want to show and for that and next to it i want to uh i want to see my drive showing up so you got guys by the way this can actually totally be copied from here uh you can pretty much do that i don't really want to waste anybody's time and if you're here just watching it would take a ton of time to uh manually import so what i will do is just pass all these in these are obviously coming from material ui usually the auto import imports them but this is how pretty much we do it so and obviously we have this one more thing um yeah my girlfriend is commenting that the food is the food has arrived yeah i'm hungry too uh so this one last icon comes in here and if i take a look at how it looks like now we have all these icons going around and we will just need to make this style look amazing so for that uh we will add a new css file which we will call the sidebar.css and before i actually create it i'm just going to go ahead and import it and let's go ahead and do that so sidebar dot css boom and yeah for okay let's take a look at that so inside of there inside of there what we would do is we would say sidebar and we would hit say a width of a 15 percent okay because we don't want this to shrink out all the way uh on the full page but we want that to be the case uh when it comes to vertical stuff okay and we will give it a margin right of 5 pixels so it can actually breathe okay margin oh come on margin right of 5 pixels so that's super dope now as far as the hr goes we will have a background color of rgb and it's just going to be one seven one ninety seven one nine seven and one nine seven again dang so this is actually once again this lighter grayish color let's take a look at how we look like that's something but we obviously need to uh make sure that the sidebar items look looks nice so for that we actually use the sidebar item.css file now let's take a look at that so side sidebar item dot css oh jesus come on c sharp ew uh so del manos remove that dude so for that what we will do is the sidebar item is going to be the following so we're just gonna uh target that and we will give it a display of flex we will give it a padding of 10 pixel and 0 and we will give it a border radius of look at this because this is going to be crazy so we will have a zero a 100 pixel a 100 pixel and a zero this is top left top right bottom right and bottom left make sure to note it what's happening here okay because now i am only giving a border radius of the right hand side as you can see uh over here if i hover over only that side if i go all the way to the left it's not uh not border radius if it makes sense at all all right and in case we hover over the sidebar item we want to give it a shiny little tat this little tab of blackish something which is the which is a .04 opacity black all right now next up we will have the sidebar item underscore arrow and we will give it a width of a 28 pixels and a margin left of 12 pixels so that's dope and next up we will have the sidebar item and we will have a main which is going to be a display of flex and the text in there should be uh should have a margin left of 12 pixels so that will deliver the desired outcome hopefully okay we're not just there quite yet um but it is getting itself together okay okay what's happening in the chat by the way how old am i too old um okay so sidebar start presenting 15 pixels whatever we will just figure it out all right and yeah we imported it whatever whatever okay uh we will add a new file in here which is going to be the style for the new file item okay i didn't want that to be a javascript file it should have been a css that's it and that needs to be imported in the uh new file file uh so yeah right there and oh my god goes all the way oh over here okay uh yeah so new file.css is going to be a little bit uh tricky we will have all these stuff happening in here so we will have we will give it a display of flex and a line item of center padding of 12 pixels on bottom on above and below and zero pixels on the sides now the padding left actually needs to be 20 pixels i should have gone with the trouble uh method but i just went this way now the container is going to have a display of flux it will centralize all the stuff both vertically and horizontally so the justify content is responsible for the horizontal axis and the align item for the vertical axis now this here you can see the trouble which means top right bottom and left uh that's what happened here so the top six pixels right 32 pixels bottom six pixels again and the left is going to be eight pixels this is so this is a huge hack that you can learn and the border radius is going to be a 50 pixel now the box shadow i honestly grabbed it from somewhere online because uh i hate messing with box shadows but uh the box shadow is going to be zero one pixel two pixel zero rgb sixty sixty four sixty seven zero point and all the way this is something that you want to uh always generate with some sort of box shadow generator if you search it at google it will show it up and the text will have a margin left of 40 14 pixels if it's bursting is bursting your eardrums make sure to lower the volume all right next up let me drink okay next up uh and now we actually have this nice little um button over here with the cursor pointer and all that kind of stuff so that's amazing now next up we would just pass in the you're good at rgb colors i was messing with those a lot those took me time i came prepared so uh we will just pass in all that file view that is coming in here and that's pretty much the main uh stuff that will happen in there so for that inside of the components we will add a new folder which we'll call which we will call files view and oh my god and for for that we will add a new file called files view dot js actually let me go ahead and close all these windows so i want to have the app.js and the files view the js open and nothing else so the files view is going to be a component again and i just want to add the class name of uh file view yes file view and it will have a row in there which is going to be containing all the file cards okay so if you remember on the top i will show it in just a bit we will have a ton of file cards okay file cards like that so if you if you take a look at this that's all those images now uh we will start with the list under it so yeah let's get that done first uh okay and coming in here we will have obviously the titles which is going to be file view titles and that we have a left and a right and we are going to be design we are going to be using almost the same css twice but don't worry uh this is just for just to make sure everything's looks cool so we will have a file view titles dash left because we are following the naming convention and inside of ap tag we will have the name now once again we will have the file view underscore titles dash dash right which is going to contain uh the last modified okay last mo find and the we will even calculate the file's size so that's something to keep in mind when it actually all these little stuff are going to give so much more value to your application and this is where all the file oops this is where all the file items will go all right so who is following me by the way who is here who is uh who is here with me okay revision okay all good uh so yeah we have a hundred and eighty five eight 159 people watching right now i'm so thankful for you guys that is amazing that all of you guys are here so massive applause for you all right with that said let us let's continue i'm new here okay we see a few different guys who are here can someone explain what he is actually doing i'm new here i am building my friend the google drive clone this is how it will look like this is where we are at right now yes google drive with react.js yes uh just make sure come back to this video we will have a shorter version of it i will have the code down below so you will have all the resources that you want to uh have voice not clear sometimes that's because my own voice is dying all right so to actually have files that we can render out we need to make sure that we upload those files so going back to our new file.js uh what we want to do is actually first add a firebase urge.js file yeah and if you guys remember we had this snippet of code with all the stuff that was happening i hope this is the one because if it's not uh yeah 7 3 f o b yeah so make sure that you get the right uh api keys and all that stuff uh that you would need for this project because that's where we will be saving all our files so but before we can actually uh do that we need to add a few different stuff and one of them being firebase and the firebase tools so these are actually two npm packages that we are using to interact between firebase and our application so that's something amazing to have and it is actually a bit of a hustle to set up but once it's done it's done for all and we will be doing a a few different stuff in here one of them is going to be actually creating the app uh instance which is going to be a firebase app and it's going to be an initializer and which is going to throw in the firebase config and then we will uh create an authentication service which is going to be using the firebase.auth um service and we will just use that api then we will have a const uh that will be the provider because we are guys we are actually gonna be using google sign in so that's you might you might be thinking that's like a total trip to uh create but it's actually super easy to set up so we will say uh five is that auth dot google earth provider and that's it and we will have two more things one of them is going to be the storage and the other one is going to be the fire store so those are the two things that we will need and then we just go ahead and export everything auth provider db and storage so that's pretty much setting up firebase oh my god my whistle is low whatever so going back to the new file that's when we will actually start using all this so to make sure everything works we will need to uh import firebase from firebase and storage and db from the file that we just uh that we just created now hey robot robot is thought yeah we will do a few different stuff here we will need to set up a model that will just pop up and we'll have two buttons and then we will make sure that uh and we will make sure that that will be responsible for our uploading processes so for that uh we have these things happening uh we will import the make styles and the model from material ui once again future we're coming from extension themes yes and we will actually i actually went ahead and uh researched all these settings right so everything in here is actually coming from google uh the material ui documentation you can go ahead and search up materia ui models and this is what it will show okay so this is how you set it up and we just need to add a few different stuff in here so to make sure that everything is aligned and in place so this is kind of like getting uh getting towards the style components ish thing and yeah now for next up uh we will need once again this is all coming from material ui you guys can go ahead and basically copy all this stuff so uh we will have these classes which is going to be using these uh styles that we just defined we will just throw it into the model and the model style will be uh updated with get mo with this get model fi and we will set up a few different uh use states from uh react so that's something to keep in mind so we will need to definitely import those stuff and now this is where we will go ahead and upload everything okay so in order for uh for us to have this model thing uh this is once again copied from all the way from materia ui uh going over here and just pasting it in here so we will have a model which is going to be open once uh this state is actually set to true okay now the on close will actually fire off a handle close um function we haven't declared it yet no problem and we have some seo stuff in here going on and we have a div in there which we'll need to use the model style that we just uh defined here and that's going to be once again coming from google and now once we are actually uploading this is something that we will set up then we just we don't want anything to show up uh we don't want anything to show up but an uploading sign if it's not the case then we want to have two inputs one of them is a file that will be responsible for uh selecting those files that we want to upload and a button okay so those are the two things that we will have in there and that's pretty much it for the upload part for now now we will have to make sure that uh that model opens and closes as we need them to do so we will have these two functions over here and once we hit the handle open which is actually going to be um triggered once we hit the button so we need to add this in oops not there not even there there oh hold on so once we hit that button we want this model to be open that's when we will just fire it off it will turn this on and then the model pops up once we click out of it it will we want that to be actually closed so we will just say set open equals false confusing a little bit uh just make sure to watch it a few different times and then you will understand it and it's all the wraps i will have the code down below a shorter version up by tomorrow the latest and then you can go ahead and understand everything now we will actually okay so once we have uh our file selected we will make sure that this handle change runs okay so that handle change where is it uh here we are so that uh const handle change will actually be important uh so that uh we make sure that our file is selected now if yes e dot target dot files equal and the first item so zero okay uh so if we have that file we want that to be set to uh inside of this specific use data we just declared up top now and that's that's what we would just throw in there so we will just say either target.files zero now this is not uploading the file just yet but we have it inside of our application so once we click upload it will start the process so if we go down here and we see this button which is uh going to fire of this handle upload function that's what will make sure that our our files are getting uploaded so const handle upload then we will set the uploading process to true right so that's when actually uh this is going to kick in and we will just have the uploading uh text showing up and with that because we already declare this storage we want to have this storage the reference and inside of there we will have the files folder and in there we want to create a file which is going to use the file name that we just uploaded okay hope it makes sense and that's where we want to put our file but once that's done we will actually wait for it to get done we will have a snapshot yep and once that's done um we can just go ahead and console log it which is good snap shot yes then we will say storage the reference and inside of the files we want to grab the download url so that way you just you're not just uploading files you can actually download them now the file uh child is going to be yeah so in here we will say file name and get download uh url why isn't it yep so that's the fi okay so right now what we're doing is we are looking into that specific file that we just uploaded and we grabbed the download url and once we have that then we want that to be saved into our no sql database okay so we will just say db.collection collection and we would just create a my files folder in there or actually collection yeah and we will say add and we will add a timestamp which is going to be the firebase.firestore firestore dot field value dot server timestamp so that way if i have a specific time i don't know so it is 1 18 p.m in los angeles time but say somebody i'm working with somebody from stockholm uh their time is past 10 p.m i think it's 10 80 uh p.m what's up everybody who's joining now uh we are building the google drive clone using firebase and react so we will see uh the time according to our time zone so once that's cool uh once that's done we want to add a caption which will be the file.name we don't want to forget those commas and then we will have a file url that's actually what we got in the first place and we will want to save the size of the file which is going to be snapshot dot underscore delegate dot bytes transferred this is actually the little details that make all the difference especially on a coding interview or something like that so make sure to understand what's happening here it might take a little bit of time for you to understand and memorize everything but uh once you get the code make sure to take a look at every single piece what's happening uh yes it's capturing good catch thank you okay so now we should be able to upload files to firebase okay something is up all right uh so sidebar has some issues and firebase the js has some issues okay in here i forgot to import firebase from firebase yes and files in the new file which liner code 57 oh yeah like that okay so because we are just only putting the one file in there okay now i got it okay still freaking out yes because i screwed screwed it up there too one file dope all right things are getting together now we have some sort of functionality coming up here we can select whatever file we want to upload there but since it's not uh showing no it wouldn't show up i am not uh doing actually let's do that actually let's do that okay so i have this uh parrot image over here i'm just gonna go ahead and hit up uh i hit escape i'm just going to go ahead select that and choose for upload and then go ahead and upload it user doesn't have permission to access files parrots whatever let's take a look at what's going on so if i go into storage i might haven't started that um okay let's take a look at what's going on in here as well we have the storage happening that's good uh storage unauthorized yep choose file select guys this is debugging mode what's up venezuela okay user does not have permission to access let's take a look at what's happening in here okay let's take a look at what's up okay can we take up the likes up to 300 let me debug it first okay okay uh might be the firebase project that has issues by the way it's a web app boom let's take a look at what's going on let's let's debug this i think you have to edit the rules in firebase storage uh could be actually it shouldn't be a problem by the way but yeah let's take a look at that oh yeah haha good catch somebody give this guy give this guy a medal he just figured it out yeah i forgot it so if you see the same error no problem because our user is not authenticated uh fiber is just not gonna let us uh import add files in there so to actually fix that problem or not that much of a problem because it's secure uh you're just gonna go ahead and delete everything uh behind right add a semicolon and just gonna go hit publish and now we should be good to go so if i go ahead do the same thing once again uh add this file upload let's see what's happening let's go it's uploaded okay let's take a look at inside of our uh storage as well yes files and here we go this is our file that we just uploaded dope that that's a good catch thanks bro massive shout out to sammy rizvan for this amazing catch all right we and we also we have all the stuff happening in here inside of our fire store and guys we are not too much far behind of schedule so let's continue all right so new file is done going to file views okay uh going to file views yes and what we would do here is once we actually load up this uh file let me just put this snippet of code in here so first thing first we will need to define a use state which we obviously import from react let's do that so we import use state we import useful because we are going to be using both of those uh yep so first thing first we will create a use state and once we are cool with that then what we will do is we will uh start a use effect which we are going to our database into our collections into inside of my files create a snapshot and then just uh give that thing a value so the snapshot.map and inside of every single doc will be destructured to id and item so these things are what that uh document is going to be made up of and if you take a look at this this is uh the doc.data and this is the doc.id so that's just something to keep in mind but for that to actually work we will need to import the db from firebase which is cool so now we are so now that we are done with that part what we need to do what's up crisby uh what we need to do now is we were just going to go ahead and list out all the uh files that we have so we will create a new file which we will call uh file without caps lock file item dot js boom and aria ce that's it and we will just add a class name of file item like that now for that we will do a a few different things first thing first and most importantly what we will do is add in all these stuff we will add in all these stuff now okay what's happening here so first off we will import a insert drive file icon which is going to be the file icon actually then we will have all these months and that will help us determine what is the actual date that we uh created our file then uh this is going to be the uh the specific file item which will grab an id a caption a timestamp a file url and the size so basically we are rotating all the stuff in here that we saved our into our database right now first off we will create a file date which is going to be a day a month three letter month and a year so for that we will use the timestamp if it exists and then uh we will transfer it to date and then grab the date out of it which is actually the day then we will grab the month names up one here and we will do the same but we will uh be getting the month and we will add plus one uh i'm not even sure why we did one let let's take a look at that uh okay and next up we will have the timestamp the two date and we will grab the year out of it now this is actually a snippet of code that i copied from stack overflow which pretty much just grabs a grabs a number and turns it into a readable file size string so what that means is instead of uh instead of seeing a bunch of numbers which we see over here we will see 17 something megabytes or something or maybe even 1.7 megabytes we will see we will see it will turn it into a nicely and easily readable format so if you go into here you see 1.6 megabytes to 46.7 kilobytes so that's what we want to do now uh so we are cool there uh yes we removed this part okay so these are the parts that i actually copied from stack overflow this is uh pretty much available to anybody who wants to go and grab these but i highly recommend either checking out the git repo down below or actually we'll be down below a day or two more or uh just copying it from the screen but with that said i'm just gonna go ahead and continue now next up uh which editor am i using vs code next up what i will do is i'm just going to create an a and the href is what's up amano let's go five dollar donation let's go let's get in all right let's continue amazing amanda is such a cool dude all right so the href is going to be the file url so basically once we click the file it will open it up in a new tab because we set the target to uh underscore blank like that and we just want to make sure that it's a downloadable file so we just add that tag there and that's cool now we will have inside of here a few different things um one of them being is the file item left that's going to contain the icon we just that we just imported up over here and the caption that we are passing in here now we are not passing in it just yet but we are catching it before i had to use my vpn for that oh wow that's what happens when the nothing is available in your region i know that all right next up we have the file item right that will contain the file date that we just structured up over here with a bunch of template literals and all that stuff and then we will make sure that the readable file size string is there too so that being said we pretty much have a row of files let's take a look at how it looks like and it's going to freak out because we haven't uh haven't actually added it yet so that's good so now moving back to file views fileview.js we will need to loop through all the files that we just downloaded from firebase over here in the use effect so for that to happen we are just going to say files dot map and we would destructure the file right away and we will obviously have the id and the item inside there so that's good and we will just add in a new file item so we import it right away uh no we haven't imported it right away so this problem uh so i'm just going to go ahead and import the file item from the same folder which is going yeah file item just like that and i want to go ahead and throw in the id as the id right then we will have the caption which is going to be item dot caption so we what we are basically doing here is just uh scrubbing through the whole uh entry of the database and then just each and every single little thing is going to be passed into that file item item component so let's take a look at how it looks like right now and still not amazing so something is still up let's take a look at what we got here i'm not sure if i oh yeah no i haven't edited it in here either so we're just gonna say file view boom and let's see if now it works okay files view is not defined not a problem oh yeah so for that uh we definitely need to import that part as well uh and that is going to be imported from exactly here what's up derek high five bro let's take a look at how it looks like right now and resolve uh file item dot js all right we're just gonna do a little bit of debugging here because something apparently is up okay file items css i think i haven't made that just yet uh but i imported it already so let's take a look at that part all right so everything is getting under it so we just need to fix something up here we will need to add a display flex so for that uh we will be going into app.css what can i learn here guys you can learn here how to build a google drive so what we will do here is the app.main needs to have a display flex so we're just going to go into over here and just add it in here path is wrong nope it's not and now it should be actually i haven't made that file just yet so yeah path is wrong but yeah okay let's take a look at how we look like right now still not good uh and that's because we need to create the structure of the app file so uh how does it look like we will need to add in a uh new div in here and guys don't freak out like this is uh this is literally how it's done it's okay to run into errors it's completely fine just fixing it up so uh what happens here is we have the header on the top right and all these things are only going to appear once we authorize the user or we sign in actually and we want to differentiate this from the header because otherwise everything would be next to each other but we want the header to be on the top and whatever comes after is next to be each other okay we will have three different three different components coming in there and out of the out of those three we have already done two so yes uh we are in that case we are pretty good there let's refresh and now we have all these things happening so that is going to be the title over there title right above the uh line okay and we will have the file name and the all the stuff and notice that we see the app class name note following bam yep just yet it's not but i'm just gonna fix that real quick so we see that we have 1.6 megabytes of file happening there okay so that is good all right uh what we are gonna do now is make sure that all these things look nice and then add two more things and we are cool okay so we are done with the file item now we need to add in a file item that css file which i actually uh didn't do last time but now it is time so file item css guys if this is confusing that is 100 okay uh that is because i'm going a little bit uh in to several places but please please make sure to come back check this video once again and check out the github repo down below in the description and i promise that everything is going to be cleared out 100 all right going back into the code uh we have we are going to target the file item which is going to have a height oops we which is going to have a height of 55 pixels and a border bottom of one pixel solid and the rgb of 219 219 and 219. all right we will do the exact same thing for the border top as well and we will have a width of a 100 percent all right so one little maintenance thing over here is what i'm gonna do is wait a just a little bit so one second let me just load all this stuff all right whatever all right so uh the width is going to be 100 and so that makes sure that the whole file is actually going all the way so the file item is using all the space that it can so the file item a uh so we want to remove all that ugliness happening so we just want that to have a 100 of height and we want that to have a display of flux as well as the text decoration of none i will go through the css preprocessors in another video okay so the text decoration is going to be none and we will set the color to this nice little rgb 85 78 and 78 that will be a grayish something so to make sure that uh the colors inside of it's actually making sure that that file is looking good so with that uh next up we're moving on to the div inside of there uh we actually want to go ahead and import all this file and with that done we are good all right so the file item uh yeah okay so inside of the file item the link and we will just uh target all the divs inside of that link and we will select display we will make sure that everything is next to each other so we will say display of flux and we will give it an align items of center so everything is vertically aligned uh let me just do a few different things over here yeah right there dope and now we want to actually uh target all the uh child items of that of those divs so we will say file item dot a a and div and inside of there there is gonna be a star so that actually makes sure that all the items inside of those uh so these basically these two are going to be targeted and those are going to have a margin of 10 pixels right now the file item uh dash dash right actually left is going to be a flex it's going to have a flex of one and we actually should have a nicely looking uh file item over here now we obviously need to stretch the whole thing out all the way uh yeah we will have to stretch out the whole thing all the way but once we are done with that uh we will be good so for that to happen we get we need to go back to the file item nope the files view uh that css file which we haven't actually created just yet and okay hold on a second all right dope all right so each and every single individual items are now looking good okay i kind of lost my chain of thought uh and we'll just close this yep dope okay so now we're back on track we can uh finish this off strong in a little bit and what we will do is we will go in the styles and create a files view um files view the css file jeez let's see us come on and what we will do is we will obviously import that inside of files view so to make sure that everything is looking clean and for that what we will say in there is we will make sure that the whole thing is uh stretched to the all the way so it will use one hundred percent then we will target the row which is going to be which i think uh we will need to add two underscores so file view i'm just gonna underscore row and inside of there we will add a height of 250 pixels we will add a display of flex and then align item of center so everything is going to be ver vertically aligned to the center now the file view file view underscore underscore titles it is going to be a display of flux then a margin bottom of 5 pixels then we will have set the color of it to prgb and we will set it to 85 then 78 and 78 next up we will be targeting all the um uh for the titles and we will make sure that everything is aligned and all in place so we should be looking at something like this if there wasn't some sort of issue uh files view title let's take a look at uh tight tools let's take a look at what we have here once again uh there's some sort of typo happening here you make sure make sure to check the typos and all those stuff because that's where my whole uh styling is going crazy right now um because i have these because they have these uh typing issues so we will have file view titles left okay so sometimes there is the s sometimes i forgot it so make sure to yeah okay now we are good it's all the way stretched and all okay now everything is looking all nice and clean we are getting this together we will finish this off strong and now with that part done we will be okay so this is uh working perfect we will be adding those cards in here the items in here and the authentication and we should be done in less than 20 minutes so with that done uh we will close up all these uh little things and we will just go in here and add the file card so the file card is going to be a new file a new component so file card dot c j j s we will just type in rafc just like always to create a new component so that will be a class name of what is it file card and it will have a top which will have the usual icon that we use throughout the application from materia ui so that's actually something uh to make sure to save it and to have it somewhere okay uh okay uh dope so with that that with that said uh we will have an other uh div which is going to be the bottom of that file card and for that to work we will need to pass in a we will need to pass in the name of the file now to actually for that to happen we would need to uh be looping through the whole thing but we don't want it to be cluttered all the way so we would just uh render out five of those so we will be going back to the files view and this is where we import the file cards file okay so for that to happen uh for that to happen we would just go in and import so notice that this is the file that i just created over here and for that to actually function uh we will be slicing it up slicing the array up so what happens here so we will say files dot slice and we just want to grab out the the first item all the way to the fifth item but nothing else right so if there is 10 items we will just see the first five and the reason for that is we don't want the whole row to be full with those uh with those top so we will just say and we will just map those and we will say id and item because we destructure it right away and new arrow function and we will just have the file card and we will throw in the name so we will say item dot caption all right that should be it but uh because we are actually adding jsx we are not using squiggly braces we are using the normals okay now it's still freaking oh yeah you need to close the hair close the jsx tag so that's something to keep in mind all right uh let's take a look at how we look like right now yeah that could and we made it super big so right now um we will be importing the css to that specific file card file and we need to go ahead and create that real quick so which is going to be file card dot css boom and card css now this thing i actually copied the whole thing from uh google drive so the best way to clone applications is actually go there and then just uh grab out the css so they have those things uh they are 190 uh 190 high width of 2 40 pixels they will have a border radius of 10 pixels and they will have a border of one pixel one pixel solid and an rgb of 219 219. hello and 219 and we will have a margin of 5 pixels obviously over there so that it actually can breathe a little now this is actually as uh as we just built it it is actually built up uh in two things the one of them is the filed card top it will have a height of 70 70 percent a bottom border of one pixel solid 290 with this almost white but still gray color we will give it a display flex and justify and align everything to the center so basically we stack it in the middle of that part now below that we have the file card bottom which will have a display of flex and align item center justify center width of 100 and height over 30 percent so that's once again uh we just put the text in the middle now the max width of that uh text should be 90 pixels of its parent container and we will hide the overflow and make sure the text doesn't wrap because that's not how google drive works so this is how it is working and guys two more things left to do side icons on the right hand side and the authentication and we are good so let's do the side icons right now so what we will say is we will definitely need a new folder yes we will need to have a new folder so it's going to be side icons and inside of there we will have an index dot js file and we will create the component just like every single time and in here um i've actually made a i actually made a few google searches and searched up the top three applications that come up for me in my personal google drive i'm obviously not going to show it um so yeah though those are for me the google calendar the keep and the google tasks so for that what's up pranay so for that to work we will need to uh add these images now i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead opens up a new tab and just type in google colon dar icon hit return and i don't know just grab one of those and then right click copy immediate address and then just paste it in there so that's literally how i've done it uh check out which one is on the top for you i have google keep google calendar and google tasks so those are the icons that i have i just went ahead did the thing that i just showed and then make sure to add the alt text for seo purposes now these are actually going to be on the top of the side uh icons so these uh we will create a new a div there and we will just wrap it around there now we will have a horizontal line in there as well and we will need an add icon down below because that's how it looks like which is going to be obviously a plus icon we just imported from the good old material ui and then we create the css file and make sure it looks all aligned and nice and perfect so we will create side icons dot css what's up partharoa how you doing bro what's good my man this guy actually crushes it he is a part he is the part of our uh chorus prophet jaws and he smashes that just like the like button right so now we are good on that side and what we will do now is we will just say dot side icons and these will have a width of a 50 pixels a display of flux flex direction of column and aligning the items to the center and we will have a border left of one pixel solid and the rgb 219 219 219. the usual ones i'm doing amazing i'm doing fantastic during this live stream we are live for more than two hours and more than 100 people are here so that's amazing that's amazing guys 10 more minutes and we will be done so uh what do you mean align items doesn't work it does work align items works vertically okay and only works if there is a display flex before that but since here we have the flex direction the column it's going to be uh horizontal but the flex is always yeah you see what i mean i kind of hope so so the side icons we will have a width of 100 a display of flex flex deduction column and align items to center and we will have we will target all those images inside of there they will be objects that contain with over 30 pixels and a margin of 10 pixel uh above and below and zero on the sides now we would want to target that uh hr tag and give it a margin of 12 pixels on both sides but uh no uh above and below and uh zero on both sides and give it a width of a 90 percent and the plus icon will going going to be a display of flex and we will just center that so that should cut it uh once we import that file into our app.js so we're just going to say import site icons from components and side icons and that's good so we're just gonna decide our cons we should be good to go soon all right there we go there you have it over there the side icons now one more thing left to do which is the authentication and this is going to be super super easy because we are using firebase so what is going to happen here is that if we go back to our app.js file we will remove all these dummy data right and that will leave us a completely empty uh use date right so that means we do not have a logged in the user at this specific moment in time and to make sure that that you uh that no there is no user that is unauthorized can log in we will need to make sure that if the if there is no user we okay so if there is a user then we want to smash the like button and put all these things here but if there is no user then we want to make sure that uh a login is enforced so in that case in that case we will be throwing that in and also make sure that there is a container tag on both sides so in case we have the user we would just throw everything in there in between these empty tags so that makes uh so everything is going to be uh smashed into one little piece as well as down here and if there is no user then we will just uh throw this app login in here we will just throw in the google drive logo and a button that will enforce the login now for that to work we will need the google drive logo to be imported and we this is where we will be using uh the authentication and the provider that we exported from firebase now uh we are only 99 people at this point uh so to get in a few people make sure to let everybody know who is watching uh just call in a few friends just finish it off 100 plus make sure we finish this off strong so user is available just in js es7 nope we need to set it first so this is the user that i'm referring to here okay so i don't want i don't want that to be mixed up now we will be firing off this um handle login function over here so for that to work we are going to be uh say han const handle login and that function is going to check if there is a user because if there isn't a user right yeah stay home i'm home all right so if there is no user then what we will say is auth dot sign in with popup so that will create a new window and we just throw in the provider which is the google signin provider then we will get some sort of result and with that result we want to do a few different things so then we want to set the user and we're just gonna say result result dot user and that's it that's pretty much it let's take a look at what's happening here okay we need to make sure that it looks cool and nice so for that we are gonna go into app.css and oh servers are rendering lately yes we will actually actually i'm gonna be dropping a few different tutorials on that too for so stay tuned for that all right so and lastly we will make it look nice so app uh app log in and we will say width of a hundred view width yes height of 100 view height we will say display grid display grid this time and we're just going to say place items actually and we will say center and the button inside of there is going to be it's not going to have a border we will set the font size to 24 pixel background color this is some sort of bluish 67 130 and 244 we will set the color to white the padding to 10 pixel uh on above and below 20 pixel on the sides and the border radius is gonna be six pixels and we will set all the transitions to point two seconds because when we hover over it uh we will set the cursor to pointer and the background color to this darker blue which is for 49.94 179 and a transform of 1.1 scale so let's see how that looks like this is how it looks like and if i hover over it it becomes a little bit bitter just a tad and a little bit darker so that's a nice little touch with the ui over there i am over here signing in with google clicking that link and with that i can just add a new file say say this black parrot bang and i'm just gonna hit upload and we are done so that was it for today's video i hope you guys liked it uh we just built the google drive clone uh i hope you enjoyed it so make sure if you did go ahead smash that like button and whatever you want me to build next for this channel or for you guys make sure to submit it down below there's an airtable link where we are expecting all those technologies that you are interested in and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed it we finished it up super strong we are at 110 people two and a half hours straight in coding so that was it thank you for joining this is david from cleverprogrammer.com and i'll see you in the next video you
