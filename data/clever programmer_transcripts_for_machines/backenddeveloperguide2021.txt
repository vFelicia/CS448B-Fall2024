what's going on guys this is david from coverprogrammer.com and today we have an awesome topic for you guys which is becoming a backend developer in 2021 now this is this video is going to be jagged with a ton of value so with that said let's get started alright so before we begin it's time to focus so please please make sure that your phone is turned off just throw it away to the other side of the room and why don't we just jump right in i'll tell you why you haven't smashed that like button just yet it's time i'll wait you done it okay let's get started so becoming a backend developer in 2021 let's first talk about the basic skills that you will need to become a backend developer all right so you definitely need a profession knowledge in a backend programming language or framework something um you will need the ability to manage and host an environment full of application and database and administration and all that stuff you will also need to understand a bit of a front end so html css and javascript is your friend this time you will also need to have a bit of experience with uh git version control or any other type of version control and the knowledge and the accessibility and security and compliance all right so i know this is why you came here for let's discuss how much a backend developer actually makes um so how much does a backend developer make in the united states so according to indeed.com the average base salary of a backend developer is a hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars actually even more sometimes now this is just the average it can peak out further usually the cash bonus is an additional 4k all right so uh according to another website this is actually 75 000 uh per year um but we have glassdoor as well which says 100 000 plus so we can confidently say that a backend developer usually makes enough to not go bankrupt uh easily all right usually like over six figures so uh let's talk about the opportunity to become a backend developer in 2021 now let's take a look at a couple of websites of all the opportunities so first up uh here we got glassdoor.com now glassdoor.com alone has almost 4 000 uh backhand job listings all alone and we haven't talked about any other sites yet let's take a look at it so indie.com has an additional 5 and 500 plus jobs as a backend developer just in the united states so i think this is a huge huge opportunity for everybody uh out there who wants to become a programmer a developer especially a backend developer so with that said let's dive into the meat and the potatoes all right so uh you definitely need to understand and learn the basics of html css and javascript because it is what it is next up let's actually learn a programming language um you can choose javascript python php not recommended though java csharp and go as well now i just told you like six different programming languages you might be like oh my god which one do i choose uh so let's actually take a look at the surveys and all that stuff so according to the stack overflow developer survey 2020 the most wanted programming language is python next up javascript and on the third place there is go so these are the programming languages to go for and let's actually take a look at the top two so python versus javascript um quickly so javascript is front and and backend so javascript for the win but why let's take a look at that so what can you actually do with javascript you can build web apps like progressive web apps there is a react which is an awesome framework next up we got react native so if you know already react you can actually go ahead and build native mobile apps with react native and you can of course create server side applications uh that's why we got node.js all right now let's take a look at where can you like this is good but where can you learn all these on this channel we have a ton of develo uh development crash courses on youtube we got the eight hour javascript course we got the react tutorial 2021 we got mirn stack tutorial 2021 we got html courses css courses python courses we got everything on this channel so make sure you check it out go ahead subscribe right now i'll wait just a sec so you don't miss out anything okay subscribe hit the bell good let's go so uh let's learn the back end framework now what the heck is that so which framework to choose actually that let's go that way like this is node.js that you want to go with uh or the other uh other frameworks which are awesome are django asp.net core flask express spring and ruby on the rails and actually the framework is depends on the language that you actually choose so for let's go back so node.js is actually the javascript backend runtime and for that the best framework to choose is express now for java it is spring for ruby it is ruby on rails for python it is django or flask all right so this is just an image uh yeah this is like a visual expression and of course we got a php with laravel awesome let's take a step uh step ahead we got git and github we have videos coming up explaining what's the difference between the two uh but we also have a git 101 already on this uh channel by amanov and me myself so let's actually take a look at what what's that two things so get is actually like doctor strange from the marwell world um this is like a time machine for programmers this is actually a tool that helps you guys to become better developers in faster times and you can just easily this is a great tool for developers all right so what's the difference between the two so github is actually up on the cloud git is on your local machine so you're tracking version on your machine and then you upload it to github well how does it look like all right so you get the master branch uh which might sound uh confusing at first but basically that's the version of the application actually right now it is called main so that's the branch that is actually on production which is uh released now you are branching out and you're building a big feature or smaller features and those are like separate branches so in case you have a bug it's not it's not going out to production all right and once you have a stable working awesome feature to your application you do this which is called the get merge and looks something like that alright next up let's talk databases and data so there are two main types of databases the first one is sql and the one of the most uh popular sql databases is postgresql and then we got oracle we got my sequel this is an awesome let's take a look at uh nosql databases the most popular is actually mongodb now let's take a look at what's the difference so a sql database is actually relational and in no sql database there is no relation between values you can store graphs in a document column all that stuff so nosql has less rules and for that it has a couple of advantages and disadvantages compared to sql now this is a couple of uses of nosql and sql database system for nosql is awesome for gaming social media iot web enterprise all that stuff now sql is actually awesome for data mart's enterprise again mobile web and all that crazy stuff so actually let's take a look at what nosql database is so it's a highly scalable highly available very very fast easily replicatable and big data capable uh database now we got a ton of tutorials how to use mongodb on this channel so make sure that you go ahead and check out those if you haven't done that already and actually this is my this is my instagram handle go ahead drop me a message if there is something that you need further details on but with that said let's go further now we got firebase what is firebase and why is it so useful as a backend developer let's take a look at that so first up uh you can operate firebase super super easily with javascript all right now we got firebase hosting which allows you to host your application online in the ga they can they give you a preview link as well so it's super super easy we got cloud firestore which is actually a realtime database now why is it good super fast your application works without reloading and all that stuff super awesome make sure to check it out cloud firestore is amazing and and the guys over at google who actually own firebase they took the good parts of sql databases they took the good part of nosql databases they merged them and that's what firestore is it is a hybrid of sql and nosql databases this is super super awesome we got a ton of tutorial with that and we have a lot of stuff coming up we where we are using firebase firestore so make sure you hit that subscribe button because we got so much more awesomeness coming on this channel all right you can also authenticate users using firebase with a couple of lines of code because firebase is all about making developers live super easy it's actually think of it as like aws but with less pain in the head super easy to set up super easy to work with and you got the full google uh infrastructure behind your back and behind your applications back so this is this is so much so amazing you can also uh host node.js functions using firebase the cloud functions so you can actually build a serverless architecture using firebase now you also get storage for media and all that stuff that you want to go ahead and store in your application and you also get google analytics for firebase and you also get the firebase test lab so firebase is super super amazing and it should be the best friend of each and every single developer now what's the best part about firebase it is free for a super super generous limit now actually this video is not sponsored by firebase opportunity for firebase though this video is not sponsored by firebase by any means however because we want you guys to use the best of your time and to actually be successful as developers we highly highly recommend using firebase we use it in a ton of applications in our own team at clever programmer and we've built a ton of tutorials so make sure to check those out because that's how you actually see how powerful firebase is and you can also go ahead check out the pricing uh they are super generous with all that and boom easy as that all right let's talk node.js apis javascript so let's actually talk apis so first up let's take a look at this uh thing and i might and i might move myself let's stay here so what is an api first an api let's actually go ahead and go this way so if uh you the user you wanna know what's the weather like in los angeles now you go to somewhere some weather sort of website and you're actually interested in the weather so you that that is your input that way you actually express your interest in the weather now that website goes ahead and makes an api call to the backend also known as the server now the server goes ahead and starts calculating and all that stuff and looks into the database and super awesome stuff but then responds to the front end and tells you that it is 51 degrees right now might be not accurate at the moment when you're watching this but at that moment it was 51 degrees now the front end actually outputs it like shows it on the screen so basically this is a workflow of the api so this is the communication channel between the front end and the back end nas frankie and daniel from cover programmer made an awesome video explaining how the whole backhand uh how the whole api infrastructure works so make sure to check that out too it is a couple minute long video but it makes so much sense and explains super awesome all right next up let's take a look at this uh image as well this is another representation of how an api works basically the application makes a request to the back end and the channel that they use to communicate is the api it's kind of like you go into the restaurant make an order then the waiter is actually the api who takes the order to the kitchen brings back the pizza for you and delivers it to your table we also have graphql databases but in this tutorial we are not going to dive deep into that now let's talk devops mindblowing so what is devops it's basically planning building continuous integration deployment operation continuous feedback there is a ton i mean a ton of applications and tools that you can use to maximize your devops now let's take a look at what what is this continuous integration uh which is the main part of devops it's basically your code you're coding you're testing you're analyzing your code you're tracking the version and you release all the time so basically it is a continuous flow when you're making new stuff making new features and you're always hitting that deploy and host button so super awesome thing make sure to check those out and go into details but we will have more and more um tutorials on how to understand all this stuff and how to use all these technologies now one of the most uh requested and and most useful uh application when it comes to devops and maintenance and all that stuff is docker now docker has a ton of use a ton of ways you can actually utilize it i'm going to show you guys one of them so let's actually go ahead and imagine that you want to deploy a react version 16 application a react version 17 application a node.js which uses uh yeah node.js which uses the 12th version of node and you want to actually uh deploy a python uh version 3.9 application and a perfect which is the backend side of swift now you want to install all these on one server because buying a new server is super expensive provisioning a new one so much hassle you have only one server you want to deploy all these now we all know that all these applications has have a ton of dependencies if you don't know what i'm talking about um node modules that's all the dependencies su so much stuff and if you install all them on one server all the dependencies will be like oh my god now this is mainly because we got react 16 version and react 17th version and it will just mess up the whole thing because if even if the others will be okay next to each other these two will definitely conflict and cause something like that on the server now for that docker introduced the containerized environment which means it creates separate environments for all the applications without running a virtual machine so how do how does it look like you have one server but then you have several little bits and pieces which are full applications look at it that way that's all for docker you probably won't need it too much but in case you do this is a goto understanding of how you can actually use this now let's take a look at the top hosting platforms first up we got netlify it is free to use for some extent but this is an awesome tool to host your application react applications all that websites you also have firebase hosting which is just a couple of commands on the terminal it's so worth it and it is free for a super generous extent and we also have aws which is very very heavy and this is for like super pro users but aws is awesome we are not against it but we always suggest here at clever programming that try to use firebase as much as you can and if firebase is not enough then move to aws because firebase is so much easier to set up so much easier to work with and maintain now how can where can you actually learn all this stuff you can go ahead and search it up on youtube youtube and youtube you can also join discord servers go ahead join facebook groups linkedin whatever basically join a community but most recommended youtube they show you they actually talk during the videos so it's super easy to learn that way let's do a quick recap so first what do you need to know what do you need to do to become a backend developer in 2021 go ahead pick a language python javascript java whichever you want to learn a framework django express.js spring all that stuff learn git and github and how to use all these things and learn a sequel or a nosql database because those are actually the most uh common ways that today we store data also learn about apis and graphql graphql is less important for now but make sure to learn about that and with that said thank you so much for joining i hope you are going to have an awesome holiday season this year in 2020 and you can finish off 2021 super hard and with that said go ahead smash that like button subscribe to our channel hit that ring so you don't miss any of our videos coming up next in this uh in this year because we are all about helping you to become and get a job as a developer in 2021 and beyond and onwards so with that said thank you so much for joining i wish you a happy holidays and an awesome new year and i'll see you in the next video peace
