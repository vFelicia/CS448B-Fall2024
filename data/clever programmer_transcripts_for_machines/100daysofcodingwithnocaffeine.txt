what's up guys how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com i just want to talk to you about my experience with coding with no coffee for over 100 days my perspective what have i learned from it so far should you try it are there any myths something crazy that happens with that said smash the like button hit the subscribe button as well let's get into it actually alex becker was one of the reasons why i stopped drinking coffee so i watched one of his videos him talking about caffeine and how it was affecting him and how it was screwing up his productivity and how it gave him you know a little bit of a boost and then crashed so i thought if alex becker says this is a good idea i'm gonna give it a try so i got on this journey and ever since that day i kind of stopped drinking coffee i wanted to see how not drinking coffee would affect my coding skills or how i focused and my ability to sustain focus over a prolonged period of time this is one thing that people ask me like how do you feel now what does it feel like and i always think that they're expecting something like oh my god literally holy spirit now just floats above the sky just sits on top of a mountain just like shits out wisdom i've been going on for over 100 days and honestly unfortunately it's not like that i if i told you the truth i feel no different at all than i did a hundred days ago the peak that i hit once i have my coffee i just don't have those anymore maybe i'm not that observant but i can't remember if i really had crashes but maybe sometimes i feel like when i had the coffee after i drank the coffee or whatever i probably might have had those like crashes that come after caffeine like post caffeine now i don't feel those anymore and probably my energy just feels like it's sustained over a longer period of time in terms of how it's affected my coding again same way while i don't have those crazy peaks of energy as i would with caffeine i don't also have those like crashes so that's been good but for me what i've realized what really helps me actually staying fasted so if i don't eat that much then i actually focus more and get more and more dialed in so in terms of my coding i don't see that much of a difference with or without caffeine i think i can sustain my focus for maybe a longer period of time my recent coding hours were 12 p.m to 10 p.m so like 10 hours of coding or more per day but yeah with that said for me those are honestly the results of the caffeine i have maybe longer periods of focus what i do is i don't have to rely on anything not taking caffeine has been empowering i will tell you that because i feel that i don't need anything to sustain and consistently be going at the pace that i'm going at to be productive or high achieving or you know hit really hard goals and don't need to take caffeine in order to be able to do this that feeling is priceless i will tell you that my hack is for me coffee wasn't about the hit that it gave me coffee for me was a lot more the ritual the ceremony of the coffee itself like holding it and watching the smoke come out of it and coming and having a coffee break in between my coding sessions you're holding it you bring it up you're just looking at it the sound the smell the taste all of that was what i was addicted to it wasn't just the coffee itself so i thought okay what can i replace it with and the tea gives me a very similar experience honestly some kind of herbal tea i've literally stopped taking any caffeine i take nothing with caffeine in it so no energy drinks nothing that biochemically changes me because one thing i do agree with is at the end of the day it is a drug it is a stimulant that is going inside of your body and changing things about it and that is something i don't want other benefits i'll tell you of not having caffeine for example if i don't have caffeine and i'm tired throughout the day that's a goddamn good sign you know why because i'm tired it means i had a lack of sleep so it will expose that i'm sleeping less whereas having caffeine will mask it and masking a sleep deprivation is one of the worst things you can do in your life as anything as a developer as a human being and you will have extremely damaging repercussions over an extended period of time it is destructive what it will do to your life and your happiness and your mental health and your emotional sanity every single one of those areas in a very detrimental way it's kind of like if you're recording and all of a sudden your terminal stops telling you that there are any errors and you're like this is great this is perfect it doesn't tell me any errors anymore when you run your app it doesn't run but it never also tells you an error that's what caffeine does it just hides it and goes yeah don't worry about it there are no errors but it's also not working and it's not telling you why it's not working and so hiding the errors is not a good thing errors and coding are your friend look at the stack and you trace it back and you go boom this is a problem this is exactly what's happening if you don't have that you're screwed same thing with caffeine catching things takes an extremely long amount of time and then when you're older it's such a habit and it's going to be so much harder to remove and so what i recommend is if you're listening to this really it sounds cool give it a try you might not need to do a hundred days try 20 days or just try 30 days try replacing it with the herbal tea where there's no caffeine try going without caffeine in your body and see what that feels like over the next 20 or 30 days but one thing i can tell you and i can promise you is you're going to feel a lot more empowered you're gonna feel like man i don't really depend on it and i don't need it to succeed and do things and i think those feelings are gonna be pretty freeing and i think after not having caffeine you start finding yourself more and more tired you might be like screw this i'm going to take caffeine but i challenge you look at your sleep you're probably not sleeping the right amount you're probably not resting how much you should and again all of this is going to affect the ability of you coding and how long you're able to code at the end of the day the best developers are going to be the ones that can sustain focus on a problem for a long period of time and not have to crash and if you can keep doing that with caffeine for the first couple of years that's great but what about long term if this is a career you're trying to stick to you want to develop your focusing muscles to grow stronger and not aided by additional stimulants so that's just my thought i have no judgment do whatever you want i might go back to coffee at some point give me your one takeaway you got from this video i love your face this is your boy cozzy and as always i'll see you in the next video peace you
