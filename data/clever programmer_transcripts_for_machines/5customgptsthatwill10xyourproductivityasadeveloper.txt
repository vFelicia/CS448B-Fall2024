these are the top five gpts that will help you 10x your productivity as a developer GPT Store launched last month and there are thousands of gpts in the store already first of all you need to be a chat GPT plus subscriber it's $20 a month and it's so worth it because the output of GPT 4 versus the free GPT 3.5 is like comparing the intelligence of a 6yearold kid to a fully grown 30yearold adult it's also multimodal so it's capable of analyzing text images and voice instead of just plain text and with chat GPT plus you also get access to these special gpts that can boost your coding productivity now before we get into the video I have some exciting news for you all that we've put together an entirely free 20minute webinar training designed to guide you in becoming a developer with AI you're going to learn how to enhance your efficiency and speed up your development process using tools like chat GPT and in this free training we're going to give you three Innovative AI app Concepts steps that you can build in under 5 minutes with the power of AI so click on the sign up link in the description below and make sure you check out this free webinar all right let's get into these top five developer gpts our first GPT is screenshot to code and hence the name this helps you write frontend code from just a screenshot so you can take a screenshot of literally any website you want so to try this out let's just take a screenshot of the YouTube homepage so we'll just grab that and then we can upload it to the GPT here cuz remember GPT 4 is multimodal so you're able to give it input that's not just plain text so we're going to give it this image of the YouTube homepage and then the prompt that will'll add will just say build this using Tailwind CSS and we'll just see what it gives us from this prompt so it takes just maybe about a minute there and it has given us this whole HTML code that we can use to create the layout of the screenshot that we gave it it says this code provides the structure for a video streaming platform UI inspired by this inspired by the screenshot it doesn't cover every detail but it gives you a solid base to start from and you can fill in the placeholder images with whatever images you want so let's just take this and throw it right directly into a repet um file and if you're not Amil with repit it's just basically an in browser IDE so we can just put our code in right here and see the output right away we don't have to do any other setup okay so I'm literally just going to copy this and paste it right here we have an HTML JavaScript and CSS environment template selected because this is just plain HTML that it gave us and it uses Tailwind if you look right up here in the scripts in the head we can see that the Tailwind CDN script is linked right here so that's how how we're able to use this Tailwind styling you can see here in the classes so let's just run this look at that move myself over here a little bit so you can see so it gave us a nice little layout for this obviously like it said you know this is just the base and you build up from here but this is a nice little YouTube homepage clone that you could start from and create your own project screenshot to code is super useful because this could really help you with rapid prototyping you can get an MVP built from design files much faster than before this GPT could also be used to help teach beginner programmers how the structure for a different front end should be set up and you could potentially even use this to help you build your own UI component Library the code copilot GPT is designed to help you with Python Programming this can help you with code review okay it can review code you've written you can get help with debugging from this GPT and it can even help to teach you Python Programming best practices so how does this work well we have the GPT open right here and it has some example commands to start with so we're just going to start with the first one they have/ start Python and it tells us a little bit about code copilot and what you can do so it's here to assist you with writing efficient readable reusable and maintainable python code so this it can help you with API documentation writing new code Snippets whatever you need with python basically so to get started with it all we need to do is just share a specific python coding challenge or some example code that we wanted to explain to us so I have here a sample of python webd project this is using the D Jango rest framework and I'm just going to take a code from a random file in this repository and I'm going to give this to code copilot I'm just just going to ask it to explain this code for me that's all I'm going to say and I'll paste the code right there some of these you might notice it takes a little bit longer because it's using gp4 which is a much larger model and it's doing a much more advanced response for us so we have to have a little bit longer of a wait time so this one did give us a pretty detailed response it's basically explaining to us that this code is for a class for a Blog application um that's being used to serialize post data to and from a Json format so this is for a Jango rest API that needs to format data for the response and then it breaks it down for us into really detailed pieces so it tells us we have the Imports at the beginning of our code right and then we Define the class constructs the API URL we use our models we have serializer metadata and then finally we have the method that takes the post object as input and Returns the full API URL for the object so if you tried to look at this just by yourself it's obviously following rest API conventions but you might miss something or maybe you are not that familiar with python and now you read this and you're like oh I understand what's going on now with the Jango framework API I know what this syntax means in this context code copilot is an awesome tool for beginners if you have trouble understanding Snippets of code you can input that into this GP and it's going to explain it for you find a bug in your code and you're not sure what to do code copilot can help you figure out how to fix it so go have fun with this one and see if you can test the limits of what this can do our next GPT is ask the code and this one has a really interesting use case ask the code is specifically designed to help you get an understanding of a GitHub repository so all we have to do is provide a GitHub repository URL and we can ask about any aspect of the code in that repository and it's going to explain to us what's going on and what we need to know okay so I came across this repository by Apple um for their own project called ml faret I have no idea what's going on in this repository I see some animals looks kind of interesting so I'm just going to copy the link to this repository and then in the GPT I'm just going to feed it this rep repository The Prompt will give it I'll just say explain what this repository is like I'm 12 so for this we're going to have to authorize it to use our GitHub account authorized so this GPT just uses a specific plugin and we have to all we're doing here is uh the reason we have to sign in with ooth is just to give it permission to be able to communicate with this plugin so so it can give us the response back that we want so I'm just going to allow that so it tells us the GitHub repository ml faret is about a project called fret imagine the Fret is a super smart robot that can understand and talk about anything you see in a picture that can point out and describe things in the picture using words just like we do this is really cool because it means far can help computers understand pictures and text in a way that's never been done before so you can see it's kind of using language here that's making this so simple that anybody could understand because we asked it to talk to explain it like I'm 12 so it's really making this super easy to understand it says faret is really smart at pointing and talking about things in pictures it learns from a huge collection of examples and it's tested on lots of different tasks so basically this is an AI that has been trained on a large set of images so that it can identify items in new images that you give it so this is pretty cool but how could this be useful to us let's let's just ask ask the code how how can I use this myself check this out it told us how we can install fret on your own computer and then how you can actually train it yourself as long as you have the Basic Hardware requirements you can train data on Apple's machine learning fet yourself so now that we know what this is and how we can actually run it ourselves let's take it one step further let's ask it um give me some projects I could build using this project it actually gave us six different project ideas that we could build with this build a platform for artwork that gives historical context analysis around it that'd be pretty cool develop an app for researchers and conservationists to upload images of animals and plants to identify the species build a smart home system a game that players can upload pictures and fret will generate stories and quests based on the objects and the scenes it detects that would be really cool so I guess actually under each one of these subjects is two different app ideas that could be an educational tool or an accessibility enhancement so if you are someone that has trouble thinking about what projects to build like you know you want to build something but you don't know what you should build literally 12 different AI project ideas that you could build using this ask the code GPT there are so many things you could do with this ask the code GPT you could use it to help you learn new open source projects and figure out where you might be able to make a contribution you could find projects you could build yourself to add to your resume and increase your chances of Landing your dream job the opportunities with a tool like this are really endless next up we have flow bite and you can use this for frontend prompt so that you don't have to write any code by yourself we're here in flowy all we have to do is come up with a prompt that describes what we want it to build so the prompt I'm going to give it is help me build a simple blog following the versel design system and following the substack blog post structure in Tailwind CSS tell it to use the CDN and JavaScript so we thought hey it might be cool to build a simple little blog where we can put some posts out there we know that we like the versel design system and the way that substack blog post are structur so we're going to tell it to copy those systems and then we want to use Tailwind CSS again making sure that we use the CDN like we did before so it's linked in the head the script tag so we can just paste this into repet and of course want to build this with Java Script all right so it gave us the basic code structure that we're going to need and then it tells us a little bit about the code and the steps it says here's the basic HTML template that contains the header the content area and the footer it's going to be structured to resemble substack layout like we told it then it's using Tailwind CSS CDN Link in the head like we specified for it to do and then it's telling us that this is a basic responsive layout if we want to further customize the design to more closely match vel's Aesthetics like we mentioned to it in the prompt or add more advanced stuff it tells us how we can extend uh on top of is to do that so let's copy what they gave us and let's see what it looks like we will get rid of what we have in here for the YouTube homepage and we'll just replace it with our blog website so this looks like it's still missing some of the Tailwind styling I feel like maybe this is not correctly importing the CDN like we did before let's just see if it can fix it for us let's see if it's smart enough to do it no I don't think think I don't think it's quite right on that piece of it if I replace this with a better CDN link yeah then we're going to get what we want and we're going to see those flow bite components so this one we had to tweak it just a little bit but it did give us a really nice layout to start with all of the HTML that we needed and this is why it's still important as a developer to know your tools and know what tools you like to use so that you can recogn recognize those small little mistakes with gpts and just tweak them to get exactly what you want with the minimal amount of effort flowy has some similar use cases to screenshot to code with rapid prototyping and building a design system for your project but it's based on a specific component Library called flowy not sponsored but this Library can help you generate a really pretty looking app in record time our final GPT is designer GPT so let's compare this with the last one because this one is similar but it actually takes it one step ahead and does the deployment for you which is pretty amazing that we could give this just one prompt and have actually a live functional site that people could really access and use deployment can be one of the most annoying pieces of web development so having that taken care of for us by this GPT would be amazing so let's try a personal blog with this one and see if it does better than flow bite for the prompt we'll say design a personal blog layout make it in the style of medium.com cuz that's a popular blog site set it up with eight sample blog posts with different titles all right let's see what we can do with this okay so like here's the pieces that it's going to structure it with I'll now proceed to create the HTML code for this layout once it's ready I'll send it to create the actual web page send it okay HTML is done it's putting some actual JavaScript function in this one okay code is done it's now sending this to create a web page and it's going to give us the link to view it okay once again it's going to need us to give it permissions it wants to talk to repet this time so we can see our live project so I'm just going to confirm permissions for that and our personal blog layout is now live it says if we encounter any issues or want to make adjustments please let me know how I can assist you further all right let's try just clicking this link and see wow this is pretty sweet this is a live website right now you could go to this URL and check this out so this is a great starting point obviously you would have you know work to do with a little more styling and with these posts you would want to make them like go to uh the actual post when you click on it and all that but hey designer GPT did tell you that you can it's happy to assist you further so you could just ask it how to do that and it would give you the code and give you the steps and get it deployed for you and literally without having to write any code you could just type in I want to be able to click on the art of making coffee and see a page with actual blog post and just like that you'd be able to have a place to host that blog on your live site so this is pretty cool we have a fully hosted web app from designer GPT designer GPT would be a great tool to use to help you learn to write clean code for all of your project builds it could also be really useful for creating your developer portfolio just give it all the information you want to include about yourself and it's going to get you up and running right away all right those are the top five gpts that will help you 10x your productivity as a developer now if you're ready to go a step further and learn how to build your own custom gpts don't forget we've created that complimentary webinar training that's going to help you become an AI developer in 20 minutes you'll get three
