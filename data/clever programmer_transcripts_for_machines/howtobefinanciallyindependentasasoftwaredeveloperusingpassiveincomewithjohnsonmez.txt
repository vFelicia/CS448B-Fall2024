let's talk about this what does it mean to be making a hundred thousand dollars a year all of us developers the dream is to make six figures work at a cool company live in San Francisco and just be millionaires right that's it but what's the reality let's talk about it yeah so I mean you know I think the first place you got to start with the reality of this is like where where is it actually gonna take you let's say that you're making that sixfigure income you know yeah you could probably live pretty nice in the short term right you can get a nice car get a decent house payment but but where are you gonna be are you actually gonna be able to save a large amount of money are you actually gonna become wealthy are you actually gonna have any kind of passive income because you know the answer is no like like what what are you gonna get left over with after taxes after everything is is done it's not gonna be a whole lot right and if you take that money if you save that money right maybe you can get you can rent a scooter for a couple you know a little bit you know where you're gonna end up you know in ten years twenty years down the road it's not gonna be enough for you to just you know permanently live off of right you're gonna you're not gonna have freedom you might have the job and you don't even know if you're gonna have the job right so what do you think about this I think that there's not much left 130 even if you're making hundred twenty thousand dollars a year and living in San Francisco after all of the taxes get taken out the state the federal after your expenses your rent being thirty forty thousand dollars a year and then you want to live off of something I feel like your true income is thirty to forty thousand dollars and even that sometimes you might want to buy a car you might want to be going out and you might want to do something you know like traveling so you're not really left with much the money that you can realistically put away at the end of every year would be about I don't know ten thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars which honestly most people don't put away that even that much a year right right so over the course of a decade you would have a hundred thousand dollars left over or less and then what I want you to think about is what would inflation do to it the money that's just there right so I feel like that plan is the old plan of being successful putting someone in 401k and kind of just like hoping and praying and I think in reality when it comes down to you spending ten years or 20 years doing this job I feel like you're not gonna be left with the income that you thought right yeah no I'd say also you know then the big thing is like the one thing that you can't get back which is your time right like and that's the thing is it's like yeah you know you you work the job but all that time that you're putting in right a lot of people think of it as putting in the time right they don't really like go to their job because that's what they want to do I mean maybe you start out I mean there's some days you like your job and whatnot but if you're given the choice I guess if they weren't gonna pay you but and you didn't need any money would you go in and do it you know probably not and so what you're thinking about really is like I mean you've got one life you've got so many years you've got your youth only one time yeah and so are you gonna sacrifice you know all that time basically a portion of your life you know a significant portion in order to to do what right to end up with like you said a hundred thousand after ten years I mean you invest the money maybe it's like you know but but the thing that you know what you really need to be able to do is to be able to earn that time is to have the time like how can you basically have more time right because if you were you know on your deathbed you're 90 years old how much money would you trade how much would you pay to have one more year of life right everything everything like millions of dollars doesn't matter because all of that money as soon as you die it's it's all it's all worthless right so so that's the thing I think to think about is that like you know we think about making money we think about the kind of the present but if you're going to the regular job if you're putting in those eight hours a day or more you basically train your life right you're trading the time that you can't get back and so you got to find another way you got to find a way how can you have that time how can you buy that time now instead of waiting you know spending all that time and then hopefully someday in the future that you're gonna have you know have more time when we in reality the quality at that time is gonna be less right yeah your best time is when you're when you have the you when you're strong and you're young and you can enjoy the time that you have but yes that's the time that most people are working and on time you're not gonna get time back you can get money back money is a replenishing resource I mean apparently I just learned it yesterday even oil itself replenishable resource after millions of years but time is not time we'll go away right so what are some things that you can do one of the tactical things like specific things that you could do for example is we were speaking with I think somebody asked this question abdullah who's in our webinar yesterday we were doing a live training and he asked he's like hey haha should i hire a mentor would it be beneficial for me to actually hire a mentor or whatever and we thought and i thought about that question i'm like okay let me take a stab at this and I thought okay when I started I was actually hiring lots of mentors and I was using lots of my money to invest in myself to get more skills so for example what I would do is I would go in tutor and I would be making twenty thirty forty dollars an hour and all of that money I would make I'll just reinvest it into a developer who was on a platform like code mentor or something like wise aunt or take lessons or whatever like even in person you could find them and hide them and I would pay them 20 30 40 50 dollars an hour and I would think ok for one hour of my time I get one hour of your time or I get one hour of some incredible developer Sam with five or ten years of experience but the arbitrage that I was doing there was for one month of my experience into coding I'm getting five years of experience of somebody right yeah right that's the game I'm playing and so what was happening was if a developer had ten years of experience and I have zero years but I'm paying him like hundred dollars or a thousand dollars or whatever and he's giving me all his hours I'm thinking I'm accelerating really fast so the more money I'm spending there and the more time he's spending with me I'm going from zero to like like I'm getting to two years of experience in like three months of time two months of time because that knowledge is so specific it's custom it's not like sprayandpray which I feel like a lot of what school knowledge is that is very specific because he's doing a job he's right there in the world and so I feel that it's almost like being in a time machine you could actually fastforward time if you reinvest that money into yourself so you know you talked a lot about making a high income skill and then leveraging that I tell people all the time like use that money and I feel like there is a place where our advice actually kind of intersects and it's helpful for people which is I remember asking about when is a good time to invest into something like real estate how much money should you have you like have twenty thousand dollars so I'm like what should you do before twenty thousand dollars and you said invest in yourself right because and the reason why is this is it's real simple it's like in fact I got you know an another version of this question someone said well how would you invest $1,000 was the best way and I was like not no like it's not worth the overhead now right because if you invest $1,000 into something I don't care what kind of interest rate you get you could get a 30% return it's not gonna it's gonna take you forever to actually amount to anything right so but what you can do with that thousand dollars is you can invest it in yourself to increase your earning potential where $1,000 isn't a lot of money where $20,000 isn't a lot of money right and that's why I said when you said you know do how much money should you invest and I said at least 20 because if you're looking at $20,000 and you're like oh this is a ton of money then the problem is that you're not earning money fast enough so you're not gonna be able investment if and so so the best and highest form of investment that you can do is to invest in yourself to increase your earning potential so you can get to the point where you're making we're not broke right we're not making we're making more than a hundred thousand dollars a year so you can save fifty thousand last year $80,000 $100,000 a year and now you've got now you can invest that money you can actually make some real money with that right because the thing about it I think a lot of people understand about finances and especially you know our situation is that you know the relative costs right or the costs for us to live like what it costs for us to you know have food have shelter have a nice car right even even living comfortably that doesn't change over time right that's there's pretty much okay so when you make more money right when let's say that let's say it cost you $80,000 to live a comfortable lifestyle yep okay if you're making $100,000 a year you're getting by like you're fine you're able to live the comfort but you're not able to save anything okay but now if you can make $200,000 a year right you're when you reach that point your cost is still 80,000 it doesn't so now you have all this leftover money and if you make 300 like it just keeps on scaling up and so but the beauty of that is that the money that you're saving that you're making more than you need to live off of you can take that money and you can invest that money and the bigger that gap is the more that you can invest and the more that you can create passive income so you can get to the point where that 80 thousand dollars you need to live off of comfortably it's coming automatic where you're not having to work for it and that's the key that's the key that's when you're not broke right because I would even say like that it doesn't matter how much money you're making right because we said a hundred thousand dollars you're you're broke I would say you're broke unless you're living off of money you didn't have to work for if you have to go and do something to make that money if that money isn't automatically coming to you you're broke because why because as soon as you stop working you're poor yeah so you're just one step away from poor right or however much money you have in your bank account until it runs out but if you have money that's coming in that you don't have to work for yeah then that's the only time you're wealthy huh right and you doesn't even have to be a lot of money if you can live up in 20 thousand dollars a year and you got twenty five thousand dollars with the passive income you're wealthy you're more wealthy than the lawyer making three hundred thousand dollars a year because you don't have to work you can sit on your butt all day and do nothing whereas he has to work to maintain his lifestyle they exactly go to other countries yeah like they'll so like what a lot of people will do is the Lord there costs a lot which is pretty beneficial and especially if you're getting passive income I mean even if you're getting let's say somehow you figure out a way to get passive income from real estate or whatever the case may be and you're getting 20 30 40 50 thousand dollars a year it's possible you could just pick up your bags and start traveling to different places and live pretty frugal leave because in other countries it's a lot less expensive than let's say United States living in San Francisco oh yeah alright so you could be in Bali Indonesia having the time of your life for twenty thousand dollars a year or thirty thousand dollars a year and in that case you're pretty rich exactly yeah it doesn't have to be a lot of money right it's like it's again like we could talk about like you can make a lot of money at a job but it's very similar to you know like you know being in a prison like you're not gonna call home and be like yeah yeah it's okay mom you know this prison is awesome we have like these awesome couches and we've got you know these great TVs and the bars they're made of gold the bars are made of gold in this prison you got check the out right yeah you still be in prison yeah it doesn't matter like it could be beautiful and it could be the most expensive extravagant prison in the world but it's still prison you still don't have a choice you have to be there and it's the same thing with a high income job right well you don't have an investor yep and create passive income you could be making a ton of money you can have a nice car you can have a nice house but guess what you don't get to enjoy it because you don't have time and that's that's the difference that's why it makes such a difference while you're still broke when when you're making a lot of money is because you have to work for that money I hundred percent agree like that is a very important thing so now somebody wants to get to the people have to figure out how to get to that and I think yesterday's called that was really important for people and people watching this right now your first step is to figure out how you're gonna get a high income skill and you need to stop thinking that seventy eighty ninety thousand dollars is a lot of money right the only way to get to the point or you can get passive income isn't happening anytime soon right right I really think if people can wrap their mind around that it will really help them because people are looking in like terms of one year to year windows but what they feel I Tony Robbins says he'll he says he'll overestimate what you can do in a year but he goes you'll underestimate what you can do in ten years in a decade 100% yeah so if you think in terms of five years which you talk about a lot or you think in terms of ten years like Tony Robbins that's a you have a lot of time that's the long term play should be thinking of I'm thinking of it for myself in terms of a long term play like I'm not thinking of stopping anytime soon I'm thinking in 10 years if I have passive income great even if I don't I'm still young as and I can keep going but that allows me to play the long game and hustle and keep at it at the process if I'm thinking man by the time I'm 24 right now so if I'm like but it's how I'm 26 I'll just have passive income and that should be perfect if I'm 26 and I'm not there I'm just gonna be like whining and crying like a little like I don't have the money you know and I'm gonna quit so I think that having that mindset of really playing the longterm game there is a lot of benefit to it so talk to me about a little bit about like that you talk a lot about the processoriented mindset so somebody wants to be able to make that income how would that help them I mean the big thing is is that the thing that we always talk about which is leverage right that that's the key there because the thing is like you can only do so much on your own right so let's say that you aren't you know you're really telling to developer you make a lot of money as a regular job what are you gonna make like I mean some of my coaching clients that are living in New York or San Francisco the top I've ever seen one of them make is like a total of like $250,000 total comp which is a lot of money I mean it's it's not you know but but it's it's not you know it's so in in in big terms it's not a lot right so you know that's all you can do by yourself right and maybe if you're a freelancer and maybe you can build like two three hundred bucks an hour maybe you can do a little better than that make you do like three four hundred thousand dollars a year I could say but you're capped out at what one person can do when you're doing that kind of stuff what you need is leverage leverage is utilizing something else like a fulcrum right to be able to to get more than what one person can do right and so that leverage can you can exist you can have it in multiple ways right like even when you're doing freelancing we were talking about like you actually hired other people to work for you so you almost have like an agency you're building a business around that so that's leverage okay you know in the business leverages other people it's other people but it's also it could be a platform right it could be things that sell right if I go and I have to walk to people I'm like hey do you want to buy this thing I can only sell as much as I can talk to people but if I have a website and I have people visiting my youtube channel and be visiting my blog and then I have emails that are automatically going out to them and selling them I can I'm leveraging that I'm leveraging that so that I have more on my time right and I think you know the big powerful concept here is to understand that like the you know you in order to make more money by yourself without leverage you just have to work harder Yeah right you got to get smarter you got to work harder but there's a limit to that but you know let's say you have a website and let's say that that website is getting like I don't know like a thousand visitors a day and let's say from that thousand videos visitors a day you can make let's let's let's be generous and say a hundred bucks a day okay well in order for you to make a thousand bucks a day from the hundred all you need to do is have instead of a thousand people visiting your website ten thousand yes and it doesn't require any more work right I mean there's really not much of a difference between that that's the power of leverage and if you end up making it so that you can get ten thousand people to visit your website per day now you're making or what do we say a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand now you're making $10,000 or a thousand dollars a day to ten thousand dollars a day right and it just scales you know to do but the the beauty of it is using leverage like that is that it doesn't require any more work for me right you know like we've got YouTube channels we've got blogs right we have people visiting our pages and although we're making content right we're getting more and more people Yeah right on a daily basis and as that grows everything we do gets multiplied right we're doing the same amount of work I'm not doing any more work when I had 2,000 subscribers on my channel I'm not doing any more work now than having you know almost 200,000 subscribers right we're doing the same amount of work but we're getting paid more because of leverage whereas when you work your regular job and you don't have leverage you don't get paid more just because you've been there well maybe you make a make get a little bit of rain but yeah you want to make more money you gotta work harder yep there's so much leverage once you have something that allows you to multiply outside of you doing something so for example when you're sleeping your YouTube channel is still showing videos right and people can find value in everything so for example we have so even right now in my life I'm like okay we can either sell more products or we have enough leverage based on the channel to go out to other people to sell them on and we can help them with their social media agency and launches and charge $20,000 for three days in person or we could actually have developers who are under clever programmer agency and then like put them on up work by the way if you guys think that's a good idea you should comment that below because I was talking to Erin about then I was considering it actually I was actually considering it make an agency in a clever programmer we have lots of developers simple programmer has lots of developers yeah I'm actually curious about that too like how that would work and I feel like that could be really beneficial for the developers because they could have like you could vet them for example or I could vet them and see the quality of them and then like help them land or negotiate then they'd perform the work like how what do you actually think about that idea no I mean it's agency model it makes sense because they get to benefit from the branding and the reputation that we've built so they'll be more likely to get the jobs they'll get the experience and they'll also have some people to turn to because if you're just a freelancer by yourself on up work and you're bidding on jobs you know you don't have the branding you don't have the the name behind it and also when you're doing the work if you have a question you don't know what to do it's just you you it's not really many people you can ask but if you belong to you know our brand under our umbrella we've got you know a hundred different developers or you know experts that you can ask they can help you you know when you're stuck on a project so I think there's definitely some value and on both sides there so this idea is really coming along Erin's get ready to get overwhelmed there's a lot of more work so let us know what you think about this but this is just an example of great leverage you know so it's like there are multiple ways you can go about it and those are things that you don't need to manually put in so much work to kind of work for you right so I feel like building a high income skill is very important but then figuring out quickly the way to leverage it so like the best advice I could give to somebody you know with my naive brain and you could add on to it more and give us something more intelligent but the one thing I say to everyone who's doing coding is the simplest way the most braindead way to get leverage right is the same notes that you take for yourself the same things that you learned for yourself just put them on medium calm right right which is a blog posting website or put it on YouTube like the same thing you're learning put it for yourself and just start teaching whatever you're learning just start putting it on YouTube without even thinking like you're teaching it like almost document it for yourself and you'll have an audience that you can leverage so yeah you know that's what I kind of think yeah no I agree I mean that's the the whole idea is that you should make whatever work that you do work more than once and that's you know that's the key whatever you're doing you want to take whatever you're doing and have it be a way to multiply that right and so you know if you're gonna learn you're gonna spend the time learning something you might as well teach it as well because it doesn't take you much more effort to do that and it's a multiplier right it's like you know yeah I guess we could look at the you know kind of the levels right if you do something right like listen you become a programmer and you're doing code like I said you can only do that yourself you can only make so much money you're kind of capped there that's kind of the first level but then above that is teaching people to do something you can't paid a lot more money to do that why it's because it's leverage it's because when you're coding on a project you can only do that project but if you teach a thousand developers how to code and they start coding on projects now you're creating a ha a huge more a huge amount more value in the world and you always get paid based on the value that you produce and so then the third level is a platform I'm writing this down you know you've got like platforms like Facebook or Amazon or Instagram or YouTube these are all platforms and what they allow people to do is to sell a product a service or to teach you know on that platform so there's multiple teachers there and so there by having that platform like thing about the YouTube platform they're getting massive amounts of value because they're enabling people to have a place to teach to teach other people how to do to create all that value and that's why they make the most money and so you start off learning something having a high income skill but then you graduate to the second level where you teach other people how to do it and then if you get to that third level you can build a platform that's where you really make the money because you have them why do you make the most money because you have the most amount of leverage wherever you have the most leverage that's where you're gonna make the most amount of money agree and again this is something you guys can get started with today like literally if you're watching this it's great that you're consuming this content it's awesome but we don't give a unless unless you take action like that's what we really care about that's what I really care about like please if you're watching this content take some action so for example for you it might look like like taking the five word script you wrote today the day before or last week just literally make it public on medium you know yeah or make a little twominute video and put it on your YouTube and if you do that and you put in a comments below I'll jump there and I'll comment back because I think that would be really awesome but please like start taking some kind of action and the great thing is that you're not even going out of your way if you're documenting it so like for example you can think of it as like level one you learning a skill level two you're teaching a skill level three building a platform but I think you can just start doing the learning and the documenting at the same time which will build up which will give you an audience and people that you're providing value can help all you need to do is just whatever you're learning just put it out there exactly don't even talk like an expert don't pretend to be an expert just put it out there hundred percent yep that's how I got started right I didn't know no one gave me no one gave me a little scepter and today you're an authority now yeah I just I just started doing it I just started talking about it I just started creating blog posts I just started writing about it and then when you do it long enough and you influence enough people and enough people start talking about you pretty soon you're the guy you're the authority you don't you don't have to be anointed I guess that's that's the thing is like people are waiting to be anointed instead of just taking action right just just assume they're waiting for a gatekeeper someone to say you're good enough you have permission and you know what you're what you're gonna have is you know you're gonna have haters and that's that's what you're gonna have to deal with but you got to get out there and you got to do it because no one else is gonna say okay now you're ready right it's like it's like you know people that are at a job and they're waiting to get that promotion but I never asked the boss for the promotion and they're just waiting until someone recognized never happens yesterday we were on a call yeah you know and Brett was talking about it and he's like he got 1% or something yeah and I immediately called it out and I was like did you like I feel like you probably didn't ask for more right exactly right so I feel for him but then at the end of the call he actually left it as a message in the chat where he was like I was afraid to like actually ask for more right right so if you don't ask you don't get I told that lesson to Aaron who's walking can you can you zoom in on him right there if you don't ask you don't get Aaron remember if you don't ask you don't get yeah there you go so remember like you have to be able to ask for those things and be able to demand those things you know like so when it comes to negotiations it can be literally as simple as most people are performing really well most bosses would be more than happy to pay them more like would not have a problem but just sometimes those conversations don't start oh yeah yeah no it's big sometimes you ask for the moon sometimes you get the moon or sometimes you don't earn alright guys so this was the video if you're gonna make $100,000 you're gonna be broke which is a really sad part but the really great part is that if you actually internalize that and you make it your belief instead of being depressed you can do something about it yeah aim to make a million dollars or five million dollars or ten million dollars aim to make it passive aim to make it where you don't have to work for it then you're not broke that's what I would say right so aim to make it passive eventually where you don't have to work and you are not gonna be broke because your passive income is gonna be working on your behalf alright so that is the ultimate goal where you're gonna stop being broke it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of effort it takes a lot of hard hard work it's really hard but I believe that it is worth it definitely right I believe that this is a cause worth fighting for for yourself for your family for for the freedom that you would want to have in your life because I value a lot of freedom a lot I know John values freedom like crazy so that's what it is I think I hope that this video about providing with some value please comment below what was your biggest takeaway from this video this helps us me and John going to the questions
