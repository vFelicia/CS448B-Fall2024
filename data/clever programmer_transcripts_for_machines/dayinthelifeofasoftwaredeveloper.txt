hey you what's up how's it going welcome this video you know we're gonna be talking about we're gonna be talking about a day in the life of a software developer now is it just me or is this a very popular trend now everybody in the goddamn mothers doing this video so why you Kazi is a new talking to me i'm Kazi hello hi nice to meet you and if you like to meet me to the smash that like button you know what I'm saying and subscribe to the channel morty you're gonna become a great developer you subscribe alright let's continue everybody I've been looking around everywhere right it seems like a very popular thing to do every youtuber who's a developer starts off with this and then they blow up and then that's all they do so guess what you know what I think it's time that I made a video on this topic to again this is one of my favorite parts where I get to take something I drew up on the whiteboard actually started in my brain then I bring it over here I cut it up and it starts turning it into reality and before we continue I do want to let you know that if you want to become a software developer or a freelance developer be able to travel and earn an income and you also want to put in the hard work that this actually requires but guess what I have a three part free master class for you that is absolutely amazing it is if you are interested in becoming a Python developer the link is in the description below it's a ton of value for your beautiful face all you got to do is pop in your email and then I unlocked the entire master class for you let's continue so let's talk about what you guys are here for what does a day in the life of a software developer look like and now for me my routine it's very simple you know what it is I don't really have a routine and everybody who's trying to tell you in all their software developer videos I mean including mine to be honest like I made one and I said I showed that I have this perfect routine which at that time for that few months I kind of did but to be honest I wish life was like that because life is very messy like sometimes you are out there and boxing with your girlfriend and sometimes you're supporting your girlfriend after she has ran from Santa Monica to Las Vegas on barefoot oh cool crazy stuff but what's my point my point is that look life is not that straight forward it's pretty complicated and it's messy and overall I guess what I'm trying to say is that for software developers people always try to put us in a box nerds behind computers and that's all they do and yes while we are nerds and we love data and analytics and stuff with code we are human beings and we're also people who love to enjoy life and do activities and enjoy sports and all that kind of stuff right like when you look online people paint this picture which at least in my opinion most of the times it's like really boring and dull and I could never do that my life sounds kind of crazy there's all kinds of stuff I'm doing coding allows me to travel and be able to do all those things sup Naz there we go now dance all right come on bro let's go trick your [ __ ] let's do a challenge poop himself after it for human elevator for me ready me in the elevator okay let's go good okay let's do it Oh press it you press it like okay let's do it oh [ __ ] we gotta do this boys this elevator is slow as [ __ ] come on come on come on come on see here I don't think so guys I think we're gonna win I think we're gonna win how does it feel to lose Naz you know why his elevator was ready up so as long as Josie pressed it oh ha ha your velvet elevator was downstairs uhhuh sometimes I want to see my mom in Chicago sometimes my dad in Chicago or my family members all over you know California or whatever it may be and I can go ahead and do that while doing something I love which is coding and creating stuff taking out on my head and turning it into reality so when you aren't thinking about coding please also think about do you actually enjoy it and would you actually overcome all of those challenges because to become a developer that's something you really have to love I'm in Detroit Michigan with my boy nas yeah to do the course yeah we're shooting a prop of a JavaScript course and literally like living with me right now that's it yeah I'm actually living in it yeah but that's the cool thing about programming and software development I feel like it gives you that lifestyle to be able to do cool [ __ ] and I know that's why I like it why do you like it you do remote work and your discipline person all you can pretty much see go from nine to five you're not doing this there's no there's no one telling you what to do you get up when you want I can literally go like I go out like go to Bali right now is still work there's 20 fine what is the reason that you code what's your reason I want you to go ahead and comment that below and let me know what is your reason for doing it get up what you want obviously figure out what you want you get decide what party's gonna do depending on what you're doing and also now we're here this is the Hudson cafe now here's the thing quoting for me actually opened up a ton of opportunity in all kinds of areas that allow me to actually speak in front of people that allow me to meet cool people it allowed me to travel the world go to Colombia and all those types of things because in the start I was a freelance when I was making six figures per year I figured out how to do that with a lot of hard work but then I also figured out how to take that and turn it into a business and now into a YouTube channel which is a similar pattern you see a lot of other developers doing like take a look at tech lead or Joma tech I mean they became developers and then they left it because YouTube there's a lot more monetary gain to be made there than just coding I still code and I still do that type of stuff but I'm just doing a lot less freelancing work I just love it man I love being able to create something whether it's in Python or JavaScript or whatever it is like I love being able to create a graphical user interface I love being able to get my ideas out and turn them into a real thing and the start for me it started off with using an excel sheet to do stuff and as a coach I would travel to people's homes and then they would pay me per hour to coach them in chess and also people would pay me to teach them coding and so I was like hey why don't I just make something that once I get to that person's house it automatically logs it so my excel sheet would detect that type of stuff but then the excel sheet got really lame in doing that and it reached its max capacity so I could learn something more I had to learn something bigger and lo and behold I ran into this beautiful thing you little cool kids called programming and that's where I started getting really fascinated about it I'm like man the applications and the use cases of coding are just so vast and so amazing I need to learn this thing and then once I got into it I realized there is there's pretty much an infinite amount of things that I could actually do with coding and there was no limit to what I could do if I could think it I could create it whether it's a mobile app or whether it's an app online on website if you think about entering Facebook I think we're entering Mark Zuckerberg drain I literally think we are entering a part of the cerebral cortex and we're entering his universe that he created I feel like that's a very important thing you kind of got to get in your heart about coding and if you can get that I think then you can do a lot of other things that is the hard work because becoming better in becoming a software developer and being able to get paid for it right like I was making six figures as a freelance developer I tell this to people and they're like well you know that's not easy it's not it's not easy that's not the point it's very difficult if you love it you will persist through every difficulty that actually comes in your way cuz programming don't get me wrong is ridiculously difficult and at times it's downright frustrating disappointing and has you freaking pulling out the hair out of the roots of your brain because certain things just don't make sense you'll spend eight hours and the code isn't working and then you will come back and the next day it's working and you go look what the hell happened somebody will be like oh yeah your API was getting throttled and you're like what's throttling and then you're like what's API it's a tough journey it's very confusing journey it's very overwhelming with all of the stuff you gotta learn you gotta learn four different frameworks and you got to learn new technology every single day you got to learn how to be able to read code you got to learn how to actually get negotiation skills and soft skills to be able to land clients and so if you are jumping into it because you see it as an opportunity where you can jump in and create an additional revenue source for yourself don't do coding do the stock market get paid in dividends start a side hustle start a business start a ecommerce business sell women's perfume sell products but don't jump into coding if that's the only reason you want to do it if you want to jump into coding because you love it and you truly enjoy it and you know at this point if you are a coder that's great you already know why it's so enjoyable but if you not a developer and you're watching this video and you're like man I'm thinking about it you have to experience it for yourself you got to go at your own pace you know go slow you don't have to get there fast because a lot of my joy for coding was killed in colleges and things like that and so what you really want to be able to do is you want to be able to just coat it your own pace and not do such crazy things that like in college the first week will be like a print your name and second week is like make the Domino's app so the difficulty just increases really really fast okay so go slow go at your own pace really enjoy the art of development I put in a lot of work you know when I say this to people people don't it's hard for them to actually understand this or believe this but I was putting in 18 to 19 hours of work every single day and I pretty much you know gave up on the idea of having this thing called life and so it's really important for you to understand like what I was able to achieve in that time wasn't because I was smart I just put in as much work as somebody would in four years of time you know I was able to put that work in about six three months or six months and then I was able to just get a head start you know I didn't focus on anything else that's all I did I just lived breathed and eight code for 20 hours a day you know and my friend Tenzin would be with me and we would go to these coworking spaces and learn it and it was awesome it was fantastic okay and so I hope like my goal with this video is to just give you some of my personal experience with coding and get you to critically think of why you want to become a developer you know why do you want to do this and what kind of lifestyle do you want to have that's my day in the life of a software developer I really hope you enjoyed this video this is kaki I love your face and oh by the way if you haven't already smashed that like button break [ __ ] subscribe to the channel I love your face this is Kazi and that's always I'll see you June in the next video
