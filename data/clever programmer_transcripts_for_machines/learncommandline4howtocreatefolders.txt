hey guys all right so as promised in this video i want to show you how you can actually create a new folder and the reason why I want to keep these videos like short little nuggets is because I want you to try these things out as you go please do not just sit and watch this and learn this whether you're doing it for school or whether you're doing it for your personal enjoyment or for your job whatever it is actively be a part of this because it'll all seem so easy so obvious you'll be like died all makes sense but then you'll sit there and your face will be blank and your mind will just be going numb so I don't want that to happen to you please follow along all right pause this video right now follow along or have my video on one screen or like half of the screen on the other half actually have your command line open and follow this so in this video I promise you I'm going to show you a creole folder so let's do that so I have this playground folder okay what if I deleted it so I'm just going to go ahead and delete it it's gone and i'm going to simply create a folder so let me hit CD because CD takes me back home or you can do CD squiggly and i will hit LS and i will go to CD documents and then I'll see PWD and I am right here right that's what's around me if I hit a less you see all those things around me ok I want to create a new folder let's call this folder playground how do I do it mkay dir essentially it stands for make directory ok so MK der make directory and I think that should work in git bash if you're on Windows and MK dirt followed by the folder that you want so what do you want to name it so we're going to name it playground so I'm going to hit enter and i will hit and you can see it's right there how cool is that ok i'm going to give you a little sneak peek of a bit again i'm going to delete it and i'm going to do MK der or i can just hit up on my keyboard remember you can recall you or last commands by just hitting up and so I'm going to hit up and pay attention to that side at the top pay attention to that ok you're going to see playground popup right there all right three two one boom took a little bit longer than three two one but you get the points right there so look at that I didn't even actually have to do anything it was like magic I just got to do it right from the keyboard right from the command line ok so these are just some shortcuts you'll see that it'll keep on adding more and more value to your programming skills as you learn more of the command line ok so that's it for this video practice this right now and i'll see you in the next video
