Python frameworks so there are two big frameworks Jango and flask like I've mentioned cure my recommendations flask is pretty simple but the problem is that okay let's just talk about quickly what a framework is so if you were to do web development Python you would have to pull out your hair not because of Python Python is awesome but because web development you'd have to write all your own code but if you use a framework with Python like flask the benefit of that is that it does all the big heavy lifting for you that you don't have to worry about anymore so creating servers and making things go online on a website okay make other people be able to see your website it's super easy you can do it with just a few lines of code flask is super light weight again as I'm talking write these things down flask is pretty lightweight and it's cool but the problem is because it's too lightweight sometimes it's you have to write a lot of code to make things work whereas Django is a little bit more advanced looking and can be confusing sometimes but it's what we call batteries included and it comes with a lot of libraries a lot of big things juicy meaty things built in there so think of it like bunch of developers who gave up and had sleepless nights God probably divorces because it works so hard and like got huge eye bags writing all this code and creating this amazing thing for you and now you could just steal it with just a few lines of code and use it okay so think of it think of Django like that and you could build things pretty quickly okay so web development django developers make about a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year jingle is my more preferred framework it's a little bit advanced but if it's taught to you the right way you can pick it up fast and then you don't have to look back django is my preferred way to go write that down second best text editors or coding editors for pi so there are a lot of them there is sublime text there is at hum and then there is pycharm sublime text and atom you can use interchangeably sublime text that annoying thing is it keeps asking for purchase whereas atom is completely free so you guys can just download atom to write your code in pie chart is my personal favorite IDE or let's just simplify and say coding editor it's my favorite but I would recommend you guys to get into PyCharm around the second or third month mark of your coding because it is a little bit more technical and it is a little bit more advanced and in the start it might confuse you more than it helps you because of how big it is but again is just a few practical things you need to know and then boom boom boom you're all caught up alright so for someone who wants to enter into web dev what would you advise them Jango seems challenging with their setups and admin Django is honestly pretty simple to get started with just the starting part is sometimes tricky but once you get past a little bit of starting time it's pretty easy to build things up really fast with Django so again I'm a huge fan of Django but if you have extra time in your life learn a little bit of flask maybe spend a week learning flask and that will show you the things you need to be doing with web development and how you're doing them because you're gonna be writing each line of code yourself you'll get a good grasp of what the heck is going on and then when you do them in Django you'll just be like oh it's just like this thing I did in Flast except it's easier now and it won't confuse you okay so that's really it
