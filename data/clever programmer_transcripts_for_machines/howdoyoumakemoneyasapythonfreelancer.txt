and also we have a cat to everyone yeah in this video I want to share with you guys our team vision and also want to share with you guys like the team themselves what we are trying to do is create a community of Python freelancers that earn an income and that's a very specific goal that we have so you can see we have like a small team but we have our hearts into this and we have a very awesome vision and every day literally we come up with so many ideas and you have to write them out so this entire place is like Project Mayhem from Fight Club you know all the white boards are just like filled out with crazy ideas of how we can provide you guys with more value and we have some amazing ideas and one of those ideas I want to share with you in this video what we wanted to do was create a program where you could take projects from platforms like Al Broadcom and then we bring those real projects and we create a video course around how you can actually complete that project so let's say we found some project online it had a three hundred dollar market value that somebody was willing to pay for it right now we would take that project and then we would make a video course on that and teach you all the skills that are necessary so let's just say the project was scraping web links from from a website and all the PDF links we would just take that and teach you all the skills that need it so the web scraping skills the Python skills and then what we want is for you to be able to go apply for that job on up work and actually be able to land it because you have all the skills you need and then get paid so some projects might be you know like $100 some projects you might make like $300 and the goal is really to get you started and then eventually you can even land like five hundred dollars projects or a thousand dollar projects each project we build it will say the exact dollar value next to it the screenshot of the actual project from work and the exact skills required to complete it we're calling this the seven step Papa Python freelancing system so our vision is that we actually go get a client you know and take you behind the scenes with us on that journey so we go through we find the client we land the client we do the outreach we do their project we get their invoice and then we actually show you behind the scenes and show you the project we worked on how we reach out to the client the followups that we did the deals that we negotiated how much was the contract for and then the proof of their invoice and we show that to you as well and then in the course we'll obviously show you how to make that project so each module like that's how we kind of imagine it you know we take a project we land it and then we kind of document the entire thing around it and with this program AWP we want to start to laser focus in on this because we realized we recently made this post on our Instagram and everybody was so excited by it which was all about freelancing what I want to be able to show you guys is how easy these opportunities can be okay so basically like we can go type in and literally click jobs right here you type in Python if we scroll down we'll look for a type of job that looks a little easier so look we want to be able to take a project like this scrape two sides walk me through guys using something like Python and beautifulsoup now what we can do and what we want to do is you want to take a project like this and we want to put like a dollar value on that project like say $300 and then in the course I want to show you exactly how to build this project alright and then you build it and now you can come to this guy and we'll show you exactly how to land him and work with this client and crushing it on up work with Python sober like let's give you guys that skill so this program we're gonna focus on that okay so this is Aaron who is our product specialist so he is the one who's gonna be helping make the content for this course and the main instructor for this program okay and this is Frankie who the our video producer and he's gonna be actually editing all these videos and putting them together for you guys in this module so it's really we are working here together and I'm just the pretty face okay now we're working together in this program to make sure that we give you guys the highest quality material and everything that you guys need to succeed so look if this is something that excites you you are into this vision you like this idea and let's say you haven't joined this program awp yet i encourage you to enroll in this program right click the button below or somewhere will link it on this page and if this is the type of vision you like where we're headed with this you want to be part of this Python freelancing community and start earning an income who knows we might actually even do leaderboards but who's earning the most revenue every week which i think is gonna be a lot of fun and I hope that you enjoy it too but jump on in because we're taking this cohort and we're going for the next three months right we're gonna go live and we're gonna make sure that these guys get the result in that you get the results so if you're on the fence jump on in be a part of this tightknit community and we're gonna get massive results we're going to find these opportunities together and we're gonna go far so click the button jump in this program the doors close tonight and let love to see you inside so basically in this system we're gonna show you how to reach out to a prospect interview followup with the clients negotiating a deal landing the client completing their project all the way to receiving the invoice
