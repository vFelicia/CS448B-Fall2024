where is the demand and how much are they paying what is the overall salary finally number three is productivity how productive can you be with that language how fast can you build application nowadays companies startups they want you to be able to build fast applications in a day in two and so picking a language that is efficient and easy to learn develop with is one of the most important

number five c plus plus now i know you're talking about the new you just bad is so old it's not interesting no shush listen to me c plus plus it is the first languages that came out not only that this is a language that all the other languages stem from if you know c plus you will pretty much be able to learn all the other languages now on top of that some of the top companies uber google amazon facebook they all use c plus plus gaming companies like ea nintendo sony blizzard are all using c plus plus for their gaming engine to build games so if you want to build games like star wars we're talking assassin's creed anything else related to games you need to know c plus plus if you're for example actually machine learning tesla's auto pilot system is actually built on c plus plus like what how crazy is that and according to indeed.com and the average c plus plus developer still makes a hundred and four thousand dollars this is a program language that is not going away anytime soon and is still going to be a very pinnacle of software development number four c sharp now it is a very useful laker that is easy to learn and it was built to compete with java and right now it is having a crazy comeback here's why right now windows applications like microsoft office microsoft excel we're talking photoshop we're talking internet explorer scratch that one though now on top of this right now vr development which is going really high is actually using tsharp so if you are interested in building games with csharp okay this is the place to go over a few years coming it's going to skyrocket like crazy believe me there's an amazing community with csharp developers and you will not be left out another fun fact about csharp is it's actually used for building virtual reality games right we're talking oculus we're talking google the google virtual reality glasses i think right whatever it's called so as it's going up in ranks as more people use virtual reality c is going to be even more popular and more demanded now according to indeed.com c developers right now make over 98 000 on average but i really think it's gonna increase throughout the time with the whole virtual reality aspect number three java now java is a very popular language to learn so when you're talking about building android applications that is what it's used for also very much known in the enterprise software and actually listen this 97 of enterprise applications use java for developing largescale software that means that if you want to work at companies like google like microsoft like uber they all use java for their large applications web applications enterprise software that is what they use now according to indeed.com java developers on average make a hundred and nineteen thousand dollars and in terms of demand at the time of filming there are over 33 000 jobs so the demand is there the necessity is there and based on that it is one of the most demanded programming languages out there now if we do take a look at google trends we can see that this programming language is declining just a little bit because all languages like kotlin which are trying to replace it but i personally think it's going to take a long time for these languages to replace something as big as java that is used by so many diverse applications i personally learned it when i was a beginner as well and so you should learn it too number two python oh you guys are gonna hate me for this aren't you what but python's number one no python is number one python is number one all right look python is a simple programming language it is one of the easiest ones to learn as personally don't worry still one of my favorites okay now this language is actually used by some of the biggest companies in the world we're talking google facebook to build backend applications so for example when you're thinking of like of you clicking like on an instagram post right well check this out all the logic that happens and how you click on it how that data is saved later on that is happening through python with the help of a framework like django instagram yes instagram actually uses python for the whole backend application so if you're interested in building backend applications for companies like instagram and so forth this is going to be the place to do it on top of that it is probably one of the most the number one language that is used for machine learning so you're talking siri the voice assistant for machine me it was joining a learning which makes sense it loves to jam it does its best right selfdriving cars machine learning and selfdriving cars that is built on python and even like face detection right right the face id that is using python as well so listen python it is one of the top programming languages it is not going to go away anytime soon personally one of my favorite ones according to indeed.com on average python developers actually make 117 000 so if you're someone who is interested in building machine learning applications and building backend applications but this is going to be the programming language for you on top of that it's probably one of the most easiest ones to learn also it's one of the most demanding ones with over 68 000 jobs according to stackoverflow survey python is one of the top languages out there too google trends is showing the fact that python is on the actual upscale and because of the amazing community for python because of the amazing libraries like psychic learn like django that allows people to build humongous applications right we're talking machine learning we're talking ai we're talking voice assistants like siri we're talking data science or accommodation engines like on amazon where you say hey you might also like this that is why python is so important number one drum roll please javascript now i know you're like nas but no hold on this is not javascript's number no hold on listen to this okay the javascript is it's a language i always recommend to any beginner not only because it's so easy to learn but also because it's visual okay but you write something and you right away see the results this was my first language this is how i got my career started now let's talk about some facts javascript has been the number one programming language on stack over for developer story for the past seven years applications like facebook front end like instagram anything you see on the website what do you think it's built with javascript because of its popularity right we have frameworks like react.js liveview.js like english and and many others to go ahead and come in use javascript to allow people to build more applications tesla for example right especially right now cross platform replication meaning applications for ios and for android are being built with technologies like react native which is using javascript for example tesla the tesla app that you see on the app store that is built using javascript that is built using react native netflix their whole system on the back end they are using node.js with javascript i can go one and on and on guys but all i will say is that it is my recommendation for you to learn if you're an absolute beginner if you're someone who doesn't know where to start and you're like nas what do i do what i don't know there's so many
