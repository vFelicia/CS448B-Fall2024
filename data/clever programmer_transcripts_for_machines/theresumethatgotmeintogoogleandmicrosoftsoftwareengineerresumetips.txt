can develop and put out there to be able to attract recruiters and to be able to land the job that you want exactly nicely said that nicely said all right let's go all right so where we have interviewed ad before me so where have you interviewed that danielle so guys i actually only applied to three different places i got the three interviews and i used after three offers and those were blue origin google and microsoft and it was a lot of fun going through that experience it was super challenging going through the technical questions but more importantly what was the important part is getting my foot in the door making sure that the recruiters saw my resume they saw my information and they actually wanted to bring me on site or start to interview whether it was a phone screen or whatever the way that the company decided exactly exactly so you have interviewed the companies like microsoft correct so if i if i highlight the companies right here right big companies like what like microsoft right right here right you've got microsoft you've interviewed the companies like blue origin yep yep uh google right and this and this is right after this is right after you graduated college this was actually while i was still in college i still had a whole semester in college when i got my first job offer exactly exactly so it's really cool man you really got your stuff you really got your stuff together really really fast yeah and it was fun because my last semester it was just about passing at that point i was like i got the job offer i'm just gonna kind of try to get through school yeah i was in the fortunate situation to do that yeah yeah cool cool cool awesome i personally guys as of as a for me guys personally um i went to hell let me see no worries no worries i went ahead and oh computer's struggling ooh computer struggling oh i went ahead and i interviewed the companies like google interview companies like volunteer uh interview with companies like for example uh twitter khan academy do you guys know khan academy raise your hand if you know khan academy nomination all right okay cool cool yeah khan academy twitter um google palantir and google actually flew me out all the way to cali which is really interesting and the way they do stuff guys is they flew you flo they fly you out to california and they pay for the whole trip so they pay you they pay you to fly out and do an interview with them they pay for the flight they pay for the food they pay for transportation for everything i'm not kidding those two days were the best vacation day i've ever had because they were absolutely free absolutely free literally literally nothing nothing nothing to charge so that that was a really cool part guys by the way you guys still on the call looks like our zoom call is like okay cool you're still there beautiful so let's see we got who we got we got here oh look at that all these amazing people alana pedro rafael vlad brandon dang you guys look at that are you guys ready to start to learn what you need to do to be able to build that resume for yourself guys let's go let's go let's go thumbs up i love it i love it everyone's giving a thumbs up i say we get into it nas cool let's get into it cool so first thing why building a strong resume is important well if you want to even try to get your foot in the door you need to be able to stand out you need to be able to you know if your resume comes along the recruiter's desk they need to be like wow who is this person nas daniel whoever that is what has he done what has he or she done that will want to bring them into the company to actually interview them because tech companies dude they probably get thousands hundreds of thousands of resumes everyone wants to work at the big tech companies everyone wants to work at the google the netflix the facebook but you need to be able to stand out exactly exactly and so with that but with that let's go ahead and talk about what are some things that they need to do so most companies don't even go over all the right that's actually very interesting part so most companies don't even check fully your resume then i have time to check all your resumes because you have what hundreds to thousands right and some it's crazy to me you know one of the things that we'll talk about later is like even just having a smaller resume makes so much is such a bigger impact than having like a resume that's like two three four pages exactly you need to have the right things on that resume because very often they have these softwares that just scan through everything search keywords and look for those things so if you have a small simple resume that has the right words the right message you're going to stand out exactly exactly beautiful beautiful all right let's continue on let's continue on all right next up so how to build your resume now everybody is like okay i just see everybody like okay don't worry how to build so this was actually my resume that i actually updated a little bit but this con has most of the stuff that i had when i was still studying my undergraduate degree okay now we're gonna go deep into it right now it's just a picture but we want to show you how it's sectioned off to different things right there's different things that i talked about that really made me stand out you could see there's the skills and the tools what were the languages i had learned what were the classes i had taken yeah the about me was a little bit more personal information so they could get to know me you know did i know any languages what did i do for fun then if you could see the bulk of my resume was my experience and my projects again naz and i will dive deep into our resumes but you'll see that's where all of that information is and all of that is about programming i didn't put any stuff about like hey i had this other job and not as a programmer working that fast food restaurant yeah yeah yeah yeah you have to reverse and then so we'll go deeper this right now guys you know just to kind of we'll kind of take this step by step and we'll divide this up into like okay what's the first thing you need to take but one uh one thing i really want to ask right now is actually i'm here on zoom right so we have so many amazing people right guys raise your hand really quickly if you even have a resume if you have a resume raise your hand okay okay cool cool now raise two hands if you do not have a resume oh no that's not me if you don't have me okay okay now everybody raise two hands raise two hands raise two hands and then stop around okay cool cool coco all right thank you guys you guys are the best i'm just i'm just gonna tell you that right now yes uh if you later on actually later on we'll take questions a bit but if you have a question raise your hand on on zoom and we will take that okay also if you want to just put a question down in zoom chat that'll be great and we'll go ahead and answer that too but most importantly what we're guys going to be doing right now is uh going through the steps and then we will go and take your resume that you sent to us we'll take your resumes and we will look at them it will critique them and let you know what you need to fix exactly cool man yeah i'm ready let's do it man cool so sections so okay let's go let's go into sections that they need for yeah so we can just talk deeper into these sections okay right do you do you have specific slides for sections like would you just just talk about them okay and i guess here's what i'll do we'll do this and then we will go ahead and actually like write this stuff out and then we'll use like screen brush for example perfect but the only problem is like screen brush might actually die this computer might actually kill his computer so we'll see how that works out to stress that computer too much that's what he's it's already getting stressed out like crazy all right all right cool so personal information so do you actually have your uh resume cause i just open up yeah yeah i sent that to you on slack you sent it to me we can open that up let's open it up right now because i actually want to i want you guys to see the resume so what is it yes so actually let's do one more um let's do one more and the next one we'll dive deep into the resumes okay gotcha where's the one more so one more is the next one okay so mistakes to avoid so these are the number one mistakes you guys need to avoid and what i want you to do is take out a pen and paper and actually start writing this stuff down very important okay so mistakes to avoid when building a resume you know number one so let's go to the first one yeah so honestly we could just rant about this and that's exactly what we're gonna do because you don't want to make these mistakes now for one you have to understand the difference between a cv and the resume right because a cv is what's called your curriculum by time whatever which that is where you could put in everything but when people ask for a resume that is like a summary of everything that you've done and just the important things that is the one page resume right very often when people ask for resume they'll try to submit like everything they've done three to four pages all the work that they've tried to do very you know a lot of irrelevant information when people want the resume they want to see everything on one page so the number one mistake is if they are asking for the resume make sure it's a one page thing don't make it a three to four page thing yes exactly i see too many people too many of you guys have two three four page resumes guys please keep it to one you can fit all your information you need to actually to actually go ahead and um and not encourage someone but actually have someone recruiter interest in you in one page okay the second you get to two three four pages i see that i don't see any value in that number one and not a lot of recruiters have even time to go through that exactly so the thing is there are special cases but it's not inside of the software industry usually it's in other industries where they'll ask for what's called the cv now again the cv is your whole entire history of everything you've worked everything you've studied and that's because they have the time to review three to four different pages but whenever it is just the resume it's only a one page summary and that's again software companies get hundreds of thousands of applications so they don't have that time to go through all of that exactly exactly all right let's get into it yo what's up man we got time we got kazzy in the house guys guys we we're currently live on youtube we are on zoom call call pwg community right now dude look at that you got look at all these amazing people go check this out bro check this out everybody on here look at this oh yours has humid now 108 people right now wow live youtube was amazing i see everybody everything hi guys jade page unkit your guests all right so i say we get into those resumes yeah let's go to that next slide nas from here no i go to daniel we'll start with my okay start with yours quickly open file okay so daniel let's let's go ahead and yeah i'm gonna make your full screen right now okay all right cool so i'm gonna put this but i'm gonna also also write some stuff down okay very important guys okay perfect i'm gonna put a monophone here cool guys uh one really cool thing if you and if guys you and zoom if you guys have a question raise your hand and we'll go ahead and answer that question okay very important all right so daniel let's get into what you got going on here and kind of what what are some okay key points let's go ahead do key points of that you implemented the right things you implemented in this specific resume i do want to give some context this resume was built when i was still in school the only extra part that i added was that blue origin part but everything else was from school so that's why i still include stuff like coursework so we're talking about some key points some of the things that i tried to do was not put in too too much information right so as you can see there's actually a good amount of white space on the paper it's not just full of text and it's formatted so i think if you want to write that down down which is formatting and white space okay so format so when you say for money what i mean by that formatting so that is literally what the resume looks like and how you could see the spacing and for example on the left side you can see i have the education the things that i've developed the skills a little bit about me then i have the line that's cutting it in half to put it on the right and the right side is all about my experience and all the projects that i've worked on so it's how the paper physically looks like you want to make sure it actually looks aesthetic it looks nice that if someone looks at it they can move their eyes around it and read things and it makes sense right yeah that might even be like the bowling of you know where i've worked along with you know what my role was as a software engineer as a software developer the different roles that i took on yeah what dates i had and all of that so i think in terms of formatting like one of one really cool thing that i think what you did right is so what you have is what's it so it's easy really easy to read right you have education on the lefthand side right here right that's education for you right it's very clear you have a bachelor's in computer science right and here are some skills right so these skills right here it's just like okay i know java swift android ios and so forth something i want to talk about something that i did a lot of people don't know that they always ask is if you look at those skills i separated them but how how well i knew things so if you see the first for example advanced for the ones that i've worked on deeper projects i have a really good understanding so that was the java swift android then if you go to the sdk those are things that i've done some projects in but i wouldn't feel too comfortable like go building it without google right like with the java stuff i've done enough that i know what what i'm doing but for the intermediate it's like i've done some projects but it's like i would still need to rely on google heavily yeah to be able to develop and then the basics those are just stuff that i've done for fun you know like i would mess around with aws try to set up an instance but if things that i've dabbled with for a while in and out but basically a lot of people are always like hey how do i write down about the skills what is it that i do or how do i talk about that that's a way that i decided to segment it so that if the conversation comes up like hey you know c i'm like yeah i worked on a couple projects but i wouldn't say i'm a pro at it right yeah i would still need to re reference google for a couple yeah really important guys one really important here guys so one thing that i see a lot a lot from students is they have for example when they talk about these skills so let's just talk about these skills right here right when you when we talk about these skills right here what i see a lot is they'll do like okay skill and there's like this bar you see like this bar right here and they're like okay i'm good at this skill at this level i'm not kidding that is the most biggest bs ever that is the biggest bs i see it's like oh i'm good at this 40 50 it's like i see this percentage [ __ ] right here right it almost makes me mad like 60 like like what does that mean like that means if you're 100 good at something like a language is that does that mean you know 100 of the language heck no please for the love of god i don't want to see it in this and i'm very particular about this because and this is why i say this kind of stuff guys this right here you guys do not need these lines of like okay i'm a 60 good right you guys know what i'm talking about like everybody raise your hand if you know what i'm talking about on um um on zoom if you guys yeah it doesn't come in exactly good good good so please do not do that that is a big no no no no big no no okay all right let's keep going let's keep going could you press on this so i could monitor the comments yeah you can also perfect perfect perfect awesome cool all right so that's that is that is part one okay let's go ahead and go to another so so skills we kind of got that okay i like that okay skills is good there now let's talk about okay what is this course so again i gave that context because i wanted to talk about the higher level courses i was taking inside of my university right okay so that included like the data structure that events uh object oriented programming whatever those may be if you're already outside of school maybe this could be just things that you take for fun as well right for example what about like pwg like for example can i say they like to took pwg part yeah i think that could be part of it like if you're part of other courses outside of what you're doing just put those things in right this is this is not what's going to make you the resume but it could bring up a conversation like hey what's this pwj thing you're talking about oh man it's this amazing community where nas is showing us how to build these awesome projects and then yeah yeah that's where you know that's where a lot of this other things on my resumes are coming from so honestly this coursework was just because like my resume was so intentional i had so few words that i was just trying to fill out the space because i didn't know what else to put in there you know i was like like all my words already here and every word has a specific like purpose yeah the purpose is to stand out it has it's for so people can search it through the seos so that it actually has intentions behind it so i had so much space i was like here i could just put extra stuff cool cool cool awesome so yeah very very i think i personally didn't actually have that if you do not have any courses you don't have to put something like this i don't think it's 100 necessary so one big thing that i would say on here it's like this is the course work is not necessary honestly like not a lot of people even have that and it's not the most biggest thing they look for exactly so if you have not taken any courses guys it is okay it is okay you don't have to put your coursework on here but it's just a nice thing to have if you actually did take for example you let's say you took profit javascript you should put that on there let's say youtube maybe udacity course you should put that on there right so any course that maybe you've taken that's actually valuable to actually taught you something well i think you can put that on there and again like how not said it's really not important i was just trying to fill out space but notice how i'm not like adding to it i'm just putting it out there so someone wants to ask about it they can if not that's not what's going to get me the interview it's not this core section oh cool right exactly yeah exactly all right next up next up so what do we have after this one okay the about me or yeah that pop that part on the bottom the about me that was just the personal information that actually includes both of those that's just the personal information a little bit about me so right there you know i'm bilingual i know spanish and english some people like to put that like hey i know four languages follow whatever that may be cool and then the other things are just some interesting that i had you know i was into personal development stock trading tutoring power lifting so that's just like the tiny section that gives them a little bit glimpse of what i do with my personal yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly now now also initially enough like i'm very curious that you put you put that here because i didn't have that i didn't have that totally for me it didn't have that specific about me section for me when i created my resume but this might be helpful you know especially if you have some really good interest right here right especially if you talk multiple languages this could be helpful because a lot of companies will look for people who are bilingual right so if you're for example talking spanish that is a very big key right like in spanish there's because a lot of people are talking spanish there so that's a really big one for example or let's say maybe you talk a language that's within your country i mean of course you're talking about you should of course that's part of it right but still or let's say you are in a different country let's say right and you're talking you and you speak english you should put it on there right you should put that like i'm an english speaker a native or an english speaker you should put that on there okay make sense yeah that makes total sense and again that's not something that you need i just had so much extra space i was like i'm gonna add these things and you know maybe it will help them maybe it won't the real important thing is on the right side of my resume yeah so before we go on guys you guys i anyone assume you guys have any questions right now before we move on real quick let's let's take one question and you will go ahead one question joe joe go ahead um i knew you go ahead joe wait joe can you mute joe how do i meet joe wait hold on joe go come on that's my need to meet you i'm off i'm you joe please there we go hi joe specific to a job opportunity in the u.s correct this and i believe it depends the format and the information differs from based on which country you're applying job for like in india this would uh i guess not fly because there the stress is more on academics you know they want to see you know whether you've done your computer science degree you've done bachelor's engineering what do you think about that yeah i mean i think that's a solid point because to be honest i don't know the context of applying to united states because i only applied to united states now if if a different country is going to emphasize different things right like if in india the emphasis is in academia because they want to see if you got a master's if you got a phd then you know change it to that don't be scared it's not about just having this one resume for the entire world right like your resume might even change from company to company and you might even change some warnings depending on the job you are applying for right because if i'm about exactly that's what that's the next point i was trying to get at is uh first off is this a word word template what is this yeah so i did that on word and then i switched it over to pdf and this is just a specific screenshot of my resume okay yeah so like i did my like after i lost my job i updated my resume you know i did and each time i used to apply for a job i was to look up the position and try to highlight front load my resume with the types of skills that would get highlighted for the job and then i would also attach a cover letter that would say how i can provide value coming in even if i didn't have the right amount of skill set you know any soft skills that would translate into that skill set that's what i would highlight in in my in my resume so that's so so joe what you're saying just to kind of repeat what you're saying is that you would put skills on your resume that related to the job is that what you're talking about correct okay yeah and if if that skill is not uh let's say they are asking for c plus plus but i maybe i don't know c plus plus but if i've done some programming that explains structures data structures i would put it there or highlight it there because that's front loading that's i won't let them know that i know the basics of you know programming yeah i think yeah no i think that that is a good way to go about it as well remember the key here is simple guys like one big key i want to point out though i want to point out here in terms of what the big key be behind any resume like here's here here's here's the big key it's be it's actually it's actually being able to put the text on here it's actually being able to um show it's about being able to be read fast okay the point is that a recruiter will have five seconds and literally five to ten seconds to skim your resume and this the most key things that will pop out that's what they're gonna notice exactly that's why we say no don't do like you know two three two three pages right so if you for example are going to highlight skills that are very helpful so like for example you know highlighting highlighting you know sometimes highlighting skills that pertain to that job i think that's perfect too that that's really good yeah yeah for sure because again you know how's joe's as joe saying don't be afraid to change it up for a specific company along with the cover letter right very often people are like oh this one resume that i'm gonna send to 100 companies right yeah when i submitted my resumes i would try to tweet them depending on what they said in the job description if they're like we're looking for a backend engineer i would highlight the projects that i did backend development they're looking for frontend or fullstack i would highlight those projects and as joe said literally front load those projects exactly exactly exactly and daniel the one other question now i i heard a lot of recruiters requesting for a video resume so basically they want you to send them a a twominute snapshot of you walking them to the resume how it translates what the job skill is that something that you've you guys have come across i i personally have not seen that before but i think that's even cooler man because that is the opportunity for you to shine and show your personality right i agree so so here's what i would do if you're asked to do that i would take it with the understanding that a human is going to watch this so you want to try to connect with them through a camera like what am i doing right now joe i'm connecting with you to a camera i'm not just you're not just like some random guy for me for me your joe you're curious you're intrigued you want to see what you can do to be able to build your resume to land a job be a freelancer whatever that is that's how you want to approach it so when it's about getting from the camera don't think about i have to create the script think about how can i connect with the person who's going to watch this can i say something that you know they'll be able to resonate with is it a story is it something about my resume but it's your opportunity to shine yeah so you're saying it should not be scripted you should be spontaneous tries being spontaneous i would say try being spontaneous because that that shows like the real you right that shows the real person that joe is like the amazing person that joe is with his smile right and everything right like look at that look at that smile look at that smile so yeah try being spontaneous like for example you know create a loom video joke with the loom video be like hi hey hi how's it going you know very happy you know for you to get in touch with me you know here's a resume and talk about your experience right most importantly i think when you were talking about this when you were talking going through your resumes i think what what they love what recruiters they love most importantly is your experience what have you done right and talk about what you have learned in that specific experience job or project right talk about those and then actually let me let go ahead and let me go ahead and put that on here so for example if you're doing like if you're doing like a video a video let me see if i do like a hold on [ __ ] well someone said uh someone's talking about storytelling no i'm not talking storytelling this is no bedtime story dude no backup stories here guys uh but if you're doing like a video video resume right with a resume resume then one of the key things is you know talk about your experience right but when you talk about your experience talk about right what what challenges right you had and how you and how you overcame them exactly and don't get scared of owning that you made a mistake everyone makes a mistake that yeah that's what humans are you know you're human yes and what result you got very very very very important you know your resume is very much result driven recruiters they want to see results and we're gonna going to get to that later on as we get into like the bullet points of like projects and so forth but what result did you bring do you bring as the person that's one big key thing to talk about got it joe yep great perfect yo thank you for coming on thanks thank you was that helpful hey thumbs up from joe let's go let's go i love joe joe is cool i agreed agreed i love joe too cool guys all right let's keep going let's keep going guys really quickly here all right so next things for next things uh first let's go and start talking about experience okay so which is this section this is what i want to say guys if you look at this is my resume right if you look at the right side of the resume everything on the right is related to programming i start with the experience which are my actual jobs and the second part is projects which were my fun projects literally i made sure that i was applying for a software engineer job i made sure that everything there was software engineer related and i tried to just make it like i try to talk quantity like if you look at academic technologies right i say you know it was uh you know qualities result quality and results right for example like oh that's dope you could highlight stuff if we look at here that okay that's fine okay so for example i built internal websites and tools those are the things that i delivered all right or for example let's go to this one right here that second one so classroom control it was released as an ios application in eight different classrooms across the campus right at this campus and it says for this semester the goal was to reach campuswide use and represented individual effort of over 250 coding hours right now that was an estimate i didn't really clock those in but i was like hey this project took me x amount of money let's say this project took me five months i worked on it 20 hours a week for that time that's about how much time it put into it and what this was allowing to do is you know i talked the results in the one above which is into uh what was what was it well what uh projects of the future so basically it was a project that allowed an ease of of um use for the professors inside of the classroom right um actually this resume probably doesn't talk much about it [Laughter] no it was because the way i approached it was more it was conversations that i had but when you're talking about results you could also talk about if you can quantify so don't be able to go so before we get into results i i know i know if you want to touch base on that i want to kind of take a step by step okay so so so when you when you talk about experience right guys you see first things first is um first first you can see how because a lot of you guys kind of mislead that so number one and when you're talking about some engineering resume i think one it's going to be have your experience be at the top so experience experience in terms of where it's placement experience at the top okay very important at the top some at the top not at the bottom and that's one of the most important things that they are going to look for when you guys are you know in these resumes number two number two right include experience that actually relates to the job yeah okay please if you if you actually have proper experience do not put that you were mcdonald's or you booked a mcdonald's okay we do not uh at harvard i see you i see you raise your hand don't worry i got you um so include and include jobs that were that were part part that relate to the job you want to get right that are related right that's very important yes right um three three what else should we say like which other related three you don't need to include all the jobs include the most important ones like the most recent ones include the most recent ones yeah now a lot of you guys i know raise your hand if you're with me on this one i know that you guys are beginners craig raise your hand if you're with me on this if you're if you're like a beginner right if you're beginners you might not have as many jobs right you would not have much experience but put down whatever you got okay if you do not have so actually let me let's talk about this if if you have no experience what should they put down so this is what i think if you have no experience in the specific field you're applying for then maybe that is a time where you can bring other experiences but you change them to show how they can translate oh yeah for example if literally your only experiences at mcdonald's right flipping burgers and you happen to put that what you want to do is in the bullet points talk about how as mcdonald's employ you were able to learn the discipline that is required similar to be able to that can carry over to software right right or talk about you were able to lead a team so you worked well on your communication skills but you want to target specific skills that might carry over to the field you're going to again this is if you have like absolutely no pro no projects no experience nothing you can talk about then you might bring in those other experiences but change them up so that it's relatable to what you're applying for exactly exactly that's so guys for those of you who don't have experience does that make sense raise your hand does that make sense okay yes yes huh how do we know if they're raising their hand i'm i just i just i'm guessing i can see you guys but i can see only one person at a time sometimes okay perfect so all right but that that is a big big key factor guys okay awesome all right now one other thing i don't know if this is on here let's let's go here oh you have that here if you have no experience one other thing is instead of putting it down experience put down what projects you've built exactly so if you literally have no experience talk about projects so it's project is going to be where you shine exactly so if you're in the pwg community you've done crazy amounts of projects because that's what nas has focused on because that's how you're going to best learn especially javascript react to whatever that is if you've been following sonny's lives you probably have tons of projects if you've been doing them this is where it's your opportunity to shine exactly beautiful guys all right so so we talked about the experience we talked about the projects now let's go ahead and dive deeper into it now before i dive deeper alkara you want to go ahead and ask a question um you want my honest opinion on that honest opinion i don't think it matters my honest opinion i am honest opinion on that is is i think that it oh hold on i'll kiss me my honest opinion so what about here i thought about here asked a question about um uh i kind of he asked a question about if you should put down the uh when you graduated or like the years right so they because he's saying that a lot of people sometimes companies will discriminate right against things like against your age right i think honestly that is simply just a what is it called what's the right word for it excuse me it's an excuse i'm sorry it's just an excuse i don't care i don't give no two shits how old you are oh only that matters is how good are you with carla okay how good are you at what you're doing i'm matt i'm mad guys interesting story guys so check this out god i really wish that i can like switch cameras like so i can like focus in like on here but i just i just okay i mean can i just it's just gonna get screwed up if i do let's see okay i don't know system audio muted okay but you guys can still hear me that's fine so i think and you guys on zoom can hear me raise your hand if you can hear me still on zoom yeah beautiful beautiful good so so um when i was when i was interviewing with google guys a a i had an i had a lunch with a googler right and during that lunch time i asked the ghouler hey why did you get your job okay and actually enough the she he talked about the whole story of how he got the job he literally got the job after high school oh well after high school he got the job how because he was doing github projects right github project okay and he was doing open source projects google noticed him doing those projects they loved what he was doing voila they literally came to him and said hey we want to give you a job this guy was in high school he was just graduating high school man so i think that just goes to show it does not matter how old you are what manages how good are you how good are you like do you know your stuff that is the most important thing so hopefully that kind of cover does that make sense yeah that makes sense that absolutely makes sense okay good good good good so i think it's okay for you to put the the date in the year okay just make sure i'm not going to the project i wanted to ask about the skills and the tools is it a guy and i noticed that you put them all in advanced intermediate and basic is it a good idea to literally just separate all that out like that so the reason i took this approach is because if i just had a conglomerate of like if i had all those skills in in like just one section i mean i'm pretty sure the the recruiter or the person that would be interviewing me would be like all right this guy's a genius or he doesn't know what he's doing right because there's no way that he knows like all the different languages completely mastered so that's why i decided to split into three now if you don't have that many different experiences like if you focus a lot just on frontend development so it might only be like react javascript css and html then it's you don't have to try to you know separate all of those out right but that's mostly because i just have like at least 15 different skills so then it's hard to for me to put that they're like well i'm not what level do you really know java compared to python yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah so my answer that julian can i can i give you my my true answer yeah yeah i don't think it's important no i don't think you need to put in advanced intermediate basic i always when i literally put down the things when i first especially when you're applying when you're applying for big companies like cool they don't even give a [ __ ] i know i'm cussing right now but like they don't give a [ __ ] even like what kind of language you know it's all about hey what's in here man like what's in here are you good at you know creating prop like are you good at solving problems yep so put down the skills that you know like for example i'll show you guys my resume later on right i'll show you my resume they're on and you will see that i just have skills listed that's it just that's it and that worked too yep that was not an issue so you don't have to though julian you don't have design it's not a big deal but it's an idea it's an idea but you don't have to okay yeah is that my answering question yeah absolutely are you are you going to do that i'm definitely going to do that okay cool he's not going to take nozzle advice that's fine you have been taking notes awesome julia thanks so much man appreciate it okay thank you you got it you got it cool sweet all right let's uh let's go ahead and keep going guys let's keep going so next things first i want to talk about later really quickly here um i want to talk about uh let's see i want to talk about the actual um the text here right i want to talk about how do you go ahead what description do you put down there gotcha so the way i approach this resume because now i'm remembering i used this resume for more like general purpose uh programming was i wanted to make sure that in the fewest words possible basically it was very intentional i was able to showcase what i worked on and i was able to maybe even quantify the amount of work that went into that and even talk about results later in the future or the results that were produced now obviously looking at this resume i probably didn't talk that much about the results but those are tips that i would probably do and change again this resume was something that i created like two three years ago so those are things that i would definitely add to that resume which would be more result focused yeah yeah yeah guys but you guys just yeah we can hear them cool cool awesome so okay so let's go ahead and just talk about this real quick okay i want to touch base on this so um in terms of description and in terms of text one thing so let's talk about description ripping off the experience okay one big thing that one big thing one thing that we touched on is results driven correct yeah okay what does that mean it means you can talk about the deliverables and how they affected either the company the business whatever it is that you worked on what was the actual results that your work was able to provide yes yes so i want to i want to point out something so we talk about results so it's result driven correct very important now i want to highlight a few things let me see let me highlight this stuff so for example guys for example if you guys see here for example um daniel has a few things he's like he talked about okay develop devops portal an internal right an eternal website too and so forth right develop a notification service blah blah blah blah blah right explore the capabilities of a new tool used by a lot right so these for example develop so keywords like developed created right increased design crea these are called keywords so when say when i say keywords right let's list them out here for a second here right created right yeah these are basically developed right like what do you do as a developer right right um create develop increased maybe increase efficiency in something right yep uh you went ahead and um decreased right maybe decreased the amount of time it takes to do something right optimized optimal automated automated like all these keywords honestly that is probably the most important thing you need to do to use in your descriptions a lot of people you will see my your description is just crazy nuts man your description is way too much i think but again but i shouldn't say that because he's got the job at blue origin so it doesn't matter what i say i i got this resume two years ago if i could take the criticism i don't care i just say at the same time guys like it's like like if you just simply use those keywords and showcase how you impacted the company that that's it yeah that's all they need does that make sense make sense guys raise your hand does that make sense good beautiful okay so let's keep going with that for example let's keep going i'm going to go into like a brush tool here perfect brush tool oh [ __ ] where's my brush tool there's my brush too all right got something okay there we go so develop right so let's go ahead and oh let's get really quickly here oh what is this what is this what is this where does this always get how do i always do this man i don't know man you messed up the rest of the live oh it's just it's just for that application i think you might have pressed something like this i think i pressed something but i'm not sure what i pressed though okay shift nope never works live man all right no what'd you go to your resume now no no i want to finish it up no no no no i got it i got it i got it i got it i got this it's not a big deal guys show there we go see i got this okay yeah all right let's continue on really quickly here um okay so let's okay another so okay keep keep let's say if we keep going with the specific things right we have okay so what do we have individually developed right another keyword right so these things are keywords okay next thing let's go ahead and keep going let's talk about projects yep okay what did you do and projects so for projects these were two projects that i had developed personally on my own time and they were both full stack develop or one was more fun and the other one was more full stack development project but since i was applying for developer role i just wanted to put that type of experience there so these were things that i had done on the side right so i talked more about what those were as well so one was a webbased application the other one was so for the projects i didn't really make it like result focused because it's kind of implicit that those were the things that i was doing but you could definitely do you know i developed or not i because you're not supposed to use that but you know developed xyz by doing that or whatever results you did with that project right yes okay yeah exactly so i think for projects i think any project that you do that relates to coding like programming you include that so for example obviously include include especially as a beginner include any project project related correct exactly so here you could talk about the live builds here you could talk about the pwg projects for all of those things exactly talk about those talk about what in those projects talk about what like as were you develop were you the lead developer you're the front developer like who were you in that project if you were the main developer just put in the developer that's it right so for example you can see that that daniel here has a lead developer on here correct so he has lead developer as one of the things that he does yeah okay um so that's part one part two you can in terms of description into a description i think it's also important i think it's okay to have it be result driven too yeah result driven reside results driven and you will see what i'm talking about when i go to my resume okay and also talk about okay uh talk about just what was your role your role in the project and you work on the project and that's pretty much it okay another big key thing guys another big key thing okay is inco please in if you have it include a github port a github link yep dude the amount of times and i'm gonna the amount of times that i have recruiters that literally would would come to me and i think at two or three times when i was doing recruiters they said oh yeah yeah i checked out your github link checked out your github project can you please go through this project literally right and that was so helpful for them i included that github project it actually showed them the real thing right exactly yeah and that's something that i would definitely do but back then i didn't have gate look get hook or get lab or whatever you have github well i didn't i don't know how well do you what are you old what the [ __ ] hey man guys this guy is all this fun he's like he's like in his 30s now i'm just kidding he's yeah so the most i could have done here was you know that link it's probably not working anymore but that's where we actually had it live in the server so i was able to point to that but if i was able to if i was actually doing github then that's what i would have done instead yeah but you see that's what we're going to talk more about in this presentation which is one of the other things you could have that can make sure that you'll really stand out exactly include the include the live product link project for the source code roger github link and even the live link honestly exactly okay that's gonna be very important so and and pretty much guys like that sums up what you need to do like there's really not that much complication to a to a resume if you have your projects number one if you're a resume number two if you have your skills number three that is pretty much it exactly right that is pretty much it now very important another another thing that i want to touch based on guys for those of you who want to go ahead and become developers who want to be be part of a group like this right here right honeycomb developers go ahead and join the webinar link in description right now okay join the webinar we have on how to become a react js developer join link is in description below make sure you go that literally right now do like get off this youtube video right now i'm not even kidding like just like click the link right there and join the webinar and we will see you tomorrow and we're going to provide you some great value just like we are doing here right now beautiful let's keep going let's keep going guys all right let's go ahead and take on a question before i move on to my resume anybody have a question yes who who's talking uh okay i see you okay go ahead go ahead uncertified uh java certification and for a tester they might ask ist qp certification so how important these certifications are uh i mean to be included in a resume so how important what you were asking my friend is you're asking pretty much how important are the certification correct yeah okay so certifications question mark are they important or not i think only if they're looking for it if they're specifically looking for it which i haven't seen a lot of software development companies do unless it's like an i.t specialist role yeah then you don't really need to include that so and like i said if i had any i would put in the coursework but that's only because i had a lot of space to fill out the resume if you don't have a lot of space because you already have a lot of projects a lot of experience and they're not asking for the certification i really don't think that it matters it more matters like can you actually deliver the results if they're looking for a full stack developer can you develop full stack applications front and back and whatever that may be yeah yeah yeah so i think so what kind of certifications do you have uh what classification do you have uh currently i have a isd qb certification because i was a automation test engineer so i i wanted to ship to a web development gotcha gotcha so you have a a a testing a testing engineer certification correct yeah yeah gotcha gotcha gotcha yeah i mean i think for example when i put down like it's very much if they're not looking for you but if you have it if you have it it's not going to hurt you that's a good point like if you have a certification it's not going to turn out mind you those of you who do not have certifications that is not necessary i for example for me i put down i put down i had an award i i won um one of the things that i did is i won a first place in hackathon in a hackathon and i put that as a that that's a thing right so but that simply showed and actually had a lot of recruiters asking me about that by the way thanks so much for the donation i appreciate it i appreciate it man hold on make sure how do i screenshot this hold on i screenshot it oh no there's so much going on hold on i got this i got this no where's dropper doppler why does quasi have so many drop applications different applications does not make sense no anyways thank you so much i appreciate mine but yeah ramji if you have a certification put it down that's fine it's not a big deal yeah sure enough thank you but if you don't have but for those of you who do not have a certification don't think of this like you have to have a certification um you don't have to have it because we have a lot of people asking us hey you guys to give certification and so forth it's not necessary most important thing is your experience that's it project experience project experience that is it exactly yeah okay thank you miss you got it amano how are you doing you're smiling uh yeah i was smiling about uh how you were clapping your hand yeah yeah anybody anybody got any any more questions yes yeah one thing we're talking about i love how like we can directly just talk and zoom like for those of you guys who have questions if you have a question on youtube go ahead go ahead and put that question down yes if you have a question on youtube just drop it in the description um i'm description in the comments in the comments section and we'll go ahead and try to get to you okay yeah we'll try we'll try to probably maybe write those down as i see yeah hey nas yes go ahead yeah so what are some you know stuff that you need to know in order to like get into big tech companies such as fang or square space or something like that like do you need to know data structures and algorithms like is that a good thing to know when you apply like can you get a job in a big tech company without knowing pictures and algorithms that is a great question and here's what i would say is your first focus your first focus always should be as nas said projects and experience right so you want to make sure you're developing projects that are really pushing you you beyond your boundaries whether that's just front end back end security machine learning whatever that is and you start to build that basically the knowledge that you need to actually work for someone right now later once you're at that point then you can worry about you know trying to get and pass those intervals right but i think right now the first thing should be project experience once you've built up the point where it's like you're building out these projects you have massive experience and then you want to go to big tech then unfortunately because of the way that big tech interviews you will have to learn a little bit about algorithms a little bit about data structures and mastering the the interview process but you shouldn't worry about that until you at least have the fundamental basic experience you need to be able to do the job true true so but to answer your question uh study card do you actually need no data structures when you go ahead and you want to apply when you go ahead and apply for companies like google yes you do need to know data structures yes you do need to know those algorithms because like it or not on those interviews they are going to ask you so if that's your question like do you need to know those things yes you do yes you do do need need to know them you need to know like data structures and so forth right but what you need to understand srika sika correct yeah what's interesting also is you will be you will know them you will get better at them as you build projects right so as you work on projects as you do more things those things will start to come naturally to you and you will start to understand them how to use them in the real world does that make sense but yeah that means jade thanks so much for the donation i appreciate it my friend hey let's go hey hold on hey we got another one got another one hey so much you guys are doing something which will be known in history i love your enthusiasm and that device i wish to just learn everything from you guys thanks so much rana appreciate it my friend appreciate it appreciate my friends appreciate it this is amazing awesome i wish i could do droplet what the heck is dropper how do i use dropper so i can actually screenshot this stuff screenshot is it option option shift four four that's usually what it is yeah so option shift three oh there we go hey perfect oh [ __ ] oh three is the whole screen no i have to do system preview because i have to go system preferences okay guys let's keep going guys any more questions guys you go ahead you tell me anymore yeah naws i had one more quick question do you know a place to learn uh data structures in algo what's a good place to learn i do know i do not actually but you say it first gotcha so if i mean i i personally learned them from my classes that's where i first started and i expanded into going into websites like hackerrank and leeco to be able to practice them so i mean a place where you can definitely learn is it could be a book it could be you know whether it's an online course but maybe nas knows a specific place that might be a great resource yeah a great resource honestly it's two resources for you to learn those specific things okay let's go ahead and go for those one one um is going to be the crack in the coding interview it's a book it's a book okay it's a book that will teach you a lot about the two churches two two is going to actually be on youtube on youtube i know it's simple stuff right but on youtube if you start search up for example like let's let i mean i'll show it to you right now let's just show an example here so i will go ahead and put you out here right so cracking the coding into you interview right they go very deep in those data structures so i highly recommend for any of you guys who are going to do resumes you highly you very much look into that okay it's very important guys so like this book right here this book where is this book with this this book it's very good at explaining those specific things okay but if you for example go on youtube for example youtube and you search up youtube um data structures yeah i'm sure there's a lot of people that explain it really well and you know they'll teach you the fundamentals the basics may even have like some extra practice as well yeah exactly let me see uh oh exactly for example here for example right so for example this is pretty good too i like i like this one yeah so cs dojo he has a great youtube site where he actually landed he landed a job at google and what he did is he decided to actually teach people more about the technical interview so cs dojo definitely i would recommend him if you want to learn more about the algorithms technically and the data structures yeah exactly so and really important as also as as you're learning those data structures go ahead and actually go for example to like hack a ring and start practicing start practicing those algorithms right so it's not just about learning do you hear me you hear me yes give me a thumbs up yeah it's not just about learning right because you can learn as much as you want but it's also about applying it that study is probably even a them that's probably even more important than just learning it yep okay because so for example if you go to hackerrank for example right if you go through this site okay and then you talk about let's say oh shoot i have to like sign up can i just log in or something ah qazi i'm sorry i'm about to show your email so if you go ahead right and go to hackerrank and you talk about okay come on listen proceed do you yes cause you're looking for just cause you're gonna be getting jobs no back no proceed just uh you jobs no i don't wanna do jobs what are you doing bro i'm trying out of this man i'm trying to show that this is something that's on fire all right okay so for example problem solving right so problem solving here uh problem solving where is this practice algorithms see this right here data structures and algorithms so go ahead and go to the other structures okay go to those oh something happened go to those and boom right solve challenge soul challenge so challenge so start doing them right away and you will this is my friend is how you're gonna learn even more than simply just by reading them exactly doing them practicing them over and over and over again okay so the certifications that come on hacker right like could i put that on my resume and then google and then we'll see like oh this guy got a certification from hackerrank on data structures that means he's probably has some knowledge of data structures is it like accredited by like does google right know what hacker rank is i mean google knows what hacker rank is but i think more importantly going back to nasa's advice it's more about the projects and the experience you've actually developed if there's a certificate in hacker rank that is super hard to get and you happen to get it wouldn't hurt to add but they're you're not going to get their attention by saying hacker rank you're going to get their attention by saying hey i built the kobe tracker that's how you're going to get their attention yeah exactly okay yeah so don't focus so much on the certifications again very very don't focus on my specifications focus more on the projects that he got and the experiences you get from here so yeah thanks wait what modules are in the module three card you sign the modules yeah yeah what module you're on uh i'm on module two i i'm on the last video let's go man awesome sweet sweet sweet cool so yeah keep doing that keep drawing the coaching calls man and keep doing the projects with the coaching calls that is going to have a bigger impact on you for you than even just putting certifications on that does that make sense yes thank you awesome all right guys let's continue on with my resume yeah guys so i saw that question on youtube what's up amanda um we've got another person waiting in the queue for a question okay okay uh let's take one more question i i think i enjoy taking questions honestly even more than just like let's take it yeah let's do it keep going let's do it man uh ines there's anisha hey what's up basically good to see you doing fine thank you how are you doing good good so i i had uh basically two questions basically uh going through daniel's resume where he had mentioned the experiences he he was you know not everyone has a lot of experiences right so you mentioned that you know you can talk about uh you have worked here and you have worked and you you know you're having the soft skills and all those things which can actually help you advance into the programming uh the platform and into the field right now the thing is that under what heading do i add this i mean it's not coming under the experience uh thing so you know okay so you're you were asking about like soft skills where to put that down there right right like as you mentioned that if i've worked in mcdonald's and you know i have a discipline which can actually help me in my software career okay i cannot include that in my experience right i mean which category do i actually that's true no that goes that goes under your experience that goes on so you for example you would okay mcdonald's right what did you do what did you do like for example where did you work for example what did you work uh i was earlier in tcs and now i'm doing business so one more time say one more time i was i was early in tata consultancy services okay what did you do there what did you uh i started off as a support role in sharepoint as an admin so support when i moved on it's important yeah like customer service customer support uh you can say like uh yes i mean you can see that okay so and then yeah then i went on to design using the sharepoint designer okay and then i went on to doing a bit of development okay which is for for a very brief file and then i again moved into uh the support role for java really wow that is yes shoot a hundred percent put that on your experience what are you even thinking about yeah but that was under like one company so no no but but no if it's under one company here's what you do here's what you do what i did for example when i was when i was when i did when i had something similar right when i what i did is like i would put like okay so for example let's say i i don't i don't remember what the company name was let's say the company name is like google okay because why not because and let's say right you were you were let's say customer support right customer support right support right customer support and then so here you did like september through october i don't know then you put another cp then you put another experience for example here and here you did google oh you guys hear me designing yeah yeah google and then here for example next up you were you were java support right so you keep listening now your different lead roles that you were on as experiences that is your experience and it would be so cool because now the recruiter can see your journey with that one company and how you're shifting towards becoming a developer yes yes okay so yeah so the second question is that uh i left my software career in 2017 okay and since then i have not been doing any you know i've been just doing coding like uh just just to be you know it's just uh it's like a passion but i have not been doing like you know to earn money or you know kind of doing a job here or there i've been uh full time into a different category all together you know like sales and marketing right right uh but you know i mean uh i do enjoy coding a lot and you know i keep wanted doing that so you know i mean i don't have many projects under my bed right so now you are saying that we need to mention the roles in the project you know so i mean what kind of role do i mention when i'm just doing it you know sitting in my computer and just doing you know loving something and just making a project out of it in that case you don't have to mention a role do if you just if you're the one creating the project just put the project name that's it yeah but then it's you said that it should result driven i mean what kind of result driven i mean can you put there example so okay so what project did you build just let's take an example like like to do list app like i was building for a company for my own company i was building like look yeah created created a todo list app to do list do a list app you created for a company you said uh i i was in the process of building for my own company uh like we have this uh contracts and all those what was the purpose of the tool step let me ask you the question what was the problem it was it was actually more beneficial to the company as in whenever the warranties would expire for the customers for the products but say one more time what did you do like what what how is it helping so i'm yeah so i am in the iit hardware and services firm okay so we supply products okay okay for example the simplest product is like say a desktop or laptop okay and we sell those to customers with save warranties now uh you know most of the warranties get over within a year and now i want to do extended warranties right so you know we don't have the time to you know actually do the data mining and going through our past records and checking on and sending individual mails to everyone right so you know i kind of kind of built like an sms and uh email platform uh an automated email platform where you know uh directly what did that platform do did it decrease the mid efficiency increased efficiency in something or decreasing yes yes it it increased the efficiency of my own company i mean there we go this is it check this out increased efficiency efficiency right efficiency of something i don't know what it was right by building a to do list app using js or whatever it is whatever what did you use java did you use java java okay using java boom that's it look at that keywords increased efficiency right off something that's result driven you increase efficiency of something by how by building in todo list app okay right by building it to do this stuff right i know i know if you don't know it's really hard to see that but it's just you know just but but if you list that using what using java and so it shows you did something using something and then it shows you what you learned so which is java done okay so at the same time you're even highlighting the technologies that you've worked on yes done perfect thank you thank you you got it yep yeah this is so cool we're just doing this on the flies it's so cool man cool so i saw that someone on youtube had asked what about for resumes that are for freelancers and i believe you have some of that on your resume for freelancers yeah for well maybe that's just like jobs you've been able to land you have some of that i would say it's pretty much

continue on with with the resume stuff let's go ahead and continue on what we have got well you've got now guys so we talked about our resume talk about daniel's resume we talked about a few different resumes okay we'll talk about let's go and talk about real quick i want to touch base a little bit on my resume okay um a little bit of my resume and then we will go ahead and then start bringing people's resumes that they submitted sure sure how much time do we have we were it's two hours now holy [ __ ] also we didn't talk about all the other stuff like linkedin personal brand and all those things oh we could go back and or we might have to do another live call now if you guys are liking this we might just do another live call where we dive deeper into other things you could do to be able to get you know from recruiters whether that's networking that's building your linkedin building your personal brand on instagram there are so many different things that you can do we can get into that later but what we're probably going to do in this call is review nozzles and then we're going to review some of the people in the pwj community's resume and we're gonna give advice so that they can actually go out there and implement some of those changes beautiful beautiful guys now so yeah we might actually in terms of linkedin stuff it might take into another call yeah because i think it's it's just super valuable but you know we'll take that to another call all right beautiful let's get to it guys so my resume did you oh did you you removed my myself okay there's my resume guys okay there's my resume let's see okay now and somebody asked a question actually so here's my resume this this resume actually worked out so my this resume was actually proofread by people at linkedin it was proofread by people at google even so a lot of stuff that's on here is actually me and i'll show you guys how i did this guys i literally i'm not going to get full screen how do i make it full screen like this yeah oh [ __ ] look at that bro it's insane okay cool so so yeah yeah i'll move that a little bit right here okay cool guys so we got we got our knock on the right hand side right here he's with us but so one of the things that i did which i thought was really interesting is actually i literally contacted i went on linkedin okay i went on linkedin and i searched up people who went to the same university okay the same university and who worked at the job i wanted to work at and i messaged them and i called them and i contacted them on linkedin crazy stuff right and literally 80 percent i got about eighty percent success rate on that yeah right so i contacted them and i'm like hey guys hey so like someone i would contact like hey can you help me out or i'm trying to get into linkedin or google can you maybe give me some pointers on what i can do to get into this company and then we'll talk we'll talk we'll talk about exchange some emails and i literally uh literally later on i will go ahead and hey can you maybe proofread my resume what do you think about this resume and that's how it was proofread that's awesome dude and that worked so well so well if you want to there's a certain company you want to work at start connecting with people who are working at that company do not spam of course don't spam but just be nice about it and kind of about it does that make sense yes it does yes it does hey oh okay wait we're both okay it's which is pretty funny all right guys let's keep going so uh a few things few things that i want to highlight kind of on my on my own uh on my thing here so a few things i'm going to highlight okay you see so nas okay this is my name of course right that's that that makes sense hopefully um but one thing i want to highlight on my resume is is the simplicity of freeing it top to bottom yep okay so one big thing is like if i if i say here right it's being able to top to bottom to bottom right top to bottom reading very simple right you can see technical skills projects experience boom right so you can skim that so quickly a recruiter can skim that so easily it will know who i am and what there are things that i do okay now let's check them out let's go a little bit deeper into this stuff okay so let's talk about this technical skills okay remember how you're talking about the skills which is like it's divided up into different things like advanced you know i didn't do that i just said languages here's what i know python php javascript mongodb mysql java html yeah literally what you did do is you divided it based off of different genres that they fit in exactly so like example languages frameworks and concepts that's awesome right so because it's just it's so easy to read that right as a recruiter you know by the way what i know okay frameworks angularjs jingle jingle rest flask wordpress psychic learn scrapey js jquery bootstrap frameworks concepts machine learning data money op uml right very easy to read and that actually and that worked out very well let's talk about projects okay we talked about project which is a very very you see even here for example project was actually first and then experience was actually second yep yes it's always been like actually delivered exactly it's actually always been something you asked what about no sequel uh i know this is an old resume so i know no sql now but at that time i did not know that so but so check this out projects created a real estate mls integration right real estate mass integration here is the company this is my company right the date and so forth right and here are the key words let's talk about these keywords real quick here okay guys let's talk about these keywords that we talked about really really fast right look at this created right look at that right next up we have decreased grease right when i say keywords i'm not talking [ __ ] i actually know because i use it you know decreased maintained increased increased right organized right there check this out increased right it's all very much so i'm going to highlight this created created decrease wordpress search time by 75 and even for example guys this is really cool guys if you can highlight a number quantifying a quantifier number bro that is like that's like for recruiters like holy grill thank you god for sending me this person you know they get super excited they get they get super excited about this you know because they like this hey ice biscuit decreased search time by 75 percent that says a lot yeah okay i for example integrate mls agreed to pull 70 000 houses listings that says a lot if you could put numbers in there it's gonna give them an idea of the type of work you really have to do exactly there's a difference between 70 000 and just 1000 exactly and so if we go back to here right for example right and then then right away you can see i talked about technologies i used python php flash api so i talked about the knowledge that i use and then you provide the link right there the link right there yeah so simple right i provide the link let's talk about next time service contracts platform wait i don't even know who this was oh this is a long time ago so there was like a company i worked for right and so forth the date right here right created an architecture for the front end single page application using english is right remember the keyword right keyword keyword who's this hey is keyword here right guys nice next tip next thing increased core readability core readability and decrease maintenance by using proper english techniques yep keywords right maintain front and back and applications creating integration google maps and customer io it's like when we say keywords it's literally a verb it's a look at all these things i did something increased maintained created develop organized develop designed boom yes all of those are verbs it's something you are it's literally like when you write a function you want the function to be a verb because the function does something so they want to see here the things that you have done exactly for example you can see i have a github link right here i specified the github link as possible github link right here right and you can see just how clean this is yeah right all right let's continue on like experience right simple stuff experience um and you can see even right here i'm at a point where i don't even put my gpa i don't put my school anymore in here yeah because it's just so many projects right it's it's it doesn't matter now it's just irrelevant when once you guys have projects under your belt and you have experience on your belt you do not need to put even your degree at this point at all they do not give a [ __ ] about it well maybe they give a little bit but sometimes but they don't so all right let's continue on say nice thing experiences right here's you see again one page one big key to it one big thing to understand here right this is one page guys one page that's it and look at how much there's there is on this page and somebody asked the question hey is it why is it so full it's okay if it's full it's okay most importantly is how easy it is to read all right so and you want to make sure the things you have there are intentional it's actually you know it's not just like random things that are put on there right it's actually something that's gonna show them why you could actually stand out and land that job yes exactly next up for example so this is my experience right independent contract is when i was freelancing right here working with clients to integrate and build web apps apis using modern practices and clean architecture right software developer codevelop something develop right for when i was working as an intern at this company right here urban science right combine statistics and multiple carbons to showcase and predict the industry trends right created right develop again those keywords when when for example when i was when i still had my first uh job my first internship right here right establishing an intern codeveloped the back end of trondella increased product base by a hundred percent from sixty thousand two hundred twenty thousand right all those things right again key words exactly and i think that's pretty much it guys like it does not get it's it doesn't need to be more complicated than this does not simple anybody have any questions raise your hand on here and we'll i'll ask you a question anybody have any questions raise your hand and we will answer them anybody with questions amana um yeah we have one person called sahil okay go ahead you just unmuted him let's see all right go ahead no questions guys anybody any questions guys hold on raise your hand raise your hand hop high if you have a question or no questions yeah hey hi hi nas how are you doing so i'm good just wanted to ask if you are an experience you have worked in a company and they have certain rules and regulations that you cannot expose internal uh internal working of a project so for example if you are building a todo list which you are not doing in a certain company but if you are doing that they don't want you to say that okay you uh you made an app add button you added a functionality to add a button so how do i uh put that on my resume like what i did in that project uh do you have any and did i get what would you say what would you say because i have some i have a few things to say too yeah so for example with my company it's important that we don't talk about the specifics as well so if there's something i can't talk about specifically i guess i would i mean it depends because if they really say you can't talk about features that you've added without giving details like you literally can't talk about it at all i assume that's pretty tough because they really can't talk about it but i feel like you are actually able to talk about high level what you're able to achieve and the results you were able to get but you don't have to talk about the details of the actual workings inside because i'm sure that if you're talking to the recruiter and you do have some sort of uh confidentiality or whatever that's called they would respect that but at a high level you could still talk about the results you got yeah yeah yeah so i think for example if you're actually writing a description for that so i'm not if you're writing a description for the specific thing here's what i would do i would in description i would actually put down the following and this is i did this a few times and that has worked out for me pretty well i literally just say code developed code developed the application let's say i code develop when you say code develop i developed someone right so you say i codeveloped the todo list app right to do list apps and then what's going to happen and that's going to happen is when you get on a call with the recruiter right then they will ask you the details about that specific app and then you can talk about it right yeah but but initially i think you could say just codevelop the app right that you can talk about that experience there yeah yep exactly does that make sense sweet does that answer your question yeah all right guys we have the question we have one more ashwin yep ashwin yeah in us so oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] i want to highlight something really cool guys i want to highlight something hold on obiwan obi wayne guys look at this oh wayne man i just signed up for pwj for your pwj course because of anako kumar i'm looking forward to start tomorrow let's go man obiwan you are gonna start to get on these zoom calls now you're gonna be able to see knowledge you're gonna ask these questions you're gonna learn so much we're so excited to be part of the community and thank you kumar man i appreciate it man yeah dude donations donations i'm just like that the community is getting more stronger and stronger that's just great huh that's the best part man just it's gay it's getting too strong too strong too strong oh man no yeah stop press the blue button all right cool cool guys sweet guys so uh any other questions you guys have and we'll answer those questions yeah nice i was asking a question okay go ahead yeah so my question is related to my education so i have done my master's on bachelor's and i've done a diploma too in mechatronics engineering so i've been like studying that for the past eight years and right now like software development is so exciting for me and i want to get into that so once a recruiter sees my profile he's always asking if my master's is in data science or a certain like computer science and like recently i'd had an interview and like it went well to the end i was able to answer the technical questions but he assumed i was a masters in data scenes but i just told him i was mechatronics and like they didn't give me the offer so i just want to get some tips on how to work around that you want to talk about that so just to rephrase your question okay i'm just going to raise your question so what happened with you is you have a master's in something else right not data science okay what is it exactly it's mechatronics engineering what is it megatronics engineering what is that it's it's more related to robotics and stuff like it's that's very little coding cool so you have a master in metro's megatronics engineering okay and you apply for a job and they thought that you had a masters in data science correct yeah okay that's because the role i applied to was for a data engineer data engineer and so when they went ahead and they interviewed you right you you think that they declined you because the fact that you do not have the masters in data science correct yes did they tell this specifically the interview went on for almost an hour and about the end of the interview the recruiter asked me like if the degree wasn't like data science i just mentioned no it wasn't mechatronics and then like uh i i just felt it just because of that i didn't get the offer do you think do you think that's because of that i didn't get offer is that why is that what you think i think so but i'm not sure yeah i think so i think very important here guys is i and i'm you know i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna say this like very seriously please please please there's no need to do not lie you do not need to lie if you have a master's in data science you have a master data science there's nothing you could you can do about that right that actually that's what you have right now if they decided to not give it a role because of the fact that you that's what you have you know you have in mechatronics then what you do is you move on like you just move on right but yeah right you keep going and there will be there will be a company that is going to select you for your amazing role for your degree that you do have and for the mind that you do have so if one does not work out it is not the only role that is the very important part right so that's true yeah that's a very important part but please keep in mind and i'm saying this very importantly do not lie that's very very important guys okay do not buy didn't mention like as to what degraded i just put masters of engineering just put bachelor's of technology i didn't like mention mechatronics and like in either of those options so i think that misdirected the employer maybe maybe you you should maybe you should put down your actual masters that you have and yeah and i don't think it's something you to worry about too much there will be companies who will like what you have as well cool thank you but but maybe you know like don't ever don't almost also like maybe this maybe they didn't select you not because of the masters maybe there's something else maybe they just found someone else who knows most importantly just just keep going move on daniel yeah daniel i know you you apply for only three companies right microsoft google and you got right so this guy is just crazy okay let's just i'll tell you that okay i applied for 50 jobs i applied for 50 jobs guys okay so i was a little bit positioned but i kept kept kept going yeah when you think about a job it's not just about finding a job it's about finding a job for you and actually it might actually be good for you that you didn't get this job because it wasn't something different that you might have not had the right expertise like yeah maybe it wasn't just a degree maybe you didn't have the experience they were looking for and that would be great for you because if you showed up to a job that you really did not know what you were doing you're gonna have to learn something completely new that's a very stressful situation that maybe that's not a situation that you want to be in so when you're out there looking for jobs just keep in mind it's not just about you know onesided thing it's a twoway thing you want to make sure there's gonna be a place where you're gonna fit in as well and it's you know with the things that you want to be working on exactly that makes sense okay cool cool let's keep going now let's go ahead and review some of these jobs review some of these resumes guys okay and we'll go ahead and get into those so where can i get those recipes is my question okay oh there it is okay you guys ready to review those resumes giving you so dope let's go bro daniel dude that was not my fault for daniel i need access to the air table request access real quick see guys you see what i have to deal with sometimes wait uh i'll drop the link for you oh thank you so the link for me but yeah but but it's not the link says i have to request access it's not your fault you got it it's not daniel's fault guys it's only someone's fault joe you what were you saying something yeah i just want to quickly share my screen and show you some things i just want to reconcile go ahead share what you got uh uh well i need permission from your do you want to share your screen yeah okay hold on one second let me see um hopefully people will be able to see that hold on let me see um come on that's what that means now hold on because if i stop [ __ ] what are you what are you trying to share out joe uh just a quick i had a quick question on my resume i just wanted to show it to you if it is did you submit your resume did you submit your resume to your table i did not know okay okay in that case we'll we'll go over it like that okay can you send me a resume somehow through slack and air table just you okay can you can you can yeah or just sign me in the slack joe send it to kazzy and slack because i have kazzy slack right now send it to kazzy and slack okay and we'll go over that sound to me like asap okay go ahead okay let me go and open up that that air table boom boom boom you got it yeah hold on no do not send it to kazi send it to okay yeah yeah yeah all right what are the questions you've done youtube all right any questions okay you can go ahead and answer any questions that are on youtube let's see what's up may we know let us know your experience on software right here code daily collection here's a good question guys let's let's answer this one while i'm searching for stuff i have a code review interview tomorrow after doing a small letter okay i feel like a little kid again i have a code review interview tomorrow after doing a small project do you guys have any advice what kind of questions might they be asking thanks so usually from my experience when it comes to code review especially if you developed it you they just want to make sure that you're going to have good design moving forward what that means is that very often especially if you're with senior senior developers they think into the future of like will this design be able to take into consideration if we have to add new features take new features will it be like bug proof and a lot of those things so what i would actually advise for you in the code interview is come openminded right like if they ask you a question that you really don't know as well just be honest transparent be like i would know but what you know what advice you have there but also just go there ready to take on critique and ready to learn from those things so you can become a better programmer yourself because very often people close off and they don't take on that feedback and then they're not able to improve so code reviews are that it's to be able to get critiqued on and to be able to improve upon those skills yeah does that make sense guys that answered a question on youtube hopefully that did yeah hopefully hopefully that answered the question i thought it was a pretty good answer honestly so uh i joe i got your resume out here joe okay there you go let's see you see it right there yeah i do okay let's see let's critique your resume let's see what we can do with this one let's let's go ahead and uh yeah we'll we'll we'll dive it out as much as possible okay joe so check this out okay okay um also so cool guys i think this is the first uh youtube channel to do you know resume i have i don't have react on here because i've not yet done like fullfledged projects but this is just my past experience you know i'm just showcasing what i like a summarized version and then just my most current job what i did and as you said i tried to use as many action words to describe what i did um i just wanted to see if anything else i can do any better gotcha so okay now first things first okay so a few things okay first things first right away off the bat first for off the bat you need to stop centering everything okay see how this is centered here's why joe because if you stand everything then my eye has to go here here here here here center it go my eye right now is going everywhere right it's taking more me it's taking me more time to actually review your resume and it's actually hard for me to understand it versus if you left the line everything here then i can go i can go down the list like this okay yeah totally agree yeah it's it's hard for me right now to read this stuff like data analyst okay okay this is cool right but if you just kind of like left online everything if you made this everything left the line it's not this it's a small thing that can make a big impact gotcha i'm taking notes cool awesome so that's part one so let's go ahead and write this stuff down as we're kind of doing this stuff right here so i'm going to write this stuff down so one we talked about what we talked about let me put joe here one is left align okay next up next up what so in the top you're taking a lot of space just put your name your email and your linkedin you could compact that so much to just be literally on that first top line so you don't have to take up that much because again this is more than one page and we talked about making sure the resume was just one page so you could definitely start to compact the top and putting everything together up there joe does that make sense okay awesome man awesome so we went over the left line the next thing is compacting the top because there's a lot of space taken here compact packed at the top right yep because that's information about you that you could just have up there on the top that's it so come back to the top right because you're taking a lot of formation so that's okay that's another thing and if you come back to the top what you'll be able to do is you'll be able to put this on one page probably yeah right right so you want that that's the goal if you compact the top you'll be able to put the stuff on one page correct exactly yes so that's that's that's the number one what is this m two zero oh that's number one that's one number never mind number five but that's good that's good next up what what's another thing that i think we can do what do you think about this like really long description do you think it's useful right here yeah so i guess one of the first things that pops out to me joe is i really don't know after i read your linkedin i don't know what the next thing is like it says you know like you're telling me guess what you do is that like a job you had is that a project you worked on then the next is experience summary technology summary so is that like part of the data analyst or like i'm really confused as to what i'm looking for right if you recall nas is in my resume there was like a specific section and it said this is my experience or nas is these are my noteworthy projects and then they had all the projects so i guess just here it says data analysis project management bi reporting was that a job was that just like some experience you have on this so this was basically this was a so again this was my first resume first pass then based on if the if the position was more on bi then i would say you know bi uh engineers i would i would change this up so i have multiple versions based on the position i applied for i applied for anything from a sql server dba to a business intelligence analyst or ssrs ssis report developer etl so joe really quickly here right away i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you this off the batman all this stuff you don't need instead instead put it instead this is what you need instead it's this right here that you know professional experience right what did you actually do right to put you actually because you don't have experience right now like i see professional experience right this does not so senior database reporting analyst right there boom right there that my friend this oh shoot not this one this should be at the top this right here this should be at the top information resource inc gig this should be on the top would you agree with me on that yeah because that's the things that you're actually that's the experience right there right that's what they want to see does that make sense developed analytical reports using power bi right like that's something you did effectively utilized oracle generated insight like those are the things that you've done right the beginning is just kind of like hey if you go back to the top what else do we have in the top yeah i mean like all this the experience summary like it's hard for me to read this yeah it's hard for me to understand what is your actual experience right away that so so here here's what i would say so there's no flow you're so you're saying flow there's no there's no flow if i were you if i were you here's how i do this i think this is a bit too much there's too much content on here you can really summarize this down business intelligence uh hi um highly a a i am a business intel in intelligence analyst with strong experience and just you can just uh you can just summarize it to just be this and the accounting services right there that's it i think that that's a bit too much okay summarize it to one sentence really really quick yeah and what i'm getting is basically like this whole front page if you look at nas's uh resume if you could pull it up just to show them real quick i don't know if you see that uh i have it i haven't i haven't like if you look at right here nods you see this technical skill section where it's just like this very small section that's the okay i got it like like it took your whole page to do what nas was able to do in just like an eighth of a page you see that yep you see that so if you were to put so here you see you have technology summary this kind of stuff this is you should put that all the way at the top right away this right this this right here you can remove this this you don't need this because you could talk about your experience through basically the projects i like if you say you develop something yeah that's talking about your experience like hey i developed this i maintain this i created that i designed that as you're being like these are the actions i took that is your experience with with if i if i take this out it's it's it's just one page yeah take joe this yeah like i said just take this out you do not need this this you want to talk about this these parts these parts you want to talk about in like the actual in uh what's it called in your actual projects in what you in in the projects that's what they care about superman thank you all right let's well let's let's keep going let's get we're not finished this yet let's keep going on this one hold on because we got you on here so let's keep going with this stuff okay so we so like just how we talked about one make that part smaller right so for example right so let's go ahead and talk about so uh oh shoot no i wouldn't okay so decrease this description size right description right is the font size too big too small i was not sure font size is fine you're good you're good i worry about making it one page that's that's not that's part one okay and how about bulletin like uh making it bold versus don't worry so for example if you look if you go back to mine for example if we go back to mine you see how i i highlighted the most important things you see you see the lefthand side you see how your eye just so nicely flows down like your eye is so easily it's so easy to flow down with your eye and exactly what you want to read gotcha see i highlighted for example i highlighted the languages the frameworks the concepts right now where they project i highlighted those specific things and then i bought a bullet pointed what i actually did you didn't go through like a professional resume writer to do this right no i did this myself i went through google and linkedin okay yeah so he actually sent his resume out to people who are working at google and linkedin and look and said like hey can you check out my resume is it good am i talking about the things i need to be talking about exactly that's what i did and that was more helpful than anything else honestly and that is what got me the interviews that that that i had yet i'm saying so let's keep going let's let's keep going what you have let's keep going joe beautiful all right next up technology summary so i love how we do this kind of stuff right here in terms of here like i'm guessing keywords what's up spearheaded your head of the development oh dang generator development i like that joe let's go spear the development conversation of all this excel okay dramatically reduce i would say you can limit this to three to four bullet points you don't need this many talk about the most important which is like for example generate insightful performance reports by cop like by comparing sales right effectively utilize oracle analytics reporting to create or to create reports published is to the central reporter hosted right so developed a local report using power bi to demonstrate proof of concept right so these i think key things are gonna be a very big key things right here like you don't need to have specific specify everything right just talk about the important things got it okay okay and so i love how you're using so one things i do love i do love how you're using those like you know formulated for example you're using those keywords those uh you know actual keywords that is a big thing yeah this part joe is already amazing if you want to take it to the next level i would say similar to nas if there's things you can quantify right right like for example the generated insightful performance and i don't know did that improve something by x percent yeah but you don't have to go back and do this but if there's numbers that you know that you can quantify again that's something that someone can see like oh my god this is how much it improved this is how much it was optimized or whatever that is exactly exactly and for example you see how you have power bi here right power bi right so what if i was you what i would do is how did power bi help them let me ask you well they we were in the middle of transition so they were debating between power bi and tableau and okay but how the reports that look look the reports that you created using power bi how did that help them help them in making that decision whether they should go with oracle or uh or stay with my microsoft also for a great study no it was uh the how easily can you develop versus uh uh you know um how much of a learning curve it is if you go tableau versus power bi and since you are already we were a microsoft shop you know we it was not much of a from a cost perspective it was more efficient to go power bi than tableau you know the whole licensing structure so it was more efficient to go with power bi right so you would say for example decreased efficiency reporting efficiency by creating reports in power bi boom okay yeah i could put that yes boom decrease efficiency boom and if you can say a certain percentage by like 50 you're golden yeah and again you don't have to like if you don't have a number don't lie about it don't lie about it yeah what if they do reference check like you know they ask for a reference check from the most recent job right so obviously i'll be i'll be giving my boss's phone number and i don't know how granularity they get to it when they talk about they don't they don't get to game granule and that stuff but you don't need to lie about this stuff again don't think about it so much just don't lie that's it okay decrease efficiency efficiency reporting efficiency right reporting supporting efficiency efficiency by creating power bi by using power bi that's it cool that's it both that is so effective versus like develop endless support probably like like if you read that like this like honestly this for me just it's just like this this something in my brain like something just like decreased reporting efficiency but using power bi that's just like it's just like good versus like develop unless support using part of your audience that's cool yeah you know versus this oh wow that's impressive if it's very action oriented it's something that can go into someone's head very does that make sense guys yep okay um uh i just want to add something like uh not about this resume i mean like not joe's resume but something in common like i saw those uh submissions on the air table and what i think is like most people uh don't know the big difference between a resume and a cv like a cv is a place where you have almost everything in it in detail and a resume is like you know the summary of it right yes yeah and that's a good problem so uh what you do is like in linkedin or somewhere where recruiters are searching for people you put in your resume and okay you say okay these are the ins in summer you say these are the skills i've got and these are the projects i've worked on and what they do is those recruiters go through all those resumes in quick uh you know like they almost spend like five minutes in a resume and from those like 100 to 200 resumes they like you know funnel down to about 20 10 to 20 resumes and from those resumes they go on to ask their cvs right and then from those things say one more time yeah so what i was telling was like uh recruiters go through almost like all because like they don't spend much time on almost all the uh resumes they spend almost like five minutes and within those five minutes they decide whether they go to the next step that is get their cvs right so from almost like 200 resumes they funnel down to almost like 10 or 20 resumes and they request their cvs and from those cvs they you know funnel down the next step is whether they are getting that interview with them uh am i right so that's questionable so um cv wise here's the thing and i'll be honest with you here are not as important as some people think there's a cover letter rarely one of them that's uh no no cv is like the longest the longest yeah but very few times very few will a company ask specifically for a cv yeah that's required exactly because it's so long to read that unless the company is willing to spend the time going through four pages per person of all the people that they're looking at will that happen so more often than not it's about having the onepage resume yes that is more important in a cv and we can do another call on cv another youtube live call on cv that's something guys interested let me know like raise your hands up high let me know actually i'm very curious actually if you guys want to do like a one on cv you guys hear me raise your hand if you guys want to do a cv yeah yeah yeah okay cool cool cool cool cool sweet so if you guys want to do that we'll do that too but most importantly i think it's going to be your resume okay awesome all right guys let's go ahead and go through one more god this is taking up so much more space we'll have to do like another live call just on like linkedin personal branding with a lot of things this is going to be a lot guys okay all right going through some of your stuff you're on here right i knew him so i do not have too much to write but i just filled up something with it so okay so a few things i like about this actually so a few things i i love about this resume um a few things and i was going to point this out is like easy flow like simple flow it's like it's easier to read like i know what i want to go next to yeah you know so for example like this is easy to read so joe when you are for example joe you can take some note from here for example you see how he has it this is a great way for example so easy to read this is really easy right i know that i okay i know his name boom there's a summary has education here's some skills he knows these skills here's some work experience vote so simple right and check this out also check this out it's also one page okay now a few things what can we improve what can we improve what do you think yeah i really want to know um i mean it's already one page because i was gonna say maybe some things could be a little more for example the skill section it is taking up a lot of space now right now you already have like it's already in one space all right it's already one page right so maybe that's fine for now but as you're adding more projects you want to highlight the projects more you want to highlight what you did in those projects you want to highlight that experience because that's what's going to get you the job right that's what they're looking for someone who has that experience so the skills are definitely an area that you could start to compact over time if you if you remember nasa's resume the skills is literally one line or like it talks about frameworks concepts and languages it's literally three lines and that's where he has all the skills he highlights them again a bit on the section it's like oh in this project where i did all these things yeah i focus on these skills but again i think for now your skills is fine but that's an area that you're going to want to compact as you're adding more things to your resume cut yes actually actually the problem was that i graduated this year and i do not have hardcore projects which i could put in here in the resume so that was one of the points because of which i didn't put it uh just to fill out the space i put in my skill slide like uh on this uh but yeah i'll just uh take your note and uh i'll just do that after doing the project yeah so for example if you if you if you want to take up more space it's actually better to have some more more like white space more white space right and but just just create more more padding between each section right yeah right so i think that yeah for example here here so one that i think i was gonna say you can do is decrease your summary your summary is okay too much there's too much there you know you say rookie is a fulltime friend responsible for creating right so you're responsible for creating frontend designs and styling using react native javascript as a private language interested in developing a better problemsolving method to fail to test oh god you know you don't need to have this right all this interested in devising this stuff like it's cool stuff but you don't really need that you are very specific i am a developer i am a frontend design a i am a frontend developer using react.js frontend engineer i'm a frontend right there fulltime frontend engineer responsible for creating frontend designs and styling using regulated javascript as a primary location that's it yeah that's it that that's all you need sure and also like you're experiencing your projects can do the talking for you exactly because if you talk about the experience in your project like hey you know this is my current work or whatever i've done this i've done that i've done that i did that and it was using you know react.js or whatever that is they're like holy crap he's a front engineer because he's done all these things right so very often yeah very often it's like you want your resume you want the actions from your resume to speak for you that's why they say in the experience make it action oriented result oriented because that's going to speak for your experience instead of you trying to come up with like this wellworded paragraph that says this is everything that yeah exactly we got regarding but yeah so so yeah so just some things which you want to do highlight the projects decrease summary right you what you want to what you want is like if you go down here yeah i don't see any projects you know in this right so you want to bring up the projects above what you have in education it's perfect that's fine right that there's nothing i like i like that um how you have your design of like this orange like it's fine it's nothing bad about this it's just something unique about the resume that won't really hurt you or harm you um i like how you added actually it's really interesting that's a big change that you want to see i mean that's pretty interesting i think it's like nothing too bad about that because it doesn't doesn't catch your eye too much right but just there it's nice to have okay so it's pretty it's pretty easy it's pretty unusual yeah so scroll down to his workings yeah let's talk about the work experience here because he here's here's the thing like i feel you could go very deep here and you'll you're probably gonna want to go very deep here with the things and the results you were able to get right and that's right that's how i was saying that like i feel like the skill section is taking up a lot of space because what should take space is your work experience as a frontend developer right as a i mean all these have been the frontend developers but going deep into the things that you did the results that you were able to get was there any quantifiable things that were able to happen from what you did because again what's more important is if you only have one line of like one line on this paper i'd rather see created xyz by doing that and optimize that then yeah rest api yeah so for example let's just take an example here like for example okay let's talk about the ti school frontend developer okay so this is a work experience this is i'm guessing this is at a school correct like at some kind of a school yeah that's an internship okay so what i would say this like for example this react native so you would say as a bullet point here right i would say for example i would say um designed so design application for the company with react random blah blah blah reduce their connected applications and various okay connect applications with abs server along with sign in okay we styling so what was that what was this application used for why did you develop this application how did this application help the company so actually uh this company was specifically for teaching kids coding and i had to design the whole app and i did all of the work with the designing uh and yeah that said the backend part was made i just had to create the frontier and just connect all of it but this company was it useful for the company like did this app help the company yeah like after as soon as the clients got connected with the company and they all started using the app uh as simple and uh yeah that was this use um like uh as soon as they'll uh just start the app they'll learn the maths and whatever the subjects they want uh with the related to coding and what the basics are and everything was in the app so they could easily see and understand can you tell us exactly what that app is so um like for kids it's actually for like uh from class uh grade uh fifth or twelve uh so they can uh sign in with the app and uh they can it's like platforms okay it's like a learning platform correct yeah just recording boom right there check this out you created a learning platform app yeah right create the authentication for the learning platform no you designed did you design did you create the whole app i focused uh i i designed the full app but the the idea was already made from the back end that was made i designed the uh frontend whole front end designed right designed designed the designed uh the front end of a learning design a learning platform front end using react native yep right there boom that is interesting look okay i focused on different uh wrong thing so yeah i should have decided exactly yeah so here it's not about the technology it's about what you did you designed it you implemented it you you know developed it right and then along with that you integrated a server to be able to sign in it's an authentication service you i don't know like you also styled it right it's like all these action words of what you actually like they don't i don't think they really care if you used it in react native redux javascript right like you could put that at the end dodge has that at the end but the beginning is what are the things that you did what are the results that you were able to do yeah you designed something you developed oh yeah get that design learning yeah yeah i named the apple learning platform because or actually it's not an education platform i think it may be a better yeah education platform that's even a lot more powerful right because when you say yeah okay that because we know that creating a platform like that is takes a lot of time and it's not easy right yeah and is this for kids is this for kids yeah yeah yeah oh [ __ ] look at this ab for for kids to using react and then you say for kids for what kind of kids like for younger kids for kids yeah yeah from uh grade five fifth to twelfth boom so as you start to write a lot of these sentences into you know your work experience this is what i was saying before you're gonna start to fill out a lot more space and then later you could adjust because this is the important stuff this is the stuff that they're going to see what impact you have in the project what impact you've had in the company that makes sense okay that's perfect yeah i got it got it got it yeah so what you have on here is perfect but i think you just you can just modify it even better i love how yeah what i what i love you know you you kind of have a similar style that even i have for example like for you see how he has you know work experience here you know how much time when for to what time that's just so simple to read right so this guy's finding one and if you take note because it's a very similar style to even like what i have i mean for example that that uh that daniel here has right um it's just very very quick to me and i'll just modify every line of it and uh i'm sure it will get time i'll just get checked with modify modify and then send it to me okay or send to daniel yeah we'll take a look at that more then you'll get your job yeah that's where the one yeah and i love so the achievements that i think that's pretty cool too you put the achievements on there um one thing i would say also don't forget is uh reference i think a lot of companies want a reference do they want to reference you i i never got asked for reference unless i knew somebody inside did you have a reference or no i never had them never had that one maybe it's not necessary but i personally had a reference but it probably wouldn't hurt maybe i mean it literally took up like the last chunk so whatever if you have a reference for example someone who can speak for you that'd be great as well okay sure sure got it yeah yeah yeah sweet yeah thank you so much you got it man it's so happy yeah i'm cool thank you so much you got it holy moly dude this is almost three hours i think i don't know how much like i think we should create this put it and couldn't do another live call going more deeper into more of these resumes than linkedin so if you made it this far into the call i'm talking to people on youtube let us know if you really got value from this yeah because this is something that we could start doing every week exactly now if you're in pwj and you also got a lot of value from this let us know so that we know this is something to implement inside of pwj community and if you're in youtube listening to what i just said you're going to realize that there's a lot of value in the pwg community so something that you can do is you can go to the live webinar that we're going to have on sunday tomorrow tomorrow i think it's 11 am pst 11 11 a.m 11 p.m no 11 a.m go ahead and check that out guys link in the description go on that webinar will be a lot of valuable volleyball provided and for those of you guys really cooking here i already see you guys on here um here on zoom okay all i gotta ask for let's go oh shoot there it is let's go ahead and turn on all of your cameras really quickly here guys turn on all your cameras all right let's keep them on keep them on keep them on let's go let's go let's go we can all see your beautiful faces now beautiful beautiful

guys you guys want to rock it out for a little bit just have some fun for a little bit maybe stretch yours stretch yourself oh boom boom boom wait was that was i needed dude yeah i allowed everyone to unmute now because it's over i'm unmuted after i near i guess what's up man i just feel so good after being unmuted so i can fight guys for those of you who we did not we did not get to resumes yet i think we should do this like every week i think we're just every week because there's so many if you can if you can just take out time that will be just perfect i think every week like every saturday me and daniel i know daniel guys unfortunately daniel he's actually he's like he's leaving you know he's leaving to like were you leaving to i'm going back home to texas yeah yeah so boo hoo i'm for that but am i complaining no man don't go please he's it did it he'll still be here guys if if anything what we'll do is we'll bring him on uh on skype so he'll still yes he'll still be here virtuous that's not doesn't matter and i think we should do this every week i think that should be fun like give us a thumbs up you think we should keep doing this guys give us a thumbs up yeah yeah i mean yeah yeah i think it would be uh it would be a good idea to do this kind of stuff on linkedin personal branding on linkedin and stuff yeah that's super huge that's what we're going to talk about today but we got so kind of with the resumes it was so awesome yeah trying to add value to you guys that that we're like all right we'll do that later we'll just focus on resumes today sunday is like on youtube i was like i want to buy pwg course what are you waiting for oh wait no wait hold on this is so funny guys check this out so check this out i'll be waiting for jay just recently he had a team tree house he cancelled his stream trial subscription and instead he bought pwm let's go let's go that's because he knows what's up oh my god oh my god hey now zombie live what's up we are still alive guys are you guys i want to say something i want to say something go ahead guys if you are still not in profit with javascript what are you guys man what you are doing what are you even doing with your life bro just just go to cleverprogrammer.com just just do it bro tomorrow the prices are increasing there you go just do it bro nike bro just do it i've got what i thought but but tell them why tell them why why yeah so so i'll give my opinion on this so it's been only four days since i joined profit with javascript and the community is awesome bro and everyone is so helpful like i have already made some friends and this is all cool and coaching calls are fun as well as informative like we can directly contact you guys for any help and you guys all you all guys always are very happy to help us and that's so huge like i don't think anyone else else does that and this is not scripted by the way if you are thinking okay just do it to say something no a lot of stuff any everybody here who talks and we are so yeah and one more thing yeah so guys like even the even if there are certain number of modules in the course this course is not ending at all because we have live calls i think we have more live score than the day than the number of days in the week like we are having live calls every day literally every day and so the stuff never ends in this course you don't have just a specific number of modules you have unlimited stuff and limit of value it's great and in the community you have people from all around the world people who are working at fang i just contacted a person one of a pwj student who is work he was working at microsoft and i got like i took advice from him and it was great like he helped me on a lot of stuff his name is ray ray is a very sweet person he just dropped in few of the links few resources and his dope i also contacted many other people so like you you can contact anyone like you you can get on oneonone call with nas kazi and you can also contact many people so this community is awesome leaf is one of the like he's the debugger of uh pwg community he helps in like he helps everyone and that's it guys this course is great the community is more awesome and it's never ending so what are you even waiting for but you know you have so much of uh knowledge that you would many people already have but they're not being able to consolidate it right yeah i mean and in this program you know it's not like if you're studying node.js you're just doing notepads if you're doing react you're just doing react you know you're doing real life projects and you're consolidating all the knowledge into one box so that tends to give you a lot of confidence thank you and i'm like literally one thing more if you guys are thinking this is a scam just remember one thing these are the guys who just gave out uh free videos on youtube for major projects like youtube stone uh like so many clones and just for free and that is the thing where if you do not want to buy even pwj you can learn so much but still just think that if you'll buy uh this pwj how much you are gonna learn like what what are what you are going to you know have what community and with the people who actually are focusing on just you know react javascript and css html like you will have such a strong community and you'll just never give up you'll never want to give up so just go for it and do not think that money is an issue it will just come back as kazi says that it's just the perfect line and it's true it will always come back okay so just do not think about money and adding adding adding to the wandering one you guys are doing this just almost one just once listen on monday and i've given my first free tutoring call to a student life consume oh man we were able to debug the whole session where that student was stuck and it was like an amazing experience and i just if you are thinking like you will invest some amount of money and you're not going to get it back that's totally wrong you are going to get it back get it i heard this yeah that's a good point guys we just have to sit here you guys literally just talk for us i just love that i just like you guys are the best like seriously i've never had such an amazing community such an amazing family such i've never been been a part of such an amazing pro not it's not a good product just such an amazing family like something that's like that people just care for so much you know and the same time value to you like that the fact that you guys tells us with what tells us that we are doing something right that the same time that we want to provide keep running even more and more value you know what i mean so like that when nasty is dancing we are company with a heart and we are not just a company we have company with a heart exactly guys so with that said let's go ahead and maybe do some dancing if we can let's still see let's see oh yeah i'm very curious if actually you guys will be able to hear it i'm very curious maybe you guys have to hear it maybe not if you guys on youtube if you guys can't hear it i am sorry on that but you know what we've got the pdw and they're killing it so actually why did i say why am i i just go sure hey let's go hey they're right here look at these amazing people so many amazing people hold on check this out let's go to share computer sound i'm going to show you computer sound right here music now yeah the whole you can spotlight people all right okay spotlight people too hey let's go leaf is going to get spotlight
