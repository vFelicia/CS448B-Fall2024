hey guys so in the last video I mentioned we're gonna do fine length of string but what's better for you guys is if we do another problem that's pretty similar so you you guys can test out your own skills as well just in case you got stuck on the even number problem right so let's see if you can write code that can give you an answer for the if it's the number is odd okay so this problem is called check for odd numbers alright so here I have write a function is odd that takes in a number and returns true if it's odd otherwise false so it's pretty much the opposite of finding an even number solution so with the even number problem if I gave you two it should return false right Iram sorry should return true but for them oops so real loud so same thing should happen for this one except when I give you three it should say true otherwise false now I'm going to go over the solution this problem just in case you haven't tried this on your own the link is below to the problem and to the solution so if you're on watching this on YouTube go ahead and try it on your own if you're on my website clever programmer calm everything should be aokay anyways then so let's get started I have some function it's called is odd that's the first step to get correct and you can check how it works you at the bottom so again you can just go ahead and kind of cheat you see the function is called odd it takes in one input so you can kind of go like okay is odd hmm my input is some number and what can I do if that number what does it mean for a number to be odd right what does it mean for a number to be an odd number well all it means is that it's not divisible by two right so for example if I gave you 12 right is it divisible by two yes it is you get back true but if what if I give you 13 is that divisible by two no because 2 goes all the 12 and then there's a one spillover or remainder so here you have false but we just want to flip the results meaning this should give you false and this should give you true for the solution to this problem so let's go if number divisible by 2 is not equal to 0 then I want to say give me true otherwise give me false ok let's check if the solution work so i'm going to uncomment this part and let's go and run it and it says your code is correct so that's good let's try giving it you know is odd let's try giving it to 3 it says true and what if I give it to it should say false ok cool and now if you want to try the bonus challenge on your own pause the video go try it otherwise I'm going to go over the answer right now so here's the bonus way of doing it return number divisible by or mod 2 does not give you the remainder 0 ok so it's like the opposite of the even number function so there you go that's your oneliner right you're cheeky oneliner ok guys that's it for this video I'll see you in the next video
