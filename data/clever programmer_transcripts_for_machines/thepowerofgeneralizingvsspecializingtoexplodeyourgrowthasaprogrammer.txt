hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm in this video I want to talk about the power of generalizing versus specializing and how it can help you and it explode your growth as a computer programmer as a developer as a Python or JavaScript whatever programming language you're doing it's kind of free of that without any further ado let's jump right into it okay welcome guys this is Kazi from clever programmer comm Here I am in Colombia marrying and traveling trying to get as much footage as possible here because it looks awesome but I do want to say that while I'm travelling here and exploring new things right like I moved to LA just go a bit like recently and now I'm in Colombia just like traveling it's like broadening my horizons at a whole new level and it's allowing me to think and tap into new ways of thinking that I never thought of and it's helping me explode and grow the business that's clever programmer like clever programmer is about to turn into something that's bigger than me or any one person you know it's all of us and it's a movement and I wouldn't be able to think like that if I just stayed pigeonholed in one place at one time it doesn't let you operate at that higher level and so that's what traveling and exploring new things has done for me not Tommy and now tying it back to you right if you are learning let's say even programming you don't want to maybe even stick with one specific technology and become a specialist because like Robert Kiyosaki says in his book he says that specializing is for the I think he said something like for the bugs right and really the idea or insects I said something like that but basically idea is if you only specialize in one thing and kind of go laser focus in that you're not growing in all aspects of your life and you only have very linear growth okay it's very linear okay one for one when you look at and try new different days tap into possibilities you never explored before you have this explosive growth that's kind of what happened to clever programmer business like how it grew into this big thing in less than a year right that doesn't happen for many of those are coding channels and it's not because of me it's because I'm constantly changing my surroundings constantly changing the people that I'm around and the thoughts that I'm letting it because as long as you remember the thoughts you're letting in are not your own and they can be changed as a very powerful and freeing thing and you could use it to your advantage okay so if you want to become a better programmer why don't you travel go to New York places and just meet people there and maybe they can teach you some new ways of program right it just opens up the way that you think and explore and look for opportunities you might not have been looking in the places before you know also it lets you go of the fear of what's new what's next then you can apply the same thing to programming the same reason why people get so afraid of applying to this job or that job because we're afraid we don't know what's there and we don't know if we're gonna get accepted we don't know there's a lot of unknown variables so when you do new things all the time you become less fazed by the unknown you actually start enjoying the unknown okay and that's how I want you to look at your life as a programmer as a web developer as a businessman whatever it is that you're doing okay and if you can do that you will tap and you will grow at an exponential level and that's what I want you to be doing in whatever area of your life you're in do that you will explode you will grow a lot other cool things right like I'm here and you could hire a private instructor to coach your programming in United States that might have been like I don't know 100 hundred $50 an hour you could come to another country like Colombia I'm 18 and you could have programmers train you for like $10 an hour or $15 an hour and they're badass programmers so just different way of thinking and kind of think of value arbitrage as well right take advantage of all these opportunities that we have in this world you're not supposed to you know most people 80% of the people die within 300 hour radius of 300 miles from Woodman where they're born you don't want to be part of that statistic ok squad Explorer have fun and as always this is Kazi I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
