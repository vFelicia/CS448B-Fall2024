what's up you guys how's it going it's david here from cleverprogrammer.com and we are live one of the most requested videos out there ever uh and i personally got a ton of messages regarding this topic what am i using what are we using uh what sorts of tools uh are we actually building our stuff with what are we using inside of clever programmer so that is exactly what i am going to be talking about today so with that said let's drop a comment where are you coming in where are you checking in welcome everybody to the stream and once again this is one of the most requested topics what are we using how are we building our stuff what is the tools that you should be investing into and not spending your money on dumb stuff what's up hello everybody hey planet hey wonder code what's up lean blue happy birthday for you tomorrow amazing it's amazing we are 40 people strong in one and a half minutes that's good and we are getting started in just a second so are you guys excited about this who is excited let me know in the chat what's up live to code hashtag ltc how's it going bro all right so before we actually gonna get go ahead and get started i amazing i see those likes going up keep it that way because the best way that you can become a developer is that you go ahead and smash that like button without question amazing super pumped awesome hey what's up how you guys doing we are at 42 people are the tools going to be very expensive or like on a budget good question i forgot to say that so some of them are going to be expensive some of them are going to be free we kind of try to balance between these and just give you guys an idea of what to be expected um i just wanted to keep it super clear we are trying to keep things uh as free and as cheap as possible because nobody wants to break their bank just to become a developer right there are like smarter investments and there are on smart investments so first thing first i want to clear this up uh the tools don't matter as much as the skills if you were to invest in your skills or in your tools or buying your new computer or buying a course obviously go with the course the reason being is that if you go with the new computer that's not gonna make you money obvious ultimately you're gonna be coding on that but that's not gonna make you that much cash so you always want to invest in for growth right all right uh amazing firebase is one of them probably that's a good catch but actually we're we are talking about stuff that support you while programming so with that said let's jump into the presentation wrong screen haha so first up uh i just want to welcome everybody to the ultimate buyer guide 2021 what tools and tech i need to invest or spend money on okay invest in all right let's take a look at those comments okay amazing so yeah once again one of the most requested highest requested uh topics to talk about so yeah let's get started first thing first it is time to focus drop your phone aways it's going to be a fast short live amazing lean blue uh welcome to your first live and is learning ai easy it depends right we got uh content on that all right so time to focus put your phone away put the do not disturb on this is the time just give me these uh 30 minutes and we will be done with it all right so i'm gonna turn on my fancy pointer first thing that i get asked the most is a laptop or a desktop all right um this is kind of like how i think desktop is beating laptops by the way so my recommendation if you're going for a laptop you definitely want to check out the m1 macbook pro this is not sponsored by apple at all but i just kind of believe in their stuff especially with their new m1 chip it is the best that you can invest into and it's so so powerful obviously all our stuff we at cover programmer we use macbooks uh and imac so that's something to keep in mind this is an amazing stuff oh yeah yeah okay all right next up if you're buying a laptop be sure to invest in an external fan the reason being is that this these things are getting hot and you want to keep them cool otherwise they will throttle back on their performance this is probably one of the easiest one to get and the best one to get it has five different fans so yes that's uh that's something that you want to uh go for so you say but they're pretty expensive that is 100 right however you are investing into it for the next five seven years and if you break it down it's it's not even that uh that expensive and because of macbooks uh apple's new stuff you will need a usb c doc bot then you can pretty much customize whatever you want to plug into your computer okay h prevents programming or sailor nope it doesn't at all we have students uh ranging from 11 years old all the way up to 50 plus all right let's go and let's jump back so my recommendation for a desktop uh is obviously going to be the m1 mac mini once again because of the amazing uh computer that they built together that powerhouse is just the best bang for your buck all right specifications you will need at least 16 gigs of ram if you are not buying an m1 mac uh in nowadays world for the m1 buyers eight gigabyte is going to be enough once you are firing up a react app is going to kill all your ram and going to use a ton of resources because you are doing some heavy coding stuff and all these development environments actually take up a ton of resource um take up a ton of your computer uh yeah okay next up you definitely want to protect your eyes i'm not wearing it at this moment but i have a blue light glass if you become a student of ours i may show it how i look like in glasses but you definitely want to invest in a blue light glass it just uh keeps the blue light uh out of your eyes and you will be able to sleep better at night and all these kind of stuff so make sure to protect your eyes you are working with screens all around the place so that's something to keep an eye on pun intended ultra wide monitor the ultrawide monitor is one of the best investments uh that you can probably make and one of the best inventions that people made because you can get so many things done just by having an ultra wide and even a second screen so if you're if you're lower on budget you definitely want to get at least two three monitors but if if you can go for a bigger ultrawide monitor go for it it pays for itself the amount of productivity that you will be able that you will be blessed with just by having so many stuff open and being able to go all around the place just with a click it's going to pay for itself in terms of price all right you don't want to jeep out on your back but your back is going to get go is the number one thing your spines need to be aligned in place what kazi uses in his studio is this gt or racing chair this is probably a higher end something uh you can get this for a few hundred dollars but this is the ultimate thing you should be doing if you are just starting out or you're kind of like at the beginning you probably want to go with something like this make sure to have a head rest like i do make sure to have proper backrest like i like this one has lumbar support is super important and you definitely want to have these arms over here all right armrests over here okay nice chair super important don't cheap out on that because you will be sitting in this thing a lot so that's something to keep an eye on all right next up standing desks it is uh a little less important than having a good chair but having a standing desk has changed my life and so many people out there so a standing desk is actually something that you can go ahead press the button and it's just gonna raise up that way you can be standing and working once again for your back for your legs and you can just move around have a uh little bit of movement all the way so that's something once again and you and even if you have an apple watch it will actually warn you every single hour that you should be jumping around a little just to get your bloodstream uh flowing around so that's once again important thing don't cheap out on that let's get to the softwares because that's literally the most requested stuff uh that you were asking me about so softwares that that will level up your game prototyping tools sketch this one is a paid software it's i think uh there is student pricing available it i think they drop it off 40 i got it with student pricing this is an amazing tool i'm literally not using anything else for prototyping whenever i build some custom stuff i always go into sketch first and then just sketch it out pun intended once again figma free version of sketch knows almost everything as sketch but it's free it's an amazing tool and you can you can pretty much do almost ever anything uh that you can do with sketch however sketch has a little more plugins and just those little details that make a software different all right and adobe xd once again a freemium software i think i honestly i hate adobe stuff but uh some people in the team and a lot of my developer uh peers that i know use adobe xd so that's once again that something you can use and actually the more of this you're familiar with the more kinds of software that you can build and and the more kinds of designs and prototypes that you can create and actually the more kinds of clients you are going to be compatible with because they might as well just send you a photoshop file and then you cannot open them in either sketch nor figma you will need to use adobe xd terminal this is the fanciest stuff uh you guys are interested in hold on a sec uh let me go ahead and open up my terminal real quick so this is the thing that i actually use and we here at clever programmer use if i i can just go into my local uh git version control and that that's actually where all my folders are and i can just list all these stuff and it looks super nice and if i were to go into uh the twitch clone say which we actually built on this channel and let's say what we have in here so once again twitch clone uh come on jesus okay i have some nested stuff in there bang it actually shows the git version control over here uh this was actually initialized before github uh and all these git version control software is refined that the uh the default branch is not going to be master anymore and calling it master is discontinued now we are calling it main but this was uh actually initialized before that time so yep and that's something to uh look out to plus it will make you super cool and just popping this up in a cafe will just make you look so much more professional and will honestly this was the software that weighed me made me want to use terminal all right next up i term 2. i personally don't use this but uh i i just use the built in uh mac software but i haven't uh actually tested this out yet but i am planning to transition over to item 2 because it actually just takes everything to another level the oh my zsh is uh amazing by itself and it just can be put into whichever terminal you're already using but but item just takes everything to another level and git version control definitely something i'm not even sure why it's in the terminal whatever it's in it's over here anyways get version control you don't want to miss out on productivity apps notion of hold on notion notion is the number one productivity app that you will use this is literally my notion that i use and this is actually uh the youtube report this is pretty much those videos that i uh did yesterday and two days before that i think and those are given to our professional editor kyle who will actually just chop it up and i will be uploading them i think he even actually finished those so it's just me who needs to upload it anyways notion 100 recommended uh it is free once again it is free by the way all the terminal stuff is free free for free 3.99 and you can actually go ahead grab them download them and just be more productive because at the end of the day you will save time and the more time you save the more time you will have to take on more projects which will ultimately make you more money again uh productivity app another one is alfred it is actually on my main screen now but if you know this thing this one on steroids i can search up my contacts i can search up files on my machine makes it so much faster and you can just build so uh workflows in there so i just type in a comment and it will just execute it so basically when i turn on my computer i just type in alfred started or something like that and it would just open up all my used application that i already use and integrated with a few more applications and everything is just going to be in place just how i left it the night before and i actually turned off my computer because of that dropler dropper is your number one uh screenshot application i wanted to say it so fast so if i hold down option shift and three and then just highlight this area it will open this window up i can mark up super fast i think it's actually uh paid by the way and i can point and click around this screenshot now why is this important you might be asking because it actually a screen shot up like who cannot annotate a screenshot right makes you fast and actually it will generate a link for you that you can share towards your clients this is something that we use inside of cleverprogrammer and makes us work 10x if not more faster 10x faster just because we take screenshots so much faster and we just point around and everybody knows where to look and even on a webpage or something that i have never ever seen before i can just look around just because i have the arrows and all those annotations in there all right loom same thing but with video uh only drawback you cannot annotate but anyways super fast and it will actually upload while you are recording it will record your screen yourself and you can by the way turn it off if you want don't want to record yourself but we'll make your life so much faster because while you're recording it is actually uploading so super fast again and it will just give you a link that you can share with your clients now coming back to the first topic that we had and this is the end do you actually need to upgrade if you are have a good enough stuff that is just working the answer is no where do you need to upgrade your skill set something that you can actually turn into money something that will give you the financial and if independence that you are entitled to and that you deserve that's why we built profit with javascript the number one course on the internet that will give give you the ability to become an amazing freelance or fulltime developer take our students who actually landed jobs this guy just landed their job at cars.com as a frontend developer today this message literally was sent to us today we have bradfield from south africa who is now working as a fulltime developer big thanks to ray and nas and kazi i mean it speaks for itself we have ingrid who has been tutoring on weizen for several months and is making good cash and we have calvin who is now uh he is actually living in nigeria when he is now as uh an anal a technology analyst intern programmer for the summer of 2021 in dublin ireland guys this works that's it that's what i'm gonna say if you want to upgrade upgrade your skill set upgrade the community that is surrounds you and yeah that's it that's the end thank you so much for joining uh i hope i could give you guys as much value as possible by the way if you're interested in joining profitable javascript link down below in the description make sure to drop whatever you are interested in because as you can see we deliver on what you guys ask link down below in the description everything is linked down we got a free training down there so make sure to check everything out and with that said thank you so much for joining this is david from cleverprogrammer.com and i'll see you in the next video
