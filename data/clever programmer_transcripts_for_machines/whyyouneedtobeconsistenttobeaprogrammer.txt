hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi straight out of Sarkis hopefully it'll quiet down just a little bit but today I want to talk with you guys about one of the most important things you can do and if you add this thing in with what you guys are doing right now with whatever your goals are this is going to be that ingredient that gets you going gets you to achieve those goals no matter where you're at right now so without any further ado let's jump right into it the main thing I want to talk about today is consistency right now this is a topic that a lot of people don't find it sexy and you don't always want to talk about it because it's not your getrichquick or get something done in a very short amount of time kind of thing right it takes a second to to actually implement this in your life because you have to be consistent because a lot of the times what happens is let's say as programmers right as people who are trying to learn how to code whether it's Python PHP Java whatever it is trying you're trying to learn web development or even if some you're doing something out of programming what it takes is incremental effort to get better at it right a lot of the times what happens with me is sometimes when I want to learn something new I see one of my friends do it and they're really good at it right I'm like holy like this person is really good at it right then what happens to me is I want to get there immediately and if I don't get there immediately I will feel discouraged disappointed and I'll kind of identified entity myself with that but it's important to understand that you know that that person it took them a long time of consistent effort consistent small failures yeah yeah we can we can have that thank you so much you know it just takes a long time oh that looks delicious thank you how good does that look yeah so we're gonna eat in a second my good friend clucks you most of is recording this for me you guys should check out some of his photography on his Instagram well link it in the description below but let's not get sidetracked so you know we feel like we have to get there immediately and if we don't get there immediately like we get kind of upset about it right or do get disappointed and then what happens it kills your journey so let's say you want to learn how to play pool right like the snooker or pool and you see your friend play really well now you get smoked by and blown out of the water and you just get really frustrated what can you do to improve yourself well start by slowly you know working on your strokes start by slowly like working on potting a few balls right and enjoy that process make small goals and enjoy that process and be consistent with it same thing with computer programming let's say you're getting frustrated with it and it's hurting your brain and you're like I can't do this this is too difficult so what happens you stop enjoying the process and then after that every second of it feels like work and then that leads to you quitting so for you to be consistent you have to associate that with something that's fun right and then after that what you want to do is just make small consistent effort ok day in and day out Brett you know I can tell you sometimes it doesn't feel like fun sometimes it just feels like crap right you just won't feel good you'll be coding you'll be trying to UM you know like get through a specific problem work on a specific project or just get through a tutorial and it'll just feel like painful grind pulling your teeth but you gotta get through it okay so certain times what you want to do is just okay I want to spend one hour every day to work on this skill whether it's fun or not so you want to try to make it as fun as possible but if you can't make it fun you've gotta meet that one hour half hour criteria that you have set for yourself and then grind through it right here's what happens you'll take a W or you'll take up you know a really good win one day and you'll just have success and everything will be making sense you in programming it'll be smoking this project and working really well at on it right well there's a Python app you're developing or or whatever and then the next day you just feel like you're stuck in this problem can't get through it spend six hours and haven't improved at all and you just feel like Plateau right and you feel frustrated but even though that day you didn't make any further progress I can promise you you still got better okay so even when it times it doesn't feel like you're improving if you're putting time into working on a specific even if you're failing you are improving okay whatever it is you want to learn how to dive off of a swimming board you want to learn how to do keep ups in soccer you want to learn how to hit those threepointers it'll be that frustrating grind and even if you're feeling and missing them constantly constantly constantly you're still improving and that's the key thing okay so consistency try to mix it up with fun and that works really well it helps you get through obstacles but you have to set yourself up in a way where you don't give yourself excuses where you don't let yourself off the hook if you say you're gonna do it for half hour one hour you gotta do it you gotta push through it sometimes it won't feel like fun but if you keep doing consistently 1 it will become fun too and which is the most important one you will improve in it ok so there you have it consistency that's your one of your number one or one of their biggest secrets to getting successful and it's not really a secret but it's just something you have to brainwash yourself into thinking telling yourself and doing it all the time right whatever skill it is that you want to do consistently putting work into it so that's it for this video thank you guys so much for watching as always I love your face install now I'm gonna go back to eating some amazing omelette and I'll see you in the next video
