hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom so in this video which is if we're gonna be talking about your fastest roadmap to becoming a Python freelancer okay and if you got my email and hopefully nothing goes wrong hi Kishori roll was the first one yeah I'm sorry guys so today we started the live broadcast a little bit late as well but let me just say what we're gonna be covering so for those of you guys who joined early I don't want you to leave because I ramble on about something random so we're gonna be talking about your fastest roadmap to becoming a Python freelancer okay that's my goal for today and then we're also gonna be covering things like what happens to the job market after Jeff Bezos he recently bought out Whole Foods for 13.7 billion dollars and I think Jeff Bezos made like 20 billion dollars in five months that's the fastest anybody's ever made I think twenty billion dollars and he might actually catch up to Bill Gates and kind of you know go past him the other things that we're gonna be talking about is my threestep blueprint that I want to give you to go from become being complete beginner or maybe you're just starting out to becoming a Python freelancer whether you're currently doing a job maybe in some kind of administrative field or an IT field or you're a tech savvy person or you're just like interested in this job industry of software development alright okay and something else crazy is going on which is um apparently somebody's trying to steal my youtube channel which I wanted to show you guys but of course none of my computers are working my iMac died yesterday when it came for the live stream and now my laptop is acting up so I wanted to go out do the live stream for you guys from my laptop but I can't do that so here we are on my cell phone again which breaks my heart because it's just so annoying I don't know why that happens so yeah I won't be able to show you but yes I'm gonna try to tell you guys the name of the person who's trying to steal my channel and I kind of need your help because you know it takes a long time to build a channel you know it's like a lot of a lot of hard work like day in and day out like I work to build this channel up to where it is today probably like thousands of hours at this point you know I would go to college and then anytime I would come back I would go to work and then even though I was tired and exhausted I would come back and then I in that one hour or thirty minutes whatever I got free I would find time to make videos for this channel and for you guys and now somebody has literally taken all of my videos and has it on their YouTube channel and yeah and the CEO of repple it repl I T try to talk basically featured one of my videos one of my vlog or one of my like yeah one of my videos where I I'm doing an exercise and he thought he featured my channel but instead of my channel he ended up featuring the channel that stole all of my content so that person also got all the publicity for that post til later I got on a phone with the CEO of rebel dot it and then we talked for a while and then once he realized that that other you know guy was trying to like plagiarize all of my stuff he finally gave me credit okay so yeah I also want to give you guys the top three programming resources that I have used that have helped me become a software developer really fast start doing freelancing work gold from kind of scratch to doing real stuff so I want to kind of give you guys that they helped me learn the technical part you know and then the the soft skills part that actually helped me get the clients was mostly some of my mentors that worked really closely with me what you guys actually might know Nick I talked about him a lot also does anybody know if you guys are watching this right now does anybody know what happened to the live stream today because I had it set to remind everybody at 3 p.m. Pacific and that should be 5 p.m. Chicago time so I'm here at 5 p.m. Chicago time but I got some complaints of people saying that the Live cast show started earlier if that's true could you let me know because that doesn't make sense California Pacific time is 3 p.m. that's Chicago 5 p.m. time okay and then also I'm going to be taking your questions kind of live I'll take all your questions headon so whatever questions you have or bring them on and then I'll try to answer them for you guys okay so this channel I wanted to kind of talk about I want to bring down this channel I really don't like you know this channel because they're they're stealing all of my content and it's called Quinn's Katherine qu IND space CA th er I and II if somebody could write that in the comments that would be great and if any of you guys get a chance just go and like flag it for having my content and that will be really good okay so let's start off with my simple you know blueprint for becoming a Python developer okay there's a really simple blueprint for this and here's what it is at a high level and again I wanted to show you guys in screencasts but I can't do that because my laptop and my computer died so you kind of start off a good job for getting the book I showed you yesterday you're taking action that's good so you want to start off with you know you're just a beginner so you start off by learning okay this is a very high level learning then the next thing that you need to do is you want to go and then you want to get to the middle which is like build projects and half things to put on your portfolio and then the last part over here right the last part over here is actually getting clients and knowing how to get clients the tricky part that happens though at the surface level is very easy you start you build then you find clients ok start build find clients threestep process fairly simple process the the real complexity that lies in between for example when do you know you are ready to get a client when do you know you're ready to start freelancing when should you stop doing the coding so before we get into the complexities of that if you guys have a pen and paper you know start writing this down because it'll be there for you and I have already mentioned this multiple times so if you guys if you guys ever hear me say something multiple times don't freak out because not everybody gets to hear it so that's why sometimes I repeat myself you know so I want to I want to make sure that everybody gets to know this so make sure you write down some of the top resources that are available online for free first of all clever programmer an amazing resource for Python right which is my channel and I have over 160 free videos for you guys on YouTube I have a course for you guys if you're looking for Python great place to start Coursera is another place very academic stuff but yeah Coursera is really good so you guys want to write that down if you're looking for resources write down Udacity another good resource Udacity is my personal favorite if I like ever found myself stuck that's the first place I go to because they make their courses a lot of fun they're really interactive and the videos are short and they focus on getting you to do some of the stuff handson yeah so Udacity is a little bit more fun and again Udacity is also free so you don't have to like pay anything and after Udacity you have then they're not in any particular order you have EDX EDX so write that down in the comment so other people could see it but EDX is basically whoops let me just double check some stuff here so yeah EDX is basically another one that's really academic and rigorous I'm not a huge fan of EDX except so one that's really good the course is really good on EDX I believe is cs50 I think it's on EDX right yeah shouldn't you on EDX so there's a course called cs50 really good course except it's not in Python and you guys know me and I'm always talking about Python and the reason why I talk about it a lot so much is it's one of the easiest programming languages it's one of the most paid and it's one of the most popular right so that's why I mentioned Python a lot if you want to do Python cs50 is not going to be the course I would suggest to stick with Udacity and Coursera Coursera has introduced reactive programming in Python absolutely great course that's free of cost to you okay so with these courses you practice a lot right but what I want you guys to do is don't fall in the trap of gets really really high I should until you're slow python is slow Python Python makes you more productive that's what matters now it depends also what you're doing if you're making a game that is really really really dependent it says very bad connection for me can you guess confirm if it's indeed very bad connection I'm gonna try changing the connection here alright what I'm gonna try to do guys is I'm going to try to go from LTE mode to my to the WiFi here but in the office of WiFi is not so good so I'm going to give it a try for you guys okay okay now it should have connected to WiFi if the connection is better let me know and then we can continue from there okay so what I was saying was you have all these resources that make you really good but a lot of the problem that I see is that people get really stuck on doing exercises that are a lot of the times meaningless and don't actually go towards helping you build a relevant experience that your employers or people who are trying to hire you or looking for and the reason why I say that's a problem is because okay so me when I started coding as you guys might know I spent fifteen hours a day coding and learning which is why I was able to just learn it so so so so so fast except now that I look back one of the biggest problems I had with doing that you know even spending 15 hours and learning FS I could have learned it way faster one of the biggest problems I had is I got stuck in doing stuff that didn't put something on my portfolio it was a lot of theoretical stuff that I was doing there was a lot of academic stuff that I was learning from you know web sites like Coursera code Academy EDX Udacity all of those right team treehouse but there wasn't a lot of stuff that was teaching me you know even if they had me build a project that I could put on my portfolio they never really talked about where to go to start doing freelancing when to go to start doing freelancing or suffer you know because we'd have a fulltime position if that's your thing personally fulltime positions are not my thing not I'm not huge on nine to five o'clock and Dan and dayout I'm big on choices so I'm gonna have the choice and I want to choose to work not only when I want but also with who I want because if I'm working with people that I don't really respect or they don't really respect me then I want to have the option to not work with them is that true for you guys you know would you guys want to be in that situation where that's true for you is this going offline because I'm guests getting messages that this is going offline what's up with that okay beautiful so this is what you want to do right you want to make sure that you practice coding you build the skills but don't get so caught up in all the technical stuff it's really good but then it can lead you down a wormhole where when the deeper that you go the more like the less competitive in the job market that you become okay so hopefully that kind of answers the question of how to go from one point to the next point which is how to go from just learning to building projects and having something to show okay and then the next part for you would be to go from building that thing and then looking out for more clients now I wanted to segue into Jeff Bezos does anybody know what's going on with Jeff Bezos okay who knows what's going on with Jeff Bezos so he just bought Whole Foods right and what does that probably mean for the job market like what's gonna happen to all the employees that are usually working at Whole Foods I have a feeling that a lot of this stuff is gonna get automated call me crazy but I have a feeling you're welcome Zachary but I have a feeling that a lot of this stuff is gonna get automated and what happens when things get automated when things get automated you need a lot of people who can take care of the automation and the people who usually are doing the automation or your developers your programmers your data scientists your engineers and all of those people need to be able to do program so whether you're a reason for computer programming is you're looking to make a complete career switch from where you currently are but another important thing for you know choosing programming is that you'll have more opportunity and you'll also be able to get a promotion where you currently work and become more competitive at your current job there are a lot of people even on the YouTube channel one of the students said he got a promotion at his current job yeah it's um I'm so sorry about this guys this is crazy I'm probably gonna get just a whole another studio with badass WiFi or something like that because this is really frustrating that I'm trying to talk with you guys and you know it keeps cutting off because I sometimes lose my train of thought or you know I lose you some of you guys you guys drop out so I don't want that I don't want to give you a bad experience so yeah that's probably gonna happen very soon because this is crazy like my iMac stopped working then my computer stopped working and then my iPhone is the only thing that's working and then somebody apparently is stealing my youtubechannel wind Catherine qu ing CA th o e RI n e somebody who wants to write that in the chat please go ahead and do so and if you ever get a chance please go ahead and mark that as spam or mark that as copyright infringement because they're literally taking all of my videos all of my material okay so go ahead and do that now you guys also note that I am launching my course which is actually about to close tomorrow so there's one day left the course is called create apps with Python or Python olp create apps and essentially my whole point with this course and the reason why I made it is because of the same things that I had to deal with I went through doing crazy amount of coding crazy amount of like doing coding challenges problems going to academic route of learning have learned computer science and college at UIC I learned it from so many different professors have also taken courses on Linda and all these other platforms but the biggest problem I had was it was all academic it did help but it didn't help teach me how to get clients like for example I was charging almost twice the money that I was paying my personal mentor at the time because he was just not a good like he didn't know any soft skills for any business skills or anything that really made him somebody who could stand out from the crowd and he helped me in the room and one of the problems that happened was well first of all he just he would kind of stop right at the dot so if we had a onehour session with him he would literally stop right at that onehour session so this is something you guys can do with your clients as well okay with whether you get a client today tomorrow a few months or from years from now and whether it's in programming or anything else like you really have to take care of the people that are there with you and that are working for you the reason why I call people clients and not customers is is there's a difference between the definition right customer is somebody who buys something from you somebody who pays you for your services or your product whatever a client by definition is somebody who is under your protection so if you think like that you already start standing out from the crowd and when people work with you they don't want to work with anybody else because you really take care and watch out for them so that was one of the key things that I wanted to share with you guys and that was the key thing that made a difference for me in my freelancing life in my software consulting and I've seen that happen with lots of like good developers at all but the mentor that I had earlier that was one of his problems he would literally clock in right at the time that he was supposed to leave and he would do the least amount of work as possible and he would try to work with a lot a lot a lot of clients so for example he had I don't know like 40 people whereas some of the top people that I work with always had very few people that worked with but just took care of them a lot didn't get exhausted weren't frustrated by them and only chose to work with people that they found you know where there was mutual respect and those are some of the key things I will tell you whether you watch this video and leave right now you know shut it off close it down and then go on with your life this is something that will help you even if you are doing something in IT right now and you just continue doing that or if you're doing something in administration doesn't really matter this is kind of universally applicable yeah generator is yeah those are fun and Python you know you can you can do that and in my course that's you know some of the things that we cover and we build GUI applications which are graphical user interfaces because a lot of the times what problem that happens with students is that right now you may know how to code and you may not how to write like a random generator for words that can do yes or no but you guys a lot of the times don't know how you can take that code and I didn't know this as well and turn it into a real app something that people can click touch and move around right because the people who are using your applications they're not sitting in the command lines right trying to type some stuff what they are doing is they want to click buttons and move around and then do stuff right so for example when you go to a website or Instagram or Facebook wherever that's what you expect to do you're not sitting there in the codes what you're doing is you're literally clicking home you're clicking add a new friend blah blah blah right so that's exactly what you need to be able to do so you want to go from writing code because nobody really cares about just code but people do care about the results right that end results kind of what you have there at the end which is going to be an app or a project something like that Kazi i'ma Coalition has lost Python for my degree also to learn Java how does Python apply to Java different languages overlap Python doesn't really have like such a amazing overlap with Java Python can overlap with JavaScript you know HTML and CSS is not really a programming language but Python goes really well handinhand with HTML CSS Python goes hand in hand with sequel SQL Java mmm no like they don't really go handinhand but you know the concepts overlap because computer science daniel says i'm curious how much you make well even when I was like 20 21 I was making about $10,000 a month and a little over $100,000 a year that I was bringing in so yeah I've never relieved I've always just been crazy in terms of being able to figure out how to get work but more importantly how to bring value to the people that I work with you know I I really I'm crazy sometimes I'll lose business because of how insane I am and when I mean insane I just mean that if I think you're doing a wrong thing I'll tell you even if it hurts your and my relationship if I think you're gonna throw yourself down somewhere I'm not just gonna shut up and let you do it which is why a lot of the times are people that end up not working with me but then the people who do end up working with me we have a really good relationship you know obviously you have to be somewhat political and try to make sure that everybody is kind of okay and you're not just being extra aggressive for no reason but that's you know one of those things I'm 22 years old right now CG so yeah but yeah I just really care about the people that I work with and I really care about what I do and I'm not afraid to ask for the price that's right you know ask for what I deserve to be paid or ask for less than that because that's one of the problems that happens with a lot of people that I see is that you are better than you think you are like a lot of you guys right now probably getting underpaid I guarantee you like yeah somebody just asked me for a oneonone I pretty much don't do them anymore I'm almost gonna stop doing one on once because it's just it's um I was gonna say it's timeconsuming but that's not really what it is I'd rather spend time for everybody that's that clever programmer you know now we have over 30,000 students at clever programmer so I want to spend time for you know with everybody so with that said I'm gonna work less oneonone but I can almost guarantee that if i sat down with almost any of you guys right now oneonone I could help boost you by ten twenty thousand dollars a year like easy a lot of you guys I mean obviously there are some people who are like way better at this than I am so I'm not trying to like brag but a lot of the times what happens is people just leave money on the table and there are certain simple things that they don't know like in the United States we almost think it's a bad thing to negotiate when it's not negotiation is one of the most important things you should be doing here I'll give you a tip that will give you a return on investment of just watching this for 26 minutes never accept the first offer like when you guys apply for a job you'll get the first offer and then you'll just go oh my god it you know you're excited or whatever it is and you're thinking I'm not gonna get this again you go for it almost never do that just one of my friends recently got an offer for about $40,000 and I convinced him do not accept it he was excited out of his mind because he got to work as a developer and I said do not do that ask them for sixty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars more we're sorry sixtyfive thousand dollars was twenty five thousand dollars more and he did he wrote this long email ask them for twenty five thousand dollars more and guess what happened they said no but with a big butt like Nicki Minaj no I'm kidding this said we're gonna put you at sixty thousand dollars so think about that twenty minutes or 30 minutes of my transtime just got him twenty thirty thousand dollars extra what does that mean that almost made him money that was one year kind of ahead right now that money was literally how should I say it saved him one year right that would have that would take him two years to make that money yeah Nicki Minaj oh my god have you guys heard her new song something about fraud I yeah I couldn't even pay attention to the freaking song I just love her so a lot of the times that's what it is that's why a lot of people just focus on the technical aspect but and it's good but you do you do do kind of need to be doing this stuff and it's not hard I promise you guys and I teach you guys this in the course I will literally all I will also be adding new content to this course constantly like nonstop it's called Python Opie create apps if you guys are watching this video and you're curious click on the link below and just check it out but I will be adding more content to this and I will be showing you guys exactly even what to say to you know keep a client or if you're working with a client how can you increase that price with that have an ongoing relationship how can you go about firing a clients I know a lot of you guys can't see yourself right now in that position of having a client because you're kind of just starting out so that might not be something that's realistic Kanako awesome man that's great that you joined this course I'm excited to have you I know you guys can't see herself there yet but that's okay you know I've helped enough people do this that I know that it's just like a repeatable process you know success it's just something that you see somebody have it and you follow what they do so it for everybody depends you know for example for Mira meets a team Iraq cause Gary Vee grant cardone and I try to follow what they do and that helped me in my business it helped me get clients all that stuff this is these are the kind of skills and things that I show you in this course in the start we're gonna be working in the course on becoming a better programmer so I'm be teaching you principles helping you master Python okay Cassie how and where will we get real projects to make back the money so in the course outline how can you start making back the money and I also talked about when you are ready to start freelancing there's one important thing that happens that is yeah you can even go on up work and find clients you know and it's not you know you can go on up work and find clients right upward calm there's freelancer calm that's no secret but the problem that happens is how do you end up landing the client how do you know you're ready to start freelancing with them and more importantly how do you actually stand out from the crowd right at clever programmer I actually have multiple software developers that actually work for me have two software developers we have a marketing development representative we have virtual assistant we have a business consultant and all of these people I have hired and I literally and I have a video editor as well so I interview people all the time I go through meza maze all the time and these are you know there are a lot of questions that I ask in there that I think are important and when I go through their CV or their resume there are many things that are important and I've got good at identifying to know whether somebody's bullshitting or if somebody's right and has the right practical skills to actually be able to do the job and those are some of the things that I want to show you guys in this course because a lot of the times it doesn't take you that long to become successful like you just go with for the people who are there and then learn that process and so it saves you you know years of your time something that's supposed to take you years you can actually end up doing it in months Daniel in the course there's no reason for me to other languages because I don't want to just teach you multiple languages which is a lot of the thing a lot of the times what a lot of academia does and then you can't get a job because all you know is just a bunch of different languages so I don't want to just make you go here make you go there and then just have your head spinning for no reason and that's the problem with a lot of the courses they have a lot of content a lot of crazy content to make it into like 20 hours so then they can be like hey look you know you paid for this course and this is what you got so I'm not a big on giving you guys 300 hours of material I want to give you guys little material but that gets your results faster okay I want to make this clear that this is not you know something that you just sit there and watch and it just automatically happens you have to make active you can have to work and put in the work and follow the stuff that I have outlined for you guys ask questions on the group and yeah then the results are there for you okay so that part is kind of tricky right when you go from mastering programming and then to freelancing when do you know you're ready to go there and those are the things I teach ok so again I have my oh my god we lost so many people I'm sorry guys so I have my phone on this one thing worse when somebody joins the course it kind of goes it makes a call to me and tells me the name of the person who joined so then what happens is it ends up going offline the live stream goes off so I'm just sorry about that like that just sucks but it's pretty cool you know now I get I get to tell you guys that who joined let's see Essen nice welcome Essen good job I have it under not disturbed but when I get to calls it ends up doing the call Austin nice let's see who else we got we got John joint that is great all right let me see if I can find some of the reasons why some of these students joined and tell you guys I'm you know what I'm saying okay so essen joined because he says he would like to build a portfolio quickly to show potential clients and employers working useful apps yeah so this course teach you how to build your own apps from complete scratch graph with graphical user interfaces things that people can click and touch and play around with and this course will show you those things I'm also adding new material to this course which will cover some web development fundamentals meaning that when you guys build this stuff you can show it to everybody around you we're gonna be specifically we're gonna be covering some of the flask framework and Python and I'll show you guys how you can build an app with Python that anybody can use I'm gonna be using the same tools that people use to build YouTube and Instagram and Yelp okay actually Yelp I don't think they use Python but read it does okay so I'm gonna be showing you guys some of those tools and I'm gonna be adding new content to this course so anytime I add any more content to the course you guys have access to it free of charge I don't charge you a cent when I add new content the last time I made this course available and I closed it down March 23rd since then the price has tripled yeah so the price has tripled since the last time I launched it and if after I closed it down now the price will likely increase again because there's just so much more content that I keep adding to this course you know it's made from the heart I spent a lot of time a lot of blood and sweat making these courses again I saved this quite often but I'm not trying to do this like some old instructor that's teaching you on udemy behind a PowerPoint who is just making that course so he can pay his bill okay so what tools are needed for the course and are there any additional cost that's a very good question Cassie and there are no there's no additional material that you need and everything is free of cost so I show you how to install Python and that's pretty much all that you need and if you need to get something like sublime text that's also free of cost and I show you in the course exactly how to download it in all of that so that is not a problem pretty much there's no dependency like you don't need to have taken any course before this it's a complete fit for beginners if you're a complete beginner or you've been doing Python for a few months this course is for you if you've been doing programming for years I'm gonna be honest this course is not for you you're too advanced sublime text is not paid if you want to pay then you can but you can also use it for free yeah you're welcome Cassie again I'm big on getting results on big on actually becoming an effective developer that gets worth that gets client I'm not big on just teaching you techniques you know I can do that and I always wanted to do that but you know I want to do something for you guys that gets you real results and as fast as possible then I'm sure you guys will be down to learn all the nerdy because then once you're making money the nerdy stuff will actually make even more profitable which is that happen which is what happened to me when I learned about intra relational databases and I got better at them right now they're about I would say probably are almost ten hours of content and then I'm going to be adding more content to the course so it's gonna end up being more than ten even just this next week you guys are going to be getting lots of videos on flasks and we're going to try to build something with flasks so yeah you guys are going to have more than ten hours of content there okay BSS try or no sequel I don't know Pet pet I don't know what that means what do you mean BS but yeah I don't know why you want to try manga or no sequel like databases databases the database like unless you're doing something very specific or niche it makes sense or you're doing something that's very highperformance maybe make sense but not really relational databases are okay a lot of things are built on relational databases Oh simple programmer just hit a hundred k subs that is crazy yeah I wanted to catch up to him and beat him but I guess he is there ahead of me he is there ahead of me the main the main point for this course is to help you guys make that transition there's no course that shows you how to make that transition from your current job your current work to the world of programming a lot of them just tell you to quit if you try to join the programming bootcamp what happens you have to pay like fourteen thousand dollars up front and then you have to quit your job and just do that programming bootcamp for I don't know like three months six months and then hope that you get a job whereas with this it works within your schedule so if you're already doing a job and you have a family or whatever right even if you're single that's completely fine you have to still pay your bills so I don't want you to just let go what you're currently doing I want to make it so you can do it within your current job spend hours on this and work on this get practical knowledge practical realworld product have the knowledge to build realworld projects and then I want to help you make that transition so my main focus in this course is to help you earn an income while you're actually learning and mastering Python okay and then once you've mastered it and you can start freelancing with clients so that's my main goal so to make it easy for you guys to make that switch as fast as possible all right sweet we just had Jennifer join Jennifer welcome on board let's see why some of the other students join Michelle I have been interested Michelle says I have been interested in learning Python also my husband has been learning Python but I had a hard time getting to a point where he feels like he actually knows something I have been encouraging him to do projects and thought this sounded like the perfect opportunity if he could learn to do projects and make money so he can quit his ninetofive then that would be perfect thank you for making the program so that is Michelle's reason Thank You Michelle for joining this is it's very exciting to have you on yeah Congrats ji Taber for joining and Congrats eat a diaper for joining guys I'm sorry on what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to turn off this thing that gives me a call the forty seven dollars extra is for the mastermind group the slack channel where there are other students they're available and you have access to me as well it's pretty much free and here's why I know forty seven dollars quite a bit but here's the thing when you work with a developer you pay one hundred a hundred fifty dollars an hour and that's a lot of money right and it's not recorded and you can't do it exactly whenever you want you can only schedule them a lot of the times once in a week so with this the idea is that you have access to us in your back pocket so think of it as your emergency hotline one you could use it just to learn and collaborate and network with everybody too if you get a client and you're kind of getting screwed you don't know what to do or you can't help them you can't figure it out you can reach out to us in the slack Channel and the community there will try to help you out do your project and I'll try to help you out too this doesn't mean will literally do your project for you like will code it for you but it does mean that will give you support and push you in the right direction so you're not completely lost okay so yeah it's a it's a huge kind of thing you know if you're getting $50 or $100 or even $40 an hour from a client that you're working with then having somebody who can help you out and save you and get you to work with them even for an extra hour or two you get you get a profit you make your money back so there you go rusty you're welcome okay I'm gonna go turn this off because we're starting to get tons of new students to join which is great the course does end tomorrow at midnight so today there's only one day left you guys if you guys want to jump on it it's a jump on it fast you know I'm kind of calm today I didn't really have my monster do you guys feel that him like really just relaxed today oh we had another person join the course okay so let me go and turn that thing off one second guys Holland's breaking my heart because it wants me to like cut the whole thing I don't want to do that okay whatever I'm cutting it out that's it okay so I had programmed this thing where when somebody joins the course yeah quaint Catherine is the channel you know guys take that take that channel down because it's annoying you know they they stole all my material they stole all my YouTube content um okay so yeah John you can contact Kazi at clever programmer comm to get your money back yeah so yeah I stand behind my courses like insane more than pretty much anybody out there and my course has a 60day moneyback guarantee if you're not happy for any reason I always say this you don't like my jokes you don't like my face or it's just not getting you the results that you expected you have 60 days to return it you know every other course gives you 30 and I want to make sure that I stand behind it you know I believe in this and I want to let you try it out so you try for 40 days you don't like it you return it no questions asked some simple as that the email is qaz I act clever programmer calm this guy goes I love your jokes and face and all the India guys look the same it was awfully racist no I'm just kidding I'm not from India from Pakistan actually I was born there and then I moved here when I was younger who somebody just asked that oh did you do the punch this course is not so much about game development though you can use the principles to then do game development like we do make some basic stuff John again for the money back you can contact me or you can contact Rachel pretty much anybody and I have my email there for you guys at all the times I would say learn the basics learn and master a specific programming language and then go from there but there are a few good books on game development I can't think of them yet for some reason but if you're looking to start off on like just learning the technical parts of Python or you just want to kind of supplement it you know use this that would be really good and some of you guys are saying hey we sent out an email guys it takes us a little bit to get back to you because there are a lot of new students that are joining the program now so we promise we'll get back to all of you I see all of your emails as well but there's a lot of people that I'm trying to reply to on Facebook on YouTube there are a lot of emails I'm trying to reply to and then going through this whole launch and course closing it's a little bit hectic so please bear with me I'm not trying to ignore anybody you will get a reply back and I will try to get back in touch with you as fast as possible okay so don't worry all your emails are coming to the right places we're getting your emails and we are going through all of them systematically but our main priority is anybody who is new and joins we want to make sure that they get the course they get situated and if they get the mastermind group then they're actually enrolled in the mastermind group and so that ends up taking more of the time but we'll get around to everybody okay yeah and thank you Rachel okay guys yeah so if you guys have any questions and stuff now would be a good point I want to take on your questions I want to share the course structure but I'm stuck on my phone because my laptop is not working and my iMac is not working so this is what I have my phone and then my internet dies so kind of a sad thing ooh nice so we got few more students who join this is amazing and yeah so while you guys ask questions I'll also read you guys off why some of these people are joining and maybe some of you some of these guys resonate with where you guys are now and I'll also tell you these people should be in the course so let's see okay kanya konyaku joined and Tania Co said to develop another career besides my degree and improve my job prospect so Kanako is actually in I think on the live chat as well hi can yakko and that's a great point basically being able to develop an alternative career so you can also have a backup so huge deal congratulations I'm very excited to have you on board and I hope you love this course it's just the best course like that's what it is it's pretty simple alrighty let's see let's see oh this is very specific goodness um okay I'm gonna try to go through this and give you guys the gist of what this person is saying because it's pretty long so I'm gonna do that and I'll show you guys my laptop so then you guys can see that I'm actually doing something and I'm busy look at that so yeah this laptop is apparently you need OBS to broadcast on YouTube and I didn't have it on his lap this laptop so didn't want to take the time to spend before going alright hidaya thank you for joining the course welcome onboard super excited to have you this is great you guys we have a lot of students in the slide channels we're going crazy because they're just joining it and there's a lot of buzz and excitement and this course you know it's take it on your own pace this course is lifetime access anytime anything new that it's yours there's no you know there's no really like you're gonna miss anything if you have work or whatever yeah and yeah somebody said learning is by trying and trying and trying I do agree with you because that's what I did to learn as well but I do also know that there are faster ways to learn just like I got to or reaching over a hundred thousand dollars a year and my income as a 21 year old right that's a lot faster than some of the people who reach it at a later age so there are always ways to like get to your goals faster and that's what I'm about so that's what this course is also about and I think you're gonna find it helpful I want to package things and get your results faster you can always look up other stuff and then put the pieces together but in my personal experience it just takes a little bit longer so that's really the point of this course alright reading this okay let's see just this weekend I came across your YouTube channel and have loved all your videos you really know how to hit the spot huh nice you're so right that all these online courses like code Academy udemy et Cie just teach you the technical and I always find myself unmotivated or stuck that's a good point I tried Python the first time this weekend and enjoyed it okay that's great to know so Nicholas just tried Python and he's trying to kind of quit his corporate job in Dubai and he's trying to join a nineweek boot camp in Copenhagen called label hone I don't know I'd actually say it so I probably butchered the hell out of it now this this is yet so this course now one of the things that he says he's unmotivated and stuck and I find that happened to a lot of people and I found that happen to a lot of my friends as well they got unmotivated and then they kind of quit and that happens all the time and I want to make sure that doesn't happen to you that's why I try to make all my courses with just a lot of love interactivity and fun you know when you look at my course you'll see what the hell I'm talking about when you look at this you're gonna be hardpressed to find something that is you know made with more love just the truth Udacity is a competition but I think that we can probably beat Udacity at this point and then another thing he says that he wants to quit his job and again that's really what I'm all about you know making that switch I was talking to you guys earlier about you know some people are trying to join the boot camp and then they are giving up everything that they're currently doing and it's such a huge investment this does it in a quicker way for example and it does it in a smoother way so you don't have to just completely go berserk and quit your job because I also try I also actually was part of a boot camp that's called thankful I have done everything so okay so to learn more about this and you want to check out this course click the link in the description it should be there it's called Python olp create apps so the link should be something like clever programmer dot two slash create apps with Python guys some people are having trouble finding the link so could you please do me a favor and copy and paste the link in the chat don't oh yeah I don't think it'll allow you to actually paste the link nevermind because I think YouTube thinks it's spam so just go in the description and then try to click on it and check it out and learn more about it for those of you who guys are wondering why should i I'm really interested in this course why should I join it today or tomorrow for two reasons one because then Ruhlman is closed tomorrow and then i don't know when i'm gonna launch it again probably a few months after at least two or three months and then the second reason is that when I launch it the next time it's going to be I can almost guarantee that it's going to be more expensive than it is this time because when I launched it last time in March 23rd you know since then the price has now tripled so because there is so much so much more content that is always added and that you know it's made there are so many new things that are added to it that's why it increases in price okay so I'm gonna read this all right so Nicholas says I I'm super excited to start your course as I would very much like to transition to a freelance work style to free up time for family friends and travel perfect being able to join pretty much at any you know any point shashi you keep asking me what's the structure of the course if you click the link to the course page that has all the details for you so if you click the link it's not like it's just gonna buy the course automatically it's gonna take you to the course page with all the details so you go in there and then it talks about it and if you still have questions I got you no worries no worries don't don't apologize it's okay if you still have questions I'll be here to answer you but the course you know covers things like when are you ready to start freelancing what are the three things that are stopping you from becoming a software developer how can you start making that transition even if you still have a job and then there's other technical stuff right like how to do objectoriented programming how do you make graphical user interfaces and Python how do you make applications that are visual how do you take code that garbage I mean I love code I don't wanna call it garbage that's disrespectful and so how do you take something that's just code and written text and turn it and turn it into an application that people use okay so I also show you that so yeah there are a lot of details on the page and that goes over it all right coding really is the most important skill to know nowadays I'm currently in sales and marketing Wow then realize most of our partners are not able to blah blah blah from that point on I knew coding was everything oh wow so basically what happened was he was doing okay so check this out I'm currently sales and marketing for a fivestar hotel here in Dubai and just when I joined we had launched a super duper stupid laptop I swear amazing offer and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars marketing sending distributing and then realized most of our partners are not able to load this offer as it was not compatible with their systems mall lol so I Ricardo so what is he saying he's saying that there was this deal that was supposed to happen it was supposed to be hundreds of thousands of dollars and then what happened their systems didn't work they were incapable of making this happen why did this happen because the people who are working to make this happen lack the right coding skills yeah they only have money no brains and no good developers so somebody who can do a deal of hundreds of thousands of dollars do you really think they would have trouble like one of their deals is that expensive do you think they would have trouble paying you 50 60 70 thousand eighty thousand dollars a year right they would not when that's just one of their deals so that's a huge huge thing to kind of hear about and again you know with Jeff Bezos taking over Whole Foods scan and goes taking over Walmart it's things are headed in the direction of the software development field Loren James asks about payment options payment options are not available with paypal but I think you can do PayPal credit it has one of those like built in you can do payment option otherwise so I have a three month payment plan for you guys and then also have onetime payment or you can pay with PayPal so I try to make it simpler for you guys oh wow good catch so apparently somebody said YouTube doesn't think it's a hyperlink oh wow this is really really good to know thank you let me go check this and see what's going on hmm interesting interesting huh apparently my computer says that I'm not even streaming I swear everything is just like broken I have no idea why it's making me so sad guys I'm trying to figure it out it's just giving me anxiety over here this life stuff is crazy okay I have no idea how to fix that cuz it's just not working crypto says since I can't afford your one on one is it worth getting computer science theater I always think it's worth getting somebody to do oneonones with you always it just helps make it it just helps make it happen so much faster whatever it is so for example I've been you know I was doing coding I've always had mentors now they have just gotten from beginners to like really professional level right so meaning they weren't beginners but they had just built ok stuff now at work with like top of the line programmers and some of these guys are charging 150 to $200 to $250 an hour so these get a little bit more expensive but if you're starting out you don't need those guys there are a lot of people who will still help you for $20 an hour $30 an hour when I was switching from what I was doing earlier I would make all the money on my job and then use that money to pay for mentors and then basically what I did is I traded the skill that I had in my previous job for getting a new skill of Python and programming this is hilarious Zachary I think he's one of the students who's joined the course earlier and he says Thank You Kazi and sport spired me to learn Python and now I'm addicted haha and then he says I'm just so broke I can't afford schooling I'm just learning on YouTube as if no and then he says I tried sitting in on some classes at the University but they caught and and caught on and told me to get out I mainly sit at the library on campus and try to find likeminded people so really good way to go if you don't want to get a mentor you don't want to spend that money font work to find oneonone people that was one of the things that has helped me as well i joined a meetup comm group and i would go there all the time and then i found one of the best mentors and his name is nick and he didn't charge me a cent and he helped me because he saw my passion I was doing 15 hours a day and I'm going nuts doing computer programming literally had bags under my eyes but then you know he would help me and he was my mentor he showed me the way he showed me how much to charge I would ask him you know where should I go to apply so I can get more work mmm how should I keep that relationship going with my clients you know so those things super helpful he says crypto says I want to be a computer engineer would you say it's worth learning a lot of Python no because programming I want to specced emphasize this that it's not about learning a specific programming language and being really good at it it's learning the concepts and being really good at them and then you can switch to another language for example I can pick up a new language like go or something I haven't tried much Ruby in probably two days and be okay at it and then obviously become better at it the more I practice it so once you have some expunge you understand how programming works and you understands the concepts then it's much much much easier to become better at picking up new things so focus on learning the concepts okay guys yes try make mistakes learn from them and grow those are some of the best ways for you to improve your skills okay those are tried and tested in my course Python olp create apps my whole point is to make that a shorter path for you to get you to make that transition to get you to that new career new job get more work you know have the ability to build projects do realworld things now this is the book again hi Sachi welcome to the corsage I just joined the course nice to have you in here let's see did I get an email from you yep saw she's not lying Sachi just joined love to have you in here who a Knick joint nice okay guys we're getting a lot of students to join which is great that is super exciting here's what I'm gonna do everybody who joins the next 15 students to join I'm gonna send you guys this Python programming book okay I'm gonna send you guys this and I'm gonna make this only available for you guys in the next 15 minutes okay so right now it's 610 p.m. in Chicago that's 410 p.m. Pacific time and so if you guys join by 425 ish or Pacific or 625 ish Chicago time I will send you guys this book Python programming by John Zell okay and then all you have to do is join within that time and send me a little message this is a great book I'll show you guys some of this stuff this is really good stuff so for example in this book you know he'll show you some stuff like how are you how can you make an application there's just no color on this this one is not gonna have my signature the signature offer I gave last time and that just takes a lot of that takes a lot of time and effort so signature offer is not gonna happen today but I will send you guys this book and you guys will have this book ok this is a really good book table of contents let's see very it gets rave technical but it's really helpful Sachi I'll still get you that book don't worry just send me send us an email okay and then what we do is we just match up the times and it's like magic okay so the chap chapter 1 computers and programs that's what this book goes over writing simple programs chapter 2 computing with numbers chapter 3 objects in graphics chapter 4 man so there's a ton of stuff where it gets more interesting honestly is to say decision structures and loop structures and boolean SCI kind of like that part as well and then let me see what else I like in this book I've gone through this book so I can tell you what I like um data collections yeah you don't really need to know that objectoriented design is good so if you're especially if you're taking it with my course it'll be really nice Ricardo if you join the course within these 15 minutes then you get this book for free simulation and design of this book also is a really good chapter I don't know if you guys can read that yep and then algorithm design and recursion is not super exciting yeah you guys probably can get this book it's a very popular book it's online on github as well I personally like to have a copy with me because I can travel make marks in it and then you know if I am driving it's still there with me if I'm at a hospital waiting for a doctor or some kind of appointment I can have the book with me if I don't have WiFi I can have the book with me and more most importantly the way that I could flip to the right pages and do it you know really cool so anybody who is joining within this time please send me an email we'll get you the book okay and here's what I'm gonna do for you this is my gift for you okay so if you are on this webinar and you guys have already taken the course please send me an email and then we will also send you the book okay but I will also make sure that you have been on this livestream so please do that leave a comment on this video or share it and that way it's easier to find out that you've already had this course okay so we'll try to send you a book but most importantly is for people who are gonna get this course right now so there are 10 minutes left okay yeah Cody there you go because you know you're here man you're watching this so I want to give you guys something for for being here I want I always try to give value to you guys whether you guys join my course or not or whatever it is that you you know whether you just stick to your current field I want to tell you guys stuff that you can actually directly apply so that's why I tell you guys resources like Oprah comm freelancer comm you guys can actually use them for even different types of fields and it makes your life easier I tell you guys the best free resources like Coursera Udacity EDX Co Academy team treehouse so you guys have that you guys don't join my course you guys still have all of the stuff that you need my whole my big thing holy crap there's a lot of students that are joining so yeah there's actually a lot of students that are joining so I'll read off read off some of you guys names so Russell just joined welcome Russell let's see Naza are just joined or another give org just joined welcome Greyson Taber just join welcome nice to have you rusty says that's me yep that's you nice Nam are just joined welcome on board and Lauren just joined cool that happened very quickly the course details are in the link and short the course is about mastering Python by building realworld stuff so you can you can get handson work right we're gonna be doing stuff that's pretty handson and fun and interactive to follow I'm not hiding behind a PowerPoint I'm right there with you guys building this together and then more importantly I am also teaching you guys stuff that you can start putting on your portfolio or giving you ideas of projects that you can start to build on your portfolio okay that's what I'm about I'm not into passive learning I'm not into me teaching you the entire time I'm into teaching new stuff that you need to do okay so I'm gonna give you the basics and then you get it done and then you have results to show for it I hate go because I've personally hated having to go through lots of courses where I at the end didn't have anything to show for it okay so I don't want to do that for to you guys where you guys are going through you know all my all my courses and then you guys won't have anything to show for it at the end I don't want to do that for you guys that's why even my course called learn Python by building projects which is a freak which is on YouTube it's called learn Python you guys are building projects in there the whole time like 150 videos that I have they're also focused on helping you learn while building stuff so yeah so I wanna have you show something for it and then I want to help you get clients so what do you do between mastering Python and getting freelancing work there's a step in the middle that's missing that's what I show you in the course to make that jump to become a freelancer and to know you're ready to be a freelancer how can you start earning an income before you can start freelancing okay this is a very realistic way of looking at it because most people are just like why don't you just quit your job put your family and your money at risk put your bills in risk and just take this six months long programming bootcamp for $14,000 I mean it's kind of insane so I understand that for most people and what I want to do for you is help you make that transition even if you're at your current job and even if you don't have all the time in the world to take the course right so getting you the results in a faster way be COO if you send me an email with your address we'll ship you the book don't worry about it so it's very simple send an email to kasi at clover programmer calm and you know just say that you are you just joined the LP course we'll crossreference if you have or not and then we'll send you the book okay very simple all right yeah just title just subject the thing like free book or books so then it's easier to kind of comb through that but I want to send you guys that okay yep I want to send you guys this kind of copy so I don't know if this is called soft coffee but this is what I want to send you okay all right so we're getting lots of students this is great let's see guys we got about how much how much time do we have seven more minutes right am i doing my math right five is twenty three plus two seven there are seven minutes left guys so whoever is joining within these seven minutes will get this book for free okay Python programming and it's a five star book this is a really good book so it will be yours yeah can Janka if you want to send your address for the book yeah send the address and then we'll send you the book yep you're welcome all right so few more students joining let's see new student must Marat welcome on board glad to have you here I'm gonna try reading some of your guys's reasons for joining the course okay my mayor just joined literally this person's name is mayor that's cool Jennifer says I joined this course because I want to get into programming and be able to create apps this course teaches you how to create apps with Python from scratch Glee apps that are gonna be on your computer and then later we're gonna do some web apps in this course as well where I'm gonna add for you guys so you can then share that more easily with your friends and family because a lot of the times you have this code but how do you actually make a graphical application link is in the description guys link is in the description if somebody's asking for the link could you guys please just send it in chat if you guys know it which is clever programmer to slash create apps with Python alright Jennifer says I wanted to learn Python and you have convinced me in joining clever programming welcome on board you are a clever programmer now I hope that you can help me become a programmer I hope so yeah guys look at the risk I'm willing to take right so if you guys join this course since there's a 60day moneyback guarantee you also get this book and if for any reason you're not happy with the course once you return the course you get a full refund and you get to keep the book so this is called the lose win right I lose but you guys win and that's what I want to provide for you guys because that's I'm confident I am behind this course because most courses teach you how well most courses take money from you I want to also help put money back into your pocket okay yeah guys I'm not look like one person's money is not gonna like make the difference he for me you know I'm not gonna be like oh my god my main goal is to help you become a programmer make an impact like my personal goal is to have a hundred thousand people become professional programmers so that's really one of my biggest goals and I want to do that as fast as possible by making the best courses as possible cut the noise out for you guys you know that's kind of what drives me every day and that's what I want to do so if you guys at any point are unhappy with the course you guys are you know again you don't like me for any reason you get the full refund okay I want to give you the benefit of the doubt so you get that and you get to keep this book so there are three minutes left if you get this course now you get the Python programming book which is you know one of the best books for a Python programming I'm a huge fan of it make sure to send me an email that says something about the book and that will be your book ok great we got Ronald on board welcome Ronald that is exciting Sachi joined the course one the book great you'll get the book no worries Ricardo Ricardo I got your email but could you please tell me could you please tell me Ricardo if you have got the course if you have already joined the course then yes we will give you the book Ronald just joined welcome Ronald super excited to have you Nora Mohammed you're on my snapchat I love her she's like my girlfriend across the entire universe there you go she has announced it live um let's see ok let's see who else is joining ok guys so we are getting some new students great let's see more why everybody is joining sure thing if you guys have any questions right now is the time to ask them and we will help you oh it's so nice one of the person in the chat was being a and it was so easy I just got to like click and then just block it's like a twostep process YouTube makes it very easy I love that so yeah just relax in the chat you know enjoy yourself and let everybody else enjoy and don't be mean or troll people because guys we're all here to learn ok and improve our skills and become marketable right so that's the whole point a pet pet no you won't be met um me yes I still managed to find time for sleep that's actually one of the biggest things that I've been focusing on not just going crazy but actually finding time to do other stuff like for example now I'm focusing on going to the gym or I'm focusing more on doing jiujitsu focusing more on sleeping on time and not doing 20hour days where I have bags under my eyes I'm just so scrawny you know that's not good and you guys shouldn't do that as well you know manage your time a little bit better I promise a lot of you guys have more hours in the day than you think the key the ultimate key to making your goals happen get a legal pad write down your goals and make them happen so for example I wrote down about 50 goals and I failed 49 of them and I succeeded in one and that one goal was actually clever programmer so you know it goes to tell you and now look this channel is a movement because if you guys right there are over at 50,000 subscribers going to hit hundred K and that is freaking amazing right so yeah write down your goals because a lot of the times will find yourself actually completing them so I had the goals of lifting becoming more fit eating better all of that and when I can see them in front of me it just meant turns me into a better person and here I'll tell you one thing they'll help you incredibly if you follow it I know it's like one of those old people things but trust me works really freaking well sleep around 10 p.m. and wake up around 430 a.m. or 500 a.m. like that alone will just change your life okay and when you sleep follow a REM cycle so REM cycles work in one and a half hours so one and a half hour or three hours four and a half hours and six hours so your quality of sleep matters more than your quantity so instead of sleeping for five hours four and a half hours will actually be better for you okay so try to do that sleep early wake up early and it will make a huge difference for you you'll find like how you got all this extra time that you didn't even have I'm personally a night owl and oh sorry I forgot to announce guys sorry before I keep going I forgot to announce that the time actually has passed but since I didn't announce it I'm gonna actually say if you joined in the next minute I'll still give you that book ok so literally I'm putting a timer on it right now so I don't forget ok I'm not I just didn't announce it so I feel bad for anybody who missed it ok so let's see 50 more seconds right now alright I'm gonna take on some of your guys's questions in the meantime so if anybody joins the program in this time join us Python I hope you create apps smoke is yours my friend okay so be cou says is there any way to sod the way to get the book is if you join the course within the next 50 seconds so do that is there an easy way to become better at syntax I have a video online that's called top 4 tips for computer programming beginners that will help you check it out all right guys we have another student we got Kevin in the game Kevin is in the house welcome Kevin super excited to have you my friend Kevin also joined the group okay great so some students are joining the group and their reason is that even if they can connect with just one likeminded other student they can then work together to build a portfolio or they can work together to look for jobs or at least do emergency hotline kind of thing where if you have a client and you can't help that we can't figure it out you can go to the mastermind group or are the private slack Channel you can ask for help so you can ask me for help or you can ask other students for help I'm not always in that group but if you post a question in that group or you're talking that I do come by and watch it a lot of the times and if nobody can answer you then I'm there to answer you okay all right guys awesome the time is up for the book I try to extend it for you guys but that's it anybody who joins after 629 p.m. or you know 629 p.m. Chicago time there's no book so no book okay guys awesome this is already really long it's almost been two or three hours tomorrow I'm gonna go live one more time guys my course Python olp create apps helping you create apps from scratch build projects and press the clients and teaching you how to get clients most importantly this course shows you how you can start earning an income while learning and mastering programming in Python okay there's two paths you can take one is a very academic theoretical and you can become good at that that's one path to learn programming the other path is you can take which is projectbased and you build stuff the first path is theoretical academic and leads to you earning exactly zero dollars the second path where you build projects have a portfolio that gets converted faster for you actually getting work that's exactly the reason why people graduate from college and for some reason they can't find work right and the problem is that they didn't have the applicable realworld skills to actually do a job they mostly had the skills of
