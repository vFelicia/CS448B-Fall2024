i really didn't want to have to do this and i really did not want to sit here and make this video didn't want to make a [ __ ] video at all but there are just certain things i have to tell you to your face otherwise you're not gonna hear me it's just so frustrating seeing this again and again happening to so many of you and it's heartbreaking but it's also frustrating i see this all the time even when i'm interviewing people right they come in and we interviewed them and they got great projects great portfolios we interviewed them we'll ask them for a simple problem hey write a recursive fibonacci sequence hey do this one thing right hey here's an api just fetch data and plop it up on the screen what i don't i can't work in pressure this is too much pressure oh what the [ __ ] are you talking about this is your job you do this right you practice coding so what what's the pressure about i don't understand it's like if you were to hire somebody who's who you if you were a basketball team manager and you wanted somebody i'm watching the last dance which is an epic um documentary with uh um what's gonna say jordan peterson with michael jordan and if you are manager like jerry krause right it was kind of who was like a shitty manager but whatever like you still have to bring somebody in and see if they can shoot a basketball or not right because if they can't shoot what are they going to do on your team it's useless so as somebody who's a recruiter and you're about to hire somebody you have to see their coding skills right so if you can't code you always have to be coding right you always have to be in front of somebody even at a company you're coding somewhere and you're writing code that's going to face customers so there's always going to be pressure it's going to never be not pressure so you should be good at it you should be able to fetch an api you should be able to problem solve get used to that [ __ ] pressure like i don't understand why so many developers speak like it's a whole me too movement going on like nobody's asking you to do something weird we're literally saying hey do your job here's the keyboard do what you're best at and we're going to give you the room but like go freak out [ __ ] break down but you know why it really is it's not because most developers have this problem or their bubble it's because they don't have the [ __ ] skill you don't have to [ __ ] skill so when you don't have it you know what you do you go i'm going to blame it on something else and that something else is ah you're putting too much pressure on your you're watching me you you know i'm coding you're thinking about me coding uh even if you're out of the room i can just hear your thoughts and that's why i can't [ __ ] code this no it's because you suck or because you got trained from somewhere and that place [ __ ] sucked and they didn't teach you the skills that you needed to learn and now you're in this space you're in the spot where you got the job interview but you're never gonna get the [ __ ] job or you're definitely not going to get the job of your dreams right if you want to make 80 000 100 000 or more you're never going to get that job if you don't have the actual skills for you you'll get something less than that most developers are 50 60 they're like yeah i got a job as a developer that's great that's fantastic but is it really the job of your dreams is this something that you truly deeply love and if it is fantastic can't okay you found your happiness but for the rest of you who want to do more and who want to get better and if you don't have a job and you want to get a high paying job you have to get your skills down and you have to be able to withstand the pressure that comes with it but withstanding the pressure right confidence comes from competence so if you're competence is [ __ ] well your confidence it's not going to be that much far from that so you have to get better at your competence that's the best way because otherwise i'd be telling you to do some [ __ ] some fake [ __ ] and that's not gonna help you so you have to go and work okay when i say work i mean work now watch my [ __ ] video now watch other content creators youtube videos that's not work now follow along on some tutorial although that could help you right those were helpful that's why we make so many clones and build projects so you can watch them but even that's not gonna help you you need to sit down by yourself in a very boring room and have code and code things from scratch and write code from [ __ ] scratch and do that today because you're looking for the next dopamine hit what can i click on youtube that's going to catch my attention oh it's this video watch then after there's going to be another [ __ ] video then after this is going to be some other [ __ ] but you're not gonna get closer to your goal what i want you to do is get off this [ __ ] video and get off this platform and go and code and problem solve and then come back and share with me what you problem solved and like share your code or share a link to your you know you could code on replica whatever i don't care but i will care when you post it i want to take a look at it and see what you did that would be fantastic but i need you to improve your ability okay because if you don't nobody's going to come to save you no project is going to come to save you next.js and graphql and redux no hot new technology is going to save you if your fundamentals are weak if your fundamentals are weak it's like a foundation of a building is weak okay you can't build a skyscraper or a flimsy foundation right now i stole that from him so it's really that simple go work on your coding skills please okay you you depend on it your family depends on it okay because every day you're away from that job you're away from your dream job or you're away from your dream income you're costing yourself that amount like if that dream job is going to make you 100 grand and currently are 40 grand it's costing you 60 000 dollars a year to not be able to have these skills down costing you and it's costing your family so please spend time go code every day problem solving websites are free go to lead code go to hacker rank sign up i don't care go to [ __ ] algo experts who is that dude clement right he makes youtube videos and he talks about interviews and stuff like that and he's selling his algo expert go go on i don't care where you go but learn to fire code dot io is another one learn to actually code and improve your skill okay every day solve 10 or 20 problems start with the easiest problems in the world should be like hey print hello start with that okay but i need you to be able to code i don't care what your projects are like what can you do from scratch if i ask you hey get me this now get me the api now add pagination to the page now add something else to this page add a button add a add a new page that i can go to without refreshing okay cool can you do those things can you figure it out as we build it as we problem solve because i'm not as a ceo of a company i'm not allowing you to be anywhere near my [ __ ] if you don't have good coding skills and problem solving skills because you're going to come and [ __ ] something up i'm not going to pay you money to [ __ ] something up because your mistake is going to cost me way way way way way more than any new hot technology you learn and bring to me so what can you do what will help you need to sit down and code you need to smash the like button that's for [ __ ] sure that's gonna just explode your ability you're probably gonna become a coder right after this video okay but please sit down work okay weekends spend eight hours a [ __ ] day every day on the weekends sit with your wife sit with your kids in your lap and code it's not stopping you right be playing hey johnny ha johnny go get this ball [ __ ] code up code and like work on a problem be thinking about a problem you can be playing you can be walking you can be talking and still be problem solving and thinking thinking is the actual ability it's not [ __ ] sitting here typing you need to learn how to think thinking can happen at all the time you can be thinking while you're in the shower give yourself a problem solved then you're in the shower and you can be thinking you can be going on a drive to pick up groceries in your thinking you can be going to your work as a truck driver you're [ __ ] driving the truck bam bam bam you can be thinking for 14 hours a day and as you're thinking your ability to be a software engineer be a software developer is improving so i need you to code my friend and i need you to [ __ ] right below this video leave a comment saying i'm gonna code for eight hours and give me a date when you're gonna do that i'm gonna code for eight hours today march 19th boom or i'm to code tomorrow on saturday march 20th for 18 hours or 10 hours or whatever give me your commitment put it verbally and then if you code i would love to see what you did made too like put a link in the chat drop a replit replit if you code there you can just take a link and drop it it shows us your code and what problems you worked on too so we can give you that accountability okay but i want to see you code i want to see you improve your skill because it matters for you and it matters for your family nothing else matters everything else is easy guys putting a cool project is as simple as like following somebody's tutorial and coding it up brainless that [ __ ] doesn't help you at all okay it's going to get you interviews but it's not going to get you the job you need to improve your skill of problem solving so let's start there okay i love oh [ __ ] i learned this from aaron or what i love your beautiful face this is your boy kazzy and as always i'll see you in the next video
