gonna put that plug right over here and go and follow both of us on our Instagram channels oh wow what's going on over here got a little cave situation see guys look at how much of a difference just the lighting makes okay so look what happens when I'm like this right it's pretty dark and then as soon as I turn around here boom you can also come out it what other good times are there to come out and like get head shots it is just a natural sunlight okay so guys it really could be that simple you don't need to spend ton of money and getting amazing lighting or whatever and again this is how is this helpful for you you want to become a programmer you want to get internship positions maybe you'll want to get independent contractor positions maybe you want to get hires a coach who can teach programming people a lot of times the first impression of you is from your picture and pictures are of like the utmost importance right that's the first impression and if you come off friendly it's like you know you have a nice friendly smile in that picture people naturally want to give you a chance and if you have somewhat of a good profile boom you have an extra double extra chance right for recruiters to speak with you or whatever so take a good photo take a good headshot and it could be as simple as you know go out between 6 to 10 a.m. and again that is a substitute for spending you know saving yourself hundreds or thousands of dollars that you would spend on amazing lighting or a professional photographer go out at that time there's gonna be less people go ahead nearby a park anywhere where there's good sunlight and have somebody to take your picture or take a picture of yourself probably have somebody take your picture right go with a friend go with your family member whatever and then that picture of that headshot boom LinkedIn put on your Facebook put it on your github and you have a much better photo so super super easy and then after this we're actually going
