hi there my beautiful people how are you doing today I'm gonna wait for a few people to jump on because we are live but today I just kind of want to share I'm feeling inspired I am currently coming to you live from Boise Idaho I'm here for the convertkit conference and it's a bunch of online marketers and we get together in one place but it's more than that it's business owners and hi zakir Talib and I fury nice to see you guys here and it is honestly just inspired me to jump on and speak to you guys because over the last few months I'm not producing a lot of content on YouTube I'm creating content for the course the profitable programmer but it takes up all of the time and so there hasn't been a lot of YouTube content and every time I think about creating content or coming out and speaking to you guys I'm like no it has to be like perfect and I can't just go up there and speak to them they won't find what I say interesting or they won't find value in it and a lot of these thoughts jump into my head and they freeze me from taking action hence it's been months and I haven't spoken with any of you however today I was feeling inspired and I was like screw that and I'm just gonna come on jump on and speak with you guys and kind of share with you we're clever programmer is headed and a vision and I really need your help as well and that's awesome junior bahai he says you made me fall in love with Python and you know what I'm realizing is maybe that's just it maybe that's just my mission if I can just have people fall in love with coding and that's enough but the ultimate vision were what I'm thinking about and please if you're on this channel you know offer me your suggestions or put it in the comment I want us to come up with a vision together and if you can help me in any way that'd be fantastic I really need your feedback on this because it's kind of been tearing me up and I've been thinking about it right for example last month I got sick I got bronchitis and for the whole month because I was sick I couldn't produce any new content and pretty much everything came to a screeching halt now that's a scary thing when you think about it because for me clever programmer wasn't ever about me the reason why I started clever programmer was because I genuinely think the whole world should know how to code and coding should actually be part of every school system yes I know Cory Shafer he's awesome guy coding should be part of like every school system and it should be one of the core subjects taught right next to math taught right next to history that has been the vision but what I've come to realize was when I got sick and my immortality was questioned I mean I wasn't gonna die not even close to it so I'm being a little dramatic but it made me think about my own mortality and kind of you know me being the biggest bottleneck and I'm like I can't do this alone I need help and clever programmers a team needs to grow a lot bigger we have some people on the team but we don't have a lot of developers on the team and what would be incredible is if clever programmer turns into a platform for passionate developers what do you think about that Zaki Khalifa everybody who's here I will read every single one of your messages okay and I will reply back to them as well but what do you think about that like that clever programmer turns into a platform for a passionate developers meaning people who are passionate about coding people who are passionate about this world and they get to use this platform to teach other people because it shouldn't just be me right it should be way bigger than myself a lot of people maybe don't resonate with my teaching style and so by having it be this one place where somebody could teach about you know there was a somebody I'm talking to right now who is interested in thank you i fury for that feedback you lot says yes awesome hi frost killer I am in Boise Idaho my friend but I'm just on like a quieter place so I can speak with you Zacky thank you for that he says that would be cool so I've been speaking to somebody and multiple people and one of them is interested in Huber passionate about machine learning she's leading some movements on machine learning she's running conventions like PI data PyCon initiative is amazing super passionate and it's like if she could have the platform right to teach and speak about machine learning and Python wouldn't that be fantastic what some of you guys be interested in learning machine learning you know and if we have other developers who want to learn or who want to teach about something else that'd be fantastic too if you are a developer or you know somebody who's a developer please send me an email at support at clever programmer comm and get in touch with our team okay get in touch with our team get in touch with me I want to give every passionate developer a voice I want this platform to give that voice and the vision for clever programmer is to be bigger than the whole world it's a movement that wants to teach the whole world to code because I fundamentally believe that's where the world is headed and it can help anyone in every direction of life and specially children learning it the logical skills it bills very very powerful for me I couldn't even understand math till I started learning coding and I couldn't even understand physics but I used coding to create things I simulated those mathematical equations or physics and it helped me understand it let's go I see it why shooting at 45 degrees will always let you go the farthest versus like 90 degrees or 180 degrees that would be terrible if you shot like that so that's kind of what I wanted to share with you guys the overall vision where things are headed why I haven't been on the platform for a while I'm also moving to Columbia which is gonna take place very soon so between that and creating content for the profitable programmer I'm not gonna be creating too much content in YouTube because I want to make sure the content is one great and two I want to get leaders to lead on this platform and that is like the big big vision after the content and the course is done the profitable programmer and everything else I want to jump in and obviously be creating a lot more content but in the meantime I'll be going live here with you guys when will you be again live I'll try to go live for you god you know I'll try to go live a little bit more because I haven't been doing that and that's easiest and it's the best way for me to get in touch with you and you know if you have any questions put them down here I'll try to answer them my fury ass thanks to give me that passion you're awesome junior that's awesome he just said he's coding it's 200 a.m. good job buddy I fury said is coding hard for a beginner it really depends what you're doing right if you're trying to kill yourself and just do too much and you give yourself a ridiculous project that there's no way you can do you can easily psych yourself out and you won't enjoy the process but if you focus on doing smaller things and take your time and enjoy the process have a connection of love passion energy excitement positive reinforcement attached to coding coding will become very easy and you'll ought to you it'll come very easily to you and you'll automatically keep wanting by yourself to spend more and more time into coding and doing more okay so that's the key I think okay you want to baby step yourself you want to baby step your way into it if you're a beginner Bartok asks why would someone share their knowledge via clever programmer when they can start their own platform that's a very good question essentially there is a business model let's hash to it right because at the end of the day it's an alt movement but it's part of a business right so it has to make sense for you oh wow awesome Cody just gave you two dollars that's amazing it makes me really happy but somebody asked that question I'm gonna answer that question first and then I'm gonna give the tips on Python okay and if I forget then just please remind me really quick okay don't get upset with me I forget sometimes so the business essentially it's like when people jump on right and will teach their content one to get exposure but more than that obviously they'll be part of the team so they'll they'll have a parttime or fulltime position working with clever programmer and then if they create a product and lead it they will have a certain percentage of the revenue that comes from the new product that gets released okay so maybe it's like a lot of free content that they'll teach on YouTube and then ultimately if they want to make a really indepth training to take you from zero to hero you know they'll charge for that and then they'll get a percentage of every single deal so there's incentive financially but more importantly financially it's like the people that I want to bring on the team are people who really believe in the vision and see it as something bigger than themselves or something that's just monitor to them right it has to be coming from a place of passion so yeah that's really the incentive for them to create your own platform you can do it certainly but automatically getting exposure to a big audience that takes time right it took me 1 and 1/2 year of what producing 200 plus videos some of the content was really good few years of learning coding very crazily 20 hours a day so it just depends if you can do all of that create a channel go for it if you have the same vision for sure go for it but this is just a slightly easier path if your goal is to spread a message here is a platform use it use me use the clever programmer team and leverage this now I'm gonna answer the question of Cody Allen he said can you give some coding tips ok for Python coding tips I would say again start with really simple things if you're new to coding if you're new to Python go take my free training it's on YouTube it's called learn Python programming I believe it's the best free training for somebody starting to learn how to code in Python hands down somebody who doesn't have that much experience coding it'll teach you all of a lot of the fundamentals ok but other tips I can give you really easy to implement tips and they will give you a lot of leverage one this is like a big time hack so just listen up and really apply this one when you eat while you eat food watch a tutorial ok watch a simple easy tutorial if you're a beginner but just watch it in the start it's gonna feel like oh this is actually boring whatever watch something that's actually more interesting to you right but the more you surround yourself the more you listen to it the more you think about it you're gonna start to enjoy it more and more and is gonna start becoming a part of your everyday reality just like right now I'm heading to the gym I was sick for like 3040 days could not go to the gym and now gym is not really a part of my reality anymore and it takes a lot of hard work to do it but you know I'm gonna throw myself in there today and then that's just gonna get me to do it you know over time it's gonna build up momentum so do that watch coding videos watch tutorial videos and that's gonna really help you and then if you're the type of person who had night uses technology watch tutorials till you fall asleep if you use something like Instagram or something else till you fall asleep I would say used to watch tutorials till you fall asleep personal recommendation keep your phone away from you after 900 930 p.m. and just go to sleep at 1000 p.m. no phones in your room start your day in the morning you know wake up 500 a.m. 600 a.m. that's the best but everybody has a routine and I know it's not that easy to change so what I'll say there is like just surround yourself watch more tutorials they'll help you a lot Bartek says that's great the way new programmers will get a chance to get mentored and shared knowledge 100% that's really the point okay nice hi epic code CFK hi mind pixel well okay folks that's really all I wanted to share for now the vision for clever programmer it turning into a platform for passionate developers I don't know yet how I'm gonna do it I don't know it is everybody gonna be speaking from the clever programmer platform like the same YouTube channel is it gonna be different YouTube channels you know for example like Paulo Rodriguez is online right now maybe it'll be like CP Paolo Rodriguez meaning clever programmer Paul Rodriguez that's you know if he if he jumps on it that's his YouTube channel for somebody else that'll be like CP followed by their name so it just maybe that's how would work I don't know yet but one thing I know is when you start like look Lao Tzu said this I'm gonna paraphrase it I don't know the exact quotes but essentially he says listen to your thoughts thoughts are very important control your thoughts everything start from thoughts your thoughts become words words become actions actions become habits habits will build your character and your character ultimately becomes your destiny okay so it all starts on thoughts and words and so right now I have fought and now I'm putting it into words and sharing it with the world sharing it with you and just being as transparent as possible and I honestly just want to even let you know that I have this vision and I don't know how it's gonna take form but just but by putting it out there sharing it with you guys maybe you will come up with an amazing idea and I can use that or maybe somehow an idea will be formed within me and you know who knows but this is just me putting it out there with the world and now it's a it's the process of the vision turning into a yeah there's gonna be a processor the vision is gonna turn into a physical manifestation right at some point but I want you to be part of that journey and enjoy that process and be there okay that's it for this video thank you for jumping on and giving me some of your time and listening in I really appreciate it I'm always humbled by it Thank You Cody Allen for the $2 donation it just put a smile on my face I love it thank you thank you and that's it I'm gonna head to the gym get in my lifting session and other than that I love you guys take care be safe enjoy life get out there the world is a huge place and you know if you have the time the capacity the money the energy to travel please do because I'm only in Boise Idaho and already I'm producing content and speaking and I have like I feel like my drive back whereas when I was just staying in one place it was kind of killing me from inside so you know listen to yourself give yourself some time and you know if you can travel do that as well thank you guys take care that state as always I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
