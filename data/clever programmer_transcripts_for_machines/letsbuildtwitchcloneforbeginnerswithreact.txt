brother we really appreciate you and this is for cloud provider aws uh or google actually we always say uh firebase firebase firebase like that is the number one why we say it it's super simple to use very beginner friendly and super powerful so it actually uh it is google so it's google and we always yeah so so pretty much google and firebase uh inside of there and yeah that can pretty much handle all the backend stuff all the database stuff with the realtime database authentication and all that so we always say go with firebase firebase is the best i'm not sure i understand oh at the same time siri thought i was speaking to her okay uh welcome south africa in the house what is up everybody and let's actually get it going who's bombed we are 304 people at the moment let me know guys if you're ready and if you were uh if you're ready to build this with me today let's get it started all right so with that uh i'm gonna switch back to screen share mode and let's actually get it going so what we will do is the usual zooming in and what we will say is pretty much npx create react app and we will say twitch clone and that will pretty much go ahead grab all the stuff that we might ever need uh throughout this build this will pretty much just uh set up a react app for us so that we don't have to worry about any of the headache that it actually uh has uh so yeah that's pretty much uh what i am just running and in the meantime uh let let me actually show ahead again on the application so we are gonna be building this nice little uh header with all the uh exact same twitch stuff i think i'm actually gonna go ahead and open up the real twitch and just show you guys how it actually looks like and oops okay so because because because i'm streaming at the moment it looks a bit different uh so yeah and now we will have this nice little center part we have this awesome background which actually stays there as i scroll past we also have the uh nice left sidebar and this is actually the exact stream guys that you are actually watching at the moment so that's super awesome you can literally go ahead and do the same thing on your portfolio so you can have like uh an actual streaming part in your portfolio so let me know if you're excited about that and smash the like button if you think this is gonna be an awesome build and if you're ready to put this on your portfolio and land the job as a developer in 2020 because our mission is to help 5 000 people get jobs as developers in 2020 so let me know who's excited about that and who's ready to put in the work and get it going let me know how's it go who's ready about for that so uh yeah okay uh let's actually yeah so at the moment i have my create react app thing running it's done and you can you know that when it says happy hacking that means we are ready and uh we are we can start going and hey what is up francisco everybody says let's go and mahi asks uh if i'm gonna be using webrtc on this build no i'm not gonna be using that um we might as well have some kind of builds that will actually use it in the in the soon future so stay tuned for that hey what is up all right so with that done i'm gonna pretty much go ahead and open up my vs code with say code space dot and that will go ahead and open up my vs code and inside of here uh first thing first let's zoom in just a bit and i'm gonna move the comments all over the place here and guys we are 294 people live at the moment i'm super excited to have you guys on this stream and yeah let's get it started so first thing first what i will do is open up a new terminal and that is what we run um oh hey oh i know what's happening so inside of here i need to see the into that folder and then i can run mpm start i was in the wrong folder so this actually this terminal is going to be uh running my this one is going to run my full uh app react application so yeah that is awesome and my application is up and running so with that we should be good to get started now um let's actually go ahead and start with our uh uh last stream hey all right okay so what we're gonna be doing is first thing first we will go ahead and we will do the cleanup process as we always so let's actually delete logo.svg we will not do uh testing today so both of the testing files can be deleted and yeah that's pretty much the start okay and also because react 17 is out in app.js you will not find an import react from react there is not not a case anymore so we will just delete the logo svg import we will also go ahead delete everything from app.js what else we would do is remove everything inside of the header and because we are going to be using the bam naming convention we will change the app to a lowercase in the class name so next up what we will quickly do uh what we will quickly do is let me quickly run through the comments okay awesome um and i think wish we are good so with that let's actually go ahead and start uh mocking up how our application is going to look like and there is still some kind of error going on uh let me quickly refresh okay here we go we are we're good we're good so first thing first what we will do is we will create this part of the application the top bar this actually consists of three parts the top bar left in the middle and the right hand side so those are the parts that we will actually add into today's build and next up is going to be this sidebar over here but that's for that's just uh later on we will also have this part which actually consists of two parts as well so with that let's actually jump into it and what we will quickly do is we will say uh let's actually add the header first so let's continue where we left off and what we did was started our server in the uh uh in the browser so let's actually do that again and let's continue so we had pretty much a fully fully empty uh server that was running at the moment and yep that's pretty much how it was going so what what i said was let's actually add the header and let's continue so that's at the header.js file and guys everybody who is coming in uh let me know if you are able to catch up and what's going on yeah we have 80 people and that's nice that's super awesome let's continue where we left off so that sounds nice okay and what i will do is quickly finish off a couple of processes on this computer uh which are actually eating up a lot of resources so welcome guys back on the um on the stream let's get everybody in here again and let's continue where we left off guys i'm sorry something happened let's continue and guys let me know who's ready who's ready to continue okay we have 88 people let's smash the like button let's get this video out to everybody uh let's get it done uh yeah let's go ahead and let's share that we are live we are back and we are ready to go ahead and continue where we left off so yeah let's go and we are 100 people that's super nice and let's continue okay um okay i think i think we should be good to go now with that uh all right that actually sounds pretty neat and we have all the files ready to continue where we left off okay so uh yeah that's pretty cool and what we would do okay so we are 137 people together and let's actually okay so i'm gonna be pitching up the stream once again because we some for some reason last stream dropped uh but we are here we are back and we are gonna be building the awesome twitch clone so let's actually continue where we left off uh we are 130 people together super nice guys let's actually let everybody know by just smashing that like button that we are here we are back 140 that's awesome we got morocco in a house uh yeah hey thank you so much nishan very very much appreciate you and of course uh yeah so we really really appreciate everybody who's coming back and that's super awesome we are 166 people again awesome let's actually raise that number back to 300 where we left off we i'm super super pumped to uh continue this build and build this thing together uh we are 188 68 people nice that's super cool let's continue raising that number let's smash the like button so that we get everybody back from last stream which for some reason dropped but with that uh i think we are almost almost ready to start i'm gonna be waiting a little bit uh before we continue and yeah so guys i'm super pumped to have you guys here do an ikea clone okay sounds good um oh the quality is better okay that sounds good so guys i'm sorry for some reason the stream dropped let's get this video out to everybody else uh and i'm super pumped to have you guys back here and we are gonna be uh continuing where we left off in just a second so let me know who's pummed let me know who's pumped to continue the uh twitch clone where we left off last time which was adding the header so guys if you're just tuning in not a problem we are building today the twitch clone which we almost couldn't even start because the stream dropped so now we are gonna be going ahead and building the awesome twitch clone which is actually able to receive stream from the computer um so yeah let's actually uh get started as soon as we hit 200 people live at the moment hey we got radu in the house awesome super pumped we got fire nice everybody is crazy pumped so that is awesome guys let me know who's ready and if you are good to go let's do this says martine that is awesome hey thank you so much brother really appreciate you guys all right uh i think i think everybody is almost in the house so soon we can go ahead and let's get started hey suran says let's go okay so with that i think we are almost ready to rock so we are 190 people together that's super awesome and i think i'm gonna go ahead and get started building so what we will do is we will go ahead and we will build the header part first which will go up top on the uh screen and that will add a nice little um uh part uh up there which is going to be super cool so with that uh i'm gonna be moving some stuff around but okay so we are in header.js let's actually also add header.css and at the same time uh let's just go ahead and using the es7 snippets which we're talking about a lot so that's actually an super awesome extension if you guys go ahead and type in es7 this is the one to get and that will allow us to say rafce and this will go ahead and create a full um this will go ahead and create a fully fully awesome uh react component which we can go ahead and use so what we would do inside of here is we will add the class name of header oops so we will say class name equals header and inside of there we are actually going to be adding three more divs because we are dividing the whole thing to three parts one of them is going to go to the left we are going to have a center piece and we're going to have a right piece so what we will quickly do is we will say we will have a header underscore underscore left and i would just create it three times and then just uh rename the left to center and right and because i'm using emmet this will actually make my job super easy boom there we go we have three divs now my only thing to do is delete left and say center and what i will say is right goes right there so i have my three divs ready and we should almost be good to go with the header so guys let me know who's pummed who is here with me who has the three headers inside of uh three divs inside of their header and let's actually carry on with that so i wait for facetime clones as radu yeah we have it in pipe stay tuned for that so yeah uh also receiving uh uh ebay okay that's actually a nice idea i wasn't thinking of the about oh it's actually a good one okay uh yeah so with that what we will do first thing first is we will just go ahead and add uh add an image that will be the logo so and so that you guys okay so this is pretty much the logo that we are going to be using you can go ahead google this link up and this will actually add the logo but we need to import that inside of our application so we will say uh we want to have header in here and with my auto import it actually went ahead and imported it oh wrong one so yeah there it is that's the line that you need and yeah that's actually pretty big now but we will make it super nice in just a second so let's actually continue by adding the following and what we will say is like like on the original uh on the original twitch we have the following and browse on the left hand side like right next to the logo that's what we will do now so what we will say is under here we will just add these two h2 tags and that will actually go ahead and add those two and i think i'm just going to change the order of my uh windows and yeah let's act that's actually is super awesome we have the following and the browse right over there down below the logo so next up what we will say is actually notice that on the on the uh on the twitch we have something called uh we have something some kind of horizontal line so that is a thing that we can go ahead and do and with that what we will do is actually add just an empty div and we will go ahead and say uh we will add an empty div which will have a vertical line or we can say like we al but for the baby the bam naming convention we will just say header uh oh and yeah there we go header and vertical line so that actually uh is doing the job for us and we will actually make it look like a pretty awesome uh vertical line and we have 225 people in the house guys i'm super thankful for you that you actually carried on and came back um that means a lot and we really appreciate you guys so i just wanted to let you guys know that uh this is super awesome and let's actually smash the like button so that this video gets out to everybody who was here in the original one and wants to join so with that said let's carry on and yeah that's it so uh let's go ahead and add two more um two more of these uh things uh those are gonna be esports and music and instead of material ui because guys uh remember this channel is only about giving you value so you guys probably pretty much familiar with material ui for that reason today we are going to be using something called font awesome if you guys don't know what's that that's pretty much a and um what's that called um an icon collection just like material ui icons it's a bit of a hustle to set up first but then it's going to be super easy to use just like material ui and actually i think it has a bit more i think actually it has a bit more icons so what we will say is we will go to fontawesome.com and if you guys don't know don't have an account it's free go ahead and register and with that yeah so that's that's me and what i will do is pretty much go ahead and say font awesome cdn over here and i will go ahead and hit this button this will go ahead and uh copy all these code for me and uh it's actually a free stuff so you can go ahead and do the exact same stuff and what i will do is go into public and index.html and inside of here you can go ahead and just paste it like right under or above the title uh there we go so that actually went ahead and imported all the font awesome stuff that i am going to use in today's session so what we would do oh i wasn't sharing my screen oh my god so uh now let's let's actually go back so font awesome.com and over here if you go into uh font awesome cdn that will pretty much go ahead and open up this screen for you and you need to press that button over there to copy this code and that is what goes into public index.html and the right above title now we are 260 people together i'm super pumped to have everybody here up here uh up on youtube and all over the place thank you so much for joining again it means a lot for the channel and me and us and the whole cp team smash the like button if you like this video and if you're ready to go over uh the twitch clone and work this thing through so on that note let's actually carry on in just a second um all right yeah so actually uh importing icons from font awesome is not uh is like the exact same easy as doing it with uh material ui so you can pretty much go ahead and search here like three dots because that's the third uh icon that you want to go ahead and use and i think i'm just gonna for relevance i'm gonna open up a uh twitch this is actually logan one of the members of team cp and what we are going to be doing is copying that part over there let's actually use a bit harsher color so that's the the icon that we're looking for at the moment so maybe we can say done and yeah that's the one that we will use so we will pretty much go ahead and copy this thing just click on that it will do the copy for you like it's super awesome right let's go back in here paste it in let's go back and check out if it is working and okay there we go there it is down there uh you need to scroll down a bit and hold on a sec boom now you should be able to see it so it's down there but for better streaming experience i'm just gonna crop it and fail so with that let's go back in here and let's fill up all the other stuff and guys smash the like button if you like this and if you're ready to use font awesome as an alternative or actually extend the uh icons that actually material ui uh offers so let's go ahead and let's continue and let's carry on so all right next up what we will do is go into uh header center and inside of here what we will quickly do is we will have of course an input field which we which will say uh placeholder like search as a placeholder and inside of there we will have an other div uh which will contain the center logo right so inside of here we will have another div and oh emma doesn't work so we will have a center logo container and inside of there what we will say is that's going to be a search icon so let's go back in here to font awesome and say search and that this is the tool i'm going to actually search and afterwards i'm just going to copy paste to keep the momentum up and to keep everything crushing guys who's excited let me know in the comments if you guys are excited hey we got a buddy in a house and let's actually uh continue uh working on the twitch clone nice so what we will do is like copy that piece and let's actually add it like down below uh inside of a header inside of a div what we will say is go ahead and this is going oh oh my god i put it in the wrong place there we go so yep that's it and inside of here we will have the search icon which we just grabbed from font awesome now with that hey exactly cp fam there we go that's it so with that let's actually go ahead continue and what we will do is we will we will set up the right side so guys if you actually go in here there we have the search bar and the logo as well the search logo so next up what we will do is we will go ahead and say inside of the header right right okay so we are pretty much finished with the left hand side and a center piece of the uh of the top header so let me actually show it to you so inside of here we have that part done contentwise we have this part done contentwise now let's actually add all these icons and let's then actually go ahead and style it so it will look like super crisp let's go ahead and on that what we will do is um mustafa asks how did i move those lines up i think you're yeah so on mac if you go ahead and hold option and then go up and down with the arrows that will actually move the lines but actually there is an awesome video on this channel uh which is which is about whim which is actually an extension for vs code and i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead and watches that because that will actually like 10x your speed encoding all right with that said hey what's up reclive from argentina sup everybody and let's continue so what we will do next up is we will have a header right container and what we will say is inside of here all right inside of here we will have three i icons one of them is going to be this crown thingy which is going to be the prime loot one then we will have an inbox for notifications and we will have a message box for uh the whispers then we will also have and it's actually going to be a different div we will have the get bits part and then we will also have an avatar all right now with that let's actually go back in here and what we will quickly do is just go ahead copy these and put them in here so this is like super easy to work with and actually don't freak out if your react apps freaks out because you're using classes over here instead of class names like what you can pretty much do is go ahead and like change it so like add class name and the reason for that is that in react class is a reserved word or a reserved phrase and we are actually using class names in the html parts uh which you actually know and like already so we already have these class names over here so we will have these icons and next up what we will do is we will say we will have the yeah above uh what we will say header uh and right and what i will what i like to say is header right bits and with that let's actually add the gem icon in there and also h4 which will say get bits and then we will style that so it looks super super nice guys who is actually ready uh with this part and who is actually uh where i am at the moment i see we got 250 60 people on the live stream so i want to see 260 comments that if you are with me or if you need a little time to finish up and close up to the point where i am um so yeah uh let me know guys how actually everybody is going and how if the speed is good so let's go ahead and let me know who is uh here with me who has it ready uh yeah exactly uh you need a mat emma is actually a super powerful tool like you can create so many crazy stuff uh with that so i highly recommend uh doing this hey david says yo let's go awesome and let's actually carry on real soon so how to auto import uh the component that's actually a pretty awesome stuff um there is a auto importing uh built into vs code and if you have like a working exported like a red ready to import component it's going to show up in the auto autocomplete so you can just go ahead and hit return and it will import it immediately so with that said with that said let's actually go ahead and carry on we are 274 people guys smash the like button if you're ready to work uh work forward with this twitch clone and let me know how you guys feeling about this and if you are ready to continue where we left off so yeah on that let's actu and yes control space for auto import that is it hey thank you so much bro i'm trying i'm trying my best all right let's continue um and guys if you have any any any questions this this is my instagram handle hit me up uh drop me a message i'm and i'm trying to get back to everybody uh so yeah let me know who's ready and who's pumped to continue so we are 286 people that let's continue guys all right with that said what we will do is we will actually there is one tiny little thing that we will need the material ui for and today it's going to only be the avatar on the top right and because we are a bit of a behind the time due to this uh stream disconnection we will just do the avatar part uh so what we will say is we will go ahead and npm i material oh material ui slash core and let's grab all the stuff in here a uh we got adidas says hello sir big fan thank you so much brother really appreciate you uh please do a shopify clone of course um so yeah hi from ethiopia sup ethiopia super pumped to have you in the house and let's actually continue okay um just one second and we almost should be good to go and let's go ahead and use the material ui we are actually going to be using auto import again because that's just super awesome to use and what we will do is we will just start typing in avatar and it's not importing automatically so we will go ahead and import it without that so what we would say is we will go up here and say import and we actually explicitly need to import avatar from materia ui core and then we can just go ahead and use that uh down here so we will say avatar and yep that should be it so with that done hey we got bangladesh in the house that's super super awesome uh am i the only one who got problems with material ui icon since react 17 release that's actually a great question i'm seeing a some sort of errors and warns and all that stuff so that's i think material ui needs to be updated and that's all uh what happens but yeah i i was actually um i was actually paying attention to that i'll actually look into it and see what else we can do about it or if we are uh gonna be um if we can tackle that sometime some way and yes we are adding streaming functionality it's actually going to be a bit a bit of an easier one uh but we will go ahead and have streams on this channel where we will do like crazy complex ones but for now because it's just the first time when we are doing such things we will do uh an easier one but this is actually a production ready uh streaming integration what we will do today so yeah uh smash the like button if you're excited for that so with that let's actually go ahead and let's go ahead and style the uh recent what is this and let's actually go ahead and style everything that we have in here so yeah that oh my god i'm messing up all these windows okay so we should be good all right we should be good now what we will quickly do is we will go ahead and go into uh header.css which we first need to import um so let's actually edit like down below we will say import uh header.css and that will go ahead and import our css file and inside of header.css what we can go ahead and do is uh uh the full header is going to be five ram high like i literally checked out uh how it is built on twitch like actually um just a moment again so uh i checked it out and tore it apart with the inspect tool and that's how i know it it's five ram high uh we also will have a border bottom which is going to be one pixel solid and fully black we will also have a display flex we will align everything to the center you might think it's a not a good call but actually i'll explain it in just a sec we will also have this nice little background color which actually is the exact same color that uh is being used by twitch and we will also add a z index of a hundred and a position of sticky and it will be stick to the top so top is going to be zero and let's actually check it out so it's it's a bit of an ugly stuff at the moment but let's just let's just keep it going and we will have it super nicely okay so i saw this question they would i will start university in just nine months do you think it's possible to learn react in this uh little amount of time to be as good as my future classmates of course you can like do it like literally my advice for you is go ahead watch every single react build on this channel subscribe to the channel and do all the stuff that we are dropping so you will not just master react you will also master mirn and you will also master react native because sunny and quasi are doing react native stuff uh starting this monday like actually like two days ago they started the react native uh stuff so that is super super awesome and hey we got priyanja in the house so that's super cool and yeah so you can literally go ahead and master all these skills guys it's super awesome that we have 260 people smash the like button if you find this video uh cool and let's go hey yeah i'm trying my best dude all right so with that said so with that said what we will do is first uh let's actually add the header let's actually uh style the header left first and that's going to be display flex uh we will align everything to the center and what we like this is the flex one is actually we are making it like responsible but what we want to do is like the left part like takes up all the space that it actually can so it will actually snap everything to the right hand side but we will actually handle that on the right hand side which will snap everything to the left which will keep the input box in the middle and all the other stuff is going to be nicely equally aligned to the sides so what we will do is we have everything aligned to the center and quickly what uh what else we need to do is we will say the left logo needs to be object fit contain so it it's not going to be crazy when we shrink it like small it's going to keep the aspect ratio and next up we will do is say margin left is going to be 20 pixels and the head is going to be 3 ram which is super awesome let's actually check it out what it does to our uh actual build so it's actually pretty ugly because i mean the the logo is super awesome the color is neat but we still have everything in like black which is uh not the ideal uh thing so if i highlight it yeah then that way you can you guys can actually see what's up so with that uh we need we still need to work on it a bit but uh i want you to actually notice something that all the text is going to be uh all the text is gonna be like white so if you can actually see that uh logan federally uh he was actually uh in a couple of live streams of club programmer it's his uh twitch account uh and like literally all these texts are white so what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will go back to app.css and inside of there uh we would just say uh all the colors should be white i mean the text colors of course so inside of header.css we will just add a star and the color is going to be white and what i actually forgot during the cleanup process is that adding the uh margin zero so it will actually snap everything is going to be snapped to the edges of the application now next up okay so you guys can actually see that it's starting to look like starting to get close to the actual twitch which is super awesome so yeah and let's actually quickly check out what do we got in hey we got yap in a house how's it going my man hey awesome and cool all right so next up what we will do is we will go ahead and quickly uh finish up the header styling so inheri.css next up what we will do is we will say that the margin of all the text uh over here needs to be 15 pixels all right so that's what we are going to be setting super quickly with that and like actually you can see that i am actually going into so every h2 inside of the header left needs to have a 15 pixel uh margin next up what we will do is we will actually add the divider but uh divider line so let's actually copy this one and go back to header.css and we will say oh we will say uh yeah there we go we will say the border left is going to be one pixel solid and this nice little uh light gray or gray butter uh gray color and it's going to be three rams high now what that will actually do is it will add that nice little divider which you can see over here so that's literally the exact same stuff all right so with that i mean it starts to look super nice and crisp so stay tuned guys this is gonna be awesome this is gonna be super cool smash the like button if you think this build is going to be awesome and if you're ready to add to add this project on your portfolio and land jobs as developers in 2020 okay let's carry on so um what we will say is we will uh like notice that uh it actually yeah we actually need to add a 15 pix like we added 15 pixels of margin for this and this but not this so what we will need to do is add 15 pixels to this one which is actually if you remember this was an i right so that this one this thing so what we will do is let's actually carry uh and let's actually add that inside of here okay like that so we will have the margin left of 15 pixels and best as always keep it up i will not sleep until i see a real twitch okay challenge accepted dude you will sleep soon just here to say great job i fall i follow at my own pace later of course bro like literally you can go ahead and just watch this one and then go over the whole thing in like small bits and chunks that's actually one of the best ways to learn what we are building over here and to literally like uh get the most out of these builds all right and with that uh next up let's actually go to the center piece which we will uh say like super easy which os am i running it's mac os um so next up what we will actually add in here is ooh yeah so it's going to be the header sender which will have a background color of this 4a4a4c we will have height of a three and a half ram display is going to be flex width of a 25 percent border radius is going to be 8 pixels which will add this nice rounded shape the overflow is going to be hidden the align items are going to be centered and and we will align everything to the center now that actually is going to make that look just like that which is a bit ugly at the moment but let's actually carry on and make it look super nice okay so what we will do is uh inside of the header center there is actually an input which we uh which we will uh make it look like transparent completely so the outline is going to be none that is actually uh blue box when you're like clicking into clicking into the um yes i did actually um and actually the camera is new as well so the outline is actually the blue little uh border when you click inside of a text area which is not cool so we will just remove it that's gonna be none background color is transparent uh we will also say flux of one that will take up as much space as it actually possibly can inside of the centerpiece so let's not forget that which is 25 of the screen so let's not forget what is taking up what kind of uh uh how much of space we will have a margin left of 15 pixels so it's like not like at the exact uh edge of the uh input and we will have a font size of large and the border none so that is actually pretty much it hey thank you so much brother really appreciate it and yes creative world this is completely for beginners as such i'm not even a react pro okay so hey what is up logan yeah actually it's his twitch that and we are uh that i'm actually uh showing when i'm presenting the actual twitch all right so next up what we will do is we will go into uh the logo container which is literally just the um magnifying glass the search logo so what we are actually doing there is we are saying that the background color is going to be a bit of a darker darker color and the width is going to be 50 pixels it is going to be a hundred percent display is going to be flex align item we are aligning everything to the center and justify coloring to the center now that is actually the exact same stuff if we did uh display grid and place items center jesus i'm not shaving my head okay guys actually if you are enjoying this build smash the like button if you are getting value out of it and i really really hope that you are smash the like button we are i don't even know uh where we are at because everything got disconnected but let me know how you guys guys actually if you're enjoying damn so guys we are at 200 likes which is super awesome i'm super happy for that and let's actually carry on with that sad so next up uh we will so we are pretty much done with this part like it's still on the right hand side but we would just smash it in the center in just a second so it's looking nice this is the final piece how we will actually look let's actually place it to its right place and let's go so uh what we would do is we will say the header right is gonna be uh coming up next for styling so we are gonna say display flex flexo one that will snap the center back to the center and justify content we want everything snap to the right hand side of it right so that's it we have the search bar in the center everything is on the right hand side because actually if we go over here everything is on the right hand side right so that's super uh we are modeling it like crazy now next up what we will quickly do uh i want to learn more about theory try to find course like code academy or free code camp and we'll provide repository link or pr um actually if you want to learn like like take it to the next level there is an awesome free webinar down below in the description i highly highly recommend everybody who wants to take this to the next level that's actually a whiteboard webinar and i highly recommend everybody goes ahead and watches it so that's that's just uh something uh yeah next up uh what we will do is we will say the right container which actually contains all of the icons we will add the display flags onto them we will say justify content there's gonna be space between align items is gonna be center and yeah now inside of that uh the right container i so all the actual all the icons in there are gonna be gonna have a margin of 20 pixels so that will actually space out all these like super nicely and still the bits is uh pretty ugly but we will just address that in just a second so with that actually we will pretty much like uh say uh i think we can add the div in here as well nope i think we might need to add a comma hey there we go um okay now something is breaking oh no uh we will need to say the right container and the division okay so we can actually do it like this okay that's it that's it so with is there a reason uh still use class components uh no not at all not at all like literally like if i or sunny like actually sunny said it a couple of times but this is uh true for me too so if we see a classbased component we literally go ahead and not gonna work with it until we have rewritten it into functional ones like class based is very very much passed like you always want to uh think two years ahead of now because that's going to be the trend uh trend of tomorrow and that's what you want to build now what uh why i say is that is like that will actually take you above and beyond and you are going to be a super modern developer so no go uh so classbased components are actually nogos don't ever use them they are just they are just not cool at all next up let's actually uh let's actually go ahead and continue so what we will do is uh we have the right bits right so the header right bits is pretty much the get bits part and what we will say in here is it should have a display flex uh it should align everything to the center background color is going to be like a lighter gray then we will add the uh padding uh onto the left and the right and we will add the border radius of 15 pixels now this actually gives us this nice little button uh going over here so that actually is pretty much pretty much how it will look like only thing though we actually want to do is we like it doesn't breathe at the moment so we want to add a little bit of margin inside of here so what we will quickly do is just add the uh the eye in there and add some kind of a margin right of five pixels and that will make the whole thing like have like a little bit of room to breathe so that's actually actually i'm a beginner and i want to make an app this is the right place for you um stay tuned we are going to be dropping some crazy values and actually let's go ahead and check out all the applications and clones that we are doing on this channel all right uh so you can learn full stack front end backhand whichever you want to so next up what we will quickly do is we will say uh i mean we're pretty much done with the header so guys who's excited about that who is it who's pumped that we have a working header which is looking actually super awesome let me know if you're if you're ready to continue and if you're pummed about it and guys if you found this video valuable so far smash the like button it would mean the world to us and that's the only thing we ask of you just smash the like button so we can get this video out to all over the world and we can beat the youtube algorithm so yeah that's pretty much it uh okay and the air horn let's go exactly let's carry on and yeah uh please do not use um what's that capital letters um because we have nightbot in the chat and it's moderating and also i think we got preentry in the chat so please keep the chat clean we are here to learn we are a nice community we want to get better together so next up what we will do is we will uh build the sidebar so with that actually let's go ahead and i'm gonna share my screen so inside of here what we will say is we will have a sidebar the js file and we will quickly go ahead and use using the es7 snippets we will go ahead and create a new component that will pretty much uh enable us auto import it in app.js so we will just go ahead and say sidebar and like literally i'm not touching anything that actually shows that i am able to auto import and then just pretty much i have it in here and that if if it doesn't show it up for you that's the line that you want to go ahead and copy in there and yeah uh okay so let's actually i know a little bit of react.js uh that's that's perfect this is a very beginner friendly place so keep it going and you will be like super successful we have crazy amount of people who landed jobs like literally like six figure jobs watching these live streams okay so with that said smash the like button if you're ready to continue now with that so insidebar.js what we will quickly do is we will add a class name uh to the div and that and inside of there we will have a couple of different stuff hey big fan from dubai thank you so much bro means a lot all right so next up uh let's actually take a look at what we are going to be building so it's zoomed in but we are going to be building this part over there and for the sake of simplicity we're just going to be uh working with this part so let's actually um add all those stuff so what we will do in here is we will have a couple of h5s which are gonna be uh the follow channels right and we will also have a recommended channels right so that's actually uh pretty much the two parts of uh of this thing so we have the follow channels and the recommended channels and yeah and we also have a show more uh so let's actually add also a class name to it and we are just going to be using a simple simple uh wait that is awesome like literally thank you so much for that actually and great job and you will crush it tomorrow in the interview okay that's super awesome awesome that's perfect so what we will do next up is yeah uh so inside of here we have the show mower and that is actually gonna be like that's how we will target it that it would actually show it purple so next up what we will what we want to do is say like uh we will have uh this part so this is going to be the clever programmer channel right so the name clever programmer and actually says uh 816k but i think we are above that like let me know guys how many subs uh subscribers does this channel have i see 820k so let me quickly change it so when i was preparing it was still at 816 but we are at 820 now and guys smash the like button if you like this video so far and you uh getting value out of this stream so next up what we will add is we will add logan's channel of course uh because he's featured in today's video um and literally you can go ahead and like grab any kind of um grab any kind of logos uh for this and this is actually gonna be freaking out because we still haven't created the channel but let me just do it in just a second okay so quickly next up what we will do is add actually add the recommended channels uh i'm gonna add my instagram handle in here so you guys can go ahead and uh drop me any questions you might have regarding this or any other builds uh and yep that will be pretty much it now it's gonna be freaking out because we don't have channel defined let's go ahead and define channel then i guess so what we would say is we will go ahead and add a channel dot js as well as a channel dot css file and guys we are at 216 people smash the like button so we can get this number up very high so let me know who's pumped and smash the like button okay next up uh in the channel.js we will quickly go ahead and import channel.css which is just like that and what we will quickly do is let i mean of course we're going to be using bam naming convention so we are adding the class name of channel in here we will also have uh we will also have uh a channel details div inside of there uh which is automatically closing oh hold on just a sec yeah and inside of there we will have an image which we are actually passing from sidebar right so what i will do is quickly add this over here so guys you can actually see it and yeah just like that so you can see that avatar name and followers are being imported so what we will quickly do and this is still here but we're just going to be removing that in just a sec so with that actually let's destructure all that stuff that we are passing in love from mars elon what do you know about that so what we will quickly do is uh let's go ahead and destructure everything in here oh i made a typo there we go and what we will quickly go ahead and do is that the image source is gonna be the avatar that we are adding or we are actually passing in and let's actually add an alt so that is actually super important when you are uh when you want to take care of seo because google ranks uh all the alt uh image tags before uh all the image tags without an odd right so that's something that you want to do so yeah let's pretty let's actually carry on so inside of here we're going to say avatar and next up we are going to be adding the name which is going to be just a simple p tag and we will also have the followers down below so next up what we will quickly do i think i'm gonna actually add this light right next to it so you guys can see what i'm building real time so what we will do is go back in here and let's actually import the uh channel uh from the component that we just created um not like that like like this so we should actually eliminate uh that uh issue just now and here we go and it's still freaking out for some reason oh my god so what we can quickly do is uh let's actually see what is up so we have it we have a problem in sidebar.js on line six and let's see what the problem what seems to be the problem can find the variable channel now what do you mean can't find variable channel right yeah um let's actually refresh it once again okay it's actually not freaking out i don't know oh um yeah i wasn't sharing my screen so right now it's not freaking out no clue but it was saying that can't find variable channel okay with that said guys if you're excited about that smash the like button we just cleared our first bug don't know how we just cleared it so smash the like button to get this video out we are 230 people strong at the moment and we are an hour in the in the build which is super awesome i really appreciate everybody who is here with me today so let's carry on building the twitch clone right next up what we will do is we will need to design or actually add some kind of nice uh look for the uh both the sidebar and the channels so what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will import the sidebar.css but first and some would say let me take a selfie but i will say let's go into channel.css and okay it's freaking out because i didn't don't have a sidebar that css file we can like help on that like super fast we will say sidebar.css so you need to manually refresh the page yeah i think that was the uh that was the reason for that so yeah um exactly [Laughter] that's the reason why i have it all right um exactly like like you learn react because it's more popular and super easy yeah that's part of the reason and like literally that's what is in demand and we are trying to focus on what is in demand and what will help you get a job as a developer and what will help you get money uh using your skills and your time put in so that's that's pretty much why you learn react and learn and we are um we are offering all these stuff for free for you guys so that you can actually go ahead and profit with all this stuff all right so that's actually an awesome point so let's carry on and what we would do is inside of channel.css is we will target the whole channel and what we will say that when we hover over it we want to have the course uh cursor to be a pointer so yeah like that thing so so the little hand ins instead of the mouse we will also say width of 100 so use up all the space the sidebar actually lets you we will also say display flags so like you can see that all these red buttons went right next to the uh items and somewhere around here should be all the text which probably is not visible just because um background is white and the text is white as well but if i actually comment this part out and save it all the red buttons go down below under the picture picture and if i go ahead and uncomment it boom it goes right back next to it so that's actually display flex and um is mean better than mern not at all so you don't ever want to change uh react to angular that's a pain in the butt you don't want to do that and next up what we would do is like the nice little touches that will make uh an app stand out we will add a hover so if i hover over all this like this actually has this nice little hover of uh over effect which kind of looks ugly at the moment but we will just address it in like super fast now next up what we will say is uh the channel channel details are going to be display flex and we will say align items to center and we probably yeah so what happened is like the text uh went over here like next to the image and if i go ahead and uh uncomment this part boom it's right under it okay same with cp right so let's uncomment that and it will actually snap back to the right hand side there we go so next up what we will do is pretty much go ahead uh and carry on and guys we are 230 people at the moment on the live stream smash the like button if you are getting value out of it to get this video out there and show this to a lot more people and be the algorithm right so now uh last but not least in the channel right so that one little thing uh we need to add an object fit contain right we want to start all these images because they are super big now uh and we want to add a margin left of 5 pixels a width of 40 40 pixels and the border rate is of 50 and if i go ahead and save it boom now we have these awesome nice looking uh channels which are actually at the moment taking up all the space that we have oh and we also got the subscriptions over there awesome so what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will style this sidebar as well so right now we have like we are building up the uh whole thing from bits and pieces and what we are doing uh and what we are doing is like we are building that part at the moment right so these things are looking crisp now and yeah there we go let's continue on that so images are done and next up what we will need to do is we will go ahead and use the sidebar.css and we will make the full sidebar looking super crisp and super nice so um what we will say is the sidebar should be should have a padding of 10 pixels width of a 13 yeah just there like i i was literally like uh trying to figure it out and once it is actually full screen it will look super crisp and we will have a background color of this thing uh we just commented that uh because i mean for development purposes while you are building the full app it is nice to see the whole thing uh going through all the way till the bottom and even further but we're just not going to be worrying about that so let's actually comment that or actually delete that we will have a display flex flex direction is going to be a column and next up what we will quickly do is oh as we will say the sidebar top is going to have a flex of one and inside of there every h5 will need to have a margin top of 25 pixels and a margin bottom of 25 pixels that will actually assure that uh let me quickly demo what we are actually doing so notice that all these channels are like super close to each other but uh there is like a bigger gap in between the h5 and the channel name right so what that will do is like we will it will let the whole thing like uh breathe a bit and and yeah that's that's pretty much what it will do it will give it a room to breathe so next up uh is we are uh making the show more right so that part over there that will actually need to look uh that that will actually we will add a nice little purple onto that so that is going to be this color and we also want to have the cursor as a pointer when we hover over it so like this and all these super hey hey we got a tharwa and he just dropped hopped in right now the crown look uh right now love your solo sessions too thank you so much brother really appreciate you and let me know what you're up to and what kind of articles can we expect from you very soon all right actually this goes out to authority making super awesome job writing all these medium blogs and helping you guys even further to take your like literally go ahead and check out the clever program immediate clever programmer medium we are giving you guys stepbystep tutorials over there and we are helping you guys uh to build all these builds right there uh let me quickly uh bring it up so right over here there we go right over here we have all these knowledge written down which actually helps you guys a lot uh building all this stuff so we have the discord clone over here how to deploy your website to firebase uh favorite programming language procrastination how to deal with it understanding the chat functionality in firebase and priyanshu actually dropped an objectoriented programming in javascript like guys this is super cool check this out like literally go ahead and and check out medium.com clever programmer because the guys are dropping crazy amount of value there as well and it will actually give you guys like uh smaller snippets of code so let let me quickly uh show you guys the discord clone super fast so if we go in here we got all these text we got the prerequisites and all that stuff we have small tiny little uh snippets of code that you might as well want to go ahead and have and you can go ahead and see what we built step by step how cool is that smash the like button if you find that cool and smash the like button if you didn't know that we are doing medium articles so let's go ahead there and check those builds out and this is actually gonna be there step by step written down okay so that's awesome and author about just says huge articles are coming up soon amazon clone article crossed 16k views super cool and yeah and we have a lot of stuff coming up even discord bought an electron js guys this is ooh this is super awesome i wish i was in your place right okay let's go ahead uh and continue and carry on uh carry on doing it and what let me just quickly go ahead and drop the um drop the link for medium uh into the chat so quickly just drop that in there and go guys guys go ahead check that out super valuable so what we will go and what we will do and uh what we will continue with is gonna be the sidebar button because if you guys go ahead and check it out it's probably not visible at the moment okay right now uh if we go ahead and check the bottom part down below here there is this search bar and we want to have that as well right so quickly let's go ahead and quickly what we will do is we will say that uh the sidebar button should look like the following all right let's actually add that part in the js file right because we don't actually have it at the moment so let's go back and then when then we will uh carry on from this so what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will have a new div uh inside of here and i can okay i will actually remove that part okay so you guys can actually see more and what we will quickly do is we will wrap this part right so this part is gonna be wrapped into a sidebar top okay so that way we can have everything separately and we can literally go ahead and have uh like style everything individually so it will look super crisp now what next up what we would do is we would say uh the sidebar bottom is going to be right just down below and inside of there what we will have is we will have a sidebar button container and all right let's close that div otherwise it will freak out and what we would do is we will again add the new item which is going to be another uh search logo you can go ahead and copy the the exact same code which we used up here on the uh top bar right down there up there which is like not visible at the moment but yeah and we will also have this awesome input type input input field and yeah that's pretty much it so we will say as a placeholder that search to add friends and next up we like we're pretty much done with the structure now what we will say the bottom uh should be uh position fixed bottom is zero head is gonna be four rams and display is gonna be flex and the we will align it to the center like horizontally and vertically like the difference between align items and justify content is align items is horizontally and justify content is vertically only if the uh only if the flex direction is row because when it changes the column which we will do in uh just a sec or we might actually have already done it um then it will flip and the align items is going to be the uh vertical one and justify content is going to be the horizontal one and mohit mathur asks uh i want to learn react js from the start where should i uh where should i learn that literally this chat literally this channel is for you this is the best place for you you can go ahead and check out all the content we put out on a daily basis um through instagram through medium reddit uh we put it out on youtube we go live with projects every single day and we also have an awesome whiteboard webinar down below in the description so let me know guys who is actually gonna be on that webinar like that is some valuable stuff and exactly uh just like jesse joseph says go watch previous stuff yeah exactly nikhil yes i do so next up what we will do is let's go back to that screen and let's actually finish up uh styling all that thing so quickly uh the bottom container should have a background color of this gray width of a 90 percent display flex and display flags a head of 2.5 ram border radius of 8 pixels align items to center padding left 10 pixels and padding right 5 pixels now that will actually hey and let me just quickly stop just a sec so see imran first of all thank you so much for that lovely donation we really really appreciate all of these tiny bits uh so thank you so much this means a lot to the channel and us and let me quickly go ahead and answer your questions uh vs code versus dream v waiver where's the sublime which is the best honestly i'm gonna be on like i'm gonna be super honest with everybody i'm using vs code uh but i don't like microsoft products i'll be straightforward i've been trying to change this and like use webstorm dreamweaver all that all that stuff like i've been going through google a lot of times but i couldn't find any which would have all the uh extensions and all that stuff that would actually make the um make the text editor super powerful so i personally tried it a lot of times i'm still doing it i'm trying to change from vs code and move to another platform but i can't vs code has so much community and extensions and all that that you just can't give it up right that's pretty much it yeah vs code that's it oh shout out to devin he was uh he had an interview with google right next up let's carry on and smash the like button if you're ready to continue and if you're ready to add all the core stuff in the middle because guys we are i'm telling you it's not visible but we are at 70 percent progress so bear with me this is gonna be an epic build all right let's keep going uh yeah now with that there is one more thing we need to add is that we need to uh yeah exactly uh so yeah what we will quickly do is add the uh this and we will say that inside of the bottom uh we will have the div and the input and the background color should be transparent the border should be none outline is none font size large and width of a hundred percent margin left is 10 pixels and that will pretty much make our uh our search bar down here look super crisp now it might actually not look like that but trust me when we extend this whole thing this is gonna be epic all right so with that said let's actually carry on so what we will quickly do is uh we will get we will go ahead and build the body part right so what i call body is pretty much this centerpiece the main part uh boom so this part let me quickly highlight it so this part this is what i call body now let's actually uh take a look at what is built up so we have this streaming area where all the streams and stuff like that goes we also have this details and recents part and actually if we take a look at it like there is this part which is like a margin or something inside of here we have this top part right then we also have this uh navigation area we also have these videos and all that and down below uh we have this category stuff okay so it's just a quick outline of how like uh to show you guys how we are actually gonna be outlining uh this main part and we are so close to the end guys stick with me and we are gonna be finishing it up real soon and this is gonna be epic now what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will say that we are gonna have to have a body.js let's go ahead and add that file so we will say body dot js add the rafc snippet which we are already used to and what we will quickly say is let's actually change the normal div to a class div and we will say the class name is going to be body and inside of there we will have a body left which is because of the bam naming convention as far as i know we shouldn't use underscores instead we will use dashes so we will say body left and we will say a bodywrite placeholder which is pretty much just going to go ahead and keep everything like a bit away from the right hand side of the uh of the screen so this will add that nice little margin on the right side okay next up uh inside of there we will actually have two pieces of uh what's that called uh don't remember the name components yeah that's it we will have a streaming which is going to be up top and the other one is going to be the profile all right and guys we are only 190 people smash the like button so we can get this video out there to as many people as possible and let's actually carry on so next up what we will quickly say is before we mess anything up let's go to app.css and add something that we will uh we will not regret so inside of app.css let's just add the uh um actually let me let me quickly check how we build this up so we just want to add the app to be display flex uh like this so that will uh either like this so that will go ahead and actually flex out uh all the stuff that we have um this is not how i was planning it all right so quickly uh just let let's quickly fix that and let's actually add the add something called app.main instead of uh app and what we will quickly do in order to fix that is uh we will go back to app.css and we will wrap the sidebar right so app underscore underscore main over here and what we will do in here is under sidebar we will add the body and that will pretty much go ahead imported just with that row so actually intellisense imported it for me so i don't have to worry about that and yeah we just have a display flex going on so we will we should be good to go very very soon now inside of body we will have two pieces of components one is gonna be stream which is gonna be up top and the other one is gonna be down below which is gonna be the profile so let's actually go ahead and build the profile first um because that is like above the stream like that's the juicy part i want to keep it till the end so guys you are should be engaged i see a lot of comments coming and going that's super awesome and smash the like button if you find this video helpful and if you like this video we are at 300 likes so that's super awesome and let's continue so what we would do is uh let's actually create a profile.css file um now profile.js and the profile.css as well at the same time so what we will quickly do is let's go ahead and inside of there inside of there uh quickly add the snippet which we are used to and which is super awesome and saves us tons of tons of time and we also want to go ahead and import the css right after it otherwise you will forget it and quickly let's just add the class name to the div which is going to be profile and the top like we actually divide this thing up to bits and pieces so it will be super easy now uh we have a profile top left which is gonna be uh the icon and all that uh then we will have like details in there uh like this part is what i'm talking about right so we will have the top top left and we will also have the top right over here like top right that's it um uh and we will also have some kind of profile menu which is gonna be this part so yeah let's actually go ahead and build this thing up and then uh i'll show you guys what is what now let's add the top part which is going to be a nice div and inside of there we will have an image which is going to be the literally the same clever programmer logo as we had already uh on the right hand side uh now i i'm wondering if we have imported it in body.js but no we haven't so let's actually do that quickly yeah there we go and now we should be able to see the look there we go so guys this is actually the logo that we added in profile and what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will say inside of there we will actually add those details that we had okay so these are going to be the channel details right so what we will quickly go ahead and do is add a div uh profile top left details and the name is gonna be clever programmer and we have 820k followers or subscribers on youtube and guys we appreciate each and everybody of you each and every one of you who have subscribed to our channel and gave us the privilege uh to teach you guys programming which is super phenomenal and yeah so that let's actually continue and let's actually add an other div which is going to be the top right so top right is going to have three of these icons and those are gonna be pretty much responsible for adding uh all those stuff uh and at the moment we are not able to see it for some reason it is somewhere around here as soon as we uh as soon as we style this whole thing up oh yeah we don't see it because it's white background and we have uh and we have every color set to white so we are not going to be able to see it as soon as we will uh style this we will see everything just super crisp okay uh yeah um let me quickly check on the comments and awesome okay we see authorities going okay some perfect so quickly what we would do next up is we will have a uh okay that's actually an awesome question could i learn react if i have little knowledges in javascript a hundred percent like literally go ahead follow all these lives that we are doing up here and that will actually give you super super much value so that's actually our goal with these that we are just giving giving giving you guys a ton of value so you can go ahead get a job as a developer in 2020 that's literally our goal to help 5 000 people get jobs as developers and we also have a freelance movement guys so that's actually something super cool we've never uh we have we haven't done it before but that actually means that all together as the clever programmer community we want to collect 10 000 which means if you you get uh get a freelance gig as a developer and you earn some money go to my instagram over here and in my bio there is a link where you can go ahead submit your name so i mean your email address some proof that you actually earned the money and how much you earned and if collectively we all earn ten thousand dollars that will make clever programmers dream come true and that would be like out of this world we have never seen anything like this before and this is actually what makes clever programmers stand out and us stand out as a community that we go ahead and we change the world together so let's actually smash the like button if you're ready to take part in the freelance movement and if you're ready to submit whatever you have and smash the like button to get this video out there and show it to everybody let's carry on now what we will quickly do yeah there we go so let's actually carry on and next up what we will do is we will have the profile menu right so that's gonna be all the navigation stuff and all that uh but what we would do is we will add a couple of stuff in there and because like the first one is going to be the active one so we want to have it purple and we want to add that nice little uh button border so we want to go ahead and do that and what if i move myself here so guys you can actually see a bit more of what i'm showing and made myself a bit smaller right so what we would quickly go ahead and do is add all these stuff inside of there so we have a h2 which has a class name of active that's gonna be the home which is gonna be the purple one and we also have an about a schedule of videos and we will also have that nice little uh arrow like literally that one like this one and we also have the chat right there so we want to let's let's go ahead and have them over there and we will quickly uh style everything up until this point so uh what we will do hey thank you so much for the gold material thank you so much for being here we really appreciate you um is there a discord i mean if you mean is if there is a discord clone yes check out this uh channel and yes there is and yeah let's carry on so what we will do is we will uh go ahead and set the profile color to this background okay so now we can actually see all the text that we were talking about it's still like not everything is aligned perfectly we will sort everything out so on the profile top we want everything to be display flex and align everything to the center we will also have the top left which is going to be a display flex align items to center and the flex of one we also will have a profile uh left image that's literally the logo that we have right over here so that oh yeah that thing let's just snap in so we want to have the objects that contain which means that we will keep the aspect ratio we want to set the height of 100 pixels a margin of 40 pixels a border of 2 pixels solid and this uh grayish thing so that actually makes the whole thing like stand out and like look super crisp like if you can actually see the normal normal uh profile picture has that as well so with that uh yeah and we will also have border radius of 50 50 that means the whole thing is going to be cropped to a circle and the padding is going to be uh three pixels now uh what we will go ahead and continue with um okay what we will go ahead and continue with is going to be the uh profile top right and we will actually go ahead and add a font size of 30 pixels we will also add uh for every single icon a 10 pixel margin 10 pixel padding 8 pixels border radius a width of 40 pixels and a center center alignment and what we also want to do is one of them should actually have like like like uh like this is this is a different channel uh for clever programmers we don't have the subscribe thing so we want the that one that one uh to have a great gray background but not this one so what we would do is we will actually add another uh another class name like literally this too the hard one and the bell one should have a gray background uh display but not the not that one so that will actually for that we will add a gray background like literally that's what it does we will just go ahead add it and yeah let's actually check out how we are doing so that is actually super super clean like check this out how awesome it looks okay and we will also add the profile menu right so it will have a display flex a margin of 40 pixels a margin top of 30 pixels a margin bottom of 55 pixels and we will also have uh for every h2 we want to we want to add a margin right of 15 pixels cursor pointer and we want to do the exact same thing to the uh to the uh arrow which actually needs to be a bit turned away right so you saw that you saw that if i go ahead comment this out the rotation it it goes all the way up but if i go ahead on command boom there we go so that is it let's actually see what do we what do we have over here um we've got express.js live sessions from david yes my man you got it we will do i'm actually researching a lot of the topics which are super backendish so drop me a message over here if you have any requests that you want to see over here on clever programmers youtube channel and we will actually make that happen uh how do i calculate the css uh like okay okay sure actually we would do sessions on twitch on cleverprogrammers twitch like head over there uh and like we will show you i personally will go live there and show you guys how i prepare all these clones so if you have a request what app do you want to build drop me a message and actually follow me on cleverprogrammers twitch channel on how i actually build it from scratch without knowing anything about the whole build like literally we will be sitting there for five six seven eight whatever hours and we will be there and we will build it from scratch googling and all the heavy stuff like here we are prepared we want to give you guys the most value in the shorter amount of time but on twitch you will actually be able to see behind the scenes on how we prepare for these lives stay tuned for that and yeah okay passport and json web token drop me a message okay so let's continue with that and all right so that's super awesome it actually looks cool but one thing though we want to add the first one to be like purple right so we want to have that and we would just do this because remember over here we added a class name of active so that should go ahead and add this nice purple look and this uh purple uh underline okay now what we will do is uh we will say we will go ahead and we will carry on from here now next up well we will quickly go ahead and do is actually we want to go ahead and style the body for a sec so let's go to body dot css so what we will quickly go ahead and do is inside of body.js we don't even have it imported so i don't think we actually created that either so let's actually add that over here and before it freaks out at the body the css okay it was faster and what i would do is uh pretty much go ahead and say like okay actually there is a quick link because this is going to be a long long svg file the background that clever programmer has actually is super dope super crisp but it actually is like a super long svg file uh which we are not going to be worrying about so to help you guys on that i have a link uh this one so what we would do here is everybody goes ahead goes over here and grab this code grabs this code and just pastes it like like this is literally the svg file okay so i i don't want this to be like typed down but i want you guys to have it now one thing though please please please just copy this code and don't edit because it can be edited by anybody and you don't want to do that okay so i would just go ahead drop this uh link to the uh chat and let everybody go there and copy that code and we will use that inside of body dot css that's something that i don't prefer doing but in this case we had no other choice so what we will quickly go ahead and do is inside of the body you have this first two lines which you go ahead and copy we will also add a flex of one and we will say display facts a height of a hundred view height and the scroll and an overflow scroll and that will my friends go ahead and add this nice awesome looking um background right so that's pretty much how we actually built this and it's still freaking something out so let's actually go ahead go into debug mode and let's find it out why the css is breaking on the sidebar okay with that said uh let me show yeah so what is happening over there is should be uh we should have a sidebar that's cs yeah uh so inside of sideboard.css boom uh let me actually full screen it so see if it only breaks when it's oh yeah okay okay actually it looks cool okay actually it looks looks nice nice this way so it should be working if you are uh on full screen and it only breaks when you're like shrinking it down okay now with that we have this nice awesome looking uh awesome looking background and all that stuff so let's get go ahead carry on uh uh let's see in the chat yeah uh um literally get better at swift like like apple is only for swift okay uh let's go ahead and continue i mean might as well drop some stuff who knows okay uh so with that let's actually go ahead and carry on adding stuff to the profile because that is like mainly the main part so what we will quickly go ahead and do uh go back to not sidebar where where's the file yeah profile and and down here uh what we will quickly go ahead and do is add an other one another div which is going to be profile.recent and we will also have a h2 in there which will say recent broadcasts right so that's literally how the actual twitch looks like okay so this is the part that we are building at the moment this part and we will just add a couple of youtube videos from cleverprogrammer that we actually highly highly recommend you guys go ahead and watch those so let's actually do this so we will in there we will add uh the items div uh you have a macbook drop it up that's not how it works but i i mean i wish it was all right guys hope you guys are finding this session uh valuable smash the like button if you do and let's go ahead and carry on we will actually go ahead and introduce one more um component in here which is going to be recent item so let's actually add the recent item the js in there and what we will say is we will say rafc e so we can go ahead and take a look at what we are be what we will have in there so first thing first what we will do is pretty much we will just go ahead and embed youtube videos right so we will go ahead and boom add this in here so we will need to grab the uh url as well as the title and inside of there what we would do is we will have an item div and uh yeah and what we would do in here is uh have an item and all these items should have this uh iframes right so guys this might be a bit too much so let's actually break it down how it actually works so let's go here let's go to youtube and let's actually grab a video like let's go into the cp and what we were quickly gonna do is like let's say uh we have the awesome mirn tutorial what we will do is we will wait a bit until the ad goes away and we will quickly grab the embed code so guys if you don't know this burn tutorial 12 hours this will master you as a mern developer just throwing it out there what you want to grab is the copy embed code you want to go ahead and then uh down you want to say like this and now let's actually make it look pretty and and like handleable so what we would do is we will like break all these lines and then we will uh swap a couple of a couple of these parameters right so this is how you want it to be broken down into uh rows and what you want to do is like delete the source right and you want to just change it to url which we are passing in because we are reusing the same component and we are going to be using this iframe every single time which is going to be reusing with a different url next up um i saw some people use jsx instead of js in the react project what's the reason um they are using previous versions of react i mean this is literally jsx code like people are using the extension jsx but that's that's that's the past this is how create react app generates the react app so that's the easiest way to go about it don't don't mess up with jsx and all that stuff just stick with js super easy and you you just want to work with that okay and the other two thing we will need to change is the width which we want to have like 400 pixels and not more and we also want to set the height of 235 and we will also need to add uh another div which is going to be item details and inside of there uh what we will do is just drop it in here oops drop it in here and that will actually the first one is going to be the category image right and on the right hand side we want this to uh appear so we want to have the title passed in and we want to have the channel name and all right so let's actually go ahead and because we have the recent item.js file done so guys if you're new to this stream and don't know what is going on and why do i have so much code on my screen there is actually two more videos just before this one which uh for some reason got disconnected so yeah uh oh yeah community uh what do you think about php just uh set it it's too old no don't do it don't do it okay uh let's go ahead and actually style the recent item and make it look super nice so let's actually add the uh importation first and then add the actual file right so quickly let's go ahead and copy this and let's go back and add the new file which we will call recent item dot css and inside of there what we will do is we will go ahead uh we will go ahead and say so item is going to have a display flex a flex direction of column width of 1400 pixels overflow is going to be hidden uh white space is going to be no wrap what mean what uh when which means that the actual title is going to be one row and that's it and the margin right is going to be 20 pixels right so we are why is it not working because i think we haven't actually even imported it so i'm just going to go ahead and chuck this into profile.js like just this one which is this one uh which is the marin stack tutorial and recent item is not defined so what we will quickly go ahead and do is say recent item and just import it just like that and yeah that's pretty much how it will work and because it's still um not styled correctly that's how we uh that's why it's super ugly so actually if you guys go down here you see that the title is only in one row and it actually is snapped at the end that's what uh those couple of lines were responsible for in a recent item.css so um yeah i saw actually a question regarding uh what what about the time need for js to rock actually as much as possible and as much as you can put in the shorter the time frame is going to is going to be like literally you can go ahead and master javascript in a couple of months okay just keep keep consistent and keep uh rocking please start express live session soon honestly with all the marin sessions we will uh we were doing express but i'm actually planning on like backend specific node.js and express specific uh content as well and i'm actually planning to change mongodb a bit not just firebase not just mongodb but one more let's keep that as a surprise okay uh there we go let's actually continue where we left off we are 100 people strong that is awesome smash the like button if you're ready to rock and continue so uh with that uh inside of recent items with css two more things we will need to add one of them being the item details and the display and it's going to be display flex and the other one is going to be margin top is going to be 25 pixels and the other thing is going to be item details and inside of that the image needs to be an object fit contain that is actually going to be like making small the category image so we would just want to keep the aspect ratio as much as possible we want to set the head of 60 pixels and we want to go ahead and say the uh of course i can of course i remember everybody so we want to set the margin right to 10 pixels and that will pretty much make the whole thing look super super nice right so this is how we look like right now and it actually is like pretty crisp now we actually want to go ahead and add a couple more of these videos and literally you can go ahead and grab any uh youtube videos as long as it is from this channel right i just want to keep it that way now yeah so you just want to go ahead and do this a couple more times two things you need to pass in one of them being the url and the other one is going to be the title you can literally go ahead go to clever youtube channel and grab any of those videos that you want like literally grab any of them and then just copy the link up above here and the title as well and you should be good to go now with that said we now have all of these videos so we have the mern stack we have how to make money as a developer we have alexa skills because we cover that here too and we just we have a react 2.0 by papa react who is now uncle react okay with that done let's actually add two more like one more div and that is going to be the categories which is uh going to be this part but for clever programmer it is only one because we are only uh doing science stuff right so what we will do is uh add this new uh div inside of here and inside of there what we want to do is add a new h2 which will be clever programmers recently streamed categories uh just like over here and we wanna in there we wanna have the static image and we want to have the image be like the following which is literally the exact same image that we used uh where over here uh and that's just the science and technology uh image from twitch you can go ahead register a free account copy and grab the image address and that will be it uh and also another thing you will do is get this do you have a cs degree or any similar education is it this all selftaught a hundred percent selftaught literally like nothing comes from the cs uh studies i'm actually studying cs but it's not adding up on up above on it anything okay so as uh in the h3 we will say science and technology and that will be uh appearing right there um so that's it and let's actually continue uh styling the profile right so we are at the uh at the port where it kind of looks nice but still can be improved on so we have the profile menu active as the last one and under that we want to have uh the reasons to be styled of course when we will just make every single piece to have a margin left of 40 pixels we will also add the whole recent items display flex actually let's make it like this and we will also add the profile categories uh to be a margin to have a margin top of 40 pixels and inside of there all the h2 needs to be 20 pixel and the categories and inside of that h3 is going to be a margin top of 20 it's going to have a margin top of 10 pixels which will pretty much like make the whole thing look super cool super nice and yeah oops hold on a sec that's it now with that done what we will pretty much go ahead and do is uh yeah that's it okay well we'll pretty much go ahead and do is we want to have uh yeah let's continue by adding some right border for the whole thing and let's continue there okay i don't want to be how should i proceed uh first thing first stay on these lives like that's step number one check out the webinar down below in the description you don't want to miss that out and then you can have like more and more stuff going on okay just check out that webinar that's gonna be awesome okay and also take part in the freelance movement of november by clever programmer and just submit your stuff whatever you earn through this instagram and in the bio i have a link where you can go ahead and cut and paste and submit whatever you made throughout the movement okay uh with that uh we should be good to continue right uh so one thing i want to do is go back to uh body.js and we actually want to have a body css set up which i think we have done let me quickly catch up where we left off yeah so we want to have the body left to only take up 96 percent 96.5 if you want to be super precise so you want to uh only take this part to uh to take up 96 and why is it not working um okay let's refresh it a couple okay now we should be good okay so now you see that there is this nice little uh uh outer space now above this we want to actually have a streaming area where we will go ahead and add all the streaming stuff including a live streaming iframe so stay tuned for that we this application is actually going to be able to receive streaming from any kind of streaming app such as the one that i'm using over here or any other one all right with that uh let's actually go back to body the js that's right and what we want to go ahead and do there is import something which we haven't created yet and that being this stream uh which is going to be another component and guys we are very very close and i mean we are very very close to uh to finishing this up uh so yeah uh we want to add a new stream.js file dot js file and that will that's what we will be using right now so inside of here what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will have a div which will be stream yep and inside and also inside of there we will have a bunch of uh divs but the reason being is that we want to make it like uh look super cool so this is this is going to be the left part and there is a div which i haven't closed still one more yeah so the reason being for all this uh hassle um happening is that we want to have like two different pieces going on one of them being this one and the other one is the actual streaming iframe right we're going to have two pieces over here and we want to build this thing up as well so uh next up what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will add the streaming video embed part uh where we will embed all the videos that we want to go ahead and stream out so let's actually add another iframe uh which we will go ahead and be okay and um okay i still need to close a couple of divs there we go nice so i think i put it the wrong place by the way yeah uh so stream status stream container yeah just over here it comes here okay so what what is happening here is we have a stream like the whole component right and we also have inside of there we have the full container which we will set the display flex and it will align everything super nicely uh we will also have inside of there we will have a stream status which is going to be this one this part right and uh inside of there we are also ha we also have oh my god i'm not sharing my screen oh my god so um you can see the cool oh my god sorry guys i'm sorry guys okay so now i'm sharing the screen uh yeah usually the chat is over here i should do some yeah rearranging on my setup i guess so what is happening here okay so this is going to be the stream.js file inside of there we have the div which is going to be stream uh inside of the stream container which will wrap all the thing inside of there we have a stream status we also have a stream status container which is gonna be this part right which i was uh trying to show you guys but apparently i wasn't sharing my screen yeah this part and stream status container and that has a top part and an indicator which we are actually pushing in from here yeah right so we have uh we have an offline indicator because at the moment it is going to be offline uh actually what we could do and what you can do but we are like this video is like super long and taking super long to uh finish up we're not gonna worry about that but you can go ahead and like check if there is uh check if there is going to be a stream going on at the moment and then you can update it and like say it is online and then you can go ahead and say uh check out the below streams from cover programmer inside of h2 and then you want to also add the stream info uh which is going to be uh a bell icon and you will be notified when cloud programmer is live next up you also want to have this uh video embed div inside of there you want to have an iframe which is uh 500 pixel wide and 297 295 tall and the source is going to be whichever video you want to go ahead and add and today i am adding this build over here which actually ended which was the first one but it is what it is i mean we can literally go ahead and change it um so yeah uh copy with yeah that will be pretty much uh it and you need to add the word embed over here you can go ahead and check out the documentation the full documentation of the streaming api of youtube and you can literally go ahead and create your own uh streaming api however uh today we're not gonna be covering that because it would be just uh super it would take super super long so instead of that uh we are gonna be doing this uh yeah let's break all the lines nicely and here we go and what we will say is we're gonna have a 502 295 boom and we should have it loading over here there we go so we have this actually it's going to be live so right now it says it's live and i'm right over there so this is actually already receiving the streaming uh functionality so smash the like button if you like that and we can actually take it to the next level in another session but this is just getting too long so yeah uh what we will quickly go ahead and do is we will go ahead and style the stream and then we will wrap this session up because it's already super long and in three pieces so we will say stream.css and we will need to rename that because i messed up the naming rename there we go uh i'm on javascript still learning that is awesome have you tried using prettier auto format yeah actually most of the guys like sunny cosby knows everybody uses prettier i just uh prefer the builtin uh thing and i'm i'm just getting pretty much used to that i'll actually once i have time i will set it up and it will be i will be using that too so i highly highly recommend everybody goes ahead and downloads prettier it's an awesome tool i just need to need time to set it up okay uh boom yeah so next up what we will quickly go ahead and do is style the full stream and because we have this class over here we will just say head of uh 50 display grid and place everything to the center uh the stream container is going to be display flex the streaming status is going to be 400 pixel wide and 295 tall background is going to be that blackish grayish color and we will have a margin right of 30 pixels we will also add the status container uh to have a 25 pixel display flex flex direction of a column and a 245 tall now we will also do a stream status indicator um which is going to be white i mean the background color and we will literally like sweep the color uh swap the colors uh so that the color is going to be the grayish blackish thing border radius of 8 pixels uh it's going it's going to be fit content uh width and the padding is going to be 5 pixels and 10 pixels which means 5 up and uh five up and below like above and below and ten on the right and left i think maybe it's the other way around i'm not sure i i think that that's what happens uh that's fine i'm just dr murray not papa react so we will say uh the stream status container is going the top is going to have a flex of one we will also have a stream status info which is going to have a display flex and align and we will align the items to the center and we will also go ahead and say the stream status info and inside of that the icon needs to be 20 pixels and we will also have a stream status and inside of the uh the two divs we have a h2 which will be 35 pixels uh this is keep going this top we are doing this we are always doing this so stay tuned we have huge huge bills coming up your way so yeah stay tuned for those uh yeah literally all the videos that say burn and especially the first one where we did the full uh four hour builds so i was actually trying to simplify everything and build the back end like very short time but let's go ahead and check out the whatsapp clone the mern whatsapp clone we build a full marin suck app okay just uh yeah and also by the way the full 12 hour martin stack tutorial that is something that you want to check out that's that's an awesome thing okay uh 5x top and 10 pixels left and right it's correct thank you so much for uh correcting me uh yeah and we will actually add two more things which is going to be the stream video which is going to be 295 high and 500 wide as well as the video embed and my friends we should be done and it should look super crisp uh one thing we actually should import this file to the stream.js um which i think we forgot about so let's actually do that yes we did and boom it should look super crisp this is now receiving the full streaming uh what what i'm doing at the moment from this computer it is actually happening live over there so guys this is literally the exact same build that i was showing you at the beginning in the first video and guys you can go ahead and check out uh yourself how to actually create a new stream using the api and i am sure that we will cover it very very soon we will have more and more of these realtime realtime stuff coming your way so stay tuned for that and if you actually want to go ahead and master your javascript your react uh your uh yeah your react your node your express and all the javascript related skills there is an awesome free webinar down below uh in the description go ahead check that thing out you know you're not gonna regret it and with that said uh let me know if you guys have any questions i will be taking a couple and answer those and if we are done then we will wrap it up just where we are and we actually made a super super awesome twitch clone that we can go ahead and put on our resumes so with that uh yeah so with that i think i'm not receiving any questions so with that said guys thank you so much for being here thank you so much for tuning in three times today due to the technical issues and uh thank you so much for staying here smashing the like button and let me know guys who was excited and who's ready to put this build on their tutorial uh on their portfolio and smash the like button and with that thank you so much for being here this is david from cleverprogrammer and we i'll see you in the next video peace guys thank you so much uh oh
