hammer.com and today i want to talk about a few things you might need to give up if you want to get that job as a developer okay and specifically i have four things that i want to share with you today that i think you should consider giving up if you want to make that a reality for yourself otherwise you might be stuck in that place where you can't make progress in coding and you're stuck you can't build projects on your own and you're unable to get a job you're unable to get that interview and uh really you're not happy with where you might want to be okay if any of those things resonate with you then in today's video and today being on this live session with you guys i want to engage with you a lot on the chat as well and i'll do a q a more so at the end i want to address all of those things for you cool with that said what i want you to do right now is click the button below and smash that like button it helps this video go out everywhere and let's just get straight into it cool so thing number one that i want you guys to focus on is let's talk about this all right this is thing number one this is the first thing i want you to look into giving up because if you don't you're going to be stuck here for ever okay my i tell my i talk to my friends and jokingly i say tutorial hell is a place where bad developers go after they die so you don't want to be stuck in tutorial hell you're not going to make progress and you're going to be very upset with how you're moving forward so um for those of you who know what i'm talking about let me know in the comments below if you suffer from tutorial hell or you experience it in your life um and i would love to start bringing that up too actually i want to make it a little bit more engaging and have you guys involved in the process so do let me know let me see if i can bring up comments here hey what's up mile mile says hello oh this is huge let me make that a little bit smaller what is up mile how are you doing my friend great to have you here we have light i'm looking for remote jobs for freelancing great stay tuned because i'm going to provide you guys with a lot of information if people from cameroon welcome mile is from bosnia hey how's it going awesome cool so let's jump into it so let's talk about this okay tutorial hell a lot of you are stuck in it if you're stuck in it and not making progress let me know in the comments below because i want to see that from you i want to see which ones of you feel like that right and this is where really you're just going in circles and watching content right you're watching one video here one video here learning something watching a tutorial here boom boom and you're just repeating yourself again and again and it's this cycle of death right we have a lot of people who are uh resonate this is resonating with i can see that in the chat uh tutorial rakshi that's what you mean by tutorial help what that basically means is you're watching tutorial after tutorial on javascript on python on you know c plus plus on react but you're not really making your own projects you're not really making your own um coding you know you're not solving your own problems and you're just kind of lulled into this false sense of you feeling like you're good you know i joke about this and i go i play chess a lot and whenever i watch the number one chess player in the world magnus carlson play i go man i can play just like that too when i'm watching him you know i'm like man now you know these moves look so simple it makes so much sense and then when i go to play those same moves guess what happens i get my butt handed to me i lose and i go wait i'm not magnus carlson okay cool let me keep working at this so this might happen to you where you're watching maybe me coding some other developer coding online on youtube and you go wow they make it look so easy i can do this this is so easy then you go and do it and it doesn't feel like that okay let me see here yep mario says i am in tutorial hell from udemy but it's because i don't know enough to build something with python can you tell me what do i need to do okay orion says yes i'm stuck at this hell mile says you're right qazi and uh we have another mario here hi nice to meet you because i'm watching it from udemy and it's because i don't know enough to build something with python all right and i love python and data science so let's just say you love python okay you could love javascript you could love whatever let's talk about why this is happening to you and why you feel like you're not making progress so let's go through mario's situation right now okay so let's go through mario's situation is there a way i can uh is there an easy way to cut all this boom boom boom boom boom okay so we have mario here okay and instead of just going in the straight line where he's making progress what's happening with mario right let's say he's a complete beginner right now i'm just gonna put a b or like let's just say level zero and he wants to get to level ten and he wants to make this progress happen well he's gonna be instead of going in this straight path what's happening with mario right now is going oh i'm gonna watch this tutorial then i'm gonna watch this one oh this is great boom this is good this is good this is good and when you connect all these dots it's basically this weird zigzag crap happening here okay and he's actually not making forward progress but it feels like progress so it's fun it feels great but it's he's really just connecting the dots in these really interesting ways okay and that's what we call tutorial hell now mario do you want to know how do you how you get out of that tutorial hell would you like to know that says this is interesting i want to address this and he says i got my first react dev internship because of your channel and building your projects quasi i've learned many things from your channel like approaching towards building projects thanks a lot a lot and the team you're very welcome and that makes me feel really really happy to hear that so thank you for sharing that that is huge let's give it up for uh anto in the chat guys yo let's go that is freaking awesome wow that is brilliant so going back to that right uh mark's point is if he wants to make that progress what he has to do is go through something that feels like no progress and feels like a lot of pain but he actually needs to code himself okay meaning that even if it feels painful for you right now that you actually need to code and you actually um question if any of you want to jump on the live with me i would love to do that but only if you post an uh intelligent uh question in here or a challenging question and if you post it in the chat below we'll bring you on the live with me okay so if any of you guys could maybe help do that that'd be amazing maybe get maybe get a message in community or something and then uh i can just send them the link for ecam like yes link and then they can jump on so i'd love to chat with you and see where you guys are stuck so then i can help out okay what to code a new pump says i'm working in android for five to six months and a bit on firebase what to do next for database and backend without firebase i don't actually know anything about backend please help so again watch our channel that's going to give you a lot of insight on back end okay cool so going back to that make sure that you are actually coding yourself that's going to be a very important thing and the problem with coding yourself is it feels like you're making no progress okay but what's happening is you're making this tiny bit of progress which is really hard to see because you're like man i'm not a 10 yet oh man i can't code like qazi yet or man i can't code like you know uh traversing media yet you know you some of you guys shout out to traversing media you guys might watch his content he has great content and you might be like man i can't code like that yet but really when you look at it you're making progress but it feels boring it feels like you're not going anywhere so one of the things i always say is how many hours are you doing coding not how many hours are you following a tutorial how many hours are you coding and that also means you looking up things online so how many hours are you coding and then googling answers to solve your problems to get in the way maybe you're like hey i'm gonna make a tictactoe game today with python or maybe you're like hey i want to make something simple with python how many hours are you spending researching how many hours are you spending thinking about it maybe you can even have a coach that can like coach you and guide you along the way where they're letting you do most of the thinking so for example think about it like this okay when you go to the gym and you have a coach at the gym and this spot you or a friend at the gym and you can't lift that weight up and they just give you that little spot let me ask you this did they lift the entire weight for you no did they do everything for you no who did most of the work you they just came in and gave you that little extra push that's what you want to replicate in the world of software development and coding when you are just following a tutorial it's almost like thinking that you're getting if your coach lifts for you you're gonna get jacked that's not gonna happen okay so where it's gonna be the best is if your brain gets that time under tension which feels like a lot of pain so if you have a coach there working with you and i'd love to work with some of you guys online like maybe some of you guys are struggling and one of the things guys i would love to do is bring somebody on and maybe even work with them live on coding skills or just you know just connecting with you and seeing where i can help you okay karen asks hey you you say to practice and code but i'm always in a dilemma about what to code and what to practice so that's a great uh question so i think kiran think about like for example what type of apps do you like what what type of things do you like right so for example you might be you might think hey man let me go on to um let me let me pop this up okay here's what i recommend find inspiration somewhere so you might go hey let me actually go to dribble.com okay and uh look at inspirations here what should i code today so again some of this might be outside of your league as in it might be too difficult okay fine but find things you might be able to do okay so for example you could look up like beginner coding projects for javascript so let's actually look at this this is great all right and let's click on 17 javascript projects for beginners to perfect your coding all right and now i would go from here vanilla javascript stopwatch so do we have an example of it all right try to code this yourself you might be like i can't code the whole thing okay okay okay okay fine fine fine but can you write the word stopwatch at the top can you do that can you write i think that would be cool even if i try to code these with you guys you know at some point it could be cool but can you write the word stopwatch at the top you know in your in your javascript app cool can you write the words vanilla javascript stopwatch cool can you write that zero zero colon zero zero cool can you make this button right there where it says start and maybe let me zoom in so you guys can see it more clearly okay now that button button start my what's the color why can't well how come i can see through that oh how do you make a seethrough button color oh that might be called transparent right seethrough button color okay let's go here seethrough button color let's go right there and we we got transparent okay let's zoom in on to that boom all right there we go we got transparent right here that's the background color ah okay that's how i get this stop reset great you've made great progress so far now you might want to add functionality to it so when i hit start the second start counting oh how do i do that look that up right how do i change my page based on clicking a button oh there's something called javascript button events ooh there's something called event listeners what the heck is event listeners then study that then come back to your app and make that happen then go back to that tutorial and make that happen guys make your training specific if you want to get good let me put it like this if um if lebron james wants to get good at shooting three pointers let me guy let me give you guys um choices should he a be focusing on doing yoga slash meditating b um let's see b would be doing juggling on a unicycle okay and c practicing shooting hoops which one would help lebron james get better at shooting three pointers would it be a would it be b or would it be c which one love it okay so we're getting c c we're getting a bunch of people saying c cool so if that's c right then basically what that means is start shooting more all right for you what would that mean as a coder more uh coding okay and what i mean by this is it's called there's something called gpp right general performance something and then there's spp in in in training your physical body okay so i think that the best benefits that are going to come to you are going to be from specific training yes certain amount of general training will be good certain amount of meditation will help you certain amount of sleep will certainly help you but if you want to get better at shooting hoops you need to train in a specific way where you guys go wrong where you fall into tutorial hell is because you start run learning all kinds of general concepts without a very specific goal so your training should follow from your project so let's say mark was working on this stopwatch project he gets stuck on event listeners then or karen gets stuck on event listeners then karen goes on udemy or on youtube and then karen types in event listeners and watches that tutorial and as soon as he got his breakthrough from that tutorial he gets back and he coats that part in because if kieran doesn't do that he will never get better at coding does that make sense cool so that's why that's really really important okay so you want to have specific training the more specific it is the more benefit you're going to get out of it this is just true in all sports everywhere right and you should look at coding really like a sport it's no different than a sport so you know if you're training for olympic weightlifting if you're training for squatting if you're training if lance armstrong is take a training for a bicycling event if you're training for a triathlon or a marathon whatever it is how you're going to get your mile times down is by running more miles how you're going to get your swimming time down is by doing more laps so same thing here and then keep minimize the time between learning and coding and keep coding as much as you possibly can okay and pick beginner projects that you can do okay let me then work on this project ah next up i'm gonna work on a calculator okay then let me work on a drum kit all right so these are example projects for you to go through work on and add to um you know okay what's a palindrome how can i make a palindrome cool all right you can also go and look into like javascript algorithm problems let's go beginner algor uh beginner coding exercises okay so coding exercise is another great way to go and improve so let's go here boom you have javascript exercises this is another way for you to get a lot better at coding okay so javascript basic 150 exercises with the solution okay so what's the first exercise write a program to display the current day and time in the following format today is tuesday current time is 10 30 38 pm okay so how would you actually write that out you can go to the editor and they even allow you to code right here cool go right here and code but the more you practice more time spent here the better you will get but if you're spending just more time learning for the sake of learning you're going to have a lot of trouble right so for some of you you're struggling with functions right even some of you in our full stack mastery bootcamp you're struggling with functions and things like that so look that up hey how do i freaking improve you know how do i improve functions do more exercises that require you to use a function write a javascript function checks whether it's past string is a palindrome or not write a javascript function that generates all combinations of a string write a javascript function that returns a path string with letters in alphabetical order okay and start going through them oh how can i turn this phrase into the quick brown fox you might learn how to use the dot two uppercase and javascript oh cool i can do that great okay let's see how do you deal with selfdoubt as a beginner love from switzerland that is an awesome question i'll actually address this in my bonus um i have four points for you guys four things i need you to give up but this is going to be a bonus fifth one that i'll share with you guys afterwards um okay so let's see sharing of the link let me see how i can do that copy hello okay cool so um yeah we're sharing a link meaning somebody might be able to jump on with us okay so yeah we're gonna have one person uh be able to jump on the live with me and have an interview and either maybe i might be able to put you in a coding hot seat so we're coding together or i might just have a conversation with you but we're only going to bring on one person so if you want to do that then look at the youtube chat and there might be a way for you to get into it okay so my team is going to be writing from the clever programmer channel so look out for what they're saying and follow those instructions but anyways that's really how you get past the tutorial health phase okay tutorial health phase you can overcome that by doing specific training all right and with that you can actually defeat this cool uh there's a lot more that i can get into in this but i think for now i'm gonna leave the tutorial held part of that hopefully you guys got a ton of value out of it okay so they just dropped um they're dropping the thing so if you send a message to that you're gonna be able to um yeah just text us at that number okay it's in the zoom chat or in the youtube chat my bad i'll write that number right here as well eight eight one seven that's it okay so that's the number uh shoot us a text here maybe hashtag interview or something like that right or hashtag um yeah hashtag yt interview uh that would tell me you're coming from youtube and you want to do an interview and then my team will be able to reach out to you and speak with you okay so go ahead and do that cool um number two okay this is the second thing i want to jump into so number two i'm going to talk about this is the next thing you have to give up all right so we're going to talk about this social media and i'll i will call this a dopamine detox okay a higher level term that's going to be dopamine detox all right so some of you might know uh what this means but i'm gonna get into it a little bit what is happening really when you're consuming all this content and you're watching all these tutorials and you're learning from other people and just consuming social media when your consumption is really high you're kind of like this drug addict and it happens to me too all the time and even um last week i had to go to portland with my team because i was performing so poorly that's why you guys didn't see me on youtube my mental game was absolute really really bad really awful okay and i was having trouble just going in a happy way i was like losing my happiness i was losing my focus i was watching chess until like 12 a.m or 1am every day um i was playing chess so much i mean i love chess but like it got too unhealthy amount and if it wasn't chest and i was watching like dragon's den or shark tank and just watching people pitch and i i just became this zombie oh damn i tried so hard to not curse okay i'll keep it going though just one um it doesn't count if it's just um so i became the zombie you know and my performance just went from like this epic performance to just like plateau like uh like freaking zombie you know i don't know if this happens to you guys um just reading the comments right and no no progress every day just plateaued and i was like why is that happening why am i experiencing that and feeling that and what i needed was i needed to actually go away from everything for a little bit so we went to portland with my team and i just had to have fresh perspectives i had to be alone by myself for a little bit too i did a lot of reading and one of the main things i did was like i got away from a lot of dopamine right so when you're consuming social media including when you're watching tutorials you're getting these dopamine hits these spikes and they make you feel really good when you're watching somebody code and do a tutorial you're feeling satisfied you feel happier like you feel like you did it you feel like you learned something and oftentimes it's good sometimes it can be a trap when it's a trap is when your performance against the amount you're learning is disproportionately more learning and a lot less your own improvement okay so let me say that again the only time it's dangerous is when your performance proportionally speaking towards your learning is way lower than the amount that you're learning something weird is happening there okay so let's say you're like learning and going crazy but then this other chart your performance is like going down right this is your learning and this is your performance something something is wrong and that's where tutorial hall is really tutorial hell okay but if your learning is increasing and your performance is increasing and this usually happens when your amount of action is more than the amount you're learning so for example 20 of you should be learning and then 80 should be you applying that learning okay so you you're not doing passive learning anymore passive learning versus active learning okay you're doing active learning and this is really the key the key to getting better at coding and actually making real progress cool um i think when they come into the chat it'll tell me anto says um from your past videos i learned the importance of research reading docs looking for a library which does the work i need people need to know to speak about the importance of this quasi yeah so that research and that reading docs looking for a library that's really important but you just have to make sure you don't get into the passive learning mode of it you're doing the active learning of it meaning you're in your project and then you're reading the docs and then you're applying the things you learn from that doc and then you know you're going to github library getting the code that you need bringing it into your project and then just continuously making progress that's active so as long as you're active in that way that's really really good okay so with dopamine detox what i basically mean is reduce the amount you're consuming down to 20 or less so what does consumption look like when you're scrolling through on your instagram right so let me put this uh scrolling on ig that's consumption okay these are examples of consumption so that might not be adding value to your life okay let me move that here let me move this here so you guys can see it a little bit um okay uh what here's another example of consumption you have uh let's remove this comment so it's less distracting okay scrolling on youtube and just consuming everything consumption okay uh watching tutorials is consumption that can make you feel good and if you're not honest with yourself you're not gonna be making progress and you're gonna be doing a lot more learning than you are doing doing and at that point it is consumption and it is just giving you dopamine hits so what i urge you to do is actually go and challenge yourself and maybe just do a challenge for seven days right for the next seven days starting today can you go and drop your usage of consumption you know drop your usage of just taking in information from outside sources or at least in that brain dead space when you're reading a book you're very actively thinking about something and learning but a lot of this is eating up your time and when that happens you're not ever going to be in a state to want to do active learning you're going to continuously keep doing passive learning okay and we wanna we wanna pull you out of this this is really really bad this is dangerous this is where you're never gonna make any progress cool all right so that's kind of the thing that i wanted to say about this okay this is for you guys number two the dopamine detox okay let's get into number three this is the thing that if you want to get a job as a developer you have to give this up okay these aren't things i'm just telling you that are going to be helpful to you if you're serious about these goals this is just what you have to do don't do them and don't get goals don't do these things and don't get the results and then also don't be surprised for the work that you didn't do to not get the results that you wanted right so like don't let that surprise you um but if you want to achieve these results and you want to get these goals and you want to make it happen this is what you have to do otherwise you're going to be stuck exactly where you're at some of you might be happy being there and that's perfectly fine but for some of you you might want to you know and and why i make this content is for that one percent of you that want to actually make that improvement that will want to actually improve and keep like going to that next level every day okay let's go into number three and this is going to be the shiny i'm going to call it framework syndrome all right and what this applies to is you guys might have heard of shiny object syndrome and what this is is basically there's this weird thing that a lot of developers have including myself it happens to me too is you always want to keep learning either new languages or new frameworks and you kind of want to keep doing that all the time i'm going to learn python i'm gonna learn javascript okay cool so let me try this somebody actually wants to hop on so let's take a look if this is going to work or not yo jay how's it going um hold on i can't hear you for some reason huh why can't i hear jay it's interesting um jay is your mic on jay let me let me try speaking with you afterwards okay maybe we have to figure this out af you know after this call and then we can speak after okay my apologies i'm gonna have to cancel this call actually okay cool so let's go back to this right with shiny framework syndrome a lot of what is happening is you're going from one place to another place and you're learning different languages right so this might be you are picking up react you are picking up um uh redux okay you might be picking up a new language and you're like man i really want to learn you know um how to do headless ui or i want to learn tailwind ooh that's going to be really nice and you keep oh next js framework that is fun so this happens and what's really happening is you just start going in all these places but when it comes to your actual software developer skills and your actual fundamental skills they're not really making any progress so your actual skills are like kind of plateauing or just kind of growing very linearly and then they start growing growing slowly because in the start you were actually focused on just learning javascript or just learning that one thing and then maybe a little bit later why it starts to plateau is now you're just like in between five different frameworks and learning things so you're making very little progress in all those directions okay so i would say this can be a secret killer that's affecting a lot of your guys performance i would recommend to avoid this okay and the way that i would recommend to avoid this is go deep in one language go deep with one framework so for example if you pick react just go deep and start working with react building projects with react and use the css that you're given with the react or use the react css frameworks that it comes with right you could do bootstrap with the react you could do um you could do a material ui with react and a ton of other things use that instead of now starting to figure out how to add tailwind just because tailwind is hot okay but once you get good at react and you're skilled then it's okay to pick this up then it's not that bad but i think just constantly jumping and not making progress that's really where the problems come in cool all right greg greg says my big issue is impostor syndrome so something cool greg uh that i wanted to share with you is um i'm gonna be getting into imposter syndrome as well okay that's gonna be the bonus that i have for you guys and i'm going to be getting into that later i know somebody else brought this up too and i'm going to be talking about that last so i hope this makes sense to you guys shiny framework syndrome let me know if this is actually helpful to you and i think the simple way of avoiding it is to stick with the things that you enjoy and go deep with them and start working with those cool cool all right now let's get into number four and this is gonna sound weird but hear me out on this okay if you wanna get that dream job as a developer here's another thing you have to give up toxic relationships and this will lead me really nicely into my last bonus point where i'm going to be talking about imposter syndrome but guys um it affects a lot of us it's affecting a lot of you and this is a epidemic right this is this existed before the pandemic this is going to exist after this pandemic is over this is there and this will affect you in a lot of real really weird ways and so if you are in a relationship or you love somebody if their family or a partner or spouse it might be really hard to just cut that completely out of your life you know for some of you you might actually need to take a good look at that and go maybe this is bad for me okay and you know when i say toxic relationship it's really like people giving you negativity uh they're giving you uh they're bringing lots of drama okay um they like nothing is ever good enough for them right uh when when you leave after hanging out with them you feel like like crap right whether you're in an interaction or before an uh after interaction right you feel patronized with them when you're speaking with them you feel lower or you might feel inferior they might make you feel inferior right so if some of these if you feel any of these things i don't know who it is for you right for some of you it might be your parents for some of you it might be a friend for some of you it might be a partner and this is what you have to look into and what this basically means is either you give up them completely i'm gonna keep looking at the comments as well hey beck johansson is in the house welcome back nice having you here giving up give up all toxic relationships yes absolutely cool so you might either need to give that up or if it's really hard for you to be able to do that i mean you might just need to do that first of all so give that up okay otherwise you're going to be stuck there forever and nothing in life is worse than this because it will eat away at you permanently but in the case of parents and stuff like that you might not be able to just give that up for the rest of your life right you're bonded by blood so in that case what you might want to do is just reduce the time okay so it might not mean cut that relationship permanently it might mean okay look you're finding yourself spending five hours a week with that person can we do one hour or one and a half hour reduce the amount of time that you're in that energy okay so i think that will help you a lot and if you are a good influence then you might want to spend a lot of time with yourself okay and that's something else to look into as well how do you feel spending time with yourself how do you feel spending time coding by yourself alone you know because if you have trouble sitting alone and sitting by yourself and you can't enjoy your own company how are you going to become a good developer most of your life is going to be you sitting down and coding okay so something to look into but i think toxic relationships reduce them yo what's up miss ma'am let's go wait wrong time wrong sound all right i'll put this let's go hey ah thank you thank you so much for a whopping juicy delicious incredible ten dollar donation uh misk mem says sunglasses perpetually fall onto video game controllers proud face oh that's actually not what you said but you sent a sticker i imagine ah i'm just audibly reading what that sticker is that's funny but yeah thank you for that i really really appreciate it that means a lot i never expect anything from you guys but i do appreciate it thank you thank you so much uh today's coffee is on miss murn you're the man cool um by the way we should have like a membership section that could be really really cool because on youtube you have memberships and we could have like membership members we can bring them on lives and stuff like that you if you want to launch it you can launch it and i can have misc or somebody become a member and we can have like member chat yeah it might be an easy way to do it um i did send a sticker that's f yeah thank you man i really really appreciate that's cool uh so toxic relationships guys get them out of your life cut it or reduce it but make a decision about it now if you stay in it and you're just loathing like you're just simmering it in and you're just taking it all in and not doing anything about it well then unfortunately it's your fault right if you are not reducing the time that you could be reducing here then that's on you so there you might want to take some responsibility but i also understand that a lot of negativity can be really um you know really just screw you over so get rid of it reduce it and you will find you're going to be a lot happier i mean you're a lot happier coding becomes easier sitting by yourself and working on a problem and it's fascinating it's one of the most beautiful things you're like wow this is an amazing problem how am i going to solve this wow reduce with javascript works like this this is amazing javascript functional programming is one of the coolest things ever this is so cool right so those things could be great yo guys actually after this i would like to do like a speed run on free code camp or something for javascript that could be a lot of fun just like going through as fast as possible it could be fun um so cool yep awesome thank you yeah miss says um you guys had a free coding boot camp boot camp we owe you thank you man i appreciate that i appreciate that very very much um the reason why i had these here i was going to talk about this earlier but like go here look at designs and then when you get inspiration see if you guys want to work on this type of stuff too like this is important so go to places where you could get inspiration of what to work on so if you want to improve your frontend skills go and like look at this stuff and go oh what's cool about this let me work on the front end of this type of app okay if you're a backend developer you might look at something like this and go um you know what maybe i'll work on the back end of an app like this great go do that do that with javascript okay um cool so let's get out of here right because all of this guys is javascript and stuff like that at the end of the day right like what happens when i click this meet button oh it gets added to some kind of cart okay so let's just say that right or what happens when i hit this watch video button maybe this video starts playing right here oh how do i make buttons work oh there might be a concept of something so when you're doing these functions here they're going to freaking work exactly hand to hand with what you're trying to do right here there's dom when you learn about dom and you learn how to manipulate dom now you're going to be able to do stuff like this okay it's very real world stuff cool awesome so uh let's go back here okay and we've talked about toxic relationships and the power of cutting out of them and one last thing i'm gonna hit on is impostor syndrome okay and this is something that every developer experiences maybe you experienced it as well if you do you know again let me know i'd love to hear from you but this is essentially like you feeling like you're um you know how how do we let's look up an actual definition of it right like let's look that up imposter syndrome and the technical definition might mean loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud okay it disproportionately affects high achieving people who find it difficult to accept their accomplishments many question whether they're deserving of accolades all right doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud so let's go back and we'll go here and paste that okay that's really what it is if any of you feel that raise your hands proverbially raise your hands in the chat so something important right i'm looking in the comments michael says that's me awesome for being able to admit that michael very powerful to be able to do that very very powerful tuna no crust says don't worry guys you get used to the imposter syndrome never goes away but it gets better okay thank you for sharing that tuna says also raises his hand and says he feels similarly with imposter syndrome jatendra raises his hand and says i feel similar greg raises his hands okay and greg if you feel the imposter syndrome i would love to jump on a video call with you if you would like okay so uh if you want you can text there you don't have to okay it's totally cool but if you send a text message at that number uh we could bring you on this live i'd love to kind of have a conversation with some of you guys and kind of get into it cool greg yep raising his hands me me canal says me yep yup yup uh tuna no crust actually interestingly enough says i'm a senior software developer and it still gets me you're tuna i would love to have you on the platform as well okay so do me a favor send a message there and let's see if we can bring you on that's awesome julia says i feel like i could never catch up even when i start at the beginning yep so it's a really powerful thing and actually a lot of us um let me see i'll bring this bring this down here so you guys can see that okay so it seems like a lot of us feel that right a lot of people are raising their hands a lot of people are saying i feel that and serum just said me so it's funny with coding with things like coding and things like intellectual things because they're so intangible you'll often feel that for a really long time for me it never it's quite it's quieter but it's always there with a bunch of things like especially with coding it's there it's like oh these people on stack overflow know everything what do i know but then like i'm coding up crazy but then i'm still like in my mind doubting myself so one other thing that tuna crust says there's a lot of power to that and he goes yo you might actually feel that forever but the idea is either you keep working through it every single day and it might start getting quieter to the point where you can't hear it anymore and really what's happening is you're building proof for your brain right so for example your brain is like gravity is a thing what's the proof if i take this wallet and i drop it proof right if i take this thing and drop it more proof if i take my phone drop it proof proof proof proof proof proof proof eventually the proof the evidence becomes so overwhelming that your brain is like okay maybe i know what the hell i'm doing right so the times where you feel less least like a fraud is the time you're most into it and working at something you're like man i feel great okay so this is one of the things that's very debilitating for a lot of developers but one thing that can help you is like you don't have to one thing i can say that can help you is like no you're not alone we all feel it we all feel it okay and sometimes it might go away for you and i think that would be so great and that would be like such an amazing feeling and there will be times you feel it but then there will be times that it's there but the the difference between the people who make it to the top in the developer game versus who those who don't how you let it affect you if you let it affect you to the point where it's debilitating you're gonna get into this okay like for example if um does anybody know what's the best way to starve fear does anybody know what is nutrition for fear okay um um so nutrition for fear uh thank you for another donation really really appreciate it thank you okay is is time if you give fear time it keeps growing right so if i draw fear fear will keep growing like this okay on the xaxis i have time and the y can be fear okay so fear keeps growing over time how do you starve fear take away time boom dead okay just face the freaking thing so if you're feeling like a fraud go in code go and learn about coding do more coding make projects it starts to go away it starts to evaporate every single freaking time the more you linger on it the more you let it last it will keep growing more and more and more as time progresses so what you want to do is you don't want to let it become this big giant monster over time it's called screen brush by the way yeah thank you thank you thank you somebody drop that in the comment ah interesting so we have some comments coming in sheriff says was messing with the official react repo reading the code and i felt like a freaking imposter in javascript world so think about that react is built by facebook facebook has been coding for like 15 to 20 years they have hundreds of thousands of developers on their team who collectively have like hundreds of thousands of years of experience and development and time in all of this right and you're getting the best of the best of the biggest breakthroughs of probably freaking hundreds of thousands of people working on this repo and building it to what it is today and you're getting that final finished piece and then you're reading then you go oh it doesn't make that much sense to me of course it's not making that much sense it's not supposed to make sense to you it's there if they can simplify it to those levels great but think about it it's almost like it's funny the way that i'm going to say this because that's how my brain thinks my brain is like sure of how dare you think that it would make sense to you it's like almost like what you might you're the audacity that you have to think me i'm like it's not supposed to make sense to me you know i haven't spent that much time like if you have e equals mc squared yes you can say it and you can repeat it and you can regurgitate what you might have learned in your physics class but like we could spend the rest of our lives die be reborn then die again then be reborn again and we might not get it at the deep level understanding or the internalization that like einstein experienced and had when he understood when he understands that as a concept some of this stuff is hard so almost come one thing that helps is how you set your expectations if you set your expectations i'm supposed to understand this i'm supposed to have gotten this by now that's where imposter syndrome comes in a lot okay so for me when i'm doing a lot of this stuff i don't let that get to me i'm like i'm not supposed to get it i'm supposed to you know but i'm like working at it so when i don't get it or perfectly clicks i'm not that hard on myself i'm a lot more relaxed right and then i'm like oh cool like i'm just going to get through this cool i'll figure this out i'll figure this out too it's like the world is a playground you know i'm just playing everywhere let's go like whoa that's crazy here's another concept i don't get it but cool i'll get it tomorrow probably i still didn't get it oh let's try it again next week so keep going and i keep going and i keep going and i keep going and i keep going and then at some point it clicks things click and i'm like whoa whoa that's what this is that's what they were saying the react repo oh my god like four years later unit clicks and it makes sense but i think just being hard on yourself is what leads you to expect that you should know this right now which then starts putting in this weird cycle which is like i should know this by now i don't know this by now now if i don't know this is my friend know that i don't know this am i gonna get caught oh i shouldn't tell anybody that i don't know this and then it's this weird world that you might become a part of all right so um i think those are some of my thoughts that i want to share with you um this so sure of like basically what i'm saying is it's it's okay for you to experience that but more importantly for you to know that it's okay and then it's natural for you to not fully grasp everything in the react you know docs the real fat boy says that's a real tedx talk let's go the goal is to do those one day that'll be super exciting yeah you don't know everything by default you should assume that you likely don't know you'll learn like think about it like this elon musk is you know um most of us can agree that he's a very intelligent incapable human being right he's very intelligent but when he walks in the thing that most people say about him is that he asks the most amount of questions in the room he's one of the most curious people so if he's learning so should you be okay the default in your mind the expectation is i'm not going to like you know i'll learn this but i don't think i should like freaking understand this but if i do that's great play to understand it but remove the expectation okay uh that's really really um that's really key for me that freed me up a lot like my parents would be like you have to get an a for me it was like well now that i have to get an a with an expectation and the most i can do is get an a and if i get an a all they're gonna say to me is you did a good job or all they're gonna say to me is like oh that's cool like you know now we're not gonna now you know basically like it's expected to get an a then that for me wasn't exciting i'm like screw this i'm just gonna get f's that's pretty stupid right but that's how it worked in my brain but if my parents were like if you get any grade that'd be amazing it makes me want to then get an a so when i remove the expectation i'm very happy and i operate at very high levels when i have the expectation it takes a joy of life away from me it's not that i don't perform under that is that it takes the joy away and when it takes the joy away i'm very less likely to continue doing it so when you think about coding how are you going to become a great coder i need to be doing this for a prolonged period of time how do i do this for a prolonged period of time to make it enjoyable right then when i go to the react docs and they're not enjoyable uh then i'm not gonna continue doing this and i'm gonna start hitting it i'm gonna start developing anxiety around coding and then i'm gonna probably quit coding in like three to five years and if you do that you'll never become like one of the best however if you switch up the game and you go how can i do this in a way where i enjoy this and it's going to be really really fun then play the game that way i'm not supposed to get the react docs it's of course i'm not gonna get it oh i got it i got one percent of it yo that's exciting that makes you wanna read more and understand more doesn't it so play the game where it's fun because if it's fun you're going to do it for a long term if you do it for a long time you're going to get you're going to beat everybody else that's just how it works coding with kenny says because being a jack of all trades is um is the it's not the most efficient way to success instead master one concept at a time and it'll be much more effective yes yes scene says thanks man but it feels impossible to master vanilla js yeah vanilla javascript is like a bajillion things you're never really going to master it nobody has uh there's so many weird rabbit holes you could go down like you could go down a rabbit hole of bits and bites and spend the next 30 years on that and then write a research paper and then die and that's that's all you accomplished right like that's the crazy thing about this world like there's you could go so deep into things that you could go crazy into them right just like understanding logic gates oh how do the logic gates work or like you're gonna go crazy so the point is not to do that what's your goal like it's your goal to master vanilla javascript then that's a maybe if that's your goal in life okay cool then like start pursuing it but also understand you might need like you know 20 lifetimes to be able to do that plus like the powers and skills of a quantum computer and a super computer installed into your brain so understand that how hard that goal is then you're setting yourself up to be disappointed right that's what you might be doing here you might be setting yourself up to be disappointed and then you're disappointed and then you're like i don't know why i'm disappointed then you're even more upset at yourself and then it's just bad then you're just unhappy then you're depressed then you come to code with a shitty energy and then you're not learning anything so it gets worse and worse right but if you set a goal like i'm going to use javascript or even for getting javascript i want to actually build this app because i think it could help people i'm going to build this website for this restaurant i think it's going to help them i want to build a new type of social networking app then you work on that and then these are just tools to help you get there okay javascript is just a tool then you're not sitting there like i want to master vanilla js that's like a crazy hard goal to achieve right um tuna no chris says co coding with kenny is correct best to take bite size chews when you're just starting out and focus your efforts in a couple things until you're proficient then move on to the next absolutely uh now guys one huge thing i do want to say is um of course smash the like button always helps so freaking much turn that thing blue and i would really really appreciate that the other thing i do want to say is if you guys go to javascript tour dot com okay we have one of the biggest events that we're going to be doing it's going to be very very exciting i'm like super freaking pumped about it um we're going to be doing this event it's going to be brilliant and it's going to be in person it's going to be happening in los angeles and this is the first time we're doing it and uh we're scared of doing it but that's also really really exciting so like i'm going to get to see you in person the team is going to get to see you in person okay and let's see maybe if i can play this video for you whoa wait how do i make this thing go away uh thank you for another super chat really appreciate you um let me make this go away real quick okay let's go to this in person javascript boot camp this event is designed for anybody that's thinking about changing their career becoming a software developer you're either a beginner right now or you keep getting stuck in tutorial hell and not being able to make progress this is the inperson event workshop boot camp for you this is going to be an absolutely mindblowing experience you're going to learn html css you're going to learn javascript you're even going to learn react we're going to build projects we're going to build a portfolio we're gonna put these projects on those portfolios we're also gonna give you interview tips how to get your dream job and the opportunity for development is just insane and javascript and react developers are making hundred thousand dollars a year if not more so if all of those things sound exciting to you and the idea of a threeday intense boot camp in person excites you i mean this is post pandemic so we can actually do these in person now and that's why i'm so excited because never before has this been done at clever programmer and we have a huge clever programmer gang you guys are absolutely unbelievable so we thought hey how about let's bring everybody in and let's do a live inperson event with a hundred to 200 people how insane is that going to be so if this is something that's exciting to you and you want to sign up for it click the button below sign up for this event we're gonna give you more details as we find out make sure that if you're in a different state you can fly in if you're already in la then you're good to go so there you guys go okay um you just have to block out three definitely going to be on fire jump into this sunday and each day is going to be about eight to ten hours long so yeah each day is gonna be eight to ten hours long just go to javascript tour dot com type in javascript tour and uh book this out we're gonna be increasing the prices pretty soon in just a couple of days and we're gonna get sold out we're already at like 50 or 60 people that have booked it so we only have a few seats left so i want you to be there i hope that i get to see you guys in person that would be so freaking amazing um would love to see you guys in person if you guys can do it please show up man because i've been doing this for so long it's like almost half a decade i've been making these videos on coding software development python javascript web scraping making frontend apps backend apps full stack development all of this stuff but one thing i've always wanted to experience is being able to meet you guys in person being able to work with you guys in person that human connection has been something that's been missing for a really long time and honestly not even for any other reason just like fulfillment and happiness and excitement um and i believe that you guys can get such big breakthroughs you know if we work together in person you me the team will be there and we'll be working directly with you right so like we'll be sitting there helping you code i'll be like hey give me your laptop let's do it like this let's work on this app giving you realtime feedback you know working with you eight to ten hours a day for three days so we're going to be august a sixth through eighth we're going to be doing this so if you can make it that'll be awesome you know if you're in the chat i'm just going through the chat right now cool took me three and a half years to get over 100k it's definitely oh by the way that's really freaking awesome tuna no crust is making over a hundred thousand dollars a year that's fantastic and it took him three and a half years to do that definitely doable goal so that's a really good freaking accomplishment by the way but for those of you guys yeah some of you guys won't be able to make it i understand i know you guys are in a different country i know somebody said they're in nigeria that's going to be difficult um but if any of you guys are in us i would love to have you you know come come here to this event if you are able to come here do let me know in the youtube chat that'd be great but go here reserve your spot and i would love to have you guys here okay don't miss out on this it's going to be a lifechanging experience this is going to be epic we're going to start doing more of these as time progresses but this is gonna be the first one and probably one of the best ones we're gonna do okay so definitely show up there uh with that said let me go and see i have been a developer for six years oh son tuna no crush just said i've been a developer for six years currently make two hundred and eight thousand dollars in the midwest that is epic that is epic really really solid work and this goes to show a lot of people that not only can you break through a sixfigure salary as a developer but you can also start going to multiple six figures as a developer as well okay and tuna no cross what types of languages are you using like what frameworks are you using on a daily basis are you doing front end backend data science python javascript what are you doing i'd like to know more about that too and i think it brings value to everybody who's here uh it's different for me because i went in independent and incorporated got it yup that can help too if you're going fully independent and doing it you can then set your own rates and things like that but you also get more risk involved as well just because there's not that much job guarantee but if you are if you can handle that risk and you're tolerant enough to do that then it might actually be a great option for you awesome so this has been um really good if you guys have questions i'd love to take some of your guys's questions right now i'm scanning for them but if you guys don't have that many questions then i'm gonna start wrapping it up okay so i'm gonna stay on here for another like 30 seconds to a minute if you guys have questions you want to put them um down in the chat i'd love to bring them up and address them for you guys yeah i know noman it's been a while but i want to start doing these lives again this is actually really fun and i miss this aspect of connecting with people and i'd love to even start bringing you guys on the show now um and i think that'd be even more fun we should build like we should start building some kind of community where you can start bringing them on that'd be sick like a slack channel on the side and then you can be talking to them you know yeah or discord his favorite age may be a hurdle for developers i am unlucky because there is no scope of coding in my country um so coding is worldwide you can be in any country in the world and you can be coding for a german market you could be coding for a u.s market you could be coding for canadian markets like it doesn't matter you can be coding for anyone anywhere you are unlucky because your brain has given into the fact that it should make you believe that you're unlucky so that's unlucky part about this because i won't be able to change your mind if you have a belief that you're on like if you have this belief you're screwed for the rest of your life like that sucks and that will be like a very painful like the rest of your life will be very painful so what i would share with you what i would tell you is the most dangerous thing i hear in that sentence is that it starts with i am unlucky and it doesn't matter what thing that you put there you're screwed you're never gonna make it regardless of what you're doing okay so if you can figure out how you can take that away and start to see then you start to empower yourself because right now you're not in power everybody else is in power i am unlucky because of this i can't do this because of this great then that means the other person has a power they'll have a great life they'll do all the things they want to do you will be in the corner crying complaining that you're unlucky so what i would recommend is figure out how to not feel like you're unlucky okay and uh one way to start that is to just stop using sentences like that and to stop saying it that would be the first place i'd start okay next place is i'd look hey what can i do okay because what can't you do is a very different question that what can i do okay um your brain will be well brain will surprise like if i ask my brain what can't i do i'll be like i can't sing um what else i can't be a great rapper here are some other really really good ones i'll like never be lebron james i'll never be a great basketball player oh man i'm on fire right now i'll never be elon musk probably jeff bezos not really i'll never have great ecommerce business like whoo right whereas you ask your brain the other question what can i do and all of a sudden becomes great well i can have a great youtube channel i could have the best youtube channel on coding on planet earth i got the best youtube channel on how to create a youtube channel on planet earth i could be working and helping transforming so many people's lives uh and then things change okay so for example um yeah that's what i would share with you okay so you know that's a difficult place to be at i definitely have empathy when you're in that place you can't see your way out of there so that's the dangerous thing my goal is to jolt you across the screen and shake you because i'm only going to get this one shot to really help you beast um so my goal is just to shake you and yank you in the one minute three minute conversation i can have you do which is also one way and i want to get as much across as i can so if i have to do that in a shocking way to wake you up i will but the goal is my goal is to help transform your belief around you you thinking you're unlucky okay uh i want you to start thinking about where is opportunity you can be crushing it like dude that is so much that is the biggest message i've read today or in a really long time because i go on code mentor and there are developers from nigeria and kenya that are charging 15 to 20 dollars per 15 minutes that's a 80 an hour hourly rate that they're charging and they're on code mentor io teaching people code people are signing up and paying them they have thousands of reviews the only reason you're saying this is because you might suck at coding and now you're saying unlucky to hide behind the fact that your skill level is just trash so um you might hide behind it for now by saying this and you might be able to trick people around you your friends around you your family members around you it might make you feel great but remember in the long run you're stealing from yourself and you're not going to get to where you personally want to get to in life okay so my goal is to kind of just like flash that mirror and help you see okay because you can certainly be killing it you can be killing it but if your skill level is bad nobody's going to hire you it doesn't matter what country you're living but if you're good people are going to hire you developing is such a hardcore important skill and it's so hard to find good developers your biggest advantage can be you just being a good developer it's ridiculous to say that but so many developers are so bad so if you're just a good developer and you have maybe somewhat decent communication skills you're gonna do really really well but beast you're gonna have to let go of a lot of this victim mentality okay so um there's a lot of possibility out there for you and i think you will be able to do great those are my parting words for you hey i'm kingsley a software developer and i'm finding it hard to find what people are willing to pay for so that i can use my skills in tech to create a solution what do you think i should do um okay so instead of looking what people are willing to pay for what i recommend you do is go to conferences and look for where they need help what are their problems in software development what are the problems in coding that they're facing when you start discovering their problems and caring about people's problems you might be able like it's very tactical okay so it's not that wubu you could go to a conference start talking to a couple of ceos start talking to a couple of software developers where do you guys face problems oh you know i don't have an ecommerce developer and we want to do this and this and this ah ecommerce might be a place i could help great write that down you talk to another one they're like blah blah yeah you know we could use a developer that understands ecommerce really well ah another person that could use a developer that understands ecommerce um you keep getting that and you go oh my god ecommerce can actually be a huge thing where i can help a lot of people and then you reach out to those two people and go hey uh would you like if i could help you and me and you know i can even start helping you for free or i can help you for this rate you know i'd love to be able to help you i think these are but like really deeply understand their problem instead of looking for what people are willing to pay for because you're gonna keep playing that game forever but if you innovate on there's a great book that even nas was reading and recommended to me blue ocean strategy instead of innovating on an offer that people are willing to pay for innovate on value so build a relationship and then go where can i help dude a person like you you know and i i don't mean this in any disrespect but like any software developer most of you guys just need one freaking client and then you're set for like a year or a few years so like it's not a game about like a massive high volume you just need a few developers like 100k 200k like that's not that hard to make that money like they're people making billions of dollars like 100 200k is like nothing i don't mean to say it in a disrespectful way i mean to say it is like there's so much abundance out there there's a lot of money for you and for everybody who's on here there's so much money you can all make and there's so much value you can provide as a software developer javascript developer full stack developer but the the trick is to just build those relationships and really search for where there are problems what are the problems and you need to talk to real people otherwise you're gonna be sitting here looking up online trying to find a niche and you'll never find anything because everything you've ever thought of is done or is not done because it sucks or there's already somebody really good at it and then you're just gonna be like all right back to watching netflix i guess i tried so that that's what i would say and i think that would help you a lot all right uh coding with kenny says sounds good we'll be building a ton of projects would it be a good idea to learn react next after node.js and express sure my my thing is instead of focusing on what to learn next focus on what you're building and what you're making so instead of a technology based focus a building based focus okay um so like like do you need to learn react for the next project that you're building do is it to be ui development heavy okay great then learn react does your app that you want to build will it require a back end great then learn node and and then does it require a lot of path um routing and like that okay cool then learn express so start with what you're doing and then if you need to learn these as tools then keep learning them alex camposano i only have one year of experience and good jobs ask for a minimum of three years how can i prove that i am a good candidate of react yes relationships or or five years of experience you choose it's totally up to you but that's really the game either you build relationships with people and you build a connection and you offer to help and then you get in that way and you will have a lot of chances or you just go head to head with somebody who's a badass on a on a piece of paper and if they have three years or five years you're crushed you're destroyed you're not gonna get that job or maybe you can in your resume somehow highlight that you bring something else to the table but that's so hard to play that game on a piece of paper if you want to play the game on a piece of paper you just have to be a better offer than the other person and that becomes really hard so instead your advantage might be bring that to real life start speaking with people start asking what they need start asking people who are running react companies go to react conferences and talk to people there build relationships there a developer might know a developer that needs a developer okay so those again why these tactics work for most of you people and most people who are looking for a job you just need one or two clients you're good literally for like the next three years most of the times you know the next couple of years so uh it's worth doing why i wouldn't recommend this to a business is it would be too random and business cares about how to generate a client after a client after a client after a client so i wouldn't give this advice as somebody who wants to run a business but for most people just need a few good solid clients and then you're set for a really long time whoa that's cool tuna no crust says i used to work in a prison before i became a developer was not a technical guy at all damn yo tuna we we gotta bring you on the show man send us a message did he send us a message yet okay tuna my team is dming you on instagram so respond either there or send a text message but we want to bring you on bro that's a really great story from a prisoner to a developer that makes two hundred thousand dollars a year wow shreya's code says hey qazi got my internship as a react developer without having a software developer degree only because by watching your videos thanks a lot man respect you got it that's amazing to hear that's that makes me really really happy great job trace i see luke's message corrections officer that's great we're even thinking about like uh going to pre uh going to prisons and offering to help them and actually teach them coding i think that'd be really freaking cool but we don't know how to where to even start so like tuna we might be able to use your help there that would be great um because yeah we have no idea who to speak to about that we have like we have no idea you know but we we know that's something we would like to be able to do whoa that's so cool um this is crazy tuna says i went to a coding bootcamp because i wanted to change careers best decision i've ever made that's awesome man that's awesome yeah a lot of people who are joining coding bootcamps this is our main thing get somewhere change careers fast and then keep going you know that's why we launched our coding bootcamp too that's what we do with people we're like hey get here and most of the people that join are looking to change their careers within a couple of months we have them change their careers get a job as a software developer and they're freaking happy and i think that's why they're popular so that's awesome okay i'm going through your guys's messages okay oh nice alex thank you for the donation really appreciate you really appreciate you um it says to be employed learn a lot of things or master one just depends what job you're trying to get my thing is to get employed work and build awesome deep projects and that will speak for you a lot more than anything else uh okay joe hunger asks can i get a freelancing job with only html css bootstrap and javascript absolutely i have worked my ass off coding for two years made so many projects helped so many friends who are in the industry but i am unable to secure a software engineer job um two years man so many projects have so many friends from industry but i mean there might be another problem there there might be something different like maybe you have trouble securing interviews maybe you have trouble passing either the culture fit interviews or the technical interviews um but there's something else happening there and what's your pipeline of jobs that you're applying to how many interviews are you getting on a regular basis okay are you doing it in a disciplined way do you have like are you reaching out to a hundred companies and getting maybe five interviews and then going through that process and then doing that week after week if you're not that might be the answer okay so it's also not going to just happen randomly you can help people all you want but if you don't like specifically ask for what you need go to those specific job interviews and then you're not going to secure that specific job okay so that might be for a different reason luke lukex asks clever programmer i've been practicing react for months and i want to learn some backend to make apps interactive what do you suggest sure you can learn node and that would be great and you can make your apps interactive okay or firebase you can even learn firebase and kind of like get rid of node and then firebase gives you a backend too so my personal preference is just jump on the firebase bandwagon i was not a prisoner no i know that i know that it's funny just a corrections officer it's funny cause he never said you were a prisoner canelo that's funny too um terrence ford says almost done with team tree house full stack javascript can someone let me know what i would need to learn to be desirable to a company i do want to freelance but baby steps cool so yeah start with something um in terms of baby steps i would say again if you're already learning these things focus on building projects putting them on your portfolio those are what make you desirable to a company i want to come and go okay let's get past the let's get in an interview taryn show me your projects okay uh great great uh that project is garbage i don't care i'm not gonna say that to you but that's what i'm thinking oh cool uh okay now within the projects let's see scanning through the code code okay he's using some react he looks like he knows some redux okay cool what else um looking through his commits oh his commits are bad uh i don't want to bring this person on or oh he has careful commits okay this looks good the code looks very clean um that's great he has some documentation in the github that where he has this code okay cool what are some other projects what are some other things he's working on okay cool seems like beginner but somebody i can teach um let me give this person an opportunity cool man all right terence let's start working let's uh let's do a weeklong shadowing with our company if you're a good fit maybe we can extend an offer to you okay so that those might be a certain examples or they might just be like yeah this is great freaking you start tomorrow but projects is going to be a really important piece of the puzzle another thing we can do guys is like we can have people lined up who maybe want to show us projects and then i can have oneonone sessions like live coding and review and going through the projects you know and like roasting or whatever like making it entertaining right and then we can put that but this would also help us start a community so if you guys want to start a community we can start linking people to that community too and then amana can start adding people so you can start a slack group or discord it doesn't matter and then a monarch can help manage that as well that could be great um watching from philippines awesome that's cool bro that's awesome okay uh sure of says do you think serverless will replace back end i i don't think it will completely replace it just because there are going to be a lot of people are going to keep doing it but yeah i mean you could use serverless to essentially replace backend and i prefer it that way i really enjoy coding it coding things like that i rarely ever have backends most of my ends are serverless and i just i love that i just honestly feel like it's much easier you don't have to focus on your back end you don't have to work on making your back end scalable none of those things like all of that should automatically be handled and you could use aws you could use versal you could use firebase i mean everybody is now having like a serverless happen so my personal preference is to go more towards serverless but of course both are possible cool all right amazing you guys uh this has been phenomenal i would definitely recommend if you guys want to join um if you guys want to join and come to the live tour just go to javascript tour dot com can we please put this in the description description oh yeah there it is description and also chat okay yeah cool so yeah just add um you can go to this javascript tour it's happening in los angeles all right august 6 through 8th so happening in uh two to three weeks okay this is where it's happening this is how much it is and this helps us kind of cover the cost of the event and yeah that's it we wanted to make it as uh inexpensive for you guys as possible honestly so everybody can show up the only two reasons we even decided to charge is number one so we can cover the cost of the event and then number two is so you show up because every time we make something for free people stop showing up on day two and day three and so that's the only goal of this if you're gonna pay we know you're gonna pay attention you're gonna show up so go get this it's gonna get booked out it's gonna get shut down but i would love to have you there and i would love to work with you in person go through training hardcore training build the projects like i want to have you leaving there like oh my god my mind has exploded but you know even if we can help you get projects on your portfolio or just give you that juice which we're going to be doing a lot here our goal is to really have a life transformative effect you know in those three days so show up it's going to be a lot of freaking fun it's going to be great energy and would love to have you guys there other than that thank you guys so much for watching this video this is your boy qazi as always if you like
