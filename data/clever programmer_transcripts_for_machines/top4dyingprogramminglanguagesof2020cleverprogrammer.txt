z from cleverprogrammer.com in this video you are going to learn about the top four dying programming languages in 2020 that's what we're going to be covering in this video i hope that you are excited because i sure am and some of these languages might actually surprise you with that said i do want to let you know that if you want to become a developer and you want to learn the best programming languages and also you want to be able to get a job or make an income as a developer i have put together an epic one hour free training with javascript the link is in the description below go ahead and sign up for it register for it and go watch that training it's going to blow your freaking mind all right completely free doesn't cost you anything with that said if you are excited smash that like button and let's jump right into it so what do we got here these are the programming languages and we got a couple of people doing a dance over these languages and this is based on real world stats and just a quick disclaimer as well guys this video is for fun this video is for shits and giggles and for us just to have a fireside chat have fun and don't take it too seriously because all the languages that i mentioned here that are dying there's still jobs out there for them there's still people paying for them so it's not like if you learn them you would never be able to get a job you see what i'm saying but they are based on statistically the programming languages that are a little bit lower and kind of dying so i'm going to keep going now this is based on real data according to google trends pipel which is the popularity of a programming language stack overflow and youtube as well we're going to be looking at so those four things we're going to look at ready three two one let's go now number four i hope you're excited for it is haskell and this haskell programming language is essentially a very functional programming language but it's also very very difficult to learn and difficult to understand if you see over here according to pipel it's currently in place number 27 and pipel takes a lot of different things into its uh equation when it's figuring out like which programming language is popular or which one is kind of losing interest so it will look at things like how many google searches are being taken place for this how many answers are there available for this in the community how active the community is so for haskell it's kind of going down this is one of the programming languages that is dying now if you look at the trend over here over the last five years you can see that we have haskell and haskell is in blue and it's so low that you can't even see it it's like boom all the way at the bottom whereas popular programming languages like python and javascript you can see they are growing and they're continuously going up and up and up and python is actually even becoming more popular but that's a thing for another video but here hascal is in blue and you can see it's barely even visible it's not dying it was never alive that was just something funny we thought we would share with you and the slides a lot of these slides are actually prepared by amana so shout out to amanoth thank you so much for putting this together really really appreciate you let me go and go forward so i'm pumped that you guys are here katan paradox appreciate you guys all being here i know manat is here all right let's keep going so here you can see haskell is actually a dreaded programming language even according to stack overflow 2020 survey and they surveyed all their developers and they're like hey what's the what are the most dreaded programming languages for you and you guys can see the names of the ones here and here is haskell and it's one of the most dreaded ones at 48.3 percent and also another thing i recommend you do when you're trying to get a grasp of how popular programming language is look just go on youtube and look up tutorials for it are there active tutorials for it that were that are currently be playing uh being placed recently if there are that also kind of shows you how active that programming language is or how much support there is for it that's just one of the metrics along with you looking on stack overflow and many other places that's one of the ones i recommend and here the most recent stuff is actually a very very long time ago like seven years ago five years ago so my thoughts and prayers go out to ascal and hopefully so do yours if you guys are enjoying this so far boom go ahead and smash that like button break that goddamn thing and smash that subscribe button because we're trying to become we currently are actually the number one fastest growing coding channel on the planet thanks to you thanks to you who's watching this so really really appreciate you guys and we're putting out this content even frankie sitting right behind me helping out with all the content all the live so we put in the goddamn work for you guys and you can help us out so much just by hitting that smashing that like button puts the video out to everybody so it means the world if you guys did that and also subscribe to the channel because we want to keep it going we have over 400 viewers welcome and let's keep on rocking and rolling number three are you ready here we come for number three programming language that is dying it is pearl my friend so pearl is one of those languages that is on the decline if we look over here it's on position 22 in the pipal index it's going down in popularity it also means going down and a lot of the support around that community again disclaimer so they're not a lot of those people in the comments being really upset really hurt if you're learning this there's still jobs out there for it there's still people i promise that are willing to pay you for it it's just not as popular it's just declining okay so don't take it so seriously to your heart all right we're just having fun but pearl is one of the programming languages that's dying take a look over here comparative python and javascript which are flying here you'll see pearl and boom it's all the way low all right and you can see the decline happening right if i if you follow my red marker you see it's declining declining decline into nonexistence and if i actually hide my face over here you'll really really see it what's up guys welcome welcome you have 460 people live on this damn thing so pumped to have all of you guys here fizzer says damn i don't even know pearl that's all good you can look it up online uh ready dev says clever programmers growing freaking faster than traversing media and free code cam yo we're growing faster than free code camp damn i totally forgot about looking at free code cam when i was doing that i saw we were growing faster than traversing media but we're growing faster than free code count let's get it the best coding channel on the planet and it's all thanks to you for being here and making it so so with that said let's keep on rocking and rolling you can see pearl here is let me remove this white board you can see pearl over here is a dreaded programming language um you know according to the stack overflow index 71 of developers actually dread it that is pretty damn crazy so pearl is definitely one to avoid if you're trying to figure out what programming language to learn don't learn this and here are some tutorials for it that were made a while ago right four years ago that's a long long time ago now pearl uh it's a declining and it's gonna still take a long time to kind of flatten out you guys saw it was like going down and down and down but keep in mind you know what it says over here there are legacy websites that are actually still using it so those legacy websites might never go away it might take a really long time to go away so there's still going to be jobs available for it but it's slowly going kind of peter out so you know time to die somebody says the only thing that is dying is my patience with all the bugs yeah with all the bugs haha working while watching your stream good job though thank you so much and yeah coding when you're coding there are tons of tons of bugs that will come into your code and make your life really really difficult so it just is what it is so just winder says amazon does use pearl though they are migrating so you can see that pearl is being used but people are migrating from it right pot liquor says and this is true legacy code is money still guaranteed yep is still money if you're trying to have a very secure future that's the only reason and if you're a complete beginner right now maybe you might not want to look into this programming language but if you already are experienced developer and you have experience with perl i'm sure there are plenty of jobs you can find so just want to say that so you guys have both sides to it yeah rashov says your content is too real and helpful big thanks really really appreciate it rishov we also really really appreciate you and let's keep rocking and rolling hopefully you guys are enjoying this now in position number two let's do a little drum roll please in position number two we got objective c now this is a programming language that is being used that was being used by apple but apple over the last like 35 years has been slowly trying to kill it and get it out it's kind of like apple's internet explorer and by the way i don't know if you guys know but internet explorer is actually officially dead as a four days ago microsoft made an announcement and they are officially killing support for internet explorer everybody just moment of silence your thoughts and prayers so the only browser that you use to download other browsers it's time for internet explorer to die along with some programming languages like objective c and according to the pipal index you can see it's in position number eight and it is definitely on the decline compared to python and javascript you can see objective c is also pretty much nonexistent time to go and over here we can see in the dreaded it is um yeah people are like rip uh really wow yep it's gone it's gone chrome dev tools all the way future code let's go ready dev says only use internet explorer only for downloading chrome yep rip internet explorer yep there you go so it's time for it to go but check this out right objective c right over here it's the second most dreaded programming language according to the stack overflow developers because microsoft is moving over to edge so that's why they just completely killed it now again look on youtube as well not much support for it not much going on 248 000 views five years ago not many new tutorials coming out for it so definitely something maybe you should avoid and learn other things instead apple's objective c is 35 years old and it's clear that the company wants it dead five years ago apple executives took to the stage to unveil swift its new and improved programming language for its software ecosystem no doubt they expected developers to quickly embrace swift at objective c's expense so swift was developed from objective c but then swift became where apple is now moving forward with that's how all ios apps are now being developed all right so that's why objective c so at some point objective c will likely fade away entirely so there it is right until then objective c get some rest but i think you're going to be going out of the picture soon and yeah rishabh says is learning swift worth yeah if you want to do mobile development definitely worth learning swift definitely worth learning flutter definitely worth learning react native those are all very very worth to learn and you know see which one you like the best from within that um we have 500 people watching this live right now thank you guys so much and guys if you just do me a favor so this video you can just go out to more and more people smash that like button if you're enjoying it and again also subscribe to the channel where this is a channel where we help people become developers and this is the fastest growing coding channel on the planet and our goal this year is to help 5 000 people get fulltime jobs as developers that's our number one mission and vision at clever programmer for the year 2020 and 2021 we want to hit 10 000 people to get jobs as developers so really pumped about that now number one are you ready for the number one dying programming language are you ready i'm gonna give it a few drumrolls right over here let me put my mic a little bit down because i think i'm blowing you guys let me let me give you a little drumroll boom you ready are you actually ready really because i don't buy it i don't think you're ready wait for it we're about to get into it and the number one programming language is actually guys uh let's just do some stretching right now all right right here here we go all right all right all right the number one programming language for real or the number one dying programming language is visual basic microsoft's dreaded dreaded visual basic vba all right this is one programming language people try to run away from and you can see over here that it is ranked 15 and is on the decline and why it's dying not only is it losing popularity over time you know of course if you compare it python and javascript it's like super like low and kind of on the decline but another reason why it's dying is just because it's the most dreaded programming language it was used a lot back in the day nowadays it's not really used and nobody is really trying to use it that much now of course the disclaimer there are still jobs available for it if you did learn it you could still get jobs all right so just keep that in mind don't get your panties tied in a twist and here is vba the number one most dreaded programming language according to stack overflow and over here you can see that the tutorial for this was made like six years ago and a lot of this is you know kind of long long time ago so a little bit of less support so there you have it and here is a bonus for all of you guys php is also on the decline but php is still popular just because again remember wordpress remember a lot of legacy websites so the work will be there don't worry about it if you enjoy it you truly enjoy it learn it you'll still be able to get jobs for it but overall it's on the decline these programming languages have been you know they're a little bit outdated if you're new use the more modern stuff you'll be up and running quicker the community support is a lot better the tutorials you can watch online on you know whether you watch it on youtube or udemy or udacity whatever it's just going to be much easier for you to pick it up build a career out of it right so why wouldn't you do that and why would you go the old way and learn all things if you don't really have a particularly good reason so that is you know if you look at php over here you can see that it used to be really popular then but you know highlevel programming languages like python and javascript started taking over so in red and yellow you have python and javascript and the blue one over here is php and you can see how php started declining boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and then all the way here now currently in 2020 it's on the steepest decline that it's been all right so definitely useful but on a very steep decline and you can see according to stack overflow it is one of the most dreaded programming languages with 62 percent of the people saying it's dreaded so this is stack overflow survey straight up data not dead but on the decline all right and on the pipal index you can see that it's over here in position number six and uh yep there we go so we have some tutorials for it but again they were a while ago and there you go guys that's all folks peace and love peace and love hopefully you guys enjoyed the top four dying programming languages you guys got a kick out of it and had fun but just again remember this is all in fun and it's just one of those videos that i think everybody enjoys you know it's kind of like the gossip where you talk [ __ ] about your friend and it's kind of fun everybody wants to peek in on it and see what's going on in reality a lot of these programming languages you can still get jobs if you deeply enjoy them but if you're a complete beginner and you're looking for a path which i know a lot of you are it's probably not worth picking these up stick to you know more popular stuff stick to python stick to javascript stick to you know swift or flutter and you know i know flutter is not a programming language dart is the programming language right flutter is the toolkit but it's fine stick to the stuff that is out there now just because the development is going to be easier your experience is going to be easier the community support is going to be better there's going to be more tutorials out there for you to learn from more courses so just keep that in mind and with that said i really hope you guys enjoyed this video if you have been watching it up until now please smash that like button subscribe to the channel and that's it this is qazi i love your beautiful face and as always and also join that free training we have for you it's in the description below one hour free javascript training and as always i love your beautiful
