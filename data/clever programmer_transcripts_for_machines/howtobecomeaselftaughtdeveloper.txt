how can you become a selftaught developer you have to stop looking at tutorials and books and relying on something get off here and start actually working on a project tutorials are gonna help you but they're not gonna help you make the things that you want to make as you're building the project you can actually go back and look up those certain things how many of your own projects have you built so far if your answer is like less than say five or three there's a reason why you're not improving at the level you want to improve at most of our time is wasted honestly learning lots of tutorials going through lots of books but not applying it so unless that knowledge is applied it's useless
