five dollars total or if the job is gonna pay you $500 total it's gonna be matched to your level because once you're a beginner when you're a beginner you want to land a small jobs and then we'll show you how to land jobs that are more so you know we have one of our clients who last month did twenty eight thousand dollars in one month freelancing and already this month he's closed over twelve thousand dollars and so you have some students who are much more advanced or a beginner so it really doesn't matter where ever you are will match and we'll show you how to actually make an income with these skills cause yeah I think somebody said something's happened to the link maybe the link is not everything can we test the link no as in the live stream is a live stream active guys because some people have said what happened it ended is that a video stopped so maybe I think the videos come down no we live concurrent via stream finished oh I think was it three hours maybe damn it seems like but but how come if the electricity went out oh I just disconnected from your session you are a live stream session on your your vs live share because my internet went out probably for a little bit right yeah okay yeah interesting hold on yeah it says zero live yeah oh we're back 107 108 we're back okay 110 yeah I don't know how this works but the network stuff of YouTube and everything is pretty awesome sick so we're back yeah right awesome guys yeah really apologize about that I don't know why the stream ended let me just hit dismiss on here and see what happens hopefully is it back on YouTube Frankie if you got I think so okay so so basically guys so that's one huge part but the other huge part is the fact that you guys get weekly JavaScript and react training calls on every single one of your calls every single week you're gonna get those calls so sunny how they get calls with you and Nas right yes so you have coaching calls with me with Naz with Jacob pretty much what happens is in those coaching calls like well I tend to do in my coaching calls is go through real build so just like what we did today we would usually start the coaching call off with some highlevel information how you can actually earn money with JavaScript so like I usually go through three different ways about how you can teach it about how you can start making an income from cheering how you can land your first freelancing client and then we kind of go into a build where you guys will build alongside me if you get stuck you can plug those questions it's a really cool interactive process yep and just to give you guys a sense of our community so check it out we have about 1200 members in our JavaScript community and if I go here these are all of our members so the list just keeps going on with how many members we have and they're all really really amazing people that are part of this program it's really like a family and so everybody really here supports each other everybody uplifts each other we're all in this journey together you know some of them are like hey I just quit uber and now I am doing this so I want to make an income and some people are like I've been coding and I'm an engineer but I really want to take it to the next level and learn how to make six figures as a developer and more and so when you join this you're really getting a whole family you know with you and for example here is you know Naz who's one of your is gonna be one of your main instructors in the program right he's doing these calls and he even assigned homework for everybody and so everybody's now gonna go and finish that homework assignment and then go look for work after that exactly yep so those are some important highlights I wanted to show you guys if you guys want to jump in just go here whichever plan you want to choose monthly or yearly up to you in the yearly one you'll save some in save three hundred dollars but at this point if you got in value guys go ahead click that link in the description click the bun which says join now jump in the program I mean your JavaScript career and your career as a reactive L appear just gonna skyrocket to another level so if you are since I'm here and you want to learn you would just do yourself a huge disservice not taking advantage of this opportunity right now because the price does go up tonight yep and for sixty seven dollars a month is and absolutely still for what you're getting is insane most people say is what a 10k coding boot camp just from the live coaching calls so it really does like blow people's minds that we offer it for so cheap literally like Jose literally said this exact same thing so yeah he's like this course has given me way more value than my six months coding boot camp that I paid $10,000 for and so this is something we get very very commonly people who have taken coding boot camps in many different places fullstack Academy they have gone to like galvanize bunch of their boot camps and then they're like hey I got more value out of this program than anything else and so this program our goal is to get it to be a really expensive program but because of everything that's happening right now in the world and you know also it's 4th of July so we wanted to make it as affordable for you as possible so you don't have that barrier to entry so you know again this is the time that you should learn coding because coding and JavaScript and all these jobs are at their peak right now because everybody's trying to work from home so if you learn these skills right now you will have a career and you will have really successful results compared a lot of other people who are out of their jobs and don't know what to do exactly perfectly per yeah and guys you can work anywhere in the world so it really doesn't matter where you are in the world like if you're somewhere completely remote or like say you're in Asia or something you can land clients in America you can learn clients in London you can learn clients as long as you have an internet connection you can pretty much work for anywhere with anyone which is insane yep yeah awesome iourney says I've never done it can I still join yeah absolutely you can you need you can still arena you can still join the program if you are even a complete beginner with coding you can join the program we handhold you from scratch so even though on these live streams you might be doing some more advanced stuff but most of the times we're when you join the program we start you from scratch exactly cool whoa someone said I bought the course now I can ride my bike with no hands nice there you go nice ok awesome guys thank you so much sunny is this a wrap let's wrap it up yeah I think I think we this was an amazing session I hope everyone enjoyed it yeah it was still when they say I think we should do this more often if you guys enjoyed it let us know yeah and we're happy there's more yeah this would be sick to do more we're actually even thinking of being so aggressive as to like do it almost every day yeah so we'll see it really depends on how you guys liked it and how much value you got out of it because if you didn't

hear from you guys let's see thank you cause yes and it's the only thing I wanted right now to binge and riad my react current machine learning project holy crap oh all laying use since the start of my engineering Krish says nice that's awesome Terry that's an awesome comment yep awesome guys thank you so much for being a part of this we love you we appreciate you if you're considering joining click the link in the description outside of that we're gonna be here pretty much every other day depending on if you guys get value from this or not and we're gonna be building things live with you
