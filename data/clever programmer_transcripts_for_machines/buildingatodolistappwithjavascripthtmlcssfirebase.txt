are doing amazing so good to see you all today we are building a todo list application using javascript using html using css and of course using firebase as well so we're going to be building a beautiful app right it was it was designed by fronted mentor right which you guys can go ahead and of course check it out by frontend mentor and you know i mean you can do all the simple things for example you can add it to your item like for example watch a youtube tutorial you know hopefully you guys don't watch too many of them hit enter right it cops to the top right you can hover over them of course you can make you can check them right they're completed you can uncheck them if you would make them want to make them uncompleted and the cool thing is this is using javascript it's using html it's using css it's using firebase to store all this data right as you can see on the right hand side what do we have here we're creating these for example you know uh a way to create our input as you can see for example there's a way where if i go ahead and do this this right here tells us the same thing is what this tells us right to create the input inside here then we'll actually generating to do items in here right but we're generating to do items using using what using a uh um using right here look at this using firebase so this is something you might have seen maybe you have not seen but using five is to get the data from a database right and just to show you how it looks like let me show you it's really cool so for example right here this is my data you see right here this is my data right here okay see all of my items are stored just like this there's a status called active or completed and then there's an actual text so for example if i want to delete the text let me show you here for a second if i want to delete this you will see that it actually live updates the database or the application look at this all right and live up this application so for example let me delete this um let me see this first one right here it says watching tutorial i'm gonna say on this one i'm gonna delete document delete it now watch that watch this left portion right here watch this watch it watch it boom gone just like that right this is an actual live realtime database application that we'll be using and of course as we update the com the status you can see for example if i mark this this is completed you can see that this gets uh turned into completed if i click it again this turns into active just like that right so again very very very useful application it looks amazing beautiful and there's a lot you can learn just from a simple todo app all right but let's go and get started guys uh as you know this is you built by for the mentor so feel free to check them out there's a link down below you could just go to fundamental right here and get all the files uh for from them on this application so if you go to challenges and then if you search up to do right here to do app here's your app right here just you can go ahead and go to this challenge i will i'll actually copy this if you want because i want to check it out right here here's your link and i'll for the zoom chat as well i'll copy this in for you guys too so you guys can have it right here right here i'll set this up for you guys too so every you can guys can go ahead down download all the files that you need to download and use them but also i also have a github page that actually has all the javascript you know so if you want to follow along with me um the actual github is right here as well it's also down down in the description guys so if you want to follow along with me which is not you know the most necessary thing you know how you don't have to but if you do uh feel free just follow along and that will be okay as well so let me go ahead and paste into the github guys from github down below in the description okay in the description all right just want to let you know that all right cool so let's go ahead and the first thing is first that we need to build well we've got this application so it looks beautiful right i would say so okay what's the next thing we need to do uh to make this happen well just like we you start any project open up your vs code and get some water to drink because you're about to get you're about to go my friends you're about to code okay let's put on the coding music that we always always like okay i'm gonna put my code to the side here i'm gonna use a cheat sheet guys okay don't judge me if you if i use a cheat sheet i always use cheat sheets it's okay okay sometimes you need to have a cheat sheet cheat good all right it's fine beautiful so first things first of course you know the drill open up use code open you open up a new window in ds code just like this right let's go ahead and now at this point i will open my projects folder and i'm going to create a new todo app so this is the one i created myself okay and let's call new folder let's go ahead challenge right here to do dash app right done to do app boom done so let's go ahead and add that okay after that what you want to do is let's go ahead and actually file open this one up i'll open this one up let's go ahead and go to project challenge to do app click open on this one click open on this one and that's it you've got your application just like that okay now let's go ahead and create a new file you guys know drill a new file called index.html that's usually this what we usually do right and of course into our startup i will start our application what do we need to do guys anybody know anybody what do we usually do what do we usually do is what is we do like this boom just like that right to create our html template okay are we going to be using cookies for this no not necessarily assets corrupted um no they're not corrupted retro they're just svg items don't worry about them but not corrupted trust me if you go to assets none of these are corrupted these are svg items so svgs are basically you see they're images right they're images but there are vector images we call them so they're not corrupted don't worry just go and download them okay beautiful so after that let's go rename our title and we're going to say this a2 to app all right good so save that beautiful all right we've got our todo app first portion done to do app yeah cool okay save it yeah that's what i'm talking about all right next up let's gonna create a style sheet so let's do a new stylesheet called stylus css okay and of course let's link our stylesheet to our application so just how we always do it is what would you say we say link what link what link what link i'm not like this that's what i want link css right this boom done style css okay what's up 4k that's right thank you sam appreciate it appreciate it all right after that i'm going to do a few things um i want to go ahead and actually create our script.js file as well so let's do new file let's do script.js all right and of course let's also link our script.js so we don't also forget as well it's the usual drill i used i just like to make this happen right away so we have to think about it too much i'm gonna say script source like this and i'm gonna say uh script right here script.js beautiful done our application is done no no no no no no no no no so okay gotta go good how do you get html doc info what do you mean what do you mean by david so if you want to do it with me the issue and that came out then what i mean what html doc info if you want to get the html just in do a commenting point my friend david okay and then do do hit enter that's it okay cool so that's all good next up what i like to usually do is a few things well you see we have this application that we need to create let's divide this application into the components that we need to create what do we what is the first thing we want to do what is the first thing to do how many uh no it's not just front end it's social front and we're using firebase for the back end as well guys so what do we need to do what is the first part i like to do personally for members who remembers from the zoom who remembers yeah that's right make a list sam that's right so i'm going to create a list called plan that plan that md plan that md plan dot md okay beautiful and first things first is this right so what is the first part we should do anybody know i'm gonna do the following i'm going to do what uh create the boxes create the boxes uh the boxes we need to create right need to create right here boom all right that's first plan part two is going to be what part two is what create the header right create the header actually before we create the header i want to create this oh you're talking about the banner yes and that's right the banner right the background this banner background image so create the banner background image beautiful part three what are we going to do okay part three is gonna be let's create the actual uh i call it the header which is this one right here let's create this header right but this could create the header create the header beautiful part four is going to be what yeah part four is gonna be what the create the what this portion right the actual input right so create the input input to you know the input the input section section part five part five um yes lucas criticalism that's right create the to do items to do items list section good job good job good job part six right what's next so we create this to do the section items what's next guys to to do area well the background we'll take care of the background what's next guys what do you guys think far that's right setup set up our database that's correct what's up database that's right is that the base okay part seven is going to be we need to what right what what what what what create the ability the ability to save data right to add a new todo list item to a database data in a firebase database just like that database part 8 so once we are able to actually set the data in a database what do we now do now what do we do what is the next thing we are we can push the data but the second portion is what anybody second portion is what it is what anybody sam maybe what do you guys think lamont grab it from the data yeah grab the date that's right so let's go and grab the data so first create the functionality to to grab the data from the database database database oh so many people are already using this already it's crazy i might have to change my firebase application don't worry i'm not changing a little bit that's right right so let's go next one nine right so create the functionality to grab the data okay awesome suede after that what i want to do is after i did i want to be able to what be able to update it by what so if i click on the check mark i should be able to update it correct yeah that's right so let's go ahead and create a functionality to update the data with what with what with the new status the new status of completed or active depending that's right that's right okay so at this point and then honestly at this point it's pretty much done i'm gonna have you guys do this portion for the homework so our focus is going to be making sure this all works perfectly okay and then your book is gonna be okay well how can i clear for example things or how can i filter it by active or completed this is where you guys have to do some research to make sure this actually fully works okay beautiful so next one let's go the first part is going to be what create the boxes we need to create so the boxes are well a few boxes of integrate here as you guys know it's going to be what this box right this box i'm going to create this box right here after that you need to create this box portion beautiful all right and then honestly it's pretty much and of course there's this box to make sure that we have this background image right so based on this the first thing i'm going to do is create the banner background image that's part one for me right away right away okay now can anybody tell me how maybe we can do that what would you do to create a banner background image like this okay what do we do to create a banner background image well a few things i would do personally is i'll just create a dip correct guys so let's do coin creative so let's say div day of class i will say background dash image okay dash image and and then that's just a background image just like that okay now this is the background that's going to be this portion right here all right this portion right here okay now inside that we're going to create an actual image here image image source is equal to what image source is equal to what well we don't have the acetate just yet so what we can do guys is we can actually download these assets so let's go to our githubs that we have down below for those of you who are on you know on zoom already sent you guys the github okay go to github let's go and click the code download as a zip so we have it okay beautiful let's go to uncover this that's gonna cover this one okay beautiful uncover that all right now with that being said with that being said with that being said what are we gonna do well we've got the assets right here let's take all these assets we have and transfer them into our assets so it's a new file or a new folder assets right here new folder assets okay i'm going to take these icons little small icons and i'm only going to do just simply drag into the assets folder like that boom done everybody see that all i did was i simply took it and i dragged it into the access folder and that's it my friends that's all you have to do okay all you to do right okay somebody said why don't just write diff container because i have a lot more fun using you know create writing up the actual diff guys somebody said why don't you just use a shortcut of div dot container like no for me i like to write out like this which is fine okay so we've got the assets now and the answer that we're going to use for this one is going to be the bg desktop dark right so we'll do image source and we'll say here what assets right dg bg that's the dark just like that save that that's all we need save that all right save that and that's it then i go back to my style of css and of course at this point let's let's actually check out what's going on so i will go ahead and i will go ahead and right click on this right click on index.html and i will go ahead and open with a live server so make sure you do that right now hey there we go so what do we see right away we have this image that's right this and of course you see how we have the spacing around it any anybody know why that's the case why is that the case can anybody guess curious and can anybody guess why that's the case that's why i said margin so by default the body has actual margin so if i go to style the css i'm going to remove all the margins so for the margin i'm going to say star which you guys know what that means already the store i'm going to say margin 0 heading 0 okay done let's see right there margin disappears i'm going to say box sizing i'm going to say border box that's just something you usually want to do to make it a little bit easier for us okay and honestly that's that's pretty much it on our side but of course this image is just not see it does not extend to full screen so we cannot just do that there's a few things we need to create one let's look at our actual what's it called let me see him open up this down the css here beautiful all right what do you need to do well a few things um oh if you guys have a live background please meet yourselves thank you all right i'm going to work on this specific background image now can anybody know how do we make sure that the spectrum image is behind any application that might be here how do we do that how do we make sure this background image is actually behind anything here can anybody take a guess on what we do in situations like these st yeah it can be sticky yeah that's right militia position absolute position absolute so let's go ahead and do that so i'm i will target this background image that background image boom oh god my stylist here says i'll say that background image and i say this one i'm actually going to create this div as an absolute deal because why absolute means what absolute means hey you know what i'm just going to stick to whatever you tell me to stick to right if i have something for example and i tell you hey you know what position it you know absolutely to the body right what's going to happen is i'm going to say hey position at zero pixels from the top zero pixels from the left and then maybe zero pixels from the right and so what that's going to do which is really interesting is actually going to stretch out this this a little div to go all the way to the top to the left and to the right stretching out there so check this out guys i want to show you here position absolute right then i'm going to say what top zero bottom bottom zero okay then i'm going to say what tab zero no now i should not forget bottom zero top zero you wanna do left zero and then finally right right zero now why am i doing this because what this is doing is stretching this div out from the left to the right hand side from the left to the right hand side that's right correct all right let me see this so now you can take a look at this right of course the image still does not stretch out but if i right click on this inspect element guys if i show you where is my inspector on here oh no right here you see this whole background image is actually the full screen width because i'm saying hey position it absolutely meaning it's like it's like basically you're sticking something like a like almost like a painting you're sticking a painting to a wall it's what you're doing basically if to give you a small reference right you're sticking a painting to a wall now because we have the background image as the full width now what needs what do we need to do well we could be really smart about it and we can actually say the following i'm going to say here uh i'm going to say here i'm going to give it a max height that's part one height of 350 pixels like this okay to make sure we only have specific height okay then what i'm gonna do is the following i'm gonna say let me target the actual background image image so i'm gonna say actually i'm gonna say min height as well min height there we go okay i'm gonna talk about the actual background image and i'm gonna say the following let's say dot background image image right here beautiful i'm going to make this image stretch out the full width so width of 100 save that this out you can see here now it's full width of 100 okay but of course now it's like it's it changes the height you know and i do not want that so i'm going to say what height of a hundred percent for this one and i'm going to say object fit fit cover boom now let me see here let me inspect them on this one so we have this right here the image is with 100 and height for some reason the div is bigger than the image why is that the case height that's so interesting with 100 and height of also 100 but it's not really thinking about that so okay that's fine i'm just at the height of 350 pixels that's fine in that case two so i'm gonna say height of actually it's going to be 350 pixels as well there we go okay and so right here now we have this okay now of course you can see what's happening here is that it's trying to fit up if it as much of the div as possible i give it a height right here i give it a height oh i think i know why this is not working because i need to give this a height so if i give this a height and i say this height of 100 then it will work oops oops there we go i need to give my parent a height and then that way i can give this a height of 100 so it will fit the the actual as much as possible so guys right so look we have the object cover now what i do want to do is i do want to make sure that it kind of stretches from the left hand side and it's not like going away i don't like that so i'm going to use something called object position position and this one's going to be left right so it's always come from the left hand side and so when i stretch it out you see it's just all this is just stretching out the actual div that's all doing that's it that's the smart part about this okay so look the background image is there of course bracket image is there the next portion we're gonna need to work on is what is actually the container is actually the full on you know the fullon thing that's going to contain this application oh my god some so much some of you you guys just like completely erased everything for me so right here right if i go ahead and take a look at this there's one specific container that controls everything guys we want to create a wrapper okay with the could wrap with that we'll make sure to control everything so for example if i'm gonna take this right here let me go ahead and zoom this out you see anybody see how this is the same width all the time well brandon asked the question what does object fit me in good question so let me look at the stellar css so brenda asks what does object fit mean so what does it mean well it means that the image inside that the actual image right is going to try and not stretch out the most important thing with an image if it's being stretched out is to keep the aspect ratio right making sure it's not doesn't look like weird if i don't do this you will see that it starts to get a little bit crazy emc here like i mean maybe not so crazy but if i stretch it out it's not gonna be the best the way that it should be the object cover what it does is it kind of makes it make sure that while you don't stretch the image you know uh while losing or to lose its uh aspect ratio number two it's like saying hey i'm going to take up as much space in this iphone as possible while keeping my aspect ratio all all in check okay that's right retro it makes the image big enough to fit the area without stretching the image actually that's probably the best explanation i've heard so far right so now that's right no stretch marks right retro right no stretch marks that's why it's so important otherwise they can you know imagine stretching you know that's right that's right that's right correct awesome sweet so we got that portion next portion is gonna be well let's create the container so i'm gonna create a container that will contain this whole thing right here i'm gonna call it the container okay so let's go ahead and do that i'm gonna say day of class is equal to container like this the classic container okay and then inside the container a few things we need to take care of well one what is inside this container well we have this header portion that's part one so let's create this one i'm gonna say div class is equal to what header like that okay and inside the header portion what do we have we have what the title and then we have what the the theme because this is to change dark theme to light theme so here we have do class is equal to what title okay and then this will be like a todo title and finally after that is going to be div class uh what theme boom and so that's going to be image source right and the only image you're going to use simply is just assets and we're just going to use the icon sun image that's it guys save that right there and so now we see of course it's actually not showing up can anybody tell me why this is not showing up properly okay why is this not showing up anybody know what do you think why is the actual this to do thing is not showing up it's on a div what do you mean by that sean that's right lucas the image is actually in the front so to make sure this image is in the back what do we do well we go to the stylus css and i actually i actually changed the z index is the index basically is like it's like a layer it's like you know there's layers there's layer on top layer on top layer on top layer it's like for example you're just layering like if you ever anybody here has used photoshop you can layer things right same situation here okay does the index controls like what layer are you if i'm gonna say hey make the layer right here the underlayer using something called 1 right if i do this right there look at this the to do shows up right here you guys can see right there it's right there guys it's up right there all right beautiful so that's exactly what we want all right so let's go ahead and work on this one i will go ahead and work on this header let's go to our stylus css save that okay beautiful okay all right and in the header well actually before that had been to work on the container let me go and look at the containers i'm gonna say what the container right the whole container i'm going to give it the container a width of 100 so it can change because i want to be uh you know mobile friendly but i'm going to give it a max width i'm going to say hey the max width you can take up is going to be 700 pixels right that's going to control how big this width is right here this whole width right here okay max 700 pixels and i'm going to say hey margin the top margin is 0 pixels but then the the left and right margin is going to be 30 pixels just make sure there's spacing here okay okay and then i'm going to give a margin top margin top desktop over 100 pixels boom save that so let's push it the todo list to the from the top right we're not done yet now let's focus now of course on well how do i put this because for example if i take this container and i say background color and i say yellow what do we see here is our container here our dot container anybody know how do we center this container how would we send to this container anybody know that's right we set the display flex on the parent which in our case the parent is what the parent is the body guys i need to create the body all right there and to create the body okay hello from from africa how you doing my friend good good good good way to create the body and for the body we say hey display flex like this flex it baby i forget display flex and then i'm going to say here anybody know what do we do to make sure it's centered horizontally what do we say we say what justify content center oh right there done that's it that's all we do now since now we're working with the body let's now actually change the the font right i want to i want to figure out the font portion here let me see here i want you to type the font portion here okay if i go to my uh the font that we're going to use is a little bit different here the font we're going to use is actually going to be let me see here let me go to my uh piece of code here i'm going to show it to you it's going to be something called josefin sounds same thing if i go to google i type in jose vincenz like this google fonts pop up you can see right here and the one i need to add is going to be the 400 and 700 so what i'm going to do i will go to here 400 select the style and then i'm going to add the 701 as well so right here let me see here 700 i select the style too okay by the way this tells me the actual code i need to use i'm going to copy this whole code i'll give you guys here okay right are importing yeah that's right font so yes correct we are importing fonts from google my friends that's right and you guys want to put this font inside here before the style should actually put it before the style sheet here so to put this font make sure to put this font before you put the stylus css link so make sure it's here and then you have this let's see it says right after guys so very important guys okay very very very important okay so save that no let's not use comic sense guys i'm saying let's use comic says ah that's not good i'm not using can make sense guys sorry all right so great we import the fonts now we can use that let's go back to our application actually which is this one go back this other css okay i'm gonna say the font family for the body it's gonna be this the josef sent and again you can know this by because it's literally telling you here's the fun family you want to use okay that's great that's it here's the final family and so i'm going to use that fun family on here and then i'm going to give it a one a background color of this broken color right here that's a whole bunch of color i know of this image and then i'm going to give it a font size a default font size of 18 pixels guys that's a default font size for this whole application and look right here we've got the image we've got the duelist item we've got this whole shebang it looks pretty good that's it right that's looking pretty pretty good i'm pretty happy with the way it's uh it's going on now with that being said let's work on the header portion okay which one family are you using there were many of them which one from okay so here i'll copy and paste it for you guys okay so i'm gonna copy and paste this for you so you're using the 400 and the 700 guys you see what i did i clicked on the 400 the 400 this one and then the 700 one this one so let me just copy and paste i copied and pasted everything for you guys it's right there okay you gotta free happy you are happy you are learning my friend happy you are learning okay let's work on the header i'm gonna go back to my style of css i'm gonna say dot header that header and in the header i'm gonna say what number one i wanna make sure that this whole let me just clear this out a little bit i'm gonna work on i'm working on this portion so you guys can see it one i want to clear this hole so it's just to do up in the on the top and then the sun is on the bottom well i need to make the sun to be on the right section right here anybody know how do we do that can anybody tell me can anybody tell me what do we do here in that case in that case any suggestions that's correct philosophy display flex right and then okay let's attend today what do you do you flex it i always say this what do you do if you don't know what to do you flex it so okay display flex awesome sweet let me remove this background color because i don't like it at all sweet so you can see now to do is here and of course the sun is right here well i want to actually spread it out to be away from each other i'm going to say justify content space between guys that's right right and then i'm going to make sure there's a line centered vertically i'm going to say align items center save it boom done boom and done okay next one let's work on this title right here make sure it looks so good and clean i'm gonna say dot title okay i'm giving a color of white that's part one okay color of white okay good looking pretty good okay one let's give it a big font size font size font size of let's just say 50 pixels save it oh look at that that's beautiful let's now give it a font weight of bold so you want to build it up bold right here save that nice okay and then after that let's go ahead and give it a letter spacing so i want to space this out a little bit you see the letters are a bit too close i'm going to say letter spacing and i'm going to say uh 10 pixels say hey let's go that's looking really really good and i'm liking this all right i'm lucky this is going that's right align items okay i'm lucky this is going next up so we have this portion done the header is working looks like this let me see if i right click on this one let me see how this looks like let's see here guys is everything centered here the way you wanted to so here's the header that's right title is centered and then the actual theme is centered as well and that's it okay all right that is all good and dandy next up let's go ahead and create this portion see one by one guys one by one one by one one by one first we need to create the html for it so i'll do div class what do you guys want to call it can anybody get an idea what do you guys want to call this one anybody i'm gonna call a new to do or yeah new to do let's say new dash to do that's right new to do item that's right okay and then inside this new to do item i'm gonna create a few things one we have this check mark right here on the left hand side so i'm going to create two div inside this one right okay remember i have this one div right here and then i'm going to have this div right here for the actual text but within the check mark dip which is this one what am i going to create for within the check mark dip can anybody guess not necessarily image sam no there's no image inside here i mean there is an image but it's like hidden all the way down in there yes it's a button it's a div button so i'm actually going to create another div a div button that's this one right here that's it and this is going to be an input right here right okay so let me show you how this works so we're going to create another div so one let's go ahead and actually create that that uh check div so i'm going to say div class is equal to check boom that's the container which is that that is this outer container oh this outer container we have right here that's this container then inside that i'm going to create a check mark guys because why i need to cut a checkmark for the actual circle right so div class and i'm going to say hey div class check dash mark and done so save that div class check mark okay and inside this checkmark this actually well this one does not have a check mark actually but it's a check mark right and how do we actually make sure that it's the proper check that we want well we'll show you guys later now after the check mark what do we do what is the next one we need to create after the check which is what the actual input right so i'm going to call it div class is equal to to do dash what or i'm going to call it new dash to do dash input like this input you see that save that boom okay new to do input beautiful inside this input i'm actually going to create a form form why because the input is going to be inside the form guys the input is going to be inside the form and i will tell you exactly why we use form right okay no i'm not using booster bali no all proper css you will not be able to do this with bootstrap by the way ali this is all custom css so input inside here let's go and create our input input and put beautiful all right i'm giving a type of text and i'm going to give the placeholder now remember the placeholder is what it's what i was going to be inside this portion see this create i need to do that's a placeholder my friends okay so i'm going to say here what create a what a new to do and of course close out this input save that okay save that and here's what we got so far it looks pretty bad i'm not gonna lie another thing we can see is hey look at that we've got it okay we've got the whole thing working that's all guys i hope you guys have a great day okay so rap there's actually no you need to wrap anything here with enough uh sam there's no need to wrap anything all right for this one we have this new to do let's now work on the style for this new to do i'm going to call it dot new to do dot new new dash to do well save it all right okay i need to read it i mean to read when you wrote huh unless what are you talking about okay okay that new to do so first things first i'm going to make this new to do let's give it a background color because i want to see what we're working with here so i'm saying background color yellow okay so here's working with here so we have so you see it's a width of 100 which is really good let's not give it a height now oh 70 pixels now it's height of 70 pixels okay do you write all css gmail just given yes actually i do brenda yes i do everything is from scratch i write everything from scratch i mean that's the way to do it guys if you guys want to be coders you have to write it from scratch right like unfortunately when you go to a job you're not going to have the code a lot of the time sometimes you will have to have the you will have the code that you have to learn how to work with but you know if you want to actually you know write code you have to know how to write from scratch from the beginning from nothing from literally zero just how what i'm doing right here is i'm creating the starting points right right yes it is actually a lot easier to start from scratch sometimes that's right it is sometimes because sometimes actually really hard to you know to fully understand the whole project that you are working with so i usually do i most of the time i do from scratch yeah save that beautiful now instead of using mega color yellow i'm actually going to do a background color of the following which is a really interesting background color you guys might not know you guys can copy for yourself right here this one i'll place it for you here in the zoom chat and same thing is this one right here up that's the background color guys i want you guys to use okay beautiful after that background color is done the next thing is going to be here let me see here is going to be what well the margin let's give it a margin now let's give some spacing here or 50 pixels beautiful and remember who remembers you see how there's these edges how do we create the edges curved edges around this specific div anybody know anybody know who knows that's our border radius oh whatever it is and i'm going to say here six pixels okay save that hey right there beautiful next up right we have new the new to do let's now check on okay the actual check right the check so here so i'm gonna say dot check here okay and i'm going to give this dot check a what a let's see background color of yellow for now same thing always yellow yellow mellow there we go it's not sure enough because we need to give it a width so width let's just say of 70 pixels oh 70 pixels it's still not showing up for some reason why is that with this on your pixels let me see here inspect that element this one new to do we have the check mark all because there is no height on this check mark that's why so to create a height i'm actually going to use something called this flex play effects we never imported the pic which picture you guys talking about the picture we did i imported the picture from by downloading the actual challenge to do list retro so i downloaded this whole thing and i imported all of my assets into my new assets folder that's what i did retro if that's what you're asking about okay great job though uh lucas what height do we need to give it well i'm actually not going to give it a height really enough i'm going to do something something better i'm going to use uh display flex so look if i put display flex on here um flex boom see display flex automatically uh makes make sure that the that um the div stretches full height that's what it does let me ask the question how do you have a pro i always have problem with flexbox what to do keep practicing that's it just keep practicing and then you'll get better at it okay okay so we have that portion all right let me right click on this one so you guys can see it here get a check mark and have this new to the input i want this new to the input to also extend the full width right here you see that guys the full width okay the check we never input it into the code oh the check oh virtual i see what you mean we actually did right here here's the check d of class check you see that it's right here dave class check right here okay great let's go back to our css now within this one the check i'm going to do a few things um well let's create this new to do um actually hold on let me see here i'm going to focus now on the to do input right here start css to input create and then i will say here what do i want to do if i want to make sure that this whole input guy stretches the full width what do i do anybody tell me what should i do what should i do anybody anybody know what would i do i would do what ah no not cover i will do flex grow look at this guys flex girl one because this is a dis so because now look look at this if i do background color for example of orange you see it grows up the whole thing without flex grow one it's not gonna work but with flasker one it went so flex girl is saying hey grow the wood as much as possible that's literally what it's saying guys that's it okay now because of flex girl one that will allow me to go ahead and then i'm here um um um wait let me see here new to do right that will allow me to um look at the form here to actually go to the input and one make sure this input is actually centered so i'm gonna say display flex on this one okay and then i'm gonna say align items center beautiful nice nice nice nice nice and then i'm going to say hey for the input here i need to do input input hey input become width of a hundred percent now it's not there yet because why if you look at the form let me look at this here look at this guys you see we have the form the form is actually really small we need to make sure the form this is a full width right but the 4 needs to be full width of 100 as well so what i need to do as well is need to get make sure the form goes as well so as well do i'll say new to the input right here and i'll say form i'm gonna give this form a flex girl one beautiful just like that and now the form is stretching and as well as the input is stretching too guys right there you go now with the input what i'm going to do yes kyle you could use the same thing with the grid that's right okay with the input that's actually inside here that's where it gets a little bit complicated you know i hate the way the input works by default it's hideous as hell is what all i can tell you and so we're just going to we need to change that one we need to make this a lot better a lot better first things first for the input i'm going to give the padding why because you will see that the text is going to become bigger check this out padding and i will say here padding of 10 pixels meaning 10 pixels on the top and 10 pixels on the bottom and zero pixels on the left and on the right see right there the formulas became bigger just by adding how do you know the pixel number so well is that the cheat sheet so how do i know the pixel so well it's the cheat sheet guys right here so yeah it is a cheat sheet because um when i originally write this right when i originally write this um of course i play around with the pixels right i tried this right i tried that i tried this i tried that i tried multiple things and see which one works the best and i mean it takes me a second like two seconds why isn't the background totally why isn't the back background totally white the background should not be white are you saying why why is the background white because by default a input has a background of white and we're gonna change that so look i'm gonna say now background color is gonna be transparent now see just became transparent okay it's been transparent beautiful after that i'm going to remove any of the prettiest borders that are come predict by default remove the border which is this and you see this outline which is so bad too i hate these outlines i'm gonna say here check this out outline none done so boom now there's no outline next up i'm going to get a color for the color of the text the color the text somebody said why oh he meant the bottom part minus y2 why is yours okay well great question why is my bottom part black and your bottom part is white because you guys did not add the background color right here oh no actually not here actually it's inside the body right here your body background color should be like this if you guys don't have that make sure you add that in right there i'm gonna give it to you guys in the zoom in uh in the chat as well so here so make sure you have a batty background color as well for the body guys okay okay good so we've got that two two two all right allen is there looking really good i'm liking the fa the the way this is working i'm going to give this a font size i want to give it a bigger font size as well font size of 18 pixels right now you can feel like you're doing something hey look at that now we have our todo beautiful and so now let's go back to our check right is this let's check right here save this one see so now you have the spacing to create a check yo what's up oh aaron is in your house yo what oh my phone just my phone just i got too excited my phone just went down what's up aaron how you doing my friend everybody say hi aaron aaron you oren is an amazing guy who with works with us um so that check all right after that what i'm going to do what's up not it's like eriaaron all right i'm going to change the place holder color to be a little bit different here guys so to change this placeholder color here's what i'll do check this out i'm going to say it like this new to do input input placeholder close this one out and here's the color i'm going to give it give it right here done done so see like that and so now this color is a little bit different this placeholder color is a little more lighter which i like a lot which i like a lot i'm gonna actually copy and paste this for you all right same thing for you guys here boom i just copied and pasted the the actual to do the input placeholder okay great so let's now work on the check mark which is so so important as well all right let's check right here now the checkmark is width of 70 pixels correct but of course inside there there's a check mark if you look at my initial html you see there's a check mark this is going to be the actual div that's going to circle right right so what doesn't good question so somebody asked the question oh what does the the two dots mean what does the two dots mean right so if i go back to my style the css what does the two dots mean well really all this means is there's no specific meaning all this is means is like grab the placeholder within the input right sometimes for example um uh what's it called there's many different things like before after sometimes we use two dots as a way to represent to get an attribute to target an attribute within the input okay so nothing crazy it's nothing crazy oh we got 200 likes guys let's get up let's get us to 300 likes on youtube that would be amazing appreciate that guys let me much appreciate it so go ahead guys click the like button and of course here's what i like to say if you're not happy right now and you want to be happy then click subscribe because if you click subscribe you'll be happy that's what i used to say so i like to say right so all right let's work on our check mark uh right here now the check mark itself is basically going to be that the round little circle thingy okay guys round i'm going to give you a width of 30 pixels again sam i know you're asking how my how do i know this pixel so well because as just you know i'm just so brilliant with this that's why i'm just kidding because i have a cheat um all right awesome the two dots indicate two classes yeah great so after that what we're going to do we're going to get a border radius of 30 or 50 percent guys that's going to make it a perfect square you guys didn't know that you guys don't see it yet because we need to create the actual borders i'm going to say border actually remove this border for now let's say border here two pixels solid and this is the color right here so it's the color that was printed for us solid here's our color boom you see it's all the way where let me just let me move this it's all the way right here right here guys okay great i can give this to you guys so you guys can have it as well boom right there beautiful okay beautiful let me go ahead and take a look at this now oh let me see the code all right keep going here after we do the two picks of style you see how it's like it's not there i'm actually going to give the border 50 percent and so now it's it actually it's not it's still on the circle anybody know why it's still not a circle even though i give it a border high hello high and high knowledge how you doing so even if though it's not a perfect circle what i do no the reason why it's not abort 50 still because it's actually because of uh well oh because border radius go good catch guys there we go now it's a perfect circle whoops your check mark your check mark right here make sure you have a color for it my friend make sure you actually have the border make sure the board make sure you have this correctly guys there there's one thing you guys need to understand is that there's a lot of details or very specific details if you don't get your class correctly nothing will show up i'm actually you'll this check mark is inside the check right here you see that right there that's what you have to make sure it's working let's go back to our style of css all right in the check mark of course let's make sure this check mark is also a line centered as well all right that's very important so i'm going to say what i'm going to say display flex right here to flex it then i'm going to do justify content center right and then align item center to put it what in the center or vertically done so and look at this guys it's working just like this it's working it's beautiful it's so beautiful i believe i can fly i'm just kidding right so we got the check mark awesome suede um for and then now let me go ahead and i think yeah let's work on the check mark hover guys that check mark i'm gonna say on the hover and again this two colons whatever it's called right it's to specify the attribute of the actual class so the hover attribute of the class right i'm going to give number one i'm going to change the border color right here to linear gradient that's right look at this guys so if i hover this oh it's not working that's awesome okay i'm going to give the background of this let me see if this is working now oh look look at this look at this this is beautiful this is awesome this backup color so that's an awesome background color all right so actually you can't really do background colors like these so i'm actually going to delete these that's not necessary you actually cannot change the background color off a border or to linear gradient that's not possible unfortunately so we cannot do that one all right but what i however can do is well we got this let's change this check mark to be a cursor pointer so we feel like it's an actual pointer beautiful all right let me see here hey let's go beautiful and i'm going to give this small transition okay guys so a transition to make it feel like it's just uh very smooth right so for the check mark i will say transition all and i will give it a 0.25 seconds and just to give you a small little tidbit yes i can place this for you guys don't worry so i can give you a small tidbit guys here um really cool 0.25 seconds is actually really good standard for like a real nice transition so there's 0.3 0.25 um i think anything above that is like does not really feel good to a user right so i would say 0.25 seconds is the best the best way to do it to go about it all right let me say can i can i do this yes i'm gonna give you the linear gradient no problem here's the linear gradient so you guys can see it right because some of you guys asked about the linear gradient well here you go right there okay we got that one oh what someone's calling me that's not cool it's not cool all right so guys guys look look we have our new to do item it's right there it's working perfectly it's awesome it's the best thing in the world all right okay i actually want to go into javascript crazy now i know we said here that in our plan we want to go into the header then the input section which we did so we did this one done we did this one done with this one done uh this one are done uh this little section we're going to create in a little bit actually i'm going to create the ability to actually uh listen to what we have from here and actually get this text you see what i mean so let's do that right now because i know i feel like i missed javascript a little bit sometimes you know which is okay we all miss javascript okay i'm sure you guys do too right we all missed javascript right guys right i'm just kidding nobody misses javascript sounds like yes yes yes all right let's go to school that's crypto.js and the the one thing i want to create now is going to be well um we want to have a functionality whereby we add item right when we hit this right when we hit enter we are adding a new item so that's going to create a function called add item so i'm going to say function here i'm going to say add item right and nothing inside here so far oh it's not interesting and inside this add item of course what do we need to do to add this item well one let's actually call this function when we hit submit so a few things need to happen if i go to my insta html if i go to my form there's a really cool attribute called unsubmit you see this right on submit so on the submit of the form i'm actually going to call a function called add item right here check this out right look at this add item and that's it so this is the function i'm going to call on the submit right here okay guys beautiful now inside here i'm going to say console.log dialogue add item right here okay click console if i go ahead and if i type something in here guys for this out oh you see it went there and disappeared so let me let me try this again okay guys check this out enter disappeared why is that the case anybody know anybody guess why it's showing and disappearing well if i go ahead and preserve the log here guys if i preserve the lock which will make sure to we'll keep track of all the log no matter what happens look at this hello and enter boom see an item but then what happened guys is that it navigated back to the index.html why is that can anybody tell me why is that can you switch to javascript back for a second okay hold on but anybody know why this is the case why did it all automatically refresh the whole page that's right asada because by default guys by default a form on submit section is going to refresh the page by default form is going to want to take you to a new page that's been something that's been in html for the longest time now i hate the way it is everybody hates it but it's okay what we what we can do is we can actually pass in the whole event which was submitted to us all right i want to show you something check this out if i go to my script.js i pass in the event and i call the event right here save the event right right here i can solo the event save that inspect element i want you to show this to this out okay hit hello hit enter boom this is the submit event so when you submit and i pass in the actual event from my enter oh it was actually going to show me come on oh it's not shown because it refreshed again so what happens is basically it's it's an actual event that we pass in now what you can do is you can actually call it a event that prevent default why are we doing this because by default the form will re refresh your page and we want it to stop from reloading the page that's right khalid that's right martin that's correct save that pom pom inspect them on this one click console i'm going to do it one more time hello boom wait oh it's not a fun oh because i spelled it wrong sorry you had pretty fault there we go e you've mc here pretty no hold on prevent uh prevent default right there okay good save it again one last time guys console hello hey let's go dashed in jaya script i'm not sure why it's dashed so you can see this is the event that we press in really enough look at this guys you can see this event has a lot of different stuff you can see here is it's talking hey the path that was it was clicked you can see this is the path that was clicked on see there's the path that was clicked on we know that we know the source element there's a lot that it's given to us right but we don't actually need this specific event our goal is just simply prevented it from refreshing which is not doing anymore once we've run the default let's actually let us do the following thing let's actually go ahead and say this let's grab the text from this input right to grab this text i'm going to give this input an id input id and the id is going to be what is it here is going to be to do input to do input that's going to be the id here okay so save that go to the input give it an id save that beautiful go back to script.gs and here's what i will do okay i'm going to say lat text i'm going to create a new variable called let's text is equal to what document dot get element by id that's the id i'm going to give it the todo input and that's it for now just that's just that for now now try this out for me to console like the value all i do is console the log the log text that value and it will show you what you put into the actual input box that's it right that's right it's actually a lot that's right there's a lot of stuff in the event uh says event is appreciated don't worry about the retro if it's just make if it's working it's working don't worry about the duplication portion sometimes it will happen that's okay so save that okay let's go ahead and go back and let's let's see if it actually works let's go inspect element in here click on the console we don't use preserve log anymore i will say here uh hello hit enter oh look at that i will say here hi nas or hi lukas or i'll just say hi now let's just say hi nas for now see it's actually getting the data guys we're getting the text that we enter which is awesome little by little does that just trying to make sense okay beautiful next up we got that portion okay amazing of course we can't really do much with it just yet don't worry about it uh we'll continue doing this uh let's focus now on html css one more time okay okay let's go back to index.html the next thing we need to work on is of course going to be what it's going to be what this section right here i call the the massive todo items that's what i call it okay and let's do that if we go back to our next html everybody right now do that with me okay uh the next thing i'm going to do is create a div after this new to do so make sure you're really careful okay make sure you create it after this div say div class is equal to to do to do items wrapper wrapper right here done i'm going to wrap this whole to do items okay and inside this to do wrapper i will have a few things one is going with the to do items actual list so i will say div class to do items now why am i creating this div because why if i scroll all the way down you see we also have this section right here and we cannot forget this section this is the info section i call it okay and so we have this list right here which is the list of todo items and then we have this info section right here at the bottom so what should we call the next div after what should we call the next div after can anybody tell me what should we call next div div div class yeah status equals to do what i'm gonna call it to do i'm gonna call it to do what is it to do items info to do dash items dash information right this is the info about the items okay beautiful to do items info make sense okay sweet save that okay oh good no problem whatsoever that looks pretty good and inside that is we'll have the inside that is this portion right that's what's inside this portion okay beautiful now let's go ahead and create the actual todo items right two items is basically the list of items that's what that you know stands for inside the one to do items guys what do you guys know we have what we have one to do item right so what should we call our negative they have what what should this be called now their class what to do dash what to do what anybody tell me to do item that's right exactly two item and of course this idea is gonna contain two things one first the same thing it's gonna have this check mark right so let's go ahead and do div class just how before div class check same thing same class we're using which is going to make it so much easier for us the class check and of course there's another div class check mark inside that one too right here let me make this a little bit smaller make this a little bit bigger so you guys can see the full code they have class right here i'm called a check mark check mark boom right here div class check mark beautiful i have the check mark well we have the actual check right then let's give it an image image source is equal to something something and this is going to be what assets and we're going to use the icontract.svg guys okay save that of course after that after the check mark we have what the actual what after we've done this one what is the next one do we have anybody know the next one is gonna be what the actual text right the todo text i call it right so let's say here div class to do dash what text boom done done okay to do dash text okay awesome i like it that's beautiful and i'm in here i'm gonna put caught the lawn i have no idea what that came out in my mind because i i don't call lawns here in los angeles for some reason that's the first thing that came to my mind when i said when i want to put it to do item maybe because i just missed cutting lawns i don't know cut the lawn okay okay so cut the lawn all right to do text and let's see what we're working with now here okay so here is it here's what it is okay of course this is our todo item of course now this todo item has a few portions to it somebody said what do i use to draw on the screen i use something called screen brush guys it's called screen brush it's only for mac sorry sam was like it's better than shoveling snow that's right i've done that too yeah so okay let's go back to our established season and style our what style our todo item the fancy todo item let me see here all right i fainted to do to do item okay let's go to the item here could it create a new todo item here no to do dash item beautiful to do item all right but actually i want the first one is going to be the todo item container that to do item dash uh wrapper is gonna be the one that's as well boom right okay to do item wrapper one let's go ahead and give it a margin tab my event was dashed because the function when i put the function instead it's okay okay good awesome sweet so all right so let's go ahead and make a dash so i'm gonna say margin top one margin dash top is gonna be what 30 pixels because i want to create some space in between the top and the bottom section that pushes much to 30 pixels to item wrapper then i say hey you know for that one after that i'm going to say uh background color is going to be this background color boom did i put it wrong it's not affecting you whatsoever hold on let me see here to do item dash rapper i feel like something's not right here let me go back to my html oh to do item wrapper it's this right here no it's actually it is items items wrapper see to do item items wrapper i'm not putting it correctly items rapper there we go much better much better okay all right after that i will go ahead and work on the todo item individual ones okay first things first is width is going to be 100 always and let's make it a background color of yellow for now like i always like to do that what do you see here hey let's go beautiful right awesome you can see the that the actual uh little box the little circle thingy one is to the you know above and so we're going to do to make sure they're full from left to right anybody know anybody know everybody know what do we do guys you know the drill now at this point you know the drill zoom you know the drill what do we do yeah we flex it that's right so display flex boom cut the lawn is now fixed see just like that so easy i'm going to now give it a height of 70 pixels beautiful after hey there we go beautiful after that i'm going to give it also a background actually i don't need the background color for this one i could just remove this background color it's not necessary at all there we go that's looking really really good i'm liking what's going on here um i'm also going to give it a let's see here um a border bottom a small border bottom here boom right just smaller to to to to make these borders a little bit you know to divide up all everything's inside here okay awesome sweet let's play flex that's good now i'm going to focus on to do text dot 2 dash text beautiful to do text is going to be what also see this catalon is one it's a really you know it's all at the top and i want to put it what centered okay so i'm gonna well i'm going to use display flex display flex it then i'm going to use a line item center right here beautiful and then i'm going to give the color like this nice color beautiful that's looking so nice i'm liking this i'm gonna give it a font size of 18 pixels nice beautiful yes let's do it okay and then finally the last i'm going to do is for the check mark if we go back to the check mark where is our check mark right here inside the actual check mark you see right here i want to center the actual check the svg icon so i'm going to say the following i will say check mark display flex it like we always like to do it display flex it and then align item center boom and then justify content center boom done that's right that's how we do it right and you see it's not centered wait what the heck how does it already know that all right because the background is this one that's funny okay good let me go back to here i think i know for this rapper i didn't give you guys the color guys make sure here's the color if you guys don't have it let's flex it something you said let's flex it color it says that's right we're always flexing things guys that's how we do it we flex you get strong so we do all right so after that a few things i want to do i want to actually um create a few of these items so i'm going to go to my to do item i'm going to copy be careful with your copy guys be careful with the closing and the opening tags trust me if you have random closing tags yours your shit's gonna be broken and i know the people i'm looking at okay make sure you have your copy but see this is why formatting is so important guys this div is the closing deck for this deal is this one right here it's like you closing your box you have to open the box and then you have to close the box right somehow like if you close the box or you use a different lid to close the box it's it's that's not the correct lid that's right so make sure you have the right box because sometimes i'll be like guys just please be careful around this boom boom i'm gonna make the same thing there we go now we have three things right you see the guys but now start and dips well okay somebody said any any techniques to find out starting end as well uh one is look at this make sure one you have a prettier to make sure it's aligned properly two is you can use something called called a prettier here let me see here it's called uh brad to your let's go bracket prettier i think it's called um bracket and see it's called bracket pretty oh there we go bracket pair color right so you guys can install this one the bracket per colorizer that was actually it will actually color the things for you so that could actually be very very helpful for you honestly yeah uh it's like it could be really cool too yeah right rainbow brackets or black and pink colorizer whichever one you want to use i'll just keep it simple guys just keep it simple okay beautiful so we've got our todo items of course let's go ahead and add our cursor pointer here so let's go to style of css the next thing i want to do is the following which is going to be i want to add the border radius to our to do items wrapper so same thing border radius just how did the last time for this one it's gonna be what anybody remember it's gonna be six pixels save that beautiful say that border radius six pixels and there we go but of course it's still bit weird you see how this thing is a bit awkward this is awkward too well i can fix that by just simply saying overflow hidden hidden done simply and done done done done done next up okay i'm now going to give a small black shadow to make it look just dope small black shadow it's going to look like this right here here's my box shadow save it let's make it look it it will make it look like it's popping out of the screen here's your box i'm gonna give it to everybody in the zoom chat and if you're in the youtubes i'll give it to you on the youtube store don't worry i got you guys don't worry all right so let's continue actually that we got all right the youtubes are good all right the next thing is going to be the hover effect i want to focus on the hover effect now for this portion okay um if you're gonna spam on the youtube i will throw you out sorry hi user uh sorry that's just how it is okay all right so let's work on the hover effect of this specific you know um you know not the check mark but the actual um the on to do item hover so i want to work on this one where's my hover my hover effect to do that uh i will say hey you know what on the hover on the hover to do item let me look at this here so to do item here dot to do item i'm gonna say hover okay what do we want to change in the hover if you look at our original original item right here you can see it's like it feels like it's like a popping out of the screen it feels like it's popping out of the screen so the way we actually do that it's a really cool um strategy that i like to use personally all you're doing guys is one we're adding a small box shadow and two you're lifting the actual uh three like two pixels up that's it so check this out on the hover one i'm going to translate it two pixels up so basically this right here means hey vertically i'm going to push the full on div two pixels up that's what that means okay that's just transform after that i'm going to get a box shadow right here and i'm going to give you guys a box shadow as well don't worry i got you guys i got you boom i got you guys i'm not gonna let you guys to get stranded don't worry always i'm going to change the border color from this uh this one to actually this one to a black border color so on the hopper check this out on the hover wait now that's the correct one oh look at that look at this look at this look at this everybody look at that now a few things i want to take care of first right so let's go ahead and number one use a transition which is really important and we can always do that so i'm here here style the css okay careful we get a small transition with a like this on a transition here i'm gonna say transition transition transition good i'm gonna say all for now 0.25 seconds but i want to say ease yes save that let's see here oh look at this beautiful look at that look at look at that look at look at this guys look at this it's so good now one thing i do want to make sure you see how i want to make sure that the z index this one actually goes overlays on top of it so don't worry i will actually make this one display flex and that will overlay it on top of it display flex you'll see what i mean ah i guess not that's okay i'll make it a z index in that case um the index one but on the hover i'm going to give it a z index of 10 of 10. let me see this will work no not yet why is it not going above it that's so weird interesting display flex border cursor pointer that's cool let's put into cursor pointer now okay well i'll fix the neck is later with you guys don't worry how do we decide where to put the transition the transition uh how you decide to produce a well that one is pretty much you decide where to put the transition based on the item so for example we're trying to listen to do item right which is this box right here right so i'm going to put the transition on this portion right here that's it right i think um let me transition this one so transition all but i'm going to change the transition property maybe let me see here this one no still not it's not that's so interesting i'm not sure why that's the case the hover effect is not working the way i want it to work the border bottom is there okay i'm not sure why maybe the index of minus one you see that no still no really that's so weird okay well it's okay we can figure it out as we continue on it's okay right from todo items that's right okay so we got that portion the next portion i want to figure actually with you guys is going to be uh the todo items info portion so let's work on that one i'll go to my insta html we have us to do add this info portion so if we actually look at what we need to work on right it's gonna be what well we have how many deals do we need to create guys anybody remember how many of you to create for this one okay who could tell me how many divs okay how many this guys well we have what three that's right we have one two and three that's it right so let's do that right now all we gotta create is go back to my our index.html and inside here i'm just going to go ahead and do one create a div here div class class is equal to what items left that's the how many items are left inside here okay right and then i'm gonna say five i don't again temporary placeholder data okay then i'm gonna say what div class div class is equal to what items dash statuses okay great not 10 statuses and i'm going to give a quick few spans of span span of let's just say there's an all all status after that we're going to create the span and span is used just to so we can go ahead and just you know change uh the styling of certain you know div tag or certain just text you know spam then we have active right here and final last is going to be span span of completed beautiful done right the last that we're going to create is right here div class called items dash clear boom and this one i'm going to say span i can say clear completed done so done my friends okay okay clear span completed all right so we got that portion okay let me go and see how this looks like on our application oh that looks horrible that's okay that's where style comes in that's where the style comes in guys it's always about the style that's right so one um one let's go back to our style the css one of course we need to target our to do what to do items dash info and for this one what well let's give it a height so let's give it a height of of 70 pixels let's give it a width of 100 okay sunny pixels after that i'm going to say hey you know what uh let's give it a different color here so color of the actual text should be a little bit different here sam is like man looks better than mine if something's wrong it's probably because your div is not correctly closed you might not have the right closing tag if it's not right okay awesome and then of course we need to put them from left to right so what do we do that guys remember that what do we put something from left to right what do we do here to put something from left to right we we do we flex it that's right so just display flex beautiful that's it right but of course i want to do a little bit differently so i'm going to space these things out so five items i want to make sure there's correct space between them so i'm going to say justify content what space between done so look at that right beautiful okay next one i'm going to give a padding a padding like this and say padding top and bottom is going to be 0 and then left and right is going to be 30 pixels both boom done so okay done so after that let's go ahead and uh put them in a sentence i'm gonna say align items center and my friends that's pretty much it that's it i see that's it so look look we did now of course we're not done yet fully i wanna check now on the statuses portion so well let's look at the status this portion said that item that statuses right here okay and here i want to say display uh flex of course flex i'm gonna say just if i cut center boom just as always centers and then i'm going to change the actual colors of the span so here for i'm going to give it some kind of a padding here so item statuses span tag i'm going to give it a padding of zero for top and bottom okay i'll have to oh good hope oh everything's okay lamont tap the bottom of zero and then uh left and right is going to be what four pixels save that okay that's going to give that span for that item let me see it's not doing it right now nope so item stat assistant did i spell it right items oh items their statuses it's items their statuses there we go nice so panning zero i'm going to give it a not four but maybe five pixels yeah so there we go that works too and i'm going to give the cursor pointer save that so that way when i hover over this it becomes feels like a button but of course we can make it even better because on the hover of the aesthetic system say items the items there's that this is on the hover of this section i will change the color of it as well that's right the color which is this one i'm going to give you guys the color right now here's the color those are you on youtube here's the color right here as well boom janjo okay we got the color so now if i go and have a oh dang i just um no that's not right so it should be item statuses span hover not the whole thing hover so go one by one you see now it's one by one that's it it makes it very easy and of course we also need to make sure there's an active one so if i if i select one i need to give an active in maybe css class for example so for example maybe this span has a class here of active active that's the one we clicked on right so the same thing is going to happen here fallacy says i'm going to say the comma item statuses span dot active i know it's right spend that that's right active also same thing so you see now the all becomes the active one and the last thing i'm going to do is also target this clear completed as well so let me go ahead and do this right now so let's go to target this declare completed portion right here this item's clear items clear i'm going to give this one a what a cursor pointer as well okay cursor pointer and then i'm gonna give it a text align end so that it's always at the end of of everything so it's always pushed to the right hand side okay like this always push to here that's why i give it text on my end and also on the hover of this i also want to make sure that the color changes too so i'm going to say comma items if you guys didn't know but comma is a way for us to apply the same style to multiple things clear hover let's see it boom done that's it look at this done done done done done done done that's it guys we've got our uh i mean application is not done fully because we need to get the javascript to it fully but look that's pretty cool wouldn't you say so i would say so it's pretty awesome we've got a really amazing looking application of course that's not fully working just yet but that's okay we can we can fix it that's okay we can fix it we can make sure we can make sure it's uh not you know differently right and that's it oh let me see why is it that i need to do hover that still does not work the way i want it to be this one works properly but this one does not why is that i'm trying to understand why is it that my todo item is not looking the same way that it should be as before here oh i think because maybe it's the background color you see here let me see here oh that's why because oh there we go that's why because by default this background color is transparent so i need to set the background color on the todo item to make sure that when i hover over this you see now it covers everything else that makes sense so much more this way you don't need this this is horrible the index portion right now right here that's right yeah i'm really curious yeah yeah because again that's what's going on right is when i hover over this it's gonna translate it two pieces up but what happened is the background color was transparent initially and so it kind of looked like this you see when i hover over this you see the little white uh border from the top uh to do item still appears you guys see that yes or no right so to remove that all i do is just simply put a background color on the whole thing and so now it looks like this that's it guys all right so that my friends is pretty much done now let's work on the actual javascript portion yeah yeah the pro vacuum brush is cool right it's really cool so look here's what we got so far guys oh that looks sexy yeah that looks amazing i like it now let's work on the the firebase that's right yes okay i am ready my friends let's do it holy moly macaroni i'm going to one open up firebase so everybody right now if you're on my on my screen go to firebase.google.com danzo what you want is you want to log in create an account if you do not have one create an account right now i will use my clever programmer account beautiful and then i'm going to go to console so sign in if you do not have it just sign in with it and then you can see here that i have the todo list one that's for from for me let's create a new one here i'm going to create add project let's say to do live right because we're doing a live right now click continue uh yeah sure you can enable analytics that's fine that's not a big big deal okay select an account select default account create project wait for it to finish that's what i'm talking about wait for it to finish finishing up good good good good click continue and there we go okay next thing what we need to do is click on this little icon it says the web icon this right here let me go ahead and refresh this this little icon right here right here right here click on this icon this is going to be firebase steps which option you selected oh it's really hard for me you just just click add property go to firebase here okay let me create a test one go to console console click uh make sure it's like the correct uh correct one i'm gonna say sorry click add project right here just enter your project name let's i'm gonna i'm gonna do tests for now because i'm gonna use the one i created before which is this one but somebody asked hey what option do you do so test continue click continue an account should be default account clear project and that's it that's all you have to do honestly okay let's say my friends okay i'm gonna close this up because i don't need this at this point but i do have this so want to create that account okay you click on this one click on the web portion click on web and then let's create it let's register our app i'm gonna say to do live beautiful click register app all right so here's what we got this is a lot so the first thing to do is copy and paste all of this script stuff these script tags you see these copy and paste this is your script app so you want to copy this portion yes firebase is free by the way let's go to back to any html and then let's go ahead and make sure you put it before script.js okay everybody but before script.js boom done let me remove this i don't need this at all it's right here so now we have a firebase app we have we're importing the firebase app right here firebase analytics right here that's looking pretty good okay and then what you want to do is copy this portion to this config so i'm going to copy this config like this command c config you should have your own config guys okay command c the config portion command c and then command command save this let's create a new file called firebase.js dot gs this will be your configuration file boom paste it into here can i paste those here so i mean i can do this for you but i don't want anybody messing with this one so you guys should create your own config if you do if you want to use my config here using effect which is this one it's in the actual store guys here just use this one can thick guys right here luca says config without the script tags yes well we're putting the yes that's correct yes lucas can think without the script tags so when we do this right now right there right forget the script text because the script tags is for us to write inside inside the script the javascript file remember when we create the fibo.gs we are already inside the javascript file so we don't need to do not need to put script tags around it that's the thing okay that's why we do not need the script text all right so we've got the configuration file all is good there save that click on continue go to console and that's it now the next one we're going to work on is called the realtime firestore database click on the firestore database click on create database start in test mode click next enable and so remember test mode enable test mode enable test mode put into test mode and click enable let me see here provisioning cloud firestore let's see if it works nice click on start your first collection and we're gonna say to do dash items now collection is a database guys a collection is a table right of items right that is what collection is so if you want to store something like a list of for example to do items right your collection is the what's going to store those to do items so for example to do items is that one big collection but inside the collection we have individual items so inside here i'm going to create a visual item i'm going to give it a document id you guys can see it's auto generated by um you know firebase itself and i'm going to say the text for this one is going to be cut the lawn i don't know why catalan is still the top one for me cut the law and say status is going to be active why because if you look at our todo list app okay you can see it says active completed there's two statuses active and completed so same thing here active save and so now we have our collection here right there and now we have one of our first document our first data document inside our collection the to do items all right beautiful now to actually get this data we're not done yet guys we need to go and figure out how do we configure firestore some say uh firestore firestore firestore get started okay firestore gets started i'm going to go down and here's what you need so the one thing we're missing here is the actual firestore uh you know uh code so i'm going to copy this fire's firebase firestore code command c and i'll give you guys the actual code here boom and then boom right here you're going to copy this script tag and you're going to put it inside index.html hit enter put it inside after the analytics one you see this one analytics portion put it after that that's it okay after all of this what you want to do is you want to import the firebase.js so we'll say script source right here firebase.js okay the configuration file for firebase does that make sense that's correct khalid firebase collections is kind of like a mongodb collections that's correct yes you're right on that one you're right okay so we got the portion command save on this one and then the last thing we need to do is if we scroll down you see we need to initialize the firebase firestore right here and that's why the firebase firestore it's as simple as that so i'm going to say vardb i'm going to go back to my wirefirebase.js and boom now i have initialized it and because i initialize it with adb that means i can access it anywhere inside my application make sense okay we got that save that now that's all good next up what are we going to do well the one thing i do want to do is you see now we have all the data to add this let's actually create the functionality to add our todo item to the database so let's try it out okay so i'm going to insert the add item functionality let's go to script.js inside here this is our ad item functionality i'm going to what do the following i'm going to say okay to add something into the into the database here's what we've got to do db.collection add you see collection is the collection we created and then here's the data we want to add just simple as that honestly oh let me move this to here let's try it out let's try that together so i'm gonna say here db.collection collection the collection that we created which what is the collection guys we created anybody know what is the collection we create anybody remember that one what is the collection that we created anybody remember this one what is the collection that we created who remembers that's right to do items so to do items to do dash items okay beautiful save that one of course and then after that one uh let me go ahead and make sure it's all good after that one we do what to do items and we say dot add same thing dot add right here and we add ourselves an object okay an object okay and this object has a few things one we have the text value i have the status value so text right here and where do we get the text does anybody know that's right retro db is for database where we got db is because remember we initialize the db here you see firebase firestore it's inside here so if i kill that database if i set this database then this would be data base see that but we call it db for short db boom done does that make sense retro so text what text are we adding to this one we're adding the what text we're getting the input but we're doing text that value to get the actual value of the text and then we say status by default the status that we set when we add a new item is what active that's the default text and then once we go ahead and add this in so let's go ahead and save it and let's go ahead and actually try it out so let's save this okay everybody ready for this are you guys ready are you ready let's go let's go let's try it out okay so it's ready so let's add for example like i'm going to go to the gym okay oh i want go to the gym i'm going to hit enter and my expedition is to see this inside here inside here somewhere are you ready for this okay let's go back to my here hit enter and where'd it go oh [Laughter] go to the gym is indeed right here my friends it is here look at this guys boom boom boom boom boom boom boom that's exactly what we want to do you see just like that okay after now of course you see how i hit enter but this did not clear where to do that i'm gonna say now textile value is equal to nothing that's right so now if i try this again so i'm resetting the actual value inside this input box i'm gonna say okay go now go to the market and enter boom we see disappears and then inside our database jim we'll go to the market and then catalon it's working everybody it is working somebody said kelly said i'm going to flex to the css gym that's right that's funny so there you go my friends that's how we properly do it okay next up of course let's go ahead and now work on the next portion which i'm going to focus on is actually getting this data right here cutting the lawn whatever is in the database so what i'm going to do is scroll and create a function called function function called get items okay it's called get items all right let's get these items this is going to be a little not more difficult guys okay this is a little bit more complicated guys now okay get items now to get the items what we're going to do is we're going to use db and again if you go back to the database uh thing every data you see that get done but the way we get it is a little different we're going to use a realtime database getter function it's called db dot collection what collection are we working with anybody know somebody tell me what collection you're working with zoom people zoom let's go what are you working with to what to do what anybody to do items that's right two items okay all right two items and then after that one we're gonna use the code on snapshot guys so this out it's called on snapshot boom so a snapshot is a picture of a database it's like basically you're taking a picture right now and then you gain the current data okay that's inside the database that's what we call on snapshot well on snapchat is so powerful is because on snapchat is actually going to send us the data you know whenever we update something that's a really cool part about it so whenever something inside our database updates this will get called inside here it's it's using something called a uh what's called not a web hook but it's using something called a socket you guys did not know that close it out also double up socket and i can even give you guys if you guys are on zoom i can give you guys the actual code if you guys are interested boom here it is okay inside that i'm actually going to loop through the snapshot so let's go and see and what we got here so i'm going to say console.log the log snapshot that's right that's correct my ul is this the current state of the database so let's go ahead and i'll log snapshot let's see what we get of course i need to call this function now called get items at the bottom okay let's see inspect down on this one console console hey look at this uh yeah looks weird huh but look at this you see we have an array of three items you see this array of three right so you have docs right here that that's what we're doing here so to actually get this these docs that's the items that we get from a database here's what we'll do we'll say the following snapshot.docs dot docs now for each we're going to loot through every single document dot four each oops not like this for each like this and for every single dog we'll do something with it we'll say okay well we're gonna push the these uh array of items into uh the database or two into an array because we need to get the data so we'll say let items is equal to an array guys and then i'm gonna push the dock into the rate but but we'll do different we'll say items dot push to get the data we'll push the what doc look at this doc dot data you see that dot data so let me show you exactly what's going to happen now in this case okay let me exactly show you what's going to happen here so as we loop through everything i'm going to now console log the items check this out inspect downline this one oh let's go we got three items coming directly from a database hey that's what i'm talking about guys right directly from a database that's amazing okay i'm loving it but the one thing we don't have is the id you see what i want to do is i want to get the id of these elements of every single element which is unique id because when i click on when i want to click on this i should be able to mark you know for me to mark something completed i need to get the unique id of that little thing so here's what i'll do i'm going to do the following i'm going to say like this i'm going to say i'm going to create going to create an object and then i'm going to say id and the way to to get the id is called doc dot id comma and i will do this dot dot dot data so uh maybe a little more complicated than usually but this is called uh a what is it called i forgot i forgot it's the uh it's called an operator it's called transformative operator separation operator i forgot what it's called if you guys uh sp thank you it's called a spread operator i forgot came out of my mind it's called a spread operator basically it's like it's like imagine this it's like if you have a present okay and the present is the data what's inside the present is the data what you're doing is you're literally unwrapping the present right and imagine let's just say imagine the president has small gifts inside of that you know inside the big gift what you're doing when you're using a spread operator is that you're taking a small gift outside that big gift and you're just handing out to people right in my case i'm taking out the data from the doctor data i'm spreading it out to the actual object that's right it's called a spread operator okay okay and so now if i save this if i right click and split them on this one again oh we've got the id the active the text beautiful exactly what we want guys exactly we want okay so now we've got the data what do we do with that data how do we showcase the data here inside here that's the interesting part huh that's the hard part actually that's the part that's going to get a little bit confusing for most of you guys so i'm going to create something called a generate items section and here's how i'll do it so i'm going to create a function called generate items generate function i'm just like i'm well past confused but i'm learning so it's like again you're creating an object but uh you're putting the id of the object and then you're putting the data of the object okay so it's creating your function and it's called generate a items boom okay generate items inside the general items i'm going to pass in these items some say items here right here and i'm going to call this after i actually get all my items from database i'm gonna say generate items and items boom done save boom done okay great that's exactly what i want now inside here is a few things i'm going to loop through every single item okay items you probably can see at this point item is done for each but that for each so for every single item again i'm looping through every single item okay let me go ahead and and let me say insert it with dom that's right we're going to insert it okay with dom so i'm going to say console.log the item for now save it console the log item and we have ears individual items one two three that's the one that we got from a database is coming directly from here okay everybody see that it's okay so the this portion usually is going to be a little more confusing guys okay so as long as you cut up some sam that's good okay just kind of loop just gonna dig with me okay here um a few things are gonna happen here so remember when we are looping through items we need to add them to our todo items correct right well um check this one out huh how do i do this make it simpler for you well okay so first things first i'm going to do is i'm going to create an item's html a section here so i'm going to say let items html right i'm really going to create our um literally going to create my html here right the html i'm going to put inside the html document okay okay after that i'm going to say items that items html i'm going to say plus equal to so i'm appending some html and i'm going to use i'm going to use something called string literals right here guys i know you're like what the hell we're doing those we'll check it out plus equal to is you're literally concatenating your html right i'm going to take my todo item that's coming in from here right here right i'm taking my todo item guys like this take it copy it right that's why we did it in the first inside html i'll go back to script tech and inside string literals which by the way if you don't know what string labels are it's this little key tag on the the on the left keyboard right here let's get all the way on the left hand side but this will allow us to use variables you'll see what i mean exactly paste the whole html in that's right now it's a sas product that's correct yes right paste the whole 8 tillman html in boom okay i turn off the music for support here wait okay never mind okay so inside this html okay awesome sweet but really cool thing we can do with this one is like i said because you're using string literals i can actually change this up guys i can actually change this up to be like this let's change it up change it up to be a uh um look at this i'm using variables now item dot text you see what i mean so depending on what the item is remember i go back to here and i expect element on this one right this is the item this whole thing we get the text portion from it using item.txt and we simply replace it inside this html document this html tidbit and i'm going through every single element i'm going through every single and i'm pushing it into the items html right so then here's the cool part then i can do the following then i can say like this i can say here i can say after i loop through everything here okay after i look through everything here okay i'm gonna say uh let me see here i'm gonna go to the parent one that to do items here yeah to do items that's right to do items that's correct i'm gonna go to the parent one okay and then i will say here the following will say document that query selector the query center okay ready i'm going to say to do items right i'm using the class i'm going to say that in our html html is equal to the item's html that i created and that's it guys so look what we have now go to the gym go to the market right there look guys look i called the function generate items i'm passing in the list from the database i'm creating the html on the fly and all i'm doing is i'm setting it i'm replacing the inner html of this big div this big to do items div with the html that i created myself it's called dinamically you see this is static if i use javascript i'm doing it dynamically but of course guys we're not done we're not done okay because the reason being actually is well a few things actually i have to be able to click on this and have this actually make this a completed item lucas i'll spend the next eight hours that's good that's good right i have to be able to click on this right here oh oops sorry my bad i should be able to click on this on this items html right here or on this check mark to be able to market complete it okay well to click on it one we have to create an event list so when i click on this i have to call some kind of a function correct yes or no i have to call something something needs to be done when i click on it right so when i click something needs to be done well how can i do that what should this out i'm going to create a function called called function i'm going to say function create event listeners that's right and so what i'm going to do is the following i'm going to say let all to do items is let me see let all to do not item but to do to do let's say check marks for now check marks is equal to document the query selector the query selector all i'm going to grab all of them all of the check marks that i within to do a what to do item so for example if i go to minus html you can see i have a to do item i'm going to grab average check mark so i'm going to say dot to do item just follow along guys so dot to do item dot check dash mark so what i'm doing is the following okay so let's see here i'm gonna show you guys you see so what i'm what am i doing here well i'm grabbing literally every single check mark that's in here and let me show you how that's being done if i can slog it here console.log okay to do check marks save and i call this create event listeners after i create this html i say create event listeners now i'm calling this function in here okay so let me inspect them on this one and look see i'm getting all the check marks one two three so number one i'm literally grabbing all the elements i'm picking out all the little presents and then now i'm going to create for every single one of them i'm going to create an event listener check this out to do check marks dot for each so i'm looping through every single one of them done so okay i'm gonna say one check mark okay and so i'm gonna say check mark dot create event listeners no that tastes like it's actually admin listener it's add event listener and it's gonna be click okay on the click of this event listener what am i going to do i'm going to what let me see here function boom boom on i'm going to what i'm going to call a function called mark complete so i'm going to it's right when i click on this what shall we call guys you guys tell it what should we call when i click on this uh button what shall we call well what should we do you guys tell me what do you guys think what do you think i'll wait for you guys what do you guys think what shall we call sam i know javascript is a little more tricky guys that's right mark completed right so after i click on this check mark i'm going to call the function to to do something right to like mark this completed so number one let's create a function called mark completed right and inside that right we'll say hey console.log mark completed ow right that's right mark completed okay let me try that so i'm gonna say here now i'm gonna say mark completed i'm gonna call a function okay again random function but what am i doing i'm creating event listeners an event list or javascript is literally basically it's like i'm listening it's like it's like hey did you click on the button yet did you click on the button yet did you click on the button yet did you click on the button yet no okay did you go to the bottom yet so literally it's just checking the whole time and when you do click it you when you do click on it it's going to do something that's it so let's try it okay right click and spike the element in this one console let's click on it hey see hey hey so it's actually calling the thing that i want now with that being said let's actually update our item so look to update our item now with the specific id okay to market completed what are we gonna do well first we need to actually grab the item database remember we are updating an item that's already existing so to update an item let me show you add data every day i'm going to show you how to firestore update item uh update update update update update update update update update update let me see update update right here at the bottom here so what do we do the first we need to grab the specific so we we grab the collection so let's do that right now so we'll do db dot collection just so we have it here what collection we're doing to do items right then we see what dot what dot doc but you see we have to grab it by the id but like what id we do need to grab like where's id coming from this is a specific id the id i'm looking for is actually this id see this id right here this id this is the unique id that's going to allow me to reference it it's the address basically to this id but we don't have it like all we did was call this function where do we supposed to get it like where mmhmm what do you guys think anybody any ideas from a db yeah but okay great but well how do you know what we clicked on how do we know that because remember um well this one has a unique id so does this one so does this one right every single item has a unique id we're actually going to go from the check mark guys so look at this let's console the check mark look when i go ahead and i actually might complete it i can actually give it but actually not yet because look at this check mark is an actual it's familiar i know i know sam i know go the restroom go to the restroom i want to go buy a restaurant too trust me trust me i'm gonna go to the bathroom too [Laughter] but you should not go right now um okay so what we want to do with this one is is actually kind of like this okay i'm going to go ahead and and uh well let me see i'll click on it hmm market completed i'm gonna use something inside my html you'll see what i mean here don't worry about it i'm gonna do an attribute called data dash id dash id is equal to a string and i'm going to give it the id that comes from my item guys from the database let me say item oh item that id so i'm going to pass into every single uh check mark on the id of the actual item so check it out now so here's how this gonna work if you look now look if you look at here inspect element on this one you can see it's it's pretty simple now right so every single look at this if i look at my check mark you see we have a unique id so every single item has a unique id that we get from database right now how do we grab that when we actually create an event listener well well what we can do is the following so here grab get data uh data set id from element right here a few ways all you got to do is if you do it properly i'll show you here is something called dataset no no no no no no no no no no right here so it's called that data set so you see how they're using an id here or did they did that info so i'm gonna say the following say here i'm gonna say i'm gonna pass in here check mark right here that's the element that data set set the id that's right i know this is crazy huh crazy stuff that's okay okay so this check mark that's the actual element right that's the element coming from where from here that's the html element because this html has almond has an id which is if you inspect them on this one has is this one the way you can grab it is dataset.id and so now i can pass this into here guys look at this i can say now okay okay cool mark completed let me say console.log id okay cool inspect element this one console click on it oh oh oh oh you see if i keep clicking on this one look at this inspect element guys look at this guys i'm clicking it's ld06 aw right that's the one i clicked on if i go to console ld608w right there you see what i mean so we got the id and because we now have this id we can now update it this is we got the address that we clicked on that's the cool part about this okay so pay attention here i'm going to grab this idea by the id like this all right then i'm going to do the following i'm going to say okay well i'm going to grab it first because i want to check if it exists i'm going to update it okay so look at this i'm going to say i'm going to actually save this into a variable select item item is equal to the collection i'm going to grab this item from the database this is again coming from a database from a database okay from this is coming from my database okay after that this took me in bubble io a few minutes but this is much more fun yeah this is a lot different than than what you'll get with these uh automatic creation stuff so look okay great then i'm going to grab it item.yet i'm going to grab that specific item that's that's just how i was supposed to do it with the database and then when i grab it i'm going to use something called then inside is that then i'm going to do a function function to do apart are you talking about this one the actual this one you see i put the id inside here guys if you're if you're wondering right here i'm going to call it a function function and then inside this function okay i've got myself this document that we we're getting from a database and it's a document and say here inside this document i say what i want to say if this document exists in the database again this this is something we can do in firebase if it exists in database here's what i'll do i'm going to what well let's console the log the status of this document i'm gonna say just document dot data here is oh i'm gonna say here like this here is the dock boom okay done so here's a dog okay cool uh let's see how this works out now i'm really curious now how this works out let me see here i'm gonna right click inspect them on this one console click on it oh this is coming directly from a database guys directly from a database look at this right so look i'm going to grab it now here now if document exists i'm going to add another if stream i'm going to check the the actual status so remember if we click on this if the status currently is active we're going to make it until completed but if i click on it again then i'm going to say completed to active so for example i'm going to say the following i'm going to say if actually i'm going to say so someone says let's status watch this stat status status is equal to doc dot data right here dot status like this okay beautiful i'm gonna say here if the status is equal to active right then we update it to be completed then we say item right here the update right that's the firebase function and we say what the status now now is which one what is it now sam is like it is so much easier to make a todo list on a piece of paper with marker that's so true but where would the fun and that be huh right now we call the completed status that's right otherwise else if the status is equal to what completed and we click on it and what we change what do we update to now the update the update to what status of what what status will does it become active you see that guys right there active that's it so now it becomes actually not like this active that's it it becomes active my friends my partially just went to the roof david says it's okay trust me guys it's okay so look now look it's just what happened we checked we got the document from database we get the status we check if the current status inside the database is active we change to completed and if the current status aside uh this is completed dimension to active so it's kind of like that okay so let's actually check to feel how this works out so let me see so we have the go to the gym okay currently inside our database go the gym is an active status okay if i click on it it should technically be completed okay let's try it so if i click on it let me right click on this one let me make sure there's no error here just oh you're here okay click on it okay so we get the database stuff great awesome sweet all right let's go to our database hey it says completed right there look guys we got it my friends we got it got it that's right okay that's correct right you see now what can we do to make sure that when i click on it right when it's completed it's actually is completed and you know it has the check mark right away well again this is gonna come from when we render the actual thing so when we render okay okay when we render something i'm going to say the following no no no this is some cool stuff guys some cool stuff but it's some advanced stuff that's what i call it on this check mark you see here here's a like mercedes if if if okay if it's completed i'm going to give it a class of check so check this out okay if when we get it from a database and the item is completed i'm going to give it a special class because that way i can actually change the style of it so check this out i'm going to say here i'm going to use again these fancy curly brackets with the money sign again the string literals allows us to actually put javascript inside our strings okay this is so cool part i'm going to say this if the item.status status is equal to okay okay well you might gonna hate me this one is equal to completed i'm gonna use this operator and uh well checked so hold on if it's able to complete it then what i'm going to do if that's true i'm gonna output checked otherwise i'm going to output nothing so this is an if else statement it's a shortcut for an fnl statement so check this out basically if the status of this item that we are outputting is completed if that is true i'm going to mark it as checked i'm going to going to add a class called checked otherwise i'm going to add no class which is an empty string that's it that's all i'm doing here right so let's let's see what we got here let me go ahead here and inspect them on this one let's see is it checked or no is it checked it is indeed check guys check this out it's checked right here this my friends is checked and the other ones are the other ones checked or no no they're not because they're not completed yet right so now check this out let's do the same thing for this to do text because again we want to change the style of it based on if it's checked or not right you agree with me on this one right so let's do let's do that right now okay let me make sure let's try that right now with with me so try with me right now okay i'm gonna say i'm gonna copy this portion command c command v boom right there awesome command s save it okay yes the the don't worry lucas i will share the final code my this code is a little bit different so it's actually weird guys because if you take a look at the code i give you guys on github it's actually a little bit different right like it's actually a little bit of a different code if you guys can if you guys will see it right um because actually as i kept as i kept through it i realized that i can make it a lot easier for you guys to understand trust me before if you look at my script this is what we did to actually generate the items and tell me this will not confuse the out of you compared to this right am i right am i wrong on this one let me know in the chat i'm curious what do you guys think if i'm confused now imagine what happened if i give you this one that's right okay that's right all right so that's why i didn't go that far so that's why you know as a developer you have to be very quick in your feed sometimes and so i'm really happy that you know it's like now i realize that this can be actually a better option for you guys so look save it you just confused okay look so let's see here guys here's our checked item that's right so here you see this one is checked because it has a check because it's completed and the same goes for this to do text now we can use css to actually change it based on if it's checked or not so let me go ahead and do this here okay so everybody right now everybody right now go to the go to css right so a few things i want you guys to do okay a few things i know sam i want go to the bathroom sam go just actually hold on a second don't go to the bottom just yet don't go don't go don't go sam just not yet not yet not yet okay so we're almost done we're so close sam just hold it hold it all right let's for the check marked one right i'm going to change the background color the background actually so for the check mark somebody mark right so you see how it is gradient on the hover well look at this if i do this now the check mark that checked right save it oh look at this look at this you see what what just happened guys i have this special thing that happens when i hover over it but also i'm saying that if it's already checked i'm saying that check mark got checked this right here when i do this it means it has the two classes there i'm giving it a background you see what i mean for the to do text here's will do the to do text dot to do text dot checked okay if that's also already checked i'm gonna deal with this i'm gonna say text decoration line through it i'm going to put a line through it and i'm going to give the color a different color now as well color of this that's right i'm going to give it a different color you see now that's right and so guys check this out now this is pretty much done now you see this show's checked because because it's in the database it's completed and so now if i click on this what should happen oh oh oh duh okay but we're not done yet almost there this check mark should be actually not be there at all if it should not be visible at all so let's go to the check mark and the image let me see here uh check mark i know you guys hate me right now probably i know i know you hate me you hear me right now sam i know i know i know i know it's okay okay that check mark image right now i'm going to say it's not visible visible visibility hidden why i don't want to show it just yet i only want to show the check mark when i hover over it or when it's checked i'm going to say here um i'm going to do the same thing here i'm going to copy this on the hover of the check mark but this time i'm going to cut i'm going to uh i'm going to target the image i'm going to say visibility is is actually what hold on is actually visible let me see here let me see here okay hey let's go look at this look you see basically i said hey when i hover over on the image once i want it i want the chocolate to be visible that's part one great that's exactly what i want and the next part is if it's already checked i also want to make sure that this is invisible so now if i do like this now check this out guys if i add a new item okay watch a all i'm gonna i know the todo list for you guys rewatch this video rewatched it video hit enter boom it just appeared where here how does this work out because look at this guys when i hit enter as i hit enter that's right as i hit enter okay basically it's gonna save it to database let me show you here guys okay watch this watch this watch it watch it watch it watch it here's our database let me show you oop my database is here it's it's uh that's horrible hold on my database is somewhere here it's that's my firebase database right it says firebase right this is my application right i type some text i say hey hey go to the gym go to the gym basically i type it in i hit enter enter as i hit enter guys what's happening is the following this is saving into the database great but then i know some i know some i know some when but then the database is then telling our application that there's an update and whenever there's an update this what happens is this on snapshot right here gets fired automatically you see this on snapchat gets fired and because of that with every single time we are generating new items every single time that we add this thing to do so basically we generate new items every single time we update the database that's it now sam can go now you go to the bathroom stamp and then i go to the bathroom while you're at the bathroom i'm now actually going to upload this guys to netflix so you guys can go ahead um um you can guys go ahead and actually use this you know for yourselves so let's do that right now okay guys it looks looking amazing it's looking pretty damn good i like the way it's looking really really good alright so look at this guys oh so i'm awesome okay at this point what's going to happen is the following let me see here i'm going to upload this to nullify so everybody go to nullify nullify there open this up click login there we go right open up sites websites and then after that let's go ahead and open up our folder of projects right here are full of projects right here and then i'm going to challenge to do uh right here i'm gonna take this app i'm going to drag it into my notify application okay i'm going to copy this whole thing command c and my application is live for you guys to use there we go and so now you guys can actually use it here everybody those are on zoom you can use it guys you can add some items and i will actually see what you're adding here i will see it as you do it here i'll put you guys for you guys just don't do don't go crazy on it please here that's it it's done it is awesome stuff hey awesome stuff there you go you guys see as you're doing it i can see what you're doing here look at this it's updating in real time guys it is opting inside real time that's it why are you guys checking everything there you go see that's it hey let's go code more yes yes yes the more we code the better there you go see so there you go it is done you got it thank you guys appreciate it appreciate it that's it now my suggestion for you guys is gonna be the following okay guys here's my suggestion my position is to use the following okay i want you guys to number one is make these buttons actually work so you can make these buttons work together okay make these buttons work and then make this button work too the clear completed you guys can do that one that's not a harder one okay oh dang guys uh you guys put a lot of stuff in there huh make these buttons work and make this work as well got it guys that's that should be the goal that should be the homework guys on that that's pretty much it that somebody said uh we watched the video that's right that should be your goal for for tonight that's it my friends actually i'm gonna do one last thing okay i'm gonna go to style the css i'm gonna add a small margin to the to do items let me see here to do dash items items uh wrapper yeah i'm gonna do a margin bottom of 30 pixels there we go there we go because i want to have this beautiful uh let me see here is that working here now i don't like it i think it's working properly that's okay uh let me see here let me see here oh it's not working the way it should be kind of let me see inspect element on this one i want to add some margin as java to make that work i want to add add a small to items wrapper but it's not really maybe should i do it a hmm oh it didn't say for some reason margin bottom oh didn't save because this is not this is the uploaded one it saved in this
