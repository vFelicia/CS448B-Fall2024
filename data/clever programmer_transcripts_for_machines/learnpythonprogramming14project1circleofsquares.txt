hey guys what's up this is kazzy so in this video I want to talk about a project all right so we learned a little bit about loops and how we can do some cool loops and make squares we learned about functions and how you can give multiple arguments to functions we did all of this while visualizing the code that's why we use the turtle python module so you can learn visually no matter how old you are no matter how young you are visual learning is one of the best ways to learn and to visualize your code it's amazing cuz you get it right away now I want to take this time and now allow you guys to do an actual project so up to this point we did a lot of fun stuff and I gave you some basic exercises like make a square now I want to give you a little bit of a project it might take you long it might not take you that long it's not that much code at all it's uh you just have to put a lot of these ideas together here's the project I want you to make a circle out of squares what do I mean just to be clear about what you need to do in the project and how it should look like I've designed this demo for you guys so check it out make a square turn a little bit make a square turn a little bit make a square turn a little bit make a square turn a little bit okay you get the idea you keep going like this and eventually you get a circle and if you notice and if you look really really into it you can probably keep looking at this forever it's fascinating so I love this thing I can myself look at it forever um yeah pretty enjoyable okay so I'm going to stop it right here you guys now have fun with it try to make something like this okay it's not too complicated it's really simple make a square turn make a square turn it just helps you put all the programming Concepts we've learned so far variables using the turtle module the looping structures and arguments in functions and the range thing that we looked at in a loop so good luck and I think you can do it all right I will see you in the next video where I'll provide you with the solution
