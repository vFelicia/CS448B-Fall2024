more than this okay cool so let me hit stop sharing and now let's go over what it looks like to actually have a plan where you can be on track to make a million dollars are you guys interested in seeing that yes of course okay okay so there are multiple ways yesterday we talked about it guys and we talked about that there are a lot of different ways you can make money from youtube um do any of you guys remember what those ways were if you remember you could just say them out loud of course brand your brand yourself make a course brand yourself make a course awesome i love that olivia already got her mind on that i like it views views so like ads youtube paying you cool what else collaborations with others collaboration awesome what else so super chats super chats yep transactions so there's tons of different ways right like we already listed them out yesterday you guys listed out you guys were like affiliate marketing sponsorships youtube ad revenue you know um super chats transactions like the people paying you donations tshirts merch there's so many different ways there's no really limit to it i could show you a thousand different ways people became millionaires with youtube but i want to start to now show you guys how i did it and maybe it would bring some value to you guys okay so for me when it came to youtube was how can i bring value to a lot of people and i knew that if i could bring a lot of value to people at scale then i could make money at scale right so if you sit and have a oneonone session with somebody and they pay you how many people have you helped in a oneonone session and you sit with somebody and help them how many people have you helped just one person right so if you're helping only one person you're collecting one payment yes now yes what if in one sitting you had a group of five people like sitting right in front of you like physically and you were helping all five of them and you helped all five of them and they all five then pay you right so you've helped how many people five five five and you got paid how many times five times five times right and you did it all in the same single one hour does that make sense yeah yes yes so same thing if you i'm to make a monitor cohost as well so give me one second boom there we go so same thing will happen if you do whether you help one person at one time or you help five people at five time then you just are able to make five times the income because you help five times the people cool so that's kind of what happened with you know clever programmer where i found a way to essentially help more people and when you're on youtube and you're making content you can help more people at one time whether it's 10 people or 20 people or 100 people so then does it make sense to you guys that if you helped 100 people it's possible you could get paid two times more than what you make right now or maybe three times more than what you make right now is that possible yeah raise your hands if that's yes so absolutely absolutely love it so if that's possible then the question becomes well why don't we do it why don't we oh i'm doing it now stacy's doing it i know olivia's doing it i know some of you are on youtube doing it so why don't we do it maybe lack of selfconfidence that we can bring value yep that i think that hits the nail on the head um and why do people think that like what for example um and uh just tell me if i'm saying your name wrong is it rocio that's correct okay so rocio like what is it for you that makes you feel that where you feel that maybe you're not bringing value to people um i guess you live in a world where we're kind of wanting immediate feedback um rather than just doing something stepping back and allowing it to be we're constantly checking the analytics and we're like trying to say oh well we don't have views so we must not be good enough yes what she just said guys was that valuable at all to any of you and she won't take offense if you don't raise your hands if you but if you thought it was valuable truly thought it was even though one little nugget raise your hands or just say yes out loud yes yes yes thanks right yes yes yes so here's the thing this is immediate feedback for you because we have a community that is like very positive and that's right here when you're doing it alone you don't hear that all the time right so if you are looking for it then what you said is true you won't really get it but what you want to share if it's your internal truth just know that there are people that are going to find this valuable there are people out there who's actually listening to you and care about what you have to say so that part is you know this is one of the reasons why a lot of people don't actually do it and don't go through it because i think for a lot of people it's very clear they get i think people theoretically understand if you do youtube you know a lot of us know so many people that have become millionaires so a lot of us are like oh this is a very possible route right but then we actually don't end up doing it and most of the times that's because we are blocking ourselves mentally or we're thinking that we don't bring enough value or we're thinking this that or the other thing so the important part is like how can we get that out of our head how can we have that mindset shift where we're not just addicted to that validation because you won't get it that's the problem behind it the validation you're looking for you might start getting it when you get 10 000 subscribers or 50 000 subscribers but if you're looking for it today when you have zero subscribers you're not gonna get it right you're not gonna always have these people who are there so understand that even your guys's world view or a perspective can actually bring value even you just sharing your insight can bring value how many of you people here have one or more friends raise your hand if you have one or more friends okay why are those friends there with you why help you personality things in common personality things in common they add value to my life add value to your life cool because of my nature we do because of your nature what else so if you have if you have these friends next to you and they're there are they there because they are they want your money i mean some of them might want free food sometimes but right like it's not because they want your money it's not because they need something from you i think friendships are is one of the most people loyalty right friendships is one of the most pure relationships you can have because they don't even need anything from you they're not dependent on you in any way they're still there so if you have one friend or more friends then i believe it's possible for you that there might be some other people out there do you guys believe there might be some other people out there that are like you or your friends out of the six or seven billion people that exist on this planet yes for sure so then that's your tribe right and take yourself and take your best friend and multiply that that's your tribe so it's very exciting like what's actually out there and what's possible even this setting here is my dream like literally i think about it yesterday and i'm thinking holy crap we were only supposed to do an hour and a half of the challenge and we went for like four hours and i could have gone for far more and i was like loving it right and like the energy was amazing everybody was here and like everybody was engaged so it's a tribe of people i'm putting my stuff out there and then the people who connect come to it it's kind of really beautiful it's like finding friends online and i feel like youtube is like the best way to do that and then imagine imagine if your best friend started hanging out with you and imagine if your best friend started paying you to hang out with you and then imagine all your friends that hang out with you started paying you to hang out with you that's pretty crazy life that's kind of awesome you're like wow like not only am now i don't even have to spend time doing this job i don't like i can literally just hang out with the people i love and care about how many of you guys would like to hang out with your friends and get paid for it almost everybody right it's a fun place to be at it's a place where you're cared for you're loved you're appreciated so that's what i want you to take out of it that that's actually possible for you that's possible for a lot of people now is everybody going to make a million dollars probably not but not everybody wants to make a million dollars to be happy right a lot of you want to make different amounts of like some of you might be so ambitious here you're like i want to make 10 million dollars some of you might be like hey if i make 50 000 i'll be happy some of you might be like if i make 10 000 extra i'll be happy so right now when i ask you what's your number just on the count of three i want you to spit out what's your number that that will make you happy okay so here's how it's gonna go i'm gonna count to three and then i want you to just say whatever your number is thirty thousand thirty million whatever it is okay so one two three did you guys hear that the answers were just all over the place yeah that's what it is but whatever but whatever if somebody said a billion or a trillion that's that's what gets them happiness right maybe that doesn't get you happiness so that's an important conversation to have and think about like what is the number that you will like that's enough and you'll enjoy and you'll be happy with right so that's why it's important and you guys heard everybody has a different number and i can't force you to think a certain way not anybody else can force you to think a certain way it's also called like a financial thermostat where is it at for you right and if you said a billion are you working like a bill are you working hard like you want a billion and if you're not then you don't want a billion that's the conversation i had with frank yesterday wait hold on not frank zach actually yesterday uh where we had the you guys remember the ultra dark roast from yesterday um and so yeah so it went so dark it went so dark that was a lot of fun it was like a therapy session yeah it was it was yeah the guy who played piano exactly so like with him right you guys stuff was so good so good i was like i was like make old town road make every single song out there man like right is that not happening if i had if i had one 100th of that skill yes i mean music has such an emotional impact on people like if you can play why wouldn't you that's true i'd be on tick tock i'm killing it right take talk and all those places are the places to go you know and that's why when i looked at it yesterday i was like you're you're you say to me you want it i want your actions to follow and then you're gonna explode and so that's the thing we all have a different number in mind but what i realized is at some point i gave up the number game because it becomes really pointless because there came a point where i had all the money i needed to run away from everything i hated like at first i thought i just wanted like some insane amount of money right and what i started what i realized is i didn't even know until 2019 to 2020 i didn't even know like what you need to do to actually just be um i didn't i didn't know how to run away run towards happiness i didn't know how to run towards a goal the only thing i knew that i actually built the business off of was like i didn't like that i had to be financially dependent on anybody else i didn't like that i couldn't afford or help my parents go to the doctors and it that's they needed that a lot i didn't like that my friend just started like literally a week before me and then ended up making way more money than me freelancing i was like [ __ ] that like i've been doing it for years so there was a lot of pain that caused me to run towards and like grow my channel grow my brand in the start but then i realized 2018 i became really like in a weird way unhappy because i felt that i got everything i wanted i'm like i've beat everybody that was like once my mentor i have gotten more money than i don't know i know what to do with i'm traveling everywhere i'm in the heart of hollywood i i have my friends with me i'm dating whatever i want like crazy but what i realized was i was not happy like i didn't have a vision to run towards but i had run away from everything i didn't want it does that kind of make sense with you guys like so ran away from my pain yes money doesn't bring happiness yes but i also want to be careful about phrases like that too because sometimes we end up thinking and i know you don't think this olivia but for some people they start thinking like oh money is the root of evil or phrases like this can quickly make it like that where it's quite the opposite i think people who have money on average are actually some of the most generous and kind people just the other day we were celebrating something and we got so excited at this restaurant and my friends started screaming because it was one of the biggest things we had ever done and um we were like going crazy right we closed this like deal it was huge it was like a 80 thousand dollar deal going nuts and this like this group of ladies like about eight or ten of them sitting on the table and i told my friend i'm like dude he he didn't even like scream out of excitement it almost sounded like a scream out of panic because we didn't know we're gonna close the deal and he's like oh and i was like dude what happened are you okay and like my other friend was like dude are you okay and he's like yeah i'm fine it was frankie frankie sitting right here um and he's like yeah i'm fine i'm like what happened look at this and i was like oh and then we're trying to keep it low because we're at a restaurant and this group of eight or ten ladies you're like oh what happened tell us what happened they're like screaming and we're like we just closed the biggest deal ever we're so excited and they're and they're like all right champagne's on us and they just order us all champagne and sent it over and i was like wow that is so [ __ ] amazing because i know that if i was not here i don't know if anybody would be happy i've had people yell at me like get out of here look go away so i'm like wow these rich people are nice so for me you know it's like i think it's just it's a balance but but even with that said i knew how to run away from everything i didn't want i didn't know how to run towards so running towards something is really really important um at some point it's kind of what you have to do otherwise you you just kind of go around in circles in life and not really get anywhere so uh now the more tactical part that some of you guys are like okay you know this is this is cool i'm enjoying this but let's get to a little bit of the tactical part cool is that cool with you guys we might get a little bit technical and [ __ ] but i want you guys to stay in there and then we're going to come back to everything all right and then plus we got the roast at the end so um um cool so let's let's go ahead and do that huh are you on here okay kenz hold on one second frankie can uh amanath make you a mod frankie okay i see you all right there we go all right cool so we're all ready let's get into it so for me you guys can see the whiteboard yes yes okay dope so when i broke my first come on how am i doing the graphs so this was like so this is 2017. this is um let's just say 18 2018 this is 2019 and this is 2020 okay now it takes a lot of work and a lot of time but frankie when when did we break the first million like the total that video that we have where we went nuts 2019. okay so i'll show you guys let me see if i can actually find that what the [ __ ] man there's some new chrome update and it just keeps crashing chrome i i really really hate it my chrome has never crashed more times what's up uh oh yeah yeah yeah it's right here but you know what that's fine i don't need these pages all right so let me go here actually and i might have this moment saved so let's go back oh [ __ ] okay guys get ready this is one of the best moments of my entire life this is what it feels like to make a million so that happens and then after that there's not much more i mean so that's that was our moment of when we hit that number and it was august 15 2019 that was the exact day i believe that we hit that number so middle of so right here this is it okay um that's when it happened did it explode some of your guys's ears that was a really loud scream you guys okay everybody doing fine hey kazi you cracked 2000 followers oh on instagram right nice yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you guys so much we cracked 1 000 subscribers on our new youtube channel and uh 2 000 on the new instagram so thank you guys i appreciate that uh this is exactly when the million was broken so think about this and 20 there was some stuff i did in 2016. like but to be fair i really started end of 2016. so if you guys remember uh day one i don't know who was here day one but like if you guys were here day one you guys remember when i was talking about like i started in 2016. you guys remember that yes yes yes so in 2016 uh it was really the end of the year it was like quarter four of 2016 where i really actually committed to youtube other than that i wasn't making any videos for the last like you know in quarter two three barely making any i made probably two videos and those you know many many months like the first nine months of 2016 i made probably two videos so quarter four is really the quart quarter account in 2016 because that's where i made a lot of videos like probably 20 to 40 videos so i started really end of 2016 and then 2019 was where we actually officially cleared over 1 million and then in 2020 we have now it's growing really really fast so now i think we've cleared over 2.6 million yeah so it's a lot it took a lot of work and if you guys want to go ahead and give a round of applause you can't that would make me really happy because i worked my ass off for it um but this wasn't a very exciting moment thank you for that gravit gabi i appreciate it so this was a crazy moment it took a lot of time and growth but what i'm what i want to show you guys here is the actual truth of it so like i didn't become a millionaire here it didn't happen here and it didn't happen here and nor do i want to sell you that does that make sense so it's like this is the actual truth of what happened for me so this is not something that happens overnight definitely not something that happened overnight for us but if you knew that this is possible does it make you a little bit more willing to actually put in the work if this is possible for you yes yeah no doubt yes okay definitely commander for sure awesome like i don't work for money yeah right so um but money is again i want to hammer this home money is a really important part of the game really [ __ ] important part of the game if you don't get this part right a lot of the stuff is really hard for example if you're doing a fulltime job how are you really going to dedicate your time fully to youtube if that's the only way you know how to make an income like i am 12 so uh i know i know i know so but still it doesn't matter even if you're 12 and if you want to do this i do want you to think about it don't put a limit on yourself just because you're 12. just like i would tell somebody who's 79 years old don't put a limit on themselves so i i do want you guys to think about like how does the practicality of making income work because that's how like we got a team of people to then grow it but it's just something important right if you maybe if that's not your goal to hit a 1 million if it's less then that's okay too you can be doing other things and still growing your channel at the same time 2018 for us was i think 2018 we hit um this was our year where in one year like in 2016 when i started i think in 2016 my income was probably 70 000 this year if not more i don't exactly remember the number but 2016 i think was maybe 70 between 70 to 100 000. i can't pinpoint i was doing a lot of like freelancing work in this time 2017 when i started my youtube channel and i actually went hard uh was the year where we did two hundred and ten thousand two hundred and two hundred and ten thousand i think two hundred and ten thousand uh 2018 we did 350 000 in one year 2019 we did 600 000 in one year and then 2020 was where we did over 1.6 million in just one year like so the year is not over yet we're still in november we still have december to go cool so this is what the journey is what it looks like what it looked like for me um for me youtube became a thing really really quickly and it's kind of because of how soon i made the decision to go all in i attribute a lot of it to my commitment and decision to just go all in as soon as possible right around this right around this area this like transition from 2016 to 2017 i was making a lot of money decent amount of money 70 no between 70 to 100 000 and i gave up all my clients i gave up literally every single dollar so i took that income from 70 between 70 100k and i dropped it down to a big fat zero i dropped that income because i knew that that's what's going to force me to actually go all into the business and force me to actually generate revenue from the business because if i'm not forced to generate revenue from the business i'm just gonna be kind of like bullshitting around for a really long time that makes sense so for you let me see if uh zoom still there okay if by the way frankie if you get any good questions or anything you want to pop up you can just bring them up and same thing i'm honest for you if you have there any good questions i can answer them as they come up so um i guess any questions right now for you guys that you have i feel like it's a good moment for some kind of questions you guys might have relevant to what i'm talking about here who is this uh mark mark okay go for it yeah so uh looking at this kind of flow chart of your income was this like strictly from monetization from ads or did this include more stuff too of course so for for me i i i leveraged youtube to sell a course okay that makes a lot of sense thank you yes um um i got a question too go for it uh okay so yesterday i was watching a live stream and you talked about how like if uh there are two youtubers in the same like genre or category they are working in yeah so they kind of promote each other right yeah so uh my question is like uh you know we learned from those people per se so we did a little sense of insecurity at first because these are like the people we learned from so we get the sense of what value would i provide yeah and like that particular instance second is that um like youtube in general seems so saturated at this point is if you want to do something okay i get that you can't do something totally unique per se um but like a tutorial about something versus a another tutorial about the same thing kind of feels the same yeah at the point so what's the point of like making something that already exists and how does that provide value to you that's a great fantastic question herman have you ever helped anybody in real life like ever a friend parent i actually have been programming since i was seven i manage a game dev server on discord not much about 1k people or so so yeah we're usually like talking to okay and do they come uh so give me an example of like a simple question somebody has asked you that has brought like that you have answered for them give me a simple example where you've helped somebody um right so like i met a lot of junior tips in my last job and it was mostly like like as a programmer it's not about learning the language it's about learning the way you're supposed to write code like it's problem solving more than anything and they usually have the issues with how can i do x now instead of trying to explain them how to do eggs i tried to explain why it works this way and what other approaches let me ask you let me ask you a question that the the question that they asked you was an answer for that available if they looked online hard enough yeah exactly cool but it was more like i was right next to them we're working together so this is something i want to share with you right if and i want everybody who's listening to this to think and recall a moment where you might have helped somebody with anything in life and maybe it was a question that was already out there that you answered for them so in this case and i think you kind of right i see you guys nodding your heads and kind of feeling it so herman this is where i'm getting what i'm getting at here is there's plenty of times where we'll answer questions that already the answers to them exist most of our life right right but maybe the way i share it maybe the way you share it hits home for that person right where the world is not so like what i want to say is the world is not like made of robots that are like well this information is already indexed duplicate question cancelled form deleted that's what happens a lot in that [ __ ] forum discord and all that world i i mean being a programmer for too long kind of gives you that mindset yes yes it's a really it's a toxic mindset um and so for me even though i was part of the programming community i was never a part of the programming community ever like i never joined any forums because it always just felt like it was just elitist and like any time if you even remotely have a similar thought like literally even a similar even if you use like sometimes similar words but it's a different question like i've gotten shut down or my questions got deleted and they're like no figure it out like so so many haters so many haters so many haters right those voices is just not a kind place to be on most of the time right remember what i was talking to about uh stack overflow so like let me just give you some background i'm a senior mobile developer i've made some of the biggest apps on the planet disney plus sonos like giant apps i asked a question on stack overflow and they deleted my question spotlight imagine if i have a question about something that has to do with mobile it's very specific and then someone's like oh uh yeah it's a duplicate question like no big deal you suck you know like how is this possible like i am i am more senior than whoever shut that question down and so that's that's the world you live in so when you're answering questions you can't think about it like oh this way or that way it's very important to always know that maybe somebody likes maybe someone's searching for something right right when you answer it so it's it's your answer that they want it might not be some weird technical stack overflow it's like a friendly video answering something yeah i know that that's what i've done yes you know i did the exercise last night and you know it's like that's the beginning of the journey nice beautiful answer um there's also this other thing that like it's psychology at most um like most people don't like the sound of their own voice and that kind of has to go like a long way understanding why not more people like your god videos per se because it's hard to put out like put yourself out there considering what the internet is you like your voice no i like i have social anxiety even being on this i feel i just joined it because i was like maybe i can put myself a bit forward maybe that would help me open up i also stream from time to time but yeah i don't know how this is gonna go but right it's okay yeah that makes sense like how do you like one is like you know as i said like the market is kind of saturated so how do you find your niche or like in general how do you find okay this is what works for me personally like how do you know this works it's not about the experimenting phase it's about like evaluating that experimentation data per se right okay so i love this and few things here one i actually think um your voice is very interesting like i actually really it's almost like hypnotizing i don't know what it is so i agree i actually think you your um your voice is really interesting second uh let's not spotlight me let's spotlight the person who's question i'm answering thank you so that that's one important thing i want to i do want to say second is what i want you to work on right i don't know if you were here yesterday um yesterday's call so similar thing i want you to get like out of your head right similar thing i had a conversation with devin about i want you to get out of your head and into your body youtube is uh there's this world of perfect science perfect math perfect programming and then there's art youtube is a lot of art combined with maybe some like mathematical thinking meaning like using historical data to like make like videos that you kind of know are gonna work but there's a lot of art there's a lot of human element to it so less thinking in terms of like precision data guaranteed something's gonna work uncertainty is something you have to like actually embrace uh i mean it's just probabilities at the end of the day you kind of have to do it to know that it works or yes for you honestly i want you to make youtube like i think right now for you i wouldn't even have a discussion about like planning [ __ ] out and and what's the best way for you to go what i know like my anxiety is so worse i have like i just recently bought like an entire setup i got a good mic i got like good enough recording equipment and stuff yeah but just i can't bring myself out of my own bubble and i'm aware of this yes but like i try to help myself but there's no way i can physically make myself do it like i got like i need a more sort of force pushing me towards doing it yes because that's what i feel the lack of yes um but then again like we all have priorities in life per se and i do want to do youtube it's something you really really want to do yeah a lot of friends have been asking me to do it as well but then again um it's just the fear of being judged but that kind of comes with being human i guess yes and i know like that would go away with time but initially like i know it takes a lot to upload your first video per se but some people just do it effortlessly and that kind of makes me more anxious about it yeah so right there's a lot of like comparison of what other people are doing and stuff like that's happening i know the fear that you feel not social because i've worked my ass off to come a lot of my social fears including like approaching strangers and crazy [ __ ] that helped me get out of it but i know the fear because i am extremely scared to jump in a pool in my own house it's only a six feet pool and it's it doesn't go deeper than that i've had traumatizing experiences where i've like drowning experiences and so i kind of know how to swim but i'm like terrified i jump right it took me 20 minutes to jump in and i felt like my whole life was going to end i jumped in and literally like i wanted to i panicked so hard it's on video so maybe i'll share with you guys one day right but i did it a few weeks ago and i couldn't just stop like hyperventilating and i got out i was proud that i did it but it was scary as [ __ ] i honestly found you to be the best person to for me to be asking questions too per se yeah because we have a lot of common background heritage from where we come from like i come from punjab which is you know we have like a lot of history where if you're from bishopville right and like that sort of mindset that they build you when you're little like the whole school thing and yeah it kind of gets to you at the point yeah and that's what kind of i'm suffering with i've tried a lot to do harmony hormone right we're gonna saw one few we're gonna take deeper questions later and i would love to get in it with you but what i want you to work on is if you can maybe even find a partner from here or just make a video even if you're not gonna publish it okay for you i want you to like actually commit to an action step and say it in the comments that you're gonna commit to um okay so if it's about commitment let's do this right i'll make a video by tomorrow this meeting and maybe we can show it to others maybe that would help okay yeah i think so right yeah i can try like i can try something like i can try putting something to it in a day or so it's fine beautiful how to edit videos and stuff so awesome that is exciting that is really really exciting yeah like that's exhilarating it's beautiful all right everybody give them a round of applause this was amazing herman if you want to make it even easier if you want to make it even easier i i i'll offer to jump on a zoom call with you and i'll just ask you questions let's do a quick interview the same way you're doing here that would look great yeah we want everyone to have one piece of content starting right now yes so let's go right yep okay okay all right harmon thank you so much for jumping on appreciate your brother yeah i like let others take the stage don't want to hug awesome thank you appreciate it um cool so um guys can you see the screen actually you guys can't see the screen i need to share it boom screen share awesome do you guys enjoy that segment with harman yes nice awesome yes is it i just wanted to ask a question okay real quick is it relevant to this here uh not this okay but let's you okay let's address it a little bit later okay i'll take on a lot of questions afterwards i promise cool i'll take on a lot of questions so yeah this is if if you guys have a question relevant to this then we can get into it but otherwise just hold your questions for a little bit later please what wait did olivia say something no okay cool i think she had background he's trying to say something okay i'm trying okay go for it um as far as growth i know you said that um to build a brand with youtube but this is like instagram i know you said you used tik tok but did you use your instagram to um actually build your brand on there as well um i didn't start really taking instagram seriously like late into 2019 yeah so almost every single dollar almost like 95 of it is attributed to i attribute it to youtube okay and somebody asked me this when is a good time to launch it i launched it with like about 10 or 20 000 youtube subscribers says are i know you asked me that question so uh that's a good place to start it at like you can once you get a little bit of momentum behind you uh because i know because i've done it enough i know that if you do launch it it works it's almost like freaking science why i have some people sell something really quickly is because i like for you to see and believe yourself that it's possible so that's why i push people to like do just a little bit of sales right in the start so you can like see what it feels like and get that it's real like oh my god the money is actually in my bank account like from this thing that i did online it's real i can now calm down and just like focus on the actual work so that's why i have people do it but if you can have more faith then i recommend you like just put up content and grow and wait to actually do the part where you ask for the sale the longer you can wait the better your launch is gonna do the more you're gonna crush cool so that's that's an important part of the game so for me you know this was comprised of i think uh two i think we did like two two product launches that entire year and then boom that's actually what happened and maybe i can show specifically um let me see if i can show this without any uh okay cool let me actually just check there's a way i can show it in like a good way okay cool cool all right so what i'm doing right now is i'm preparing to show you guys something and um i'm just doing it in a way where it's like i don't reveal any sensitive information so just give me one second and i'm gonna pop it open for you guys okay all right there we go all right cool so this is what that year looks like now i'll show you guys boom all right so are you guys taking a look at this right now yeah yes so this is the first year um so actually i made more than i thought in the first year i said the wrong number apparently uh how many of you guys would like to make this in your first year yeah be happy cool um so whenever i say that stuff i'm always like man i just hate sounding like those get rich quick people i [ __ ] hate that so like that sounds like ah but um it's again just to nothing i hate bragging so it's really not to do that it's just to share with you like what i came across and so i want to just share that all right and please don't take it like bragging or anything so um i did the first product launch i think in march so like for example here's what i want you to look at right so let me just erase this and go here you guys see these like this spike right here and then this spike right here and then this spike right here right yes okay so now what's happening with these spikes is actually this is this is the first time i'm asking people to buy this is the second time i'm asking people to buy and this is the third time i just asked people to buy does that make sense yes totally yeah and what kind of call the action was that um so it's i mean it's a whole product launch but like basically the simplest way i can put it is i like literally i just ask for the sale so i'll give you value and then i'm like hey if you're enjoying our thing like this is our course you can join it now we can get into copywriting at some point and you can of course get better at the sales process you can get better at the copywriting process but the simplest way i can put it even if you're a [ __ ] like you don't want to learn any marketing you don't want to learn any copywriting i believe that you might not have numbers like these but you will still do really good and be able to replace your job by just asking for the sale at some point okay so it's like a product launch do any of you guys know brands like hype um it's called what is it called no not hype supreme my bad supreme they're so built on hype that i literally call them hype uh but do any of you guys know the brand supreme for clothing yeah i mean they just sell because they have a brand right so like they stack the logo they built the brand and they made it so hot and then they do these drops so like the whole year they sell only a few times they don't actually sell very often they just do these like big drops and that's it so and then it's over so for me i just do these drops in between that time i just shut the [ __ ] up and work and give value does that make sense so like he yeah so like here it's me making zero like so i know that you guys want to make like um so like here right so let's see this was one of my first weeks i did the launch so march march 2017. so 163 97 507 584 3697 so basically let's just say in one week of doing this launch i probably cleared like seven thousand dollars is that a good number for one week yeah cool that's bothered cash come on so that's a good number okay great oh actually it was uh no no i'm sorry it was actually like uh fifteen thousand dollars my bad fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars in one week right that was the first launch but who here wants to make zero dollars for three months i don't yeah biggest racing is it depends if i have enough money in the bank too right so like it's like a lagging indicator guys it's like you have to remember you got to put the work in first then you're getting cash in on the work yeah so that's the really hard part for most people where it's like okay this part here is the part where you literally do zero dollars and then you work your ass off like in terms of content value engaging with people making sure you're answering their questions all of that right so that's the first launch now the second launch i did in the first year was right here so let's go there so the oh this this actually was a pretty good launch day one of the launch we did seven thousand seven thousand dollars whoops and then 2500 and then 5500 and then 4100 and then how would you guys like to have a day 19 000 a day yes why not so that so this chunk over here for the second launch i believe was um probably sixty thousand dollars the sixty thousand dollars sounds good in one week sure that's awesome hopefully sounds good so that's that was week two or sorry launch two and then anybody want to guess what launch three did you get you guys can see launch three is pretty massive day one was 22. so like i'll just show you like this launch there was one day where we on just one day i think did 40 000. so that's like one of the days and then one of the so like yeah just give me what are you guys saying overall like take a guess on the launch number three 180 what would you say 180 000 180 000 any other guesses thousand 97 seven thousand what else 500k what else all right so 100k nice all right so for this one it was actually 150 000. cool and that was um this was over the course of one week how does that sound hundred fifty thousand over the course of one week perfect he's just perfect i like that cozy just a quick question yes um like you're doing like different uh courses per se right so are all these sales coming in from the most recent course you created yes or is it like a compound of the previous ones as well because like people would discover you so they might buy something else as well right yeah like they don't necessarily have to buy just one thing right but mostly all the best results we got was just by focusing on one product at a time that's why we exploded like and just crushed everybody else in the market because like just uh i get that like yeah you did a call to action for like a particular course and people joined that course what i'm asking is if you like let's say you created a python course per se and um does the value of it like does the new users you get time dies off because youtube kind of keeps promoting your video if it's good right right like there's no into it it's compound it will grow with time yes um so do the sales like grow little as time progresses yes your daily sales or it gets stable at the time so i'll tell you this right okay okay cool i got you i got you so here's here's what it is so this business model like like doing nothing and then launches called feast or famine business model okay so like for example in between here i'm making pretty much zero dollars in between here i'm making now a little bit more than zero dollars it's probably a few thousand dollars uh in between here i'm also i'm now making a little bit more so it's a few thousand dollars more right so they are compounding over time yes so as it goes if we go forward and forward into time like for example let's just say we go to like maybe 2019 and we just take a look at this and let's go maybe oh man it's taking a really long time to load but you guys can see in the background like what happened with the days where we weren't making sales it those are the days that are now starting to get filled out does that make sense right right so that's that's what i was asking yup so that's kind of what happened so yes the compound effect is very real i say youtube is like uh compound interest on steroids right i mean it's a digital product you don't have to manage any inventory you don't have to like refill your inventory it's just one thing and yeah that's actually the day so i love what you just said there was one day where it like really blew my freaking mind where i went from um i went to i went to go skydiving with my friends so i went skydiving with my friend i wanted to surprise him for his birthday and i went skydiving and they had to make us watch these videos to make sure that like we understand that we can die so there's this like this old dude like it's like nine years old has this giant beard and the entire the entire video he's just talking about like death he's like so in the case of death you have to inform your family members and put your contact information so we can contact them i'm like holy [ __ ] like i'm already excited and nervous because my first time the whole time this guy's just talking about death and i'm like man this is kind of scary should i do this and then we finally like going through this crazy adrenaline rush finally get in the airplane and what was the scariest part anybody here skydived anybody here skydived let me see a view of everyone does bungee jumping count that rope thing adam did frank did nice so um so it's got it's just so it's like a crazy thing i'm uh when you do it it's like ton of fun it's really enjoyable but the scariest part for me about skydiving was actually the part where the plane is going up because it's anticipation of the fear so like that was just such a scary part and i was like oh my god what the hell's gonna happen every and then i saw the trees go from like trees and cars go from cars to like they turn into these tiny little like invisible molecules from this and i'm like we're gonna jump from here and then we saw the one of the instructors jump out and my heart i'm just sitting there my heart's like beating my palms are sweating and i'm literally thinking we should quit and go back but it was so scary and it would have been so like at that point it would have been too embarrassing to go back then it would have been to just jump out so i was like let's just jump out we jump out and like um i remember the moment the video was there stacy says i'm terrified of heights i remember that exact moment right where the camera or sorry the because i saw my video in the camera later but i was about to jump out of the plane and you see all life just leave my body like literally my face just goes it's like i've seen death and then he pushes me off and i'm like like crazy my face is everywhere my cheeks are like deformed i'm like laughing i'm having fun it's like literally the best moment of my life that i've experienced but i'm scared at the same time i have this brilliant experience right then they pull the parachute at that one point and then it's just like calm it's like smooth sailing we get to the bottom they interview us unbelievable experience and when it comes and then when we leave i'm thinking about man it was such an amazing experience it was so fun and then i thought about i'm like how much did that cost so i asked my friend i'm like i forgot how much it cost him like how much was it and he's like oh it was like 300 bucks and i was like whoa hold on you're telling me that they gave us an experience of our life they had to risk multiple people in the airplane and the skydivers life to jump with us and help us they had to like have an airplane they had to have like fulltime people that are trained that are doing thousands of jumps they have to pay them there were so many things that they had to take care of and they charged 300 and at that exact same moment i looked at my phone and i just got a sale of 500 for my course and i was like that is kind of crazy it's kind of almost like in a way i was like is that unfair is that ethically wrong because i'm not risking my life i don't have inventory nothing happens to me there's no risk and it made me start realizing wow it is so great of an opportunity that we have where you can actually have what's in your head whatever value that you have you can share with people they'll pay you for it and there's no like there's there's no inventory none of that right so that's one of the things that i thought about that i feel like is very cool about the opportunity that we have and the world that we actually live in uh gabi go ahead hi cassie i have a question how many subscribers do you have when when you launch your your course so there were three launches which launched um the first one cool so the first launch that i did i believe that by that time i had maybe somebody can verify this for me but i believe that i had between 10 to 20 000 youtube subscribers um yeah i believe that's what it was and how much did your cause with your curse cost so this launch was the course cost 47 which i realized was a mistake like you should charge much higher but then just make your course inc like way better but just charge way higher it's like way better to charge way higher you get higher quality customers you can give them like they're not going to be a pain in the ass at all and they're there to like be serious and learn and be committed when you pay you pay attention right so has that happened with you guys where you paid a lot for something and then you like really paid attention to that same thing right where you get that same advice for free people even when you give that same advice for free to people they don't really care they're like yeah yeah yeah gabi i already know you that's cute but then if you charge somebody for it they're like oh my god that was life changing so those are the kinds of people you get it truly changes their life supporting them is so much easier and it's a breeze so um so yeah like that was one big lesson we learned but that was my that was the price of my course at that time gabi okay perfect thank you very much you got it hey kelly i have a quick question who is this uh vicente ramos okay vicente go for it hey um so i if i i was one of their students from prophet um proper priority with python and at that time when you made your courses did you have a team or was did you do like a certain amount of video yourself and then you got the team before like did you get a team after you started making a certain amount of money or like that's a great question that's a great question so i knew i i know to think of everything in terms of skills everything like for example right uh when i all money is right what is money guys money is literally nothing but just a lagging indicator of skill and value if you develop enough skill in a certain area and then you give that value to somebody then they give you money back in return for example if olivia's really good at mindset she has worked all really hard to develop those skills she's probably studied tony robbins she probably has looked at gary vee she's probably studied books a bunch of stuff right she talks about the law of attraction she had to spend a lot of time developing that skill yes or no she had to develop a lot spend a lot of time developing that skill right yes then she had to spend time giving that value to somebody and then she just makes money for that that so that's all that money is at the end of the day it's a skill that you develop if gabi has a skill of finances she had to spend a lot of time acquiring that skill and then she gave value to somebody and she got money in return so right so skill is the ultimate thing that you need to develop and then you get paid for it and all of that so when i think about skills i'm like okay if everything comes down to skills then what's the most important thing is for me to learn the skill of working with people because people are the most important that's how the ideas come and that's how all of the breakthroughs happen so if people are um everything and guys just one thing i do want to let you know i see olivia yeah cool so one thing i want to let you guys know is we're not done yet we're going to keep going but for day 5 happens tomorrow that's we're going to create your blueprint okay that's where we're gonna create your path to actually crushing it on youtube make sense guys so tomorrow's so tomorrow is gonna be a really important day tomorrow is probably the most important day so make sure that you guys have that already scheduled in same time 11 a.m tomorrow and we're gonna get started pacific right california time and if you guys have questions or anything bring those just wanted to say that as a reminder so vicente for me i realized that just like programming was a skill that i developed i got paid six figures for it youtube was a skill i developed and i got paid a lot for it i knew that people were one of the best skills to develop on my team and learning how to work with them because i knew that all the biggest people knew how to work with people like everybody who's created the biggest companies so i started hiring people as soon as i possibly could like literally even when i had 500 bucks or 50 bucks or 100 bucks i would hire people and work with them um cassie uh hold on hormone right now hold on right now it's vicente vicente go for it oh no thank you thank you for the answer and i appreciate it okay got it awesome um so yeah okay hopefully that brought you value and and you got value out of it um cool uh isa isa is it isa uh yes it's isabey and charlie hi issa okay go for it uh hi i have a few questions go for it okay uh one is how many minutes do you recommend for a an average youtube video as long as as long as that video as long as it needs to be okay yep so as long as that video needs to be so if you have a message that is only three minutes long then it's three minutes if you have a message that takes 45 minutes to come out then it's 45 minutes some of my best performing videos isa i have videos that are 15 minutes that are at 2 million views and then i have vid i have a video that's 12 hours literally it's a 12 hour youtube video and it's at 1.8 million views wow that's great so as long as it needs to be okay and uh my other question is a bit uh personal why did you choose to open a channel with your name rafi kazi and uh which uh what did you what do you suggest can i open a channel with my name or with an adjective or another name which is not mine got it great question so for me the coding channel it makes a lot of sense for it to be called clever programmer and that's just like now it's a brand and so for example tomorrow there could be other teachers teaching on there and growing it like coding is not something that like is gonna be you know what i'm saying like i'm not coding all the time i'm running a company like now i'm running a company i'm focused on actually impacting people's lives i don't care if it's me coding and impacting lives but i just care that there might i might inspire their developers to create content on there so then they can change lives my channel rafikaze is on my life's journey oh yes that's why it's called rafikaze it's whatever journey that i'm on so like for me the thing that is the deepest and most satisfying right now is i love inspiring people which is something that that i've always loved i love teaching but right now for me the thing that i'm the most passionate about and i believe in the most is people starting on their youtube journeys like i understand thank you so much you know what i'm saying like i love i love seeing what it does to their confidence i love seeing what it does to their like income to their business how they can provide for their families i love everything about it so so yeah so rafikaze is all personal and slash like my life like whatever is happening and then clever programmer is a brand for coding okay thank you very much yep you got it and i have a followup question to that girlfriend mark does your rafa quasi channel also like do you have intentions for it to feed into your clever programmer channel like maybe people who discover you as a person will then be like whoa this guy's really great at programming or are you trying to keep them separate um i mean i'm not really trying one or the other i'm just trying to grow them independently and separately almost like imagine two kids right you like if you have two kids you don't necessarily want the little brother to just like follow under the shadow of the oldest brother you really want them to be two unique individual people uh that do their own thing that's my longterm goal with both of the channels i don't want them to worry about necessarily having to even know about each other they can just like they should be both good enough to grow from each other i think from clever programmer it's really awesome that from clever programmer there are a lot of people that are jumping into the rafikaze side yeah cool well thank you man yeah um cesari says qazi what do you think of you to me and cesar you can jump on somebody can spotlight you says what do you think of udemy it's nice but for me hard work can't be paid 10 to 12 euro precisely for this reason my question is how can you fight this platform you make use you make your own platform which is essentially cesare here um okay he's not here but i'm gonna answer his question i mean wait he literally just he's not on video i asked him to turn video on but i mean he should be he okay got it got it got it okay so that's fine i'll answer this question um so what do i think of it i think you need to have your own platform like if i'm on udemy i i'm at the mercy of udemy i don't get the email list i literally like the number one most important thing is the thing that differentiated me is i use youtube to grow my email list okay so this is something i want to share with you guys because i think we're in the important sections of this call now and so i want to actually share more advanced strategies that i uh alluded to yesterday so let's go to my videos and i'll go here all right and i'll share my screen with you guys right now cool so if i show you guys my videos and we sort by like most popular so in this video i got about two million views the most important thing that i'm doing here is this right here you guys see this thing here yes that is the biggest secret like this is the thing that a lot of people don't understand i'm driving the people to go and join uh an email list so then i can let them know later like if there's a course or if there's an opportunity i can get the word out all of the revenue guys comes from majority of the revenue at least in my case i think in most people's case will come from your the people you have on your email list okay so this is the one important advanced thing i want to show you guys if you're thinking about starting your youtube channel it's a really smart idea to send people on your website give them something in return for free right like you give them something return for free so if i go to cleverprogrammer.com i'm giving you something for free how to become a javascript developer in 2020 right you join it because it's a free training does that make sense i'm giving you something valuable but in exchange i get your email for it discounts are not a thing for discount like i stay away from that type of stuff like discounts and things like that but free training is a good thing to do here's another example right how many of you guys here oh crap it's gone again no help all right so hopefully this will be good how many of you guys here i actually want to get a sense of this raise your hands if you came here from uh if you found me from a facebook ad raise your hand if you found me from a facebook ad to for this training okay a few people got it um and you guys can drop it in the chat too if you how you found me if you found me from if you found this training the five day training i mean from a facebook ad uh drop it if you came from clever programmer how many of you came from clever programmer a bunch of people okay most people got it awesome so wherever you came from the important thing here is to understand that i get you guys are getting value and there's something that i'm giving out for free it's a five day challenge so you don't give anything for it but you're like wow this is awesome getting so much value and you get it for free so then it's a fair exchange it makes you want to be like okay when you put that you're on an email list right so then on the email list if we have a course uh which we're actually gonna drop which i'm super [ __ ] excited about i'm making the best course i'm literally like this is gonna be my life's work in one course and we're gonna be launching it and i'm gonna be talking about it towards the end of the challenge with you guys it's going to be called i'm thinking about calling it youtube masters academy i'm so excited about this and i want to put everything in there but those of you who are interested in going further you guys are going to jump into that course those of you who are not interested in it won't jump into it if you don't feel like i've given you enough value but the whole point of having the email list is it gets the word out does that make sense and i'm not i'm not blocked by youtube i'm not blocked by i'm not dependent on instagram i'm not dependent on that necessarily email list is it allows me to connect with you directly okay so this is one like advanced tactic that i wanted to share with you guys when it comes to you actually growing a youtube channel is build the email list from day one of your channel like from day one if you do that that's a really good idea um a tool that i recommend that you guys use to build your email list we use this tool i recommend using convertkit there are many other tools this is the best just take my [ __ ] word for it i know every goddamn tool on the planet i've been through every rapid hole you can imagine i know the insides and outs and every automation and every fancy tool like i have exhausted myself going through it so if i can help you just make a decision fast and simplify your life like i had an email tool that i had to pay 48 000 a year and it was awful and it was a nightmare to then like pull myself out of it at a later point so this is the easiest one this is the best one i believe that it lets you get started for free so i would highly recommend using convertkit to um to build your email list and get people on there people are okay so somebody said i came from email all right i found it from youtube youtube clever programmer all right mailchimp oh somebody said using mailchimp yeah get off mailchimp mailchimp sucks like don't be on mailchimp it's yeah it sucks uh i mean all right if you are a human being sitting face to face i'd probably say it's okay mailchimp is all right if it won't take too much energy for you to get off of it then get off of it now um yeah so that's kind of the actual answer i would give you if you were sitting face to face um and yeah mailchimp has like some funny stuff with like how the duplicate lists and yeah all right found from instagram ad awesome yeah even even i would i would recommend convertkit guys i know about mail gun i know about spark whatever i know about uh you know like every pla all of the platforms i've went through like ontraport and all of them this is the easiest one to use i recommend it at the end of the day decide whatever you want this is my personal recommendation for you uh this is a good one the other thing i would recommend guys is for you here are the steps right you have to make so here are the steps for you you got to have a youtube channel okay this is what your road to one million looks like if you guys want to take notes at this time it would be a good time to do that so youtube content this is your number one and most important step if you [ __ ] up every other step every other step including like not having a product not building an email list you will be golden you will still be golden if you don't get this part right and you don't put this part on a pedestal no matter how much i help you or you get fancy in business and marketing that every like because it's gonna be that's gonna be hard okay so that's step one we'll take questions later guys we're gonna take questions later we're gonna take questions later um so step one step number two is if you actually want to make the sale guys how can somebody pay you what do you need for somebody to pay you or actually before we get to the payment before we even get to the paper uh before we get to the payment part let's get let's get to the part so that's the right answer i just asked the wrong question right now so second part is you need to have a relationship with the people a way to communicate with them all right so this is the thing we just talked about right now so number two we need uh client list yes client list okay cool so that's the second most important thing so i will say email list client list prospect list you guys can call it whatever you want so this is step two of something that you're gonna need okay youtube content build your email list if you own the email list and tomorrow youtube gets destroyed facebook gets banned instagram gets shut down tick tock gets blocked in america you're gonna be fine you're always gonna have a business you're gonna be completely fine email list is yours nobody can take it away and and gabby another cool thing is you can put in your excel sheet and save it there and it'll be yours forever um cool so those are the two things number three now let's get to the point of what do you actually need for people to pay you like literally what is the thing that you need for people to pay you some of you guys said it for the last step it's for this here check out the product the product cool so yes so secure checkout all of that is going to be you know kind of like part of the product but i'm not i don't want to get too much into the weeds of it so at a high level this is what it looks like guys all right you make youtube content people like it let's say 10 000 people watch it right 100 people now might join your email list does that make sense they might be interested in going further getting a free training from you like gabi could have a free training on an excel sheet frank could have a free training on how he got his 170 000 job that's by the way that's a phenomenal free training to put out um that you could give out so that right then number three product 10 000 people might watch your [ __ ] 100 people might join your email list and one person might actually buy your product okay and this might actually mean for you whatever 297 597 um whatever right i but generally the best thing i can do for you is if i can get the thought of making a 10 course outside of your head if i can do that for you that's the best thing i can give you forget about all of that and don't ever like do not have a course if you're gonna work with me or you want to follow me longer term don't have something under 100 bucks why it's going to make your life miserable you're only going to do it most of the time because of lack of selfesteem because you don't believe that you could charge more guys louis vuitton purse i mean what the [ __ ] is in that purse what is it what is in the you guys tell me what is in that purse that's eight thousand dollars what's in that purse unicorn tears there's nothing in that purse so why are you so scared to put your course over a hundred dollars when giving us so much value louis vuitton doesn't give a [ __ ] what walmart is doing they're both respectable businesses in their own regard so don't give a [ __ ] what udemy is doing with udacity it's their business let them do it that way they want to sell it for ten dollars cool are there coding boot camps that are selling their coding bootcamp for fifteen thousand dollars yes their goddamn are so you if you keep looking at the ten dollars that's all you're gonna think about you're never gonna be able to get out of it i want you guys to stay away from that like that's like a slum like that's a sewer like stay away from fighting on pricing stay away from stay away from that land that's a really really bad bad place to be it's like those people you give them five dollars and then they make your life miserable like you know your friend just like bugging you hey can i have my five dollars back hey when when did you do the thing that i asked you like they go crazy over it whereas somebody some of my best clients or people who pay me like the mo like some of my best clients are people who pay me like 20 000 i almost don't hear from them i have to follow up with them and i'm like hey are you still there like we're working on more stuff for you and they're like oh [ __ ] really cool so those are the people you want to work with and then you bring them your best work because you're in a good head space so this is as simple as i could make it now this is a good point i want to take your questions but keep them about this guys so if you have some questions now is the time go for it yeah i asked this in chat but um you were saying did not really have low value products but all of my products are 99 cents because i produce music and stay away from that stay away from that stay the [ __ ] stay the [ __ ] away i'll tell you something my brother he wanted to do color grading okay he wanted to show people how to do better color like color their videos okay so you guys know like when you watch a video and it looks like you're like i don't know why but it looks like it's a hollywood video and it looks so good like those music videos and you're like i don't know what it is about it it looks like [ __ ] sick that's my brother my brother does that [ __ ] all right so he wanted to start when he was i i inspired him to get to doing youtube right that was my first thing that i helped him with like inspired him enough to do this so he got started i'm like yes then when it came to the product he's like you know everybody's selling these uh luts and i think i want to sell these luts they're these like these looks that are essentially like plugins so think of it like plugins and he's like i want to sell these plugins and he's like everybody sells them for like 99 cents or two dollars and stuff like that okay i told them i'm like please bro i'm like i love you but you know that um how should i say this instead of um making a million dollars you'll make um 97 that year and i'm like i [ __ ] love you but that's actually what's gonna happen but he's gonna hop on itunes and pay more than a dollar for a song you know so don't do it i i would go you know i mean depends what you want to do but i would go a different direction like for example you can keep playing that direction and if you're [ __ ] rock star then you'll blow up right but if you can teach that skill to people teach skill like actually give them a transformation now my brother gives them give instead of selling luts which is cool but like now he actually gives out transformations and you can join his program and become a colorist you can join this program and now you actually have the skill to go out there and charge other people and color their [ __ ] right like we show people how to become a developer people if we give them like a little plugin they'll pay us one dollar but if we can give them a transformation they're gonna pay us five hundred dollars seven hundred dollars one thousand dollars right so um that's what i want you to focus on when you think of creating a course i want you to focus on forget about how much stuff you got focus on what is the transformation you can give when you guys go to the dmv to get your license do you care if they keep you like for two hours or is it better if they leave you in one minute and just give you the updated license what is better updated live in one minute would you literally pay more if they could [ __ ] kick you out of there in like 30 seconds would you literally pay more yes yes everybody it's like a nightmare going to these legal things and sitting there for hours same thing here if you can give me a transformation i'd literally pay you more if you could help me do it faster or in a shorter amount of time so meaning you don't need to have 100 000 modules in your program in order to justify a price so uh that's the thing that i wanted to say okay for you mark i would go keep keep pumping out your songs but i think that if you can teach other people that skill that actually might be one of the most valuable things now i don't know maybe you're not into wanting to teach it which is fine but just know that if you were to teach that skill you could charge 500 because you can then create a transformation in people but for a song you probably cannot charge 500. that makes sense mark it's like imagine like i want to learn how to do ableton right i want to make old town road on ableton show me how to do that that's a course right like the finished product it's like hey here's a remix of volton road yes it's not as exciting that exactly so like inside that's that's money right there so like for example you could be like putting on tick tock content where you're like old town road and that's your content and i'm watching i'm like [ __ ] that's amazing i would put all that [ __ ] out for free and not charge for it and then in my course i'd be like i'll literally show you how i made this how i made the whole town road how i made this other song how i made this other song and i'll give you a breakdown and people would actually want to pay to learn how to do that like like i've paid for that so yeah you know what i mean like that's uh yeah of course i you know some help i don't know what the heck i'm doing i'm a beginner at it um so that's that's what people will pay for versus like a finished product is it's great you can i have also i have friends who are producers who also sell um basically like the ableton pack right all the the the song and all of the i don't honestly don't know what it's like the files to make the songs uh i do sell that also uh and they license things out um and they do they do pretty well there and it's not it's not 99 cents for sure it's right you know it's it's it's a hundred bucks and that that's sort of awesome so yes i agree with that that's right on the money so hopefully mark that helps you out we're going to go on to another question and then i want to keep continuing with this training all right guys so i want to make sure that just if you guys have questions right along these lines what mark asked i'd love to take them on the other questions i'll take them on a little bit later okay so that's the this go ahead go ahead because your thoughts on uh like patreon and stuff you know no uh because like some people do like projects don't share their servers and the source is kind of behind a payment wall or say yeah i mean like i'm not a fan of patreon like literally it's the same thing right so like and mark my brother actually did go on to make a million dollars my brother actually in one year my brother my brother actually just broke his first million in in about 12 months selling a 500 to 800 course on how to become a colorist and then he taught his skills in there he taught people what he did for his clients where their music videos got 280 million views he breaks that [ __ ] down in his course nice nice and he's putting out all the content out there for free so i do want to share that because that was the difference if we went the route of selling a 99 cent thing i swear to you that he would be at 8 700 in the whole year or max twelve thousand dollars max so okay i want you to think about that mark just to add into if you want more ideas for your channel if you just don't want to put like songs on youtube because copyright and stuff uh maybe you can do like a breakdown of stuff like how was the song created instead of like right not teaching them to create it but like these are the drums this is the bass these are the snares yes like what why what makes the song special stuff like that you know i think that would be able to break down select that awesome right all right so let's continue with this guys so uh here you guys cue cassie yeah what's up uh can i ask you yes you asked me three times bro you can ask me for sure go for it okay but uh i have a question in another topic not say youtube okay so let's address that later let's address all of those questions at a later time i want to keep going through this training and then we'll address your guys's questions okay thank you you got it you you got it all right so this is the path in a threestep process if i could break it down if you can be building an email list and launch the product when you get a like a thousand people on your email list or more that's a great time for you to actually launch a product i think that's a phenomenal time and you can launch your very first time and then go from there most of the times if you guys spend 95 of your time focusing on content you will win guaranteed if the entire year you forgot to build the email list and you forgot to build the product you cannot go wrong with this where you can go wrong is if you start with the product you can completely go wrong because you have no audience and nobody's interest so like all of that can be you can then go hey i made a product i spent months now you go out there and there's nobody out there that's gonna buy it so zero people would buy it so that's the path i don't want you to go down you can't just start an email list without having content so really the path that i recommend for people the path that i believe is the best is start with the content first start with the content link things to your email list so for example in your video like even for example gabi in your video or frank if you make your youtube videos make sure that like at the 45 second mark or the one minute mark you can say by the way i do want to say i have a free training on how i landed a 170 000 a year job if you're interested in that make sure you go here put in your name and email below and it's a completely free training you can sign up with that said let's jump back into the video does that make sense frank 100 i did not know about convertkit yes so that is like money right there that's like money like that is if you can just take that and actually apply it that same video like for example that video just keeps going and going if that video goes up to 2 million views that one video got you 50 000 subscribers and boom that one video will get you like 10 000 people or 20 000 people on your email list one video the one right video literally never thought of that man thanks so much it's it's crazy dude like how that works it's insane and then you just go to those 20 000 people and you're like hey i am making some [ __ ] that like i spent my whole life's work on it's pretty awesome do you want it most of them 99 of them will say no thank you 99.5 of them will say no thank you half a percent of them will say yes that's the only half a percent you need in order to do 200 000 400 000 800 000 1.6 million dollars 2.7 million dollars 10 million that half percent is the only percent that you need to say yes so let's go that's the only reply what do you say yes that sounds amazing i love that bro yeah that's that's the that's the right uh reply so that i would say is a really good thing to focus on build a content email list almost forget about your product at some point ask for the sale of the product and you guys will be good okay i hope that this got brought to you guys does this bring you guys clarity by the way on what the path to making income from youtube can look like does that give you guys clarity on it definitely yeah it's a great yes okay awesome um because it's one of those things that's really hard for people to go hey what is the best way to monetize what's the best way to do this what's the best way to do that and i think a lot of the other ways are really complicated but if you can have something where you can share with people and charge for it i believe it's the fastest way to get to your like whatever your goals are like whether it's your income goals business goals whatever okay i'm just reading the chat uh cause your thoughts on monetizing channel videos yeah i monetize most of my videos uh it brings in a little bit of revenue for our channel but because a coding channel it's very like it's like very little revenue i mean it's four thousand seven hundred dollars right now that we're making every month from it um but you know yeah so but like how many views we're getting we should really be getting like way more revenue if we had a higher cpm so if we had a channel on finance or something then the revenue is way higher like graham stefan with this gram stefan because he has a channel on finance for the same [ __ ] i get two thousand dollars in a month graham gets two hundred thousand dollars in a month for that so yeah so his ad revenue is like pretty pretty nuts um okay i'm looking at some of the questions how to use the email list use it as a link to both the content and the product no so that's a great question the email list is only for i'm gonna give you a free training when you give me your email you get the free training that's it and now they're on your email list the only number one goal of anybody ever going on your website is for them to give you their email that's it that's all your website's purposes your website's purpose is not for your website to look pretty is not for you to have a nice logo not for you to build your selfesteem not so you could share it at the dinner table i'm launching a business take a look at my website none of those are reasons to have a website the one and only reason for your website is so people can go to it and they can give you their email and that's it that's like where your website will start that's where your website ends pretty weird thing but that's all your content on youtube websites so they can get your you can get email and then you're good kazi how do you send email to us what service convertkit that's how i send you guys emails that's how you guys got the email from um from today i hope you guys got an email today but that's where you guys got it from who's coming here from by the way who's coming here from the text that i'm sending is anybody able to use those i want to get a sense of like just raise your hands and keep them raised if you saw the text or if you opened the text or you saw the text so i see adam keep your hands raised the whole time rocio stacey matulla coyote giulio okay uh misha xavier okay cool all right all right you guys can put your hands on thank you so much i just wanted to get a sense of it so it seems like it's a pretty good percentage of the people that are getting the text or responding to it so that's something i'm experimenting with but i love how it allows me to like just connect with you directly like yesterday i saw something from giulio and i just like actually responded to it you know and like it's just one on one like 11 30 p.m and i'm like oh that's easy just respond whereas from email that's like really it's it's a little bit harder uh text is not convertkit for text the service i'm using is called community it's like bleeding edge i've had to go down some weird rabbit holes to discover it but it is the best i was using super phone before and it was ridiculous it was like 300 for one like if i added it would go from 300 to like 380 if i just add an extra exclamation mark at the end like literally an extra period at the end it'd be like boom like each text would cost me between 100 to 500 to send to people so like if i had to invite you guys to the training it would cost me like four hundred dollars like literally to tell you guys hey there's a training like 400 like jesus so super phone i'm running away from community is much better um and much easier guys another service probably the most important one if you are thinking about launching a course um okay let me ask you guys that you are on this call what are you guys trying to uh sell like after this conversation like what are you guys thinking about selling like are you who here is interested in potentially using their knowledge to at some point maybe think about selling a course okay cool so a bunch of people here um awesome again there's many things you can sell one of the things for one of the things that's really easy is a course and i want to show you guys a platform you can use to do that and the platform that i recommend for you guys is kajabi that's the platform that we use okay so kajabi is why i like kajabi is it's going to be your website and where you sell your course all in one place so here and super easy to use so you can have your website for example i have cleverprogrammer.com this is hosted on kajabi so this is my website right and if i go to customer reviews blah blah blah fullon website and if you were a student and you wanted to access our courses you would just hit log in and be able to access the courses this is the only combination i found that combines websites and making courses so easy everything else doesn't have what this has there are a lot of alternatives out there teachable podia and then there are some other ones stay away from wordpress don't go to wordpress stay away run away you're gonna make your life hell you're gonna instead of trying to sell a course you're just gonna spend all your whole life away trying to make one [ __ ] plugin work stay away um also you i would have recommended squarespace until i discovered that on kajabi you can have a website all in one place so instead of going through the nightmare of what we went through having a squarespace and then kajabi and then having to integrate them into one which was like pulling teeth it's like root doing root canals really hard painful once things get integrated over long term much better if you guys just start with one thing and then it makes your life easier cool so that's what i recommend for you guys to go ahead um sorry quick question yes do services like squarespace or the other one you mentioned do they offer ssl certificates or no i think almost everything offers uh ssl certificates i've been building my own for too long yeah so yeah yeah there's all the it's like the curse of the developer or like there we always want to build everything ourselves and it's like one of the worst things you can do because then you're spending all your time on making it then you're spending all your time on like developing a service that already really exists and not really teaching or helping people a lot you know how many people would come to my website and they're like this guy is a joker he didn't even code his own website i'm out full stack developer more like using a service for ten dollars a month i'm like i don't care like i again you just need half a percent of the people to agree with you everybody can not agree with you and that's okay so um go don't go that route you're gonna spend all your time coding it up then you're gonna spend all your time maintaining it instead of spending time on making content caring about your customers anything that pulls you away from caring about your customers or the potential people stay away from that not worth it okay so all of that stuff is already made um and then just pay for it that's the beautiful thing you can just pay for it and you get it i just dropped all the links in the comment also on the channel oh thank you thank you thank you thank you that's perfect so yeah direct text messaging community um i am a bleeding edge marketer i am using the community platform and it's it works for me uh i don't want you guys to get too hung up or crazy over every single thing as long as you have an email list you're solid if you want to use the community thing you can okay but it's just cause like i i'm just sharing with you guys the most advanced [ __ ] that i've discovered now that i'm using so you don't don't feel like you need to jump on this right away all right awesome uh cool so those are the resources that will help you get started in your journey those are the resources that hopefully will make your path much easier if you're about to go down this path because if you get started with the wrong things it's so painful i remember trying to sell like trying to put a course somewhere and nothing i would do would just i'm like guys i'm literally just trying to create something that i can sell why is it so hard why'd i have to coach it up why why'd you have to discover these plugins and so everything was really really complicated and it took all the time and energy from me actually making content me actually providing value so avoid those rabbit holes pick the simplest platforms from either convertkit for email kajabi for hosting course and website and it makes things really really easy and yeah it um and then for payment processors if you're trying to collect payment because at some point people are going to want to pay you um so you know whether you're making a course on finance or programming or you know or are on music you're going to have people pay you so the payment processor i recommend are two so here's what i recommend and you guys can write these down for payment you guys need one stripe which is the best payment processor so get a stripe you have stripe already stacy oh [ __ ] nice um and then the second payment processor you're gonna need is paypal okay so these are the two payment processors um that are the best with kajabi both of them will plug in and get integrated so i recommend using that making an account on it so then you can collect the payment okay but step one is you're gonna need a youtube account so if you don't have a youtube account go make that first wait service i opened up chat oh there it is yeah so i i mean i have tried thrive cart alexandros i've tried sam cart all of that you can i just go everything kajabi now like even my checkout i had um i had squarespace where my website was i had kajabi where my course was i had sam cart where i collected the payment from for checkout and then yeah i was like it was a [ __ ] nightmare to it was it was yeah it was just too many different texts and it was so hard to do any type of tracking anything that i want to do that was more advanced was a nightmare so i just completely went not that route uh later like it took us three to four years to completely switch now we're just all kajabi i even tried the clickfunnels route kajabi just makes everything so damn simple and for me simplicity i put on a pedestal and speed above everything um and so yeah that's what i would recommend just simplify it and make it easier for yourself all right guys so how was this guy how was this for you guys was this valuable for you guys yes yes too much value beautiful okay beautiful i'm glad that you guys got value out of it now guys what i want to do is i want to get into some questions and you guys want to do youtube roast today as well yeah okay dope awesome so let's take on some questions now is the time you can drop them in the chat or you can just speak them out loud go for it i want to take on new people so i want to make sure that some new people we're taking on for questions go ahead like i haven't heard anything from rob and rama even though you have an amazing background i always see it and i love it um i haven't heard anything from lawrence or corey or issa or alicia or raphael reynold so anybody who hasn't asked a question before i think it's a great time to ask one but go ahead guys i know we have questions guys you guys had your hands up a little bit earlier yeah i think the uh question in the chat from md is pretty good okay cool so md asks is it okay to put different niches into one channel or is it better to put them in different channels um i think it's better if you just have one niche and a channel that's usually it's gonna give you the best clearest growth you could try to do it but it's it's very hard like for example i tried to add personal development in my coding channel and it just always like sucked always like performed horribly so i kind of like just stopped completely i got there was a lot of stuff that was really meaningful to me on the personal development side but at some point i just kind of had to not talk about that same thing with i wanted to talk a lot about freelancing but there was just like no matter how much i wanted to talk about it not a lot of people wanted to listen to it because people just wanted to get jobs and so that was something that i would talk about but i started talking about it less on the channel um and i wanted to lean into where people were already listening to more of it and then help them with the thing that they needed help with so i think if you can niche down it's probably going to be better but don't again don't let that stop you from actually getting started all right beautiful so awesome can you show us which tool used to create or edit videos and how do you post it on youtube great question i use final cut pro to edit most of my content and if you want to use your phone to edit you can use an app called video leap it's amazing i have people using yive to create videos on youtube do you have an opinion about yive what tells you i've i'm looking it up right now your instant video empire huh the mass video marketing platform that launches your business success um i mean it looks funny to me but who knows it could be good you know so i don't know i i believe in just like using if you use final cut pro i think you're going to be good if you want to use another tool i'm not against it you i'm open to it you guys can check it out premiere is really good yeah so whether you want to use final cut or whatever use whatever you guys want i got on final cut i like it it's the easiest for me and i move on with it another thing i like about final cut is it's simple i believe it's way simpler than adobe premiere pro and so if you just want to not get let anything get in your way then i recommend just going with final cut um you were talking dimas says you were talking that we don't need to put money into ads before you get the money from content but how then attract viewers friends or friends trendy titles and picks and what else um good videos on good topics are gonna work and so yeah that's how you do it and it takes time but that's how you do it because at some point it has to be not your friends or friends or those people watching it and when those people start watching it then you're on the right track alicia i'm loving your setup bro you got you got the piano you got the mic what are you doing are you making youtube content right now or what's going on yeah appreciate it um so i don't have any questions but um i came across one of your ads on facebook and i clicked it and then you retargeted me and then you emailed me and i'm like okay this guy knows what he's doing so i just want to just chime in and say what's up keep killing it and uh thank you bro good stuff bro definitely oh that's sick i appreciate it man i appreciate that yeah i actually took a step back from youtube a little bit and just kind of wanted to really define my niche a little bit because i had a music channel as a rapper and then i had hit 10 000 subscribers and i'm like i started getting checks from youtube and i said let me try to really figure this youtube thing out and maybe go like go a different route because kind of like what a young man was saying it's kind of hard to get rich off of 99 singles you know what i'm saying so now i'm just i'm going to focus on like content creation and monetization and just like education so that's kind of where i'm at with it right now so appreciate it awesome and what are you thinking right now like are you going to get back on youtube are you going to create content where's your mind at so my mind right now well first of all i just had to upgrade everything so i got cameras and mics and all that because i didn't have none of that so now i have like a setup so yeah i just want to like i don't know man maybe you can uh answer that maybe you can give me some advice on what you think would be the best route to go i love content creation i love teaching people so um maybe that's kind of where i'm at with it to be honest with you beautiful and then okay cool and uh what's your situation looking like for money are you are you making i'm imagining that you're making your living from somewhere outside of youtube yeah so i'm an insurance broker hate it though you know yeah you know i sell insurance i don't like talking about insurance all day so yeah but i've always been a pretty successful artist in orlando i'm pretty big so i do shows concerts and stuff like that but it's like that battle of your passion and then your paycheck so i'm like i want my passion to overtake my paycheck type stuff so that's where i'm at so yeah yeah so i don't know if you listen to my pa like between that that transition between 2016 to 2017 where i dropped out and i i uh gave up all my clients i was making between 70 to 100 000 a year and i gave up and i dropped it to zero because my my channel started taking off it showed me signs of taking off because i had 3 000 subscribers in that month and so i realized there's something here and i want to see what happens if i pursue it fully brother you've got a channel with 10 000 plus subscribers there's a lot of [ __ ] people that believe in you yeah it's like eleven five now but it's nothing like where you're at but yeah um i'm gonna just try to like really go for it i think a a nice regimen is like maybe two to three videos a week dude and i i noticed that the algorithm really favors you when you're really putting content out consistently so i think that's my biggest thing just put out content and really just try to like find my niche and really try to see what people gravitate to and just do more of that basically please please like you already got something and you just need to keep going bro like just go just [ __ ] go like take out all that other voice bro and you just gotta go because dude you have you're on a winning streak don't quit when you're on a winning streak bro like don't quit so 11 5 that's 11 000 people voting like for me that means you have 11 000 people that voted for you that believe in you if you put those many people in one like stadium it would like fill up a freaking stadium so if you got that much vote of confidence behind you you need to going you need to keep going and figure out how to monetize it bro because i want you to like this is where i'm in between what gary garyvee says and what i say because i want you to figure out how to make a living from this because if you could do that then i know you will quit your insurance job that you [ __ ] hate so you could do the thing that you love fulltime that's what i would want for you yeah yeah appreciate it you got me pumped man you gotta you should be a motivational speaker or something dude you got me pumped over here yeah dude he is a motivational speaker he's speaking to you and he's motivating you yeah it's like absolutely amazing community and would say i was i was going to say like music there is a way to monetize it like we were just talking about before people are trying to do a little 99 cent hits the little things like that it's there's a way to say hey how can i make that right like how can i make that in ableton like something that you know really well or like how do i make my voice project more how do i get that that sound right like there's it's like turning that into a horse that's where the fire is that's where the fire it you is an amazing channel like i'm even looking at this right now and your [ __ ] is killing it yeah it's but like i said it's all over the place that's where i really had to just focus on my niche you know what i'm saying so bro okay so it's sometimes it's even okay if that happens i mean you can focus more on your niche if you want but i'm even looking at this and i'm like damn bro you're doing some great stuff and you're getting a lot of love from people 666 000 views is no joke to add that to a video this has to be a good video otherwise it just won't because that's the thing about youtube if the watch time isn't there it won't send it out to more people so you're making good content that people are watching um and then they're gonna go to your next piece of i mean i mean man this video is looking good too [ __ ] hold on managing social media god damn it i paid to not have to see ads why is easy still let me get my coins bro let me get my coins bro like two seconds in i already know what the video is about your title is dialed in your freaking tags are dialed in you got the beautiful ring light amazing my setup is looking great and start making money off of all of your youtube videos if so you're in the dude insurance [ __ ] br that doesn't make you this happy look at the smile that you got on your right place i'm gonna give you three easy steps on how you can monetize your youtube channel and start rolling in the dough coming right up yo love it that's not bro you're making me you're making me blush over here bro i bet you i bet you you don't talk to your insurance customers like this right no heck no hey you don't have you don't have the heart in it right like bro you're hitting that youtube hard i'm telling you bro you please you gotta just go all into this dude you just gotta do that like i'm so certain of it that if you were like if we again like uh my brother like if i would imagine you're like my you're my brother or you're my good friend we're just sitting right next to each other i would tell you the same thing i told my brother and i literally told him i'm like the best thing that can happen to you is if you all of a sudden lost your job like literally today you lost your job and he would laugh and he'd be like haha yeah then he actually called me one day and he's like dude i lost my job and he was like having tears coming out of his eyes wow and i um i mean i heard him have tears coming out of his eyes because he was sniffling and [ __ ] so i put my phone on mute and i was just screaming and it was the happiest day of my life dude i was like laughing i was like yes i was like [ __ ] god bless like we've done it hallelujah like let's go then i up unmute and i was like bro that [ __ ] sucks yeah yeah and that was the day he started making content on youtube that was the day he actually got started fast forward one year from now and he has a whole business and he doesn't have to worry about anything else so like i really do believe that the best thing that can happen to you which is would suck and most people will be like oh don't say that i like the best thing that happened to you is if they either stop you from having that job like today or you stop that job and i believe in your channel and what you have so much because you already have a track record for it too that this would be the fastest path for you to grow like the most logical path honestly i think it's the safest path appreciate it i'm gonna go for it man i'm gonna go for it bro appreciate it man beautiful bro it means a lot man it means a lot yes uh when was the last time you put out a video like i said i haven't really put out anything uh this year i'll get like some gear and i'll do like an unboxing or something but i've i've been gearing up and just right writing all my ideas down so i'm just gonna really just hit it hard like probably start in december i'm just hitting hard like like couple videos a week beautiful and i mean look at this you have content coming out i mean you put something one month ago yeah it was just a um like a little desk tour because i just kind of like i said i've been getting all my gear up and stuff so now i feel confident to really go for it because i have everything i need you know what i'm saying beautiful what's stopping you bro from making a video this week not nothing i'll do it let's do it i got it let's do it i'm getting so excited i'm kind of getting goosebumps because i can feel these moments and i love them like i'll tell you this when the day my brother made his first sale i started crying i had tears coming out of my eyes i swear to god because up until that point i was so close to helping him and all of this i even sat in chat to like support him and then the day that he got his first sale i cried because i knew that that day he's not gonna need my help anymore that day is the day that he sees it's possible for him and now he's just gonna go my job here is done so for you like why i'm getting so excited because i feel like we're so close to this win um can you is there a way you can make a video today bro uh yeah when i get the kids to sleep i got a little one so i get them to sleep yeah i do it dude that is sick um that would be so sick and can you bring that video in tomorrow uh yeah i can i'm gonna make a video about this whole interaction right here and i'm

even when you were just sitting there i'm like there's something there bro awesome bro thank you appreciate it man yes please bring that thing tomorrow i would love to watch it um and dude i like your channel a lot so i'm gonna subscribe to this channel but oh man that's dope man i appreciate it now you definitely gotta start producing content i'm not i'm not gonna let you down bro guys please don't please don't all right awesome great that was exciting um questions before we get into the roast okay cool so if there are no more questions we can get into it um um oh who go ahead vicente um sorry um i just have a quick question so uh i i know that we've been talking about like the process but um when you were working like did you have like a schedule you set up where like every time i'm gonna every day i'm gonna get home from work i'm gonna work on a video and i'm just keep doing that or did you just do it whenever you had free time i did it when i had i i built my entire channel i mean the start of the channel in one in one hour windows so i would i would have uh full time i was like going to college and then i would go and do parttime like work and i would do a lot of freelancing work and then i would come home by 8 or 9 p.m and then i had a 9 p.m to 10 p.m window so i'd leave home at 6 a.m come home at like 9ish p.m and then i would do between 9 to 10 p.m is when i would make my videos that's how i got got it started okay i see yep and then thank you and then two or three months in when i hit 3 000 or 5 000 subscribers that's when i just went all i just quit i just went full in because i saw i'm like if i'm getting momentum and i hit three to five thousand subscribers there's something here and i just gotta go all right thank you very much yeah you got it man yeah i'm still looking at that channel and i'm excited it's like the how to monetize youtube channel fast that video like yeah okay all right cool so um music channel all right guys now start dropping your links and let me know what type of roast you're looking for i know some of you guys already dropped it um and then we'll start from there so i see stacy stacy what are you looking for i don't have to go first um i'll take a dark roast i mean yeah i'll be okay all right cool let's do it okay so um cool how to so i i like i like overall how the title looks i think when you when you get cute with titles sometimes they don't actually perform well because people don't know what you're talking about i know you're talking probably about git version control i have popped the squat in my recliner and i am ready to introduce you unless there's something wrong on my end i think the audio is really low on this video like i think yeah i think something happened to my audio yeah okay github that has this great platform that's better that allows you to save all your i'm saying that i was there to work to process okay great so i would edit like this part out where i think you're looking at something or trying to open up something so if it's a video and it's not a live stream then i would edit that out or i would just do better preparation in the start yeah i didn't do too much editing on this one okay so either do so here's this here's the thing right if you don't want to do editing then you got to do a lot of preparation and mentally put yourself in that state so like if i'm not gonna do if i'm not gonna do uh if if i want my people to shoot a video of me but i don't wanna do a lot of preparation then i get myself in the zone and then you just give me a topic right so you're just like so somebody give me some topic here any of you guys can give me a topic here giraffes giraffes what else git and github get in github okay so if i have preparation then that's great if i don't have preparation then i just got to go on the spot but be energetically wired so i'm like just going so then you don't need to edit it so then i just make myself so good that you don't need you don't need to edit it as much so then if it's like yo guys here are the top five things we're gonna learn about giraffes in this video now before we get started make sure you hit like subscribe to the channel this is me stacy joseph let's roll the intro that happens right i like alicia's laughing because that's probably his intro so either you have to like get your energy up and then really commit and go all in um that's one way of doing it or two just make sure you edit like if you're feeling like oh my energy is i'm like um now we're gonna open up github now we're going to open up this and then if you're looking at the thing and it's not prepared ahead of time so make sure you edit that part out so then the video is like paced well so if i'm watching it then i'm actually going to commit to watching you okay because it seems like okay you care you're not gonna waste my time you're gonna be respectful of my time especially the first stage especially the first few seconds are so important so if in the first few seconds you lose my attention you don't hook me i'm not going to get past i'm not going to get to the other parts and also to have others be able to collaborate with you don't tell me how i go about getting it so audio needs to improve um audio is like really bad it's really hard to understand what you're actually saying plus i think you're sitting away from the mic so i would recommend that you can invest in a might like a yeti and i think that will go a really far a long way if you're anything like me i need to know step by step what i need to do is my github after that if your mic is there i think this video is going to start popping like there's something about good audio that just makes things pop so even when you guys saw like alicia's video we put on before yes he has really great lighting yes he has a lot of those things but it's the mic that does a lot of the magic where all of a sudden you're like whoa like for example i want you guys to notice the difference between my voice right now and i want you to notice the difference between my voice right now did my voice my that is it like really an is is it much more annoying to hear me now like it's almost like this sad sound far away yeah it's not equally echoey far away like weird right all of that and then all of a sudden i'm like how's it going guys what is up right it is just howard's turn like hey how's it going right yeah yeah so audio makes the most difference the most difference um and then yeah so i would focus on the video part of it later other than that i sometimes just skim through to see how i feel about the video so here when i see visually things changing that's a really good sign i would increase the energy in the intro because that there's there's no energy in the intro like and here it's almost like you you're like you forgot that you even had a camera on or something for a few seconds so that part is important other than that you're good add some visuals so when you say github github logo should pop up like have a github logo or a github image right there that's gonna be a better way to go so that's what i have for you okay okay cool all right let's go um all right i'm gonna go with muktum ahmaktum are you here yes because okay dope all right let's go with this one and see what's going on here hey guys welcome back to the great start i hope you are doing well so in this video i'm going to show you great you're getting to the point pretty quickly you how can you write python code into visual studio code great i already know what's happening here i'm not a fan of the title of the video to be honest python with vs code like that doesn't make that much sense to me i would probably do something along the lines of like um how to like visual studio code setup with python or like how to set up visual studio code using python something along the lines of something that's a lot more popular and people are already searching up and looking up when people have to read your title and go um what is that when you have to explain it to somebody it's red flag that's a danger anytime you have to explain something to somebody red flag so make sure it's something that immediately either yet or something is already popular when you made this title did you do the research of seeing what other titles like this are popular okay so that's what i would do and then i would uh then i would post up with that title python.org website i'm going is installed your energy is good you flow through it fast i like it check whether it is python and check it out go to vs code the vs code looks like this so you can save it as need of semicolon i think you have potential i can even see you have 16 to one dislike you're already over a thousand subscribers uh so it tells me you've probably been doing it for a minute i can see your energy and how you move with it so that's really really good i think just do more of this if you can invest in a better mic i don't know if you have a yeti if you can get something like a yeti go with that i think your thumbnails are really bad thumbnails i think you have to work on okay so i'll tell you the thumbnails that i think are actually good and uh so this one is okay uh this one is a little bit better um this one starts to get too much like i don't care about bai who and i don't care about learn with muktum so anything that makes it look like a flyer remove that that's an awful thumbnail um let's see most of the thumbnails they're really busy like you're you're putting a whole diagram on them so they're like too much there's too much going on hard to read model channels that are doing well make thumbnails like them that's the simplest way i can make it and it doesn't matter if you're in freaking india or sri lanka or canada or u.s it doesn't matter like this stuff to make things look good it doesn't cost you [ __ ] it's free just look at what the people who have the best channels just make it look like theirs then immediately it'll look good and it won't look cheesy and it won't look weird and it'll actually make people want to click on it okay also there's a free tool called canva.com yes and they there's uh there's a bunch of really good templates for youtube that's what i use for for the video that kazzy's about to roast me on nice all right cool so that's your roast let's go to frank hey everyone have you been wondering what git and github are i'm going to show you oh [ __ ] one tool for developers to use to collaborate with code all right our first step that's all you gave me get in github huh this is going to be going to github.com so open up your google chrome browser let's go right to it okay so something i want to tell you frank is i mean you you got it this channel is gonna go this channel is gonna grow okay something i would tell you um you're holding back emotionally okay i can see the fire in you and you kind of want to go but you're almost like holding back and being kind let that go and just be more like a little bit more on the voice so like i would i would just a little bit on the higher louder projection and i would just like go so like you're so close to it but it's like you know even the little bit like what is git and github like i would just go yo what is github yo this is your boy frank what is git and github you're like that even on the calls you know like you go crazy even on the calls on video when you go way overboard that's when you actually look normal it's really weird right so like even you guys paying attention to me on this call when i actually go overboard and i'm speaking really loud because that's not how i'm speaking when i'm with my girlfriend and we're just sitting eating like here's how i actually will speak with her right i'm like hey how's your day going though yeah so like this crazy thing happened the other day and you know we were on a call with these people on the zoom and it was such a cool call like i just loved it but you guys see how that doesn't actually sound normal to you guys on zoom it's like you guys lose energy and attention so i have to actually go way above and beyond on the call for it to actually sound normal so same thing on the youtube end i would push there's something holding you back i would push that way harder so then it actually sounds like really good and step is gonna be going to github.com i like that little like i like the design of the background the image that you have and then i like how what is getting github like how it's moving towards me so open up your google chrome browser let's go right to it it's built for developers you'll see this is like a very top tool everyone uses this to collaborate with code nice um you need to know this it's very important so let's click so here you're saying like you need to know this this is very important i just want you to do you need to know this this is very important i'd love for you to learn it and so that just a little bit louder there's something beautiful about it that it like hooks you there's something about it that when you listen you actually want to stay there just for a second longer so that energy is where i want you to play at because your video is already looking crispy clean click here on the sign up button nice i like how i don't know how you have a mouse that's bigger than [ __ ] my face but it's awesome a little test account let's see frank right like holy [ __ ] like this thing is [ __ ] huge uh dev uh let's pick something fun let's make a email address oh my god disposed something is with the sound there's a lot of hum in the background so i would focu i would reduce the gain to zero all right and let's let's make the password the same but make it 20 20. all right all right here we go are you sweating go email press preferences mega spicy chili's right okay holy [ __ ] dude let's verify that we're a real human let's pick the spiral i know um i know how it feels when you're making content and and yeah i've been through a lot of those sessions where i'm making content it just feels very contrived and like so sometimes just like loosen up a little bit before making it uh but you have to put your uh reps in so there's no way out of it so that's okay okay let's cut our profile here and here you see this is a repository called free code camp excellent repository see they have a bunch of different things here a bunch of different files it's a very large project here you see there's a lot of people watching the project that means dope so this is you know i love this you're gonna you're gonna improve so fast you're gonna get so good just keep putting it out and hitting public publish on it and then go and do another one another one this reminds me of like remember when i started my first videos and you can see that there's just something holding me back you know what i'm talking about right yeah i saw it um and so it's it's it's literally like that where it was something holding me back almost for a bunch of videos and then i started coming into my own and then i'm just like i'm just going this is what i want to teach and i'm going to go so keep making the these videos and keep making more and more of them so increase your quantity and just in a loving way i want you to focus on increasing your energy that you come in with like commit to coming in with your like entire energy see what i'm saying 100 100 i recorded this video at midnight and it's probably better to do it daytime so i could go real crazy yeah yeah yeah have the neighbors kill me yeah i mean yeah i love it though hey this is exactly like you're saying this is like exercise it's like practice you know i'm taking everything to heart i'm writing everything down what's up with that thumbnail though i took your your advice on the thumbnail oh let me see the thumbnail okay so let's go here i like the yellow oh [ __ ] i love the thumbnail nice job on it that's looking really really clean so great job on this the reason why i actually say to put your face on the right hand side sometimes is because this uh watermark actually blocks a lot of what's happening here so um it's it's like a actual problem like it's [ __ ] huge you don't see it right now because i'm on your video but like if i'm on my phone and it's in the recommended that watermark is huge there's like bunch of stuff that you could have there like for example the github logo is hidden so that github logo so that's why i would put the face here and then i would put the stuff on the left hand side that's one thing another thing is there's no need for a youtube logo in this so i would remove the youtube logo um the github the get in github logo is what i would have that pops a lot more so i would do this where okay i don't know if you could just try to follow me okay i'd move your face here i put the git and github logos like here and then i would put your text here kind of like that and no youtube and make sure the git and github logo have colors because they have such amazing colors that pop out you know that octocat or whatever it's it's really nice it pops so i would yeah i would put that there and that would be great but this is but other than that i mean it's a great thumbnail great thumbnail so nice job bro this is amazing all right guys everybody give it up for frank amazing job brother thanks guys nice mark is doing snaps i love it uh cool let's go on to who who should we take next we got oh we got lots of comments down below you can pick mark what who's mark is that did mark just say you could pick mark i don't know oh you said that oh all right i i totally okay okay i'm sorry i just got confused i need like a huge tv where i can ha i can see everybody nice savior what's going on brother all right cool dope bro i love your hair all right cool let's go to joey all right here we go joey joey my friend joe g music are you on this call right now joey hello going once going twice all right we'll move on to the next one uh let's go with red red diane yo what's up this is radion from top notch programmer and today i'm going to share with you an instagram dm bot so this bot is build it using python programming language and this bot can send messages to a list usernames on instagram you can use this bot for influencing for advertisement to get jobs or to increase your followers before watching this video please make sure to like and subscribe so we can break this youtube algorithm and we can share this video oh [ __ ] let's get right into it that's what i'm talking about bro that is a massive improvement you need to do is just to go to my github repository and clone we have to install holder uh let's extract here oh man i i want to talk about like the fury of the bangers i don't i never i haven't talked about it yet let's make and uh here and as you can see it log in successful and now we send this message to the first user okay cool uh make sure that random [ __ ] that you have in users text that that's clean so i don't know if these are the names of the users but make sure that there's not dumb [ __ ] in here because you're gonna get either downvoted or banned on youtube so just be careful about that okay so that's one thing i would just be careful about other i i just imagined probably was either a mistake or you were like scraping some username and somebody just had a random username and that's okay um what i would say for the rest of it intro is really really good okay so i love how this intro is and i want you guys to have intros like this too especially if you're showing people how to make something the best way to show that is just demonstrate it in the start yo what's up this is radion from top notch programmer and today i'm going to share with you an instagram dm bot so this one is build it using python programming language that's great so great intro on that um that i would be careful about like you're just like breathing into the mic you're not really talking okay let's extract here okay now is is extracted we can delete the zip file paste yeah so just i think like just overall flow of it i would make it a little bit faster so as long as you're speaking or you're giving some tips even in those small moments that's what makes a really big difference so there's very subtle things but they make a big difference so for example if you guys are watching my tutorials and i'm talking about moving this scrape bot or opening this folder i won't just be like and then clicking on this i i will actually be saying like all right guys so now we're gonna unzip the ig bot so i'm gonna go ahead and double click it and unzip it all right now it's unzipping it'll be unzipped in a second and as soon as that's done i'm going to move it over into the scrape bot and then as soon as the unzip happens i go all right now that that's over let's go ahead and put it into here so that part is really important to be able to have the flow of it going the entire time if you can keep the flow going it helps people get through everything okay so that's one thing i would improve here other than that great job radiant and big improvement from yesterday guys everybody give it up for red diane awesome brother love it love it love it okay let's go ahead for the next person and remember guys day five just want to share this with you guys day five of the challenge is tomorrow and what are we doing on day five of the challenge creating a blueprint yes you're creating yeah you're creating your very own blueprint for your own youtube channel all right so that's what we're gonna be doing and then day six i'm gonna have a surprise for you guys i shared with you guys a little bit about the launch of the course and that i can talk to you guys about it on day six and how it might even be possible for you guys to join so we're gonna talk about that more tomorrow at the end of tomorrow but right now i want to keep going through everybody's youtube channels so let's keep going through that all right so we got alex alexandros cool let's go i love it because you come to all of our you you would come to all of our youtube live streams so that was super awesome all right so let's see here are you there alexandros yes okay i'm here beautiful so um what i see here and you're a monk so i'm gonna be nice to you yeah it was a little draft effort so not so prepared okay that's fine you know but you know about what it's better then yes i know several improvements can be made so for example the sound can be improved yes no no no no that's not what i was saying i was saying it's even if even even though it's in draft it's better than 99 of the people who don't even have one video so you gotta congratulate yourself on the fact that you actually have a video okay so that's really really good so now let's go through it hello alexander's tuition friends and welcome to our cute python tutorial from pandas it's kind of ridiculous how much sound makes a difference when you watch this you're like there's so much wrong with this but if if he didn't change anything else and the only thing he changed is audio and just reduced his gain to zero put the mic really close to him and spoke that alone would make this video like completely watchable just that one thing alone like actually pay attention to sound right now right function based on slides by the instagram profile azure will so because of there's a lot of sound in the back if just that one thing improves almost everything improves so let's keep going now through this you can find the slides on this link i like how you have stuff prepared and organized alexandro so good job on that because you're respecting people's time i like that you have preparation behind it um this slide so so as you can see it says pandas shift function shifting grows there's kids in the back there's like all kinds of craziness so that's where this is the number one way to make your videos sound professional and something worth watching just audio i cannot emphasize enough invest in audio that automatically makes so many things better oh dude you are like you are actually providing valuable [ __ ] it reminds me of the garyvee tick tock where he told people he's like it's easy he's like open your camera and he's like just say valuable [ __ ] and people started making all these tick tocks where literally all they do when they open their cameras they just open the camera they go valuable [ __ ] so it reminded me of that tick tock and i was laughing but this is really valuable i think that if you just keep going you're gonna actually do well the only things for you um see if you can replace this with your actual face yes if you can't then maybe then just make the whole screen coding okay um other than that brother the only other advice i'll give you is keep going and make more you're making good content you're providing value people always want to go where they can get value from so improve your audio and then just make more content that's the best advice i got for you okay brother thank you very much you got it nice all right you got it take care uh yazid dark roast a bit of sugar uh kevin yeah yeah just a minute i'm uploading the video here just four minutes okay cool if you can go to the next all right all right got it got it got it all right xavier king let's go xavier's got his whole website up all right so kings oh okay i see it redirects me to it like that cool what yeah looks better than the garbly [ __ ] at the top youtube link yeah got it all right so okay so my first thing is what is happening i think i'm mostly confused so is this supposed to be like a lifestyle vlog or something uh not quite i am in the process of converting a school bus into a tiny house on wheels oh [ __ ] the process of the build okay and are there other people who do similar things yeah are there other people that are popular doing similar things um i believe still i know i've seen a bit where i was looking into it okay so so i see here watch this before you start a bus conversion i would literally i would just type in schooly and i would look at like what people are doing and what thumbnails are crushing it and that's what i would model the [ __ ] out of yeah so the number one thing is that you need to work on i cannot emphasize all your need your time and energy needs to go to like learning this and by learning this it literally means you type in one word and you take one thumbnail type of idea and one title and that's it you're good yeah so popular titles are really important that's really important i call them bangers all your channels need bangers you all need to [ __ ] make bangers if you don't make bangers your channels will never grow people are always like why are my channels not growing you don't have bangers so you gotta make bangers that's the only way you get found ever i have 490 videos on my youtube channel i have 830 000 plus subscribers on the clever programmer youtube channel there are only 10 videos that bring me all of those subscribers literally 10 videos that bring me 800 000 subscribers and then the other 400 whatever like they bring value and all that [ __ ] so you need things that help you get discovered a lot of you want to find out you guys want to find out right how you get discovered on youtube guys yes or no yeah if you want to find out how to get discovered on youtube you got to make bangers when we looked at alicia he dropped a banger on the 21st 21 day breakfast those types of titles are bangers if you can nail that video another one that's a banger was his how to monetize youtube channels in 2020 that's a banger title that'll work and it did and he got 12 000 views then he had one on birthday quarantine and that one did nothing because it's not a banger nobody's talking about that so until he has a huge subscriber base they're never gonna find out about that birthday quarantine video see what i'm saying so bangers is how you get discovered then all your other content is watched by people that you know discover you okay cool so that's why you guys gotta so number one thing is i would take something like this make a video on it um big titles whatever these big ones are schooly home conversion bus life touring lockdown what the hell these people do i would make a video similar to this all right let me go to your channel now all right schooly so now look at the comparison right schooly conversion part one and if you look here watch this before you start a bus conversion that's pretty cool one um seven regrets schooling home conversion so i would do something like this and i probably would not necessarily do part one also i think i wouldn't have this because nobody knows this or cares about this like for example if i'm about to watch this video i can understand everything and i even i can click on it if i'm about to watch your video i have no idea what i'm getting into because these are terms only you know and then this is something very specific to only you yeah i would actually recommend watching either the part 0 or part 7. i don't i think that this one's more of a time lapse of my trip to go get the bus cool i think what would be better is probably if you just made it all into one video okay um okay let's go to where part zero is hi my name is xavier king i'm 19 and i'm about to embark on a trip to buy i like that you're playing with storytelling i admire that that's really good putting emotional music playing with it in the start sometimes even when is caitlyn on here today caitlyn are you on no so even when caitlyn was on here yesterday right she tried a joke it didn't really work in the video that much but if she adds a little bit of music a little bit of this it will work so first it's important for her to take shots at it and then eventually she can actually make it work so same thing here i like that you're playing with storytelling there then there are times where you'll actually be really be able to make it hit home the bus i will be converting into a schoolie in fact there's a good chance this video will go live uh while i'm on my trip to el paso amazing look at the camera yeah okay having a little bit of an issue with that why is that uh i was recording it with my phone so i was trying to look at the screen and then the script that was right next to it and i never really looked at the camera that was right between them oh i see now how did i get to this point well first glance you'll see my dad gave me this idea back in february uh damn when i was looking for something to do most fun class i stuff we made association of turners a woodturning use autodesk january so i'm liking i'm liking your broll i'm liking all of that i think a few important things one look at the camera to mike i cannot emphasize mike enough mic is so important the same video will actually feel a lot better with the mic three you are reading too much off of a script to the point where it's making you a robot so i cannot connect with you as a human being if you read too much off of a script i want you to also speak to me a little bit okay that's a that's a important uh thing other than that i think for this is for everybody you all need to like actually pick banger titles and then like go all in on those videos those are how your channel is going to really really grow for clever programmer for my clever programmer channel i know my banger titles like the top five programming languages to learn um you know another one is like how to become a programmer in three months what are some other ones frankie that are like that always bang top four dying programming languages the crash courses that we put up they're always like they banged so so like there's a list of them and for you in your schooly you need to go and look at the schooly [ __ ] that's banging you can if you just keep getting unique with your um content and you don't actually look at what works you're never going to get found bro it's very unfortunate you're going to be 300 videos in with zero subscribers i've seen it happen to people they [ __ ] make 300 videos nothing ever gets found nobody ever knows them and it sucks so i want you to look at the top content then i want you to model the [ __ ] out of it model for you especially because you got a long way to go model it really closely that's how you're going to get really good you're going to pick up so much by emulating them yeah i was actually modeling when you search up schooly build because there's a lot of people who post the same type of things where they're doing the full build process and different stuff uh schooly build yeah um so which one is it where any of the different playlists there they go through all the different videos so okay so i'll click this one right here is that fine yeah yeah that looks like it's before but i was planning on doing some of those down too so like what's cool about this is they're telling me what is going to be happening when and what times yeah right so like you can do that if you added all that in your video and then you could give me that and then it would make it a banger video yes it would make it a banker video [ __ ] my life all right up into hers or your own thing you need to maximize your space inside of a butt has some little clothes storage this is where so surprisingly we actually live again and so we're just really looking forward to going west and seeing everything that it has to offer we love the snowboarding dope so this is a good video and he's showing us like what's happening throughout it all of it is packed in one video rather than part one two three four parts don't work that well on youtube people want that one video to just be selfcontained that's why when we would do these like eight hour live streams we wouldn't break it up into part one part two part three part four building facebook we would just have one video and you would just build facebook in there so i would recommend going that route okay all right we're gonna move on to the next one just because i wanna give more time to people yeah um awesome love it cool quasi harman says how did you set up your mic my current setup is yeti voice meter rtx voice okay cool yeah if you got that i think you should be good my just mine is uh i have a shure sm7b connected to a road caster pro and that's kind of it on my setup mark cinematic says i want a constructive rose please do i need to appear more human okay let's take a look yes that's a that's i didn't realize how inhuman i appeared until today yes it i mean it's one of it seems like one of those channels that you know have uh like like i know what these types of channels are like right like i'll go here and i'll click like i'll do trap instrumental uh stuff like that and i'll click it and then i'll go and watch and i'll watch some of these you know this one i like with the rick and morty one that's pretty sick oh my [ __ ] god all right all right all good just [ __ ] ads man god they just give me anxiety i would say bro for you let me let me hear this um i'm actually moving away from trap i didn't delete that video based off of yesterday you said don't delete anything so okay same okay cool don't delete anything yeah i love trap oh [ __ ] that's pretty cool that's sick i love that um okay so i think for these types of channels to really explode one of the hacks that i've seen is if you had a live stream that's just going permanently i've seen a lot of channels do that and they do really well with it that's one you know a service that offers that or would that be something i set up i have no idea about that i've never really looked into it uh you could you could call restream.io something like that no no no i mean that's not going to allow you to like he's looking to stream forever permanently like so yeah like lofi hiphop radio yeah re restream is just to be able to stream to multiple platforms so that's all that's all that is with restream you would literally i think need to dedicate one computer or one laptop to just streaming permanently okay um so you can have it like a cheaper computer that just permanently does that forever that could be what's up i'm sorry for interrupting but um with this infinite stream thing would that be like something i'd want to include other artists in to kind of grow my brand or would it be something i keep completely exclusive to myself um be careful be careful with copyrights that's a that's a big yeah so massive strikes on that right if you had your own music that you were streaming or things that are like copyright free you could stream that forever that could be one way to do it i mean honestly i would recommend you make videos with your face in it that are teaching people how to make beats how to make traps i think the problem with this stuff is there's no brand so like it's just music i i mean i can go to any channel and listen to music and so right that's your big problem then you just become a commodity like so that's why i would break that by offering more of a service i mean first of all you need to make youtube content where you're teaching you're giving valuable advice maybe you're teaching people how to make trap or you're teaching people how to make whatever this music is do you think an entertainment approach would work too like let's say i want to teach somebody how to make dubstep yes if you could if yes if you make that would be sick if you teach people how to make dubstep and then the video starts with you playing dumps dubstep i think that would be sick what is that guy's name andrew i'm just gonna type in andrew music i forget his name there we go andrew huang yeah he's all about music right but his videos are so freaking entertaining to watch like whatever he makes it on with att like this as you can see for each family member like hbo max all right boom there we go that's a great intro hey it's andrew huang and in today's video we're going to talk about what i think is the most powerful and most versatile soft synth ever faze plant from killerhearts full disclosure i am working with killerhearts i put out a preset pack with them and they also wanted to sponsor a video on my channel as you want pretty much as many as your cpu can handle just do a random variation of the parameter assignment all the possible places project tempo and the other two types of this yeah like if you're good at what you do and you want to go technical and you just want to go all in yeah like you're you'll crush but this is a good way to do it show what you're about to do it's entertaining and you can give value how do you feel about like trolling videos though like i want to pour mountain dew in old instruments and say that's how dubstep's made you know you could do that so like a lot he does that a lot where he uses like random sounds to make dub steps and music and stuff like that from it sweet make them entertaining like the best metric i can give you guys if you want to know if your video is entertaining or not so like for example let's say you picked out a banger title you already know what's going to be a good title video then the next step is sit there have your friends come in and see if you can watch it with them if you're sitting in that video and you want to just [ __ ] they want to shoot themselves like tell them be brutally honest like leave or stop it as soon as you're bored you're going to realize you're not even sitting through your video you know that's the that's the main thing so like if you can sit through your own video and watch it then that's a great video okay but you gotta enjoy it dope um okay cool so did that help mark yeah it really is tough just working with only music i need to grow out of that man yeah yeah and then yeah just add valuable advice to it and you'll be good you gotta add your face in it thank you my friend cesari asks uh tubebuddy or vid iq i do both vid iq until you need to buddy that's what i would say vidiq until you need tubebuddy vid iq is a great thing to use it's free to use with youtube it helps you with your seo and um other stuff i have tubebuddy to do advanced stuff like doing a b testing on my thumbnails so that's that gets more advanced but it's one day it's one thumbnail then the other is another thumbnail and then it picks whichever one the winner is and it makes that the thumbnail permanently what okay cool canva yes okay joey joe are you here i don't know if joey's here or not so i'm going to just skip past it again cool joy keeps posting but joey's not here oh he can't use the mic all right joey well let's take a look at this we won't have a lot of back and forth conversation but i guess i would say the same thing bro like maybe make some music where it's not just music add same thing i'm gonna end this very quickly because it's the same type of oh [ __ ] i didn't share my screen with you guys so here i would say the same thing is happening with joey uh that we had with mark you guys need to add your faces into it and you guys need to add your personalities into it and give valuable tips while entertaining so maybe entertaining the start and then give value on how you made that music or how you made that beat there's a big market for that okay dope awesome uh who else do we got uhhuh perfect oh i'm like really far adam says over nine years ago i did over 70 videos teaching english to native japanese speakers this is the last video i ever did for that channel can you give me a light roast please mostly focus on setup and presentation okay hey minazon how are you doing today holy [ __ ] mochironi genki da yo dude that's kind of cool yeah man good energy adam so happy bro hey that was nine years ago a different time and place [Laughter] yeah and like i said this was 70 videos in more than that i don't even know how many i did but um i i really appreciate everything you've been uh uh doing over these past four days because i think the reason that this particular channel never took off was that i didn't try to model anybody so i think all of my titles sucked um you know my thumbnails probably sucked but i think probably like you said my energy is okay i think my presentation is good so that's why i'm asking more to focus on that yep okay so uh important thing like the video qual i want the video quality not to look like wooden potato so that's important that's one thing i would try to improve because it's really hard to actually even like for example i can't even make this out at all what is there not that i even need to look there uh the text is extremely pixelated so it um it makes me not want to be in it and watch it your energy is the saving grace and i bet your content is good too so yeah i was a linguistic student at the time it was a lot more conversational in japanese i think it was pretty decent behind the teeth there let me see if i can nice zoom in a little bit more great energy dude like really light energy really like calm positive flows so i think that part is really good i think your speaking skills are really great too the biggest frustrations here just lack of pure quality outside of of course thumbnails and titles you can improve just the quality so the video at least should be 720p if not 1080p this video is 240p i have trouble visually seeing what's happening and i am it's really frustrating to hear what's happening if the audio quality could be better and the video quality would be better then this i think you have a lot of potential yeah like i said it was nine years ago there's i don't even know if they had 1080p back i know but even the last videos you sent me you're shooting in a vertical format on an iphone i don't know when you made those videos but they seem more recent yeah the past couple days right so i want you to use an actual camera or actual webcam because your videos i want them to be not vertical i want your videos to be 16 by nine so that's a good place to start because again you have good energy you have good thoughts i literally think if you just put a camera proper camera or even a webcam and good audio you can actually have like a good channel but if you don't 16x9 yeah just like a regular camera yeah 16x9 yeah um so all right dope that that that's all other than that adam like keep going keep making content just put it right there and you'll be good to go okay thank you i appreciate it yup you got it hi jen oh my god how are you doing it's good been busy this week wow you you look amazing your face is glowing you look happy you feel it feels like you're well rested um somewhat [Laughter] lack of sleep a mom of three teenage daughters can be rested i'm rested i think wow yeah that's amazing so i'm so glad to have you on here uh what are you currently are you trying to grow your own youtube channel what's going on i am starting a brand new one i have never had a youtube channel before nice to meet you at work all week i've been watching all the videos all day and catching up so beautiful here i am beautiful awesome well welcome to the channel uh welcome to creating your own channel and being on this journey i'm excited for you is there anything specifically that you have in mind i am probably gonna take what i've been doing um with the success coach live calls and turn it into smaller video snippets got it okay with my with my friends oh wow i love it i angry unicorn friends holy [ __ ] gets really angry amazing i'm really excited about that i think that's going to be awesome jen so that's cool that's a great way to go about it too because it's the easiest way to make content is just your conversations with other people that's a really good hack for making content just having conversations recording them like i believe exact for example even this gives me an idea about adam is how you're making your content jen i think if adam literally had zoom calls with somebody and he recorded them i think and that's great start for making content yeah it's a it's a really great way to get comfortable on camera is just talking to people like the last few months i spent tutoring and talking to people on zoom i've changed how i speak on cameras yes immensely i feel like you're so much more confident in speaking in your energy yeah that's amazing sorry i have really loud dogs and they keep barking that's okay that's okay yeah she um jen is one of the students in our profit with javascript course in clever programmer and she went in there and became a success coach and so she started doing a lot of like calls with people coaching calls oneonone calls and just by the repetition and practice of that like i me even knowing her i've seen her come a long way and i can see her confidence now you're happy being on camera in front of people big difference so congratulations i mean my first my first video i think ever was sent to you yes when i applied to be a success coach so wow amazing come amazing you've seen the full transformation i love it that is so amazing guys give it up for jen that's amazing all right we're gonna take on a few more channels and then go um go with them okay so let me see if you guys have dropped a channel that you guys want me to go through recipe says this was just for tasting purpose so i want medium roast i want to create a channel on coding so let's take a look at it i will share the screen um okay i would amazing fishing okay this is just like a test or something i guess of yours nice good intro um dude this channel is actually going to be good if you keep going music is too loud here so i would reduce it like when you're when you guys are speaking don't put the music so loud that's competing with your voice this is a good video like this is actually like one of those videos that like yeah so i would make more content this is good content the biggest thing is there's only one so i would make a lot more content and i would keep going i wouldn't like stop okay you're making good content you already i know you already watch a lot of vloggers you already got that vlogging style you got the music going you got the whole thing going received so that's what i would say to you make more and just keep going okay so awesome do you think it's still possible to use a funny video model to succeed on youtube yeah you can make funny videos that are like awesome and they work cool okay awesome yazid says dark roast videos 4k but need some time to process so maybe it's up now 23.5 million is the number of developers this year so why not be the next one in this video we will learn about the top five languages you can learn in 2021 anyway good intro very good intro 23.5 million is the number of developers this year nice so why not be the next one in this video you will learn about the top five languages you can learn in 2021 um audio is not coming from this mic so make sure the audio is coming from that mic right there um because your audio i think is coming from something else so that's what's weakening the punch punchiness of it the best language to learn in programming is not the best question to ask it depends like for every task for everything it offers value and class and those are frameworks for libraries that help you are for instant language obviously so the most important language the number one language you said it right in the start right you said your number one language is python right yeah that you can consider okay cool yeah right so i would do a few things one make sure i can see the python the text is too much at the bottom left i can barely see it so i would put the python logo or text up here and make sure you use logos because logos are very recognizable they're nice images so that i would use the other thing i would recommend is i wouldn't say the number one as the first one i would put it all the way at the end right if you're if you watch like the oscar awards you know they don't just tell you the best award as the first thing right they're not like and the oscar goes like the they don't just open it they're like the oscar goes too right they keep building up and building up and building up and marinating and marinating and marinating the finally what you're just like i want it please somebody tell me i need to know now so you're going crazy and then they're like right after this commercial break and you're like [ __ ] that's what you want to do with the video like this okay where it the numbers go backwards on this if it's top five number five goes first then number four then number three then number two so like it makes people wanna watch all the way till the number one make sense yeah make sense good job on popping these up those are for the data science developers although python has been for a while now but it makes so much sense to learn in 2021 it's a very good language infrastructure so yes great video improve the audio quality and i think you'll be golden uh in the back instead of having this stuff open random stuff i would put code just have some random code open so you look like you code um mic make sure the sound is coming from here and then you're just it's money and then just keep going and then whenever you can afford it invest in a good camera okay sure okay all right it's uh it's 4k but the only problem youtube has some problem with that it takes some time it's not only 360p oh i see yeah okay okay but one thing i want you to see at the end of the video there's a that's a good thing okay okay got it it's something i tried this time nice dope i liked um i would again the music gets loud yeah it's at the end i know i know but you're still speaking so it can be there but your voice needs to be clear over the like right now you're telling me to like and subscribe which is an important thing to say in your videos oh yeah but i cannot hear you right now the music needs to start going up and now it just goes maximum up okay so like how it works is right now it's a little lower it should be a little lower lower and then up all the way up here and then you leave them with that energy see what i'm saying yeah thanks so the endings just make them um let me see if we can do this give me one second here so all right so let's go here zoom so for example this is how i end mine right so it's like for example whatever video of mine you'll watch hi my name is ronald so let's take a look at like this one for example right how to get your first one i um bought a mac mini reynolds hold up one second random one second one second one second product this thumbnail actually looks fantastic so i'm just gonna show you on the outro how i key up the music so you'll see when i'm talking it's going to keep me talking and then the music is going to come in okay is it so watch this this is raphael quasi i love your beautiful face and i will see you in the next video and the reason for the music sound increasing so much and that like it hits hard and it doesn't stop me from what i'm saying okay so so raise it at the end you can model my videos you can take a look at like when i'll add in the music and like raise it up okay other than that great video great job thank you so much okay um dope let's take a look at the tool i used to draw on the screen is called screen brush uh that's the tool that's the tool uh yeah it's it's the best tool and pay for it because once you pay it allows you to do a lot of other like things stay on the screen the whole time and yeah it's totally worth it what's the id for that outro now that's a banger uh id for the outro what does that mean mark what do you mean what's id for that out like mark hello i can't hear you oh you wanted to know the name of the song or whatever okay okay got it so yeah the the name i i don't know what the name of that song is i forget but yeah we got it from epidemic sounds i should have it in my final cut pro so it should be in there maybe i can find it if you give me a second boom boom boom boom um so and then you know once you learn the skill you can do a lot with it right so like now we're starting to run ads you guys have seen my like youtube ads right you guys um seen that you guys saw the video that we made that's like right so all that stuff i'm it's happening right over here let me get rid of yoink so you want to start or grow your business with youtube i'm doing a five day youtube channel how many of you guys have seen this video every almost everybody i think should have seen this video just raise your hands or say yes if you have all right jen has cool so this is the video that was added in final cut pro this is where i edit all my like almost everything all of my secrets of how i went from zero to 831 000 subscribers on my clip so yeah you guys can you guys can really use whatever platform you guys want to edit i love editing on uh final cut my for my personal favorite platform to use and then i think the music that you're looking for let me see if i can find it uhhuh all right let's go here zoom and share my screen all right boom so now i'll be able to share with you guys what that one is so this one is called meg i think it's called magnetic eye yes hi you got it right thank you very much yeah that's that's the one it's a magnetic ion i think it's really worth guys learning how to edit your videos because you can tell stories there's something beautiful about being able to like tell your story the way that you want to tell it uh it makes everything hit home and makes it like you can have people go through an emotional journey you can make people feel sad you can share how happy you were and i think if you spend time learning how to edit i think it'll be like one of the most worth it skills that you actually learn and um let me see if any of these are the ones that have that intro oh yeah there's some some of these like really crazy but yeah like if you can make the intro something that's really exciting to watch and it hooks you then it makes people stay the entire time to watch the rest of your videos so definitely a skill that's very very worth learning and very very worth spending time on um you know this is why those videos are doing well like even when we saw alicia's video there's a reason why i was sitting at like 12 000 views or 600 000 views the the editing helps you can shoot just videos where you're just talking to the camera and that's good too but if you can edit and tell your story a certain way it just makes your video so damn good and rewatchable you know and again my test is can you bring your friends like can rocio can she bring her friends and can they watch the video if they can't sit through and watch the video it's not a good video so then you can edit it more and make it better if you want um can we do i knew that was your brotherinlaw i see his ads all the time oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's my brother yeah that's the one who i got him started on the youtube channel and everything but yeah now you guys will see his ads probably everywhere can we do a live video editing basics oh that could be cool i don't know if you guys would be into that but we could actually even maybe edit a video live uh yes no give me a thumbs up give me a thumbs down whatever it is that you if enough people want it you guys are excited about it probably could do it at some point okay a lot of you guys are saying yes i love it okay awesome so yeah we can do a live master class where i edit with you guys together and we can take a video and then edit it dope because i think there's a there's a lot of videos on youtube that show you the process but i think it's like you kind of take it to the next level how do you make it into like a banger i think that's what people were kind of talking about like yeah you know someone just walking slowly through you know final cut that's cool but how do you make into like something really good yes okay dope yeah that's uh you're right a lot of people don't actually show that you know and that's one of those things that's super [ __ ] important like even this one right this video the title is a banger title because i know how to get your first 1000 subscribers those that those that video will crush if it's good if i know that if i make this one video and it's good for my rafikaze channel three to six months from now this one video is gonna have me get 40 000 subscribers i'm not kidding just one video so if i can take this one video and spend a lot of time and energy behind it it's really really worth doing that really really worth doing that like for example i'll even show you like if i go to do we have our analytics open anywhere all right let me go to the youtube studio and let me show you guys something right let's go to some of the most popular videos so let's go here and then let's go filter by top five and see if it comes up it's right there cool so i want you to notice the this one yeah so there we go this one video let's go to its analytics guys look at this youtube paid me thousand dollars just to make this video this is just youtube paying me so think about that would you guys like for youtube to pay you 8198.48 49 cents for one youtube video yes or no right this is i'm not even talking about the fact that it got 103 000 subscribers probably it got me 30 000 people on the email list and when i asked to sell the product this video alone probably led to over 100 to 200 000 in cash this year would you guys be interested in knowing how one video can have you make either between eight thousand to a hundred thousand dollars is it a worth its skill to learn is it a worth its skill to spend your time energy and attention on oh yeah yeah no no yeah and if you if your cpm was higher you would be freaking oh billionaire oh my god yeah yeah yeah like you know if i was like oh you know i need to do this the problem is if i only did it for the money i wouldn't probably do it for long enough because i would my my love for it would run out but if i was one of those people who like enjoyed finance and i love teaching and if i taught finance holy [ __ ] it would be like the same exact video would be at 275 000 right now like literally this exact video because yeah yeah the video on my channel would like you know it's like i'm at half that revenue but i have like not even half that many views but i think it's in the health niche so it pays higher bro how much did that video how much did how much did you make off that video that you had 666 000 views it's like it's like 4 000 yeah you gotta [ __ ] go bro like you can make one video literally bro you can make how much are you making right now per month bro how much are you making right now i'm i'm barely scratching 100 now because that video started going down but i'm right at like a hundred no no no no i mean how much are you making your job right now per month oh oh making good money six figures okay cool so how like think about this if you could make one or two of those videos per month you would be making close to that same six figure income just from youtube ad revenue which is like i don't even look at youtube ad revenue it's like two it's usually i'm like i think of it as like nothing so i i mean i believe in your [ __ ] bro especially if you did something and it worked you gotta [ __ ] do more of that bro because just a few of those types of videos will just keep exploding you but so this is what i'm saying like the skill of making the videos is so worth it and it's so valuable youtube pays you and if you want to sell a course or build a brand you could do it you guys with me so far on this yes or no guys i i would love to appreciate a little bit higher energy okay i know we're all tired it's three hours or whatever we're in it's a [ __ ] saturday but we're a bunch of lunatics on this goddamn call right that's why we're here so let's [ __ ] go guys i'm going to ask you guys again do you guys want to learn this [ __ ] yes or no that's what i'm talking about guys that's the [ __ ] energy i want that smile i want that energy let's go hey let's go it gives me energy and i mean nobody's talking about youtube with this much energy out there so this is what's so freaking exciting and honestly what inspires me a lot is if we started our youtube channels and we're growing it together then the impact we're making together on the world is just absolutely insane and uh i just saw frank doing this but if you guys want to take a story at any point and tag at raf rafi.causeyrfeh.qazi that would be amazing i reply to every single person and i will repost all of your stories okay so this is one freaking video one video worth eight thousand one hundred and ninety eight dollars this is just one of them if i go back to the channel videos let's take a look at this other one this other one is worth how much let's take a look 12 dollars let's go lifetime this one is also worth 8 654. and got me 55 000 subscribers so think about this you guys two videos got me how many subscribers two videos how many 155 150 god damn 5 000 subscribers two videos two videos like if you can put your heart and soul and effort into it and you learn it two videos can get you that right and here's just on one more video and that's that eight thousand six hundred fifty four dollars so if you take those two videos it's sixteen thousand dollars that youtube paid me we got 155 000 subscribers we probably got 40 to 50 000 people on the email list and then when we were like hey we have these courses are you guys interested a whole bunch took us up on it and it provided them value and it exploded our business does that make sense guys yeah yeah yeah so this is the name of the game this is why i think this is so important to kind of understand why this [ __ ] is important and uh if i go share my screen again with you guys when i saw that i can make a video on how to get your first 1000 subscribers i wanted to make sure that i make that video bang so like it's gonna be actually good so the few important things i want to show you here that i'm doing is first of all i want to get to the point in the first one to three seconds that fast right when we saw alecio's video he got to the point really fast i'm going to get to the point really fast few other things i want to do i want to have framing that's hyper hyper relevant hyper relevant framing before i even say a word you already [ __ ] know this [ __ ] knows some [ __ ] right so you're gonna watch the sec second you know you're gonna watch like two seconds in and four seconds and seven seconds in so that's the hack this is why i even told a yazid put coding screen behind you makes like subconsciously it makes people stop so the framing is like perfect in that sense where there's a timeline you know that this guy's gonna talk about like this is not gonna be just some boring video where this dude is just gonna talk to me for 10 minutes about how to get your first down subscribers you're like i see a camera i see a tv with the timeline i see another computer i see this crazy thing okay something is about to happen what's about to happen and let's go how to get your first 1000 subscribers right i have a text come in with the key things that you're looking for how to get your first 1000 subscribers and the first two seconds with key framing so you if you're coming here to watch this video would you be hooked yes or no yes right you're gonna be hooked you're like okay cool let's talk about it guys so that is just to kind of get you into the video like now i've told you what's going to happen now i give you a little time lapse of me editing whatever you're like oh this [ __ ] is cool and then right before we start the video i give you now this is where i'm gonna build authority okay so this is where i'm gonna tell you why you should probably pay attention to what i have to say because you came in you've given me some of your time i want to be respectful of that and now i want to tell you like yo before you give me 16 more minutes i want to share with you what i have done so then i can respect more of your time you guys see what i'm saying my own youtube channel to over 830 000 subscribers called clever programmer and multiple videos with over millions of views and i cannot wait to share the secrets and insights with you guys that i've learned from growing my own coding youtube channel oh and by the right and then right before it starts this is a hack for you alicia i don't know if you do this but make sure at the right time get them to hit the like button the way right before we start if you could smash that like button that would mean the world to me good morning you guys today i'm starting right and then it just gets started um and then it gets going and then i take so i know this is going to be a banker title i want to make this now the best video ever because i know it's just going to be so freaking worth my time energy and effort just like for example you know i keep coming back to you alicia but even that youtube how to make uh how to monetize your youtube channel fast right that video you you know that's a banger title so when you actually put your energy into it it's totally worth it same thing with that 21 day thing that you did yeah i literally just like you said earlier i modeled videos that were already crushing it and said let me just do like an updated version of it that's the right way to do it bro it's the right way to do it um and then here i like was just learning so this is where i make it fun for me so then it doesn't just feel like a job so for me i like learning things i like uh getting inspired and i don't want to just do only the things i know so for example here i am now getting a lot more into sound design and i'm having fun with it so when i say sound design that's like adding audio that's like not supposed to be there that wasn't originally there you know so it's like the door opening or the cabinet opening so i have this little fun segment where i'm just taking a coffee break right and then i bring this coffee i sit down and i get back to the rest of the video so like for this video i am not worried about you know should i give this video my all or not like a video with the title like this i want to give it my all and go hard make sure that this video is good and then it's packed with value i'm giving you actually tangible advice you can use so this video is like phenomenal i think a lot of all of you guys should actually watch this on my youtube channel like mindset stuff is great there's this one part where my girlfriend is crying because her youtube channel isn't growing and i literally break down like look at this for the my first 10 months i [ __ ] got nothing like i made 41 in my first 10 months and almost no views and her channel is like doing nothing right here it was just getting one subscriber at a time so how do you actually deal with this type of stuff mentally and what do you need to prepare for so i try to pack that in in that video all those he's just shaking his head i like it oh my god that's so cute how many of them are there at least yo wow goodness too many man like one popped out i was like okay and two and three and then i think i lost count adorable oh wow adam everybody has kids popping out randomly just all happened at once i love it say hi hi let's see i'm not the only one here yeah yeah frankie pop out um hey uh yeah feel free to ignore this question if it's too off topic but i did want to know when you said that you quit like dropped everything your clients to go youtube fulltime did you save up like three to six months expenses or something or how did you get by in that um lean time when you had no income to the point where you were actually making some i um so what i because i was forced to make my youtube channel successful and make income from it i started coaching people oneonone the people that found me from youtube so like for example i was just like hey i'll charge you 35 an hour to teach you coding then i was like hey i'll charge you 50 an hour to teach you coding so i started making my living very quickly from my youtube channel so that's what i did adam until later i could figure out how to sell a course and stuff like that um oh wait i'm reading comments can you also do why don't you have merch i will have merch i already have a lot of like uh taglines that i want to have on my merch like for example in production we trust um another one would be like just one and then there are a few other ones that i would want to have in there so i would i would really love to have merch at some point cool i have no words when i see these stats yeah i mean they're really really like crazy like sometimes for me even for me they're hard to like believe like what is happening wow but you know it's just consistently putting that work over time believing in that thing and keep doing it and then those results just keep getting bigger and bigger every single time did you find that playing live shows helped grow your social yeah lives help grow my social media but most importantly lives make me come to life so for example this video isn't going to get that many views this video like right now the zoom call that we're on is not going to get any views i know that because the replay value of it is very little it's kind of like boring to watch a video of like other people on zoom so i understand that that's probably just gonna die at like two thousand views or one thousand views the reason for this is it feeds my soul to connect with everybody that's on this call ah it feeds my soul and i love it when i can actually speak to the people that are behind the camera you know that normally i just have to imagine all of you have to imagine a stacy and all you guys but it's so much it gives me life and heart and then this is the food for my soul and then it lets me go and then make more content for you guys and come up with ideas that are gonna actually help all of you because up until the zoom call i appreciate it kazi it's like you know coming from the pwj og crew yeah uh it's we we love having this oneonone i don't care if it dies on youtube right like yeah like be able to talk to everyone like all the brand new people learning how to grow youtube let's let's go hey that's beautiful bro thank you i appreciate it i appreciate that energy um yeah i love this man it's so it's really exciting and it um it doesn't become real for me until we can do this like until we can do this it's just the number now says 3.7 k members in the facebook group uh the number now says 195 comments you know so it's just like random numbers at best what i see even if i see comments just like avatar next to it but until i can start speaking with all of you guys and talking with all you guys that's when it becomes real and that's when it's really exciting for me personally uh rasib says could you please repeat from where you bring background music epidemic sounds robin says that is one reason why i clicked on your facebook ad for a five day clone class because you had super cool setup monitors desk equipment and lighting that's awesome robin talk to me about that hey hi no that's why i uh i don't even know why the facebook ad popped up in my feed i have no idea because i guess i've been um i had a project i had to do so i'd been googling a lot of different programming courses i had a program but not for many years and then one day that popped up and the only reason i clicked on it was because you had a setup like what i would want wow that's the only reason basically damn super cool wow so then i yeah so i joined the course and it's awesome that's amazing i love that because i i programmed like super long ago in the olden days and so i have no community whatsoever yeah because none of my friends are interested anymore they're all like doing other things so yeah awesome because this is what i want to do so now i have people to connect to great i love it and i'm going to ask you you said you want you're interested in programming so what like what made you join the youtube challenge and actually stay on this for the last few days uh well i have many ideas for youtube channels i did we did have a channel i've just built an online school and so we did have a channel but someone actually sort of they didn't steal it but they sort of hijacked it so i've stopped doing it and so now i want to get back on and i want to maybe do it for myself instead of doing it for a company so i'm just trying to get ideas and get inspiration and motivation i'm buying a mic i'm putting an order in tonight for mike yeah and um yeah damn okay that's amazing i'm excited for you and what uh are you getting a yeti or something different yeah i want to get a yeti okay cool i'm excited and you want to talk about coding on your channel no uh no i'm not an expert in coding got it um i used to be in c but that was ancient you know forever ago wow okay i have uh like someone's hired me or asked me to build and at some apps like in chinese medicine and doing um chinese medicine diagnosis and chinese astrology and doing health diagnosis from chinese astrology some like really sort of esoteric very super cool things that are very esoteric and i want to make it um uh like so so that anybody will be interested in it got it so take this esoteric language and make it attractive to people because it's super cool that no one knows about it yep so one thing i'll just share is if you're especially getting into territory where it's esoteric or there's very few of it happening uh the one thing i want you to also focus on and make sure see if you can find somebody you can model that is doing something similar somewhere and has success with it if you start off by modeling that that will give you a lot of room to grow really fast and then you can get really unique with it so that's one thing i would recommend because the one thing that scares me about like something that's very uh untested is you'll spend your time doing it but then nothing will come of it so i want you to get some results from it too because you're gonna spend time energy effort money right so i want you to go and model in areas where whatever maybe there's some other channel that's like teaching something esoteric or something like different model the way that they teach it in terms of like their titles and thumbnails and then content just make your you can make whatever content that speaks to you yeah cool okay thanks awesome thank you so much for coming on robin i appreciate you all right beautiful let's see do you guys have um so guys what i'm going to say is if there are any more youtube channels you guys want to drop we could do it but tomorrow we're going to be building your youtube blueprint okay we're going to be building and working on your roadmap so for today what i want to say to you guys is in terms of your guys's homework because every day i want to make sure there's some type of homework um again let me ask this again how many of you guys did you did the homework from yesterday where you made a video or worked on a video raise your hands raise your hands keep them raised keep them raised i see rocio did it aldo jen frank mark stacy miesha okay let's keep going and rediane okay beautiful awesome that's amazing thank you guys for the participation i love it let's do um what i'm gonna do is for the for the people who win the like in the five day challenge right we're gonna go through this and for people that i think have done the best and have grown the most within this time frame like even somebody the topnotch programming channel i forget who's it was redian i think and i even the improvement that he made was amazing so whoever wins guys i'm gonna actually give them i'm thinking to give them uh one live master class with me where i actually go through a full editing of full video okay so that's that's what i'm thinking about um also if you guys are participating don't think that you're too far off so even if you haven't maybe done some of the homeworks if you guys like participate and engage and actually are doing the things making the things it's possible for you to be able to get that okay so i just want to share that with you so if you're showing effort and you're actually putting in the work we can make that happen but i want to make that exclusive for a few people that are actually doing the [ __ ] work all right and i want to actually recognize the work cool awesome reynold i think you wanted to ask a question at some point and and it never happened you want to ask a question uh i didn't have a question right now but i appreciate everything you're doing this is incredibly awesome awesome thank you my man thank you i appreciate you being here awesome great all right guys well i hope that you guys had had a phenomenal session i hope that you guys freaking enjoyed this and got value out of it and you guys are inspired for tomorrow what i want you guys to do is i'm gonna i want you guys to start thinking about i want you guys to come in with a few things okay i want you guys to think about what your channel is going to be about and what product or service you actually want to sell so tonight i want your homework to be road mapping what your road to 1 million looks like okay again that's just a random number it could be wrote to your first 100 or 50 or a thousand dollars but i want you guys to actually write that down and plan that out okay so today that's what you're what you i want you guys to do for tonight write down what your path to that will look like so and you can actually i do have a question go for it who is that reynolds sorry it's ronald yeah go for it um so i had to like jump in and out of uh this like during the session so is there an easy way to find the link to the playback of this because it was kind of hard to find one location where you had uh so this is streaming to my clever programmer youtube channel that's one place you guys can find it it should also be streaming to the facebook group that you're in it'll also be there okay i'll check your channel because the facebook group had stuff scattered and it wasn't yeah i couldn't find yesterday's okay but i had i had save one and two got it so there is the channel and i linked it for you guys i mean not linked it but wrote the name so you can go there and it's in the most recent videos it's going to be on the channel and i know on facebook it gets scattered so hopefully we can get it there too so for homework guys plan out what that looks like so for example write down what you're gonna make number one what are you gonna make your content on what is your niche all right that's your thing number one so i'm gonna start writing this out so you guys can write this down with me and complete this so here we go all right day four homework okay and this is what this is gonna be step one write down your youtube channel niche all right what are you going to be making content on what are you going to be bringing value to people in so for example for me a lot of my content is going to be about people growing their youtube so how to get your first 1000 subscribers how to get 10 000 subscribers how much did youtube pay me to make a million dollars that stuff okay so have that what do you want to help people with you want to help them with coding do you want to help them in personal development you want to help them with music that's number one thing number two i want you guys to write down tonight in your homework is what are you gonna sell all right what is it that you're gonna sell is it gonna be a product is it gonna be a service um are you gonna sell your skill of coding you know like what is it that you're gonna sell for me it was a course that i decided to sell some people want to sell a coaching program some people want to you know please don't sell tshirts especially in the start it's the hardest way to make money um you can do that later when you're grown as a brand so i recommend the cheapest stuff go to that years later when you're bigger i recommend the start more expensive because you're only one person so then you can actually give more value and get also more income and then later when you can fulfill for mass volumes of people then offer cheaper stuff okay so figure out what your product or service or thing to sell is gonna be is the homework assignment clear for you guys is it clear yes or no yes frank says yes robin says yes yes okay great so when you guys come in tomorrow the first things i want to see in the chat is what your guys's niche is gonna be and what you're guys gonna be thinking about selling got it cool and then tomorrow guys we're gonna be talking about day five and then day five we're really just gonna get into it day five like if you guys enjoy day one day two day three and day four day five just will get a million times better because on day five this is now time where we're gonna start planning and mapping out your youtube content okay this is where we're gonna get specific with it we're gonna create a full blueprint and if you do this blueprint the right way you can have content ideas between three months to 12 months worth of content ideas okay so would you guys be excited if you came in tomorrow and left with a full on yearlong plus blueprint to your youtube channel yes let's go hey beautiful nice it's exciting i love it guys i again thank you so much for being here i know we've been going for so long i love it thank you guys for participating and giving that energy so that's
