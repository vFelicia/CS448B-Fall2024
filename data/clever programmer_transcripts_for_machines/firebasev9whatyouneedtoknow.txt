what's up youtube firebase version nine things you must know okay because if you don't know them you're gonna be in trouble you're probably thinking hey what's up with the stash cause why am i learning today from ron jeremy well that's not what i'm here to answer all right what i'm here to answer is how can i help you become a really awesome developer okay so a couple of things that i want to talk to you about okay so welcome welcome everybody who's live if you're not live i love you anyway smash that like button let's freaking get right into it okay so hopefully my face is gonna be in there we go okay now we got some action going on so i want to just give you a micro lesson it's not prepared this is completely live and we're just to play you know and go off the seat of our pants here so a couple of things i want to share with you right so if you were using react before i want to show you what's the difference between version 8 and version 9 of firebase so how you've been using firebase your whole life things have just changed permanently and you better start using this new way because it's going to make your app so much freaking better all right so if there's any time to learn it that time is now and that's what i'm here to share with you now there are a lot of nerdy reasons for why you should use firebase version nine like there's uh it's tree shakeable and your code is gonna be smaller and faster i wanna just show you all the stuff you need to know so here we go so remember we used to have our uh config files right so let's go to our config files and our config files you're used to seeing something like this right boom you have a firebase config now you can have initialize app at the top like this but this is the new way of doing it right before if you've ever seen our tutorials you might have seen us doing import firebase from firebase right and then we just export that export firebase um export default firebase right and then you would see us using that in firebase thing around everywhere in all of our other files right like for example we'd import it here and we'll be like cos db is equal to firebase.firestore right and we'd be using that thing everywhere we'd be using it for auth this is me showing you what it used to look like version eight okay it's me showing you version eight right now and you would import it right you would import it you would go import blah blah blah from firebase right and you would just keep calling it like this and that used to be like the way to do things and that was normal right and if you wanted to make a query you would do like db.collection get me all the games dot doc if you wanted to get a specific game or you would do something like where right or if you wanted to add a collection to the games you would do dot add or you would do dot update or dot set well this used to be the old way all right so this is the old way the new way we don't do that anymore all right that's the old way that way now unless you're using the old firebase you won't be able to do that way we want to move over to the new way okay so i want to show you what the new way looks like so it's pretty simple okay i'm just going to give you a fast run down here so in the new way what you want to do is instead of doing all of that what we want to do is we want to import okay and you can just get the specific things you're looking for so what we can actually do is we can just say hey get firestore from and now you can save from firebase firestore okay and i believe if you want to reduce your file size by like 80 and you don't need to use the on snapshot listener you know the on snapshot listener that makes your app live the whole time if you don't need that then i believe don't quote me on this look this up but i think you should be able to do something like slash light right and then that should give you a much more reduced file size okay i'm just gonna look that up just so i don't i don't screw you uh with you guys and give you some wrong information but let's just take a look at this import yes firebase firestore lite right and now reduce it but for those of you who need realtime apps like you're trying to build a realtime chat application or you're trying to build a realtime chess application which i'm working on right now then you don't want to use light all right you want to just do it like this but the so the nice thing about this new way of doing it is everything is a function the bad thing about it the new way is this tons of imports and exports now so for example if you want to be able to get a collection well you're going to have to import a collection at some point if you want to be able to um call your docs well you need to import get docs if you want to be able to read one specific doc you need to get doc if you want to be able to add a doc you need to get ad doc or set a doc set doc or update a doc you need to import update doc all right so your imports now look much bigger but again the benefit is the performance of your app is better because you're not using anything that you don't need now let me show you down here how your code will actually look right so if i go back to my app.js instead of using this objectoriented way of doing things what you will now instead do is you'll be able to do things like you'll be able to say set doc okay you'll be able to do set dock and you'll be able to call whatever ref you have right so for example i can actually say gamesref and i can say db.uh collection okay or what i can actually do is i can actually call the function collection right and now i can pass information over to that specific function so what does that look like well here's what it actually looks like right so let me show you so now i can take i can pass or i can even get like a specific doc okay so if i want to get a specific doc i pass it a database i pass it the collections i want to get it from and then i pass it the id of that specific document so let's just say id one two three okay this will get me now the specific uh the specific reference to one game that i want okay that's the new way of doing it now if i want to be able to get more information out of this right i can actually do game snap is equal to whatever game ref was right so let me actually show you here game snap okay and what i can do now is i can say await and i can say get doc and i can give it the game ref like this okay so this get dock the only again like i said the tricky thing is you could you want to import this get dock from your uh firebase okay that's the only thing that you want to do so what does that import look like it'll just look like this you'll import and you'll say get doc from your firebase file that you created okay just like that and now this will get you the specific doc now if you want to get the data that's really really simple at this point right so for example let's go here if i want to get the data i can actually just do this right game is gamesnap.data and this will return to me actually an array okay this will actually give me back something that is usable that i can actually do things with all right let me see if you guys got comments coming in uh yes sir kazi with that new look that's right welcome yeah nice nice having you guys on here by the way on the live so just remember everything now is a function so whatever things you want to do they are a function i want to show you another function that's also useful for you like if what if you want to update a document right so what you want to do for that is you want to do set dock you want to give it the reference of the game that you want to pass it okay then you can update your fields in the game so it's like game field one value one whatever right this is what you're just passing it and now you can pass whether you want merge to be true or false and this is how you would actually run that query okay and the last one i want to show you which is also really important is a lot of you guys want to use on snapshot listener so how you actually use the on snapshot listener with this is like this you'll call on snapshot then on snapshot now it's just a function you guys it's not like object oriented programming period period period you know none of that like chaining all the dots together it's not like that anymore on snapshot is just if uh it's just a function now okay so on snapshot might take a document or a collection for example that you want did you want to listen to and then it'll take a callback function all right so on snapshot is just that so how do we give it like a specific document right i can just do this i can do doc db right and then give like my id of one two three so this will give my on snapshot like a specific document to listen to right i can also just pass it that game ref that should be equivalent there's this game ref right here and then the callback function is like what do you now want to do with this information right so for example now what i can do is now i can actually call other things so i can do things like um this is a code this is some of the code that i already have written but um i'll try to like simplify it for you guys here right so now i'm getting the doc right and then i'm just reading from that from that doc that's it doc.data.data so this is how your new on snapshot listener would actually look we got people saying this is nice we got finn techery saying wow a lot of changes tree shaking uh yeah so the tree shaking is a real thing it makes your app a lot faster right i think god damn runs fast and this is a much more functional programming approach in the start if you've been using firebase the old way it will feel slightly weird but in the long run i feel i feel honestly more at home with this kind of already because those long weird chains they were always annoying to look at right like db.collections.where.something.something.then snapshot.com this looks a lot more normal readable also i like that on snapshot is just a function right yet doc is just a function um all of these are like functions but just one thing right is like now you have you do have to do set dock right and every function that i'm using here on snapshot right and if i go back to my firebase i now have to export all of these so that's something you do have to remember so like i have to do export i'm not going to do firebase but like set dock export update dock export collection get firestore add dock so a bunch of imports bunch of named exports then bunch of name imports in the files that you want to use it so yes i get that that is a little bit annoying but um but yeah like something you kind of got to get used to because i want you guys to be able to move on and start using version 9 of the firebase and not be stuck using version uh eight or seven because at some point it's gonna start to get deprecated you're gonna need to move on anyway and you're gonna regret that you didn't learn it now um you know or back then and you'll have to learn it at a much later point so i'd rather you have a competitive edge i'd rather you be ahead of the field and even if it seems a little intimidating or a little confusing right now i wanted to show this to you so that you could get ahead that you could actually get a head start and you could be ahead of where maybe some of your peers are so hopefully i thought you i hope you thought this was entertaining valuable tiny micro lesson decided to just do it live and uh just let me know did you enjoy this did you not enjoy this in either case hopefully you smash that like button and uh subscribe to the channel i love your beautiful face this is ron jeremy i mean rafikaze i'll see you in the next video
