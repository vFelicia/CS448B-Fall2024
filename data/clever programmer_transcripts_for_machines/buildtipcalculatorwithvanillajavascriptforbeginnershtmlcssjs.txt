ladies and gentlemen have you ever been at a restaurant with a bunch of your friends and then the waiter brings a check at the end of your nice juicy meal and then you're just sitting there looking at each other trying to figure out and pulling your hair out how to calculate how much everybody owes and how much the tip is well that's the problem that we're going to be solving today we're going to be building a tip calculator that not only shows you the tip and how much you owe but also calculates the tip and how much everybody owes so once and for all you can solve this problem we're gonna be doing this with javascript vanilla javascript actually that's gonna be our weapon of choice smash that like button so this video goes at as many people as possible and as always here's a picture of a baby panda and let's get into it for those of you who don't know me i am rafae kazi i'm the ceo and founder of clever programmer and i just like to go by kazi now if you want to build this along with me you're going to have to fork this because the styling of this app is already completed we're gonna be working on the javascript functionality so make sure to go below at this link or just click the link in the description below uh it's gonna be a replit link and simply go ahead and hit fork all right once you hit fork on that what that will do is allow you to code in that couple by yourself okay and um what you could do then is just code along and finish the javascript portion so the files that you're going to get are going to already have the html and css completed you're going to only need to write the vanilla javascript to make the entire functionality of this app work all right with that said let's go ahead and i hope you've already forked this because if you're not i don't know how you're gonna build along with me but go ahead and fork it and let's build this app together here's what we're gonna do now we're gonna step it up we're gonna go and start building a tip calculator app so check it out i'm going to go over here and we're going to do the following i'm going to open this up so hit that button right behind my face the top right and it's going to open up this um this right here and we're going to go over to tip calculator and hit click on it okay and here if you type in let's say the bill total is 100 the tip amount is 10 and you can see it already calculated it correctly right because if the bill is a hundred dollars and the tip is ten percent well that's the tip would be ten dollars so the total would be a hundred and ten dollars per person but what if we had more people what if we had two people so watch what happens when i hit plus boom the bill just got divided between two people and so it automatically tells hey john you need to pay 55 kazi you need to pay 55 so both people know exactly how much they need to pay what if i keep increasing this number well you see it keeps dividing between all of those people so if the bill was 110 and you divide that by 10 people you get 11 dollars per person now watch what happens if i keep subtracting it's subtracting and subtracting subtracting it if i go here and now subtract it watch it's not going to let me go down to zero right i'll try a couple i'll try a couple more times boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom nope does not let me go below one so these are some of the functionalities of this app that you'll have to keep in mind so for example what will you need to know how to do well you'll actually need to be able to get the user input from this field right here okay and this field let's say it's called our this one over here let's just say it's called bill total input okay then you're going to have to get data from this tip as well and let's say this one is called tip input okay um also you're gonna be able to you're gonna need to be able to pull the number of people at any given time this one will probably be called let's say number of people okay so maybe these are all divs or inputs that you can have you know these are ids that you might be able to have access to okay and then this over here this right over here right this will be called per person total okay and all of these will be div ids okay which means these are special things inside of the html and you can get access to all of this so then if you want to get access to this hundred and ten dollars you'll be able to do something like per person total uh you know div dot inner text or whatever right and that'll get you access to what you're looking for and that's just to show you how the javascript portion will interface with this app okay and then based on that you're going to need to do things right so for example you're going to need to do some calculations that you know maybe take the bill plus the tip and then it divides that by the number of people and then when you do that you get this so there's going to be a bunch of things that you're going to need to understand but take a screenshot of this actually right now on your computer or with your phone because this will help you constantly refer to certain key elements on how this app is going to work so i'm going to now explain and kind of walk through this app and we're also going to have you set it up on a new repel so let's go ahead and do that now so this is going to be your tip calculator exercise so how you're going to get access to it so i'm going to zoom in here so you can see everything a lot more clearly okay and then we're going to kind of walk through every single thing so on the left hand side right you see projects make click into projects all right now when you click into projects you're going to see tip calculator so go ahead and click on tip calculator and now you're going to see exercise now don't go into the solution because once again if i show you how this works over here right let's run this and over here you'll see that we have project exercises project solutions so here's the tip calculator solution this will be the fully working app so you'll be able to type in 100 here and 10 and it'll calculate everything correctly you'll be able to hit plus minus minus minus so this right now is the working version okay so if you need to see the solution anytime don't go to it right now do not do it but this is where the solution will be and the main file that you need to write code for is the script.js file the javascript file the index.html and the style files are already completed for you so you don't need to touch them if you make the javascript work this entire app will work okay so that's where your solution is going to be but if you go to tip calculator from project exercises and you do 110 and see nothing happens you can't change the number of people it doesn't update your score there's no calculations being done here so the javascript here is not working okay so this is where your javascript is not working so this is your exercise file okay now what i recommend highly highly highly highly recommend you don't just start coding in this script.js what i recommend is you create a new rupple with these three files right and then get started okay so let's go ahead and do that now so i'm going to create a new tab here and we're going to go to replic.com all right now we're going to choose html css and javascript rupple and here i'm basically going to say let's go and say tip calculator exercise and i will hit create rupple okay now that this rebel is created what i recommend you do is go back go to your index copy all of this so command a command c or control a control c okay cop select all right in here copy it go here and delete everything in this index.html and paste what you just copied okay so once you paste it you should see a ugly looking bill app okay now the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna grab the style file so let's go ahead and grab the style file copy it come back go to your style.css delete everything that's in here hit paste hit run and now the styling is complete so now our app is looking good okay so this is what style files stylesheet is for now the last thing we're actually going to do here is you see if you go to your script there it's empty so we're going to go ahead to our exercise copy the whole thing okay command a command c come over here paste it so now when you look here uh there isn't any real javascript code written up okay and what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna collapse all of these functions and now what we're going to do is we're actually just going to walk through walk through like all of the um all of the things that you need to know in the gotchas right and then you'll be able to just get started and code it up yourself okay but just let's walk through it together all right so you're gonna be building the tip calculator app now there are a couple of things that you're gonna need to know all right otherwise this prop this project is going to become way harder for you and i don't want that to happen okay so i want it to be something that you're able to kind of grasp so there are a couple of functions you're going to need to know their names all right and you have access to them so you have access to calculate bill increase people decrease people these are the functions you're going to create these are the only three functions you'll need and make sure to give them this exact name they're already made for you you cannot change their names if you change their name your app will break i'll explain why these functions are hard coded inside of our index.html okay so for example when you are typing over here typing over here every time you type on key up we're calling the calculate bill function so that function is running literally every single time you type here that's why that function is there you don't need to change that name the other function i told you about for example increase people and decrease people function those are also written here so for example you can see here increase there's a plus sign right there right and then there is a minus sign right there and then there is a number right over here every single time you click this plus button right over here every time you click this plus button this function increase people will run every time you click this minus button over here this function decrease people will run that's what's happening so that's why these functions have special names do not change them unless you change them here and then you're fine okay but i just don't want you to fall prey the next thing every time you clickety clack and type anything in here or here anything anything you type in here here you're gonna run this calculate bill function okay for your tip and your bill total okay so calculate bill and then you also have calculated bill twice you can see that so this calculate bill is for this one and this calculate bill here is for this one okay so every time you type in any of those fields calculate bill automatically fires and runs going um and then the other things you'll need to know are a couple of things like you know you have this bill input and you have a tip input right so you have ids like build total input and you have other ids like tip input so let's look for temp input you have tip input okay now because i'm nice all right not everybody's gonna be this nice but what i've done for you is i have put it all into the javascript file everything you need to know so you don't have to go to your index.html file pretty much at all okay you don't have to like go and look at anything because what i've done here for you is i've already just told you hey here are the three functions you need to know calculate bill increase people decrease people i'm already letting you know these functions are hard coded in the html so you cannot change their names and then i'm already letting you know these are all the div ids you're going to need access to so you're going to need access to build total input this is going to be this div or this input field so that's going to be that input field you're going to need tip input okay this is going to be the user input for tip you're going to need access to you're gonna need access to so let's just draw these again that's right there tip input is right there you're gonna need access to number of people which is right there this is a div okay so this is a div id so once you get the div you're gonna need to do dot inner text to get to get these okay and then you're gonna need access to so you're gonna either for this i think you might need to do dot value uh one of those dot value or dot inner text okay try both of them and it should work one of them should work and then you have per person total which is right there so those are the div ids you're going to need access to i'm already telling you their exact names so you don't have to look in your html file right over here on line 20 i'm telling you hey get global access to all of these inputs okay meaning just get access to all of these inputs right here before you start creating your functions because your functions are going to need access to them so you know if i were you i'd do something like const let's say bill total input div or something right and then or build total input and you can do something like document.getelementbyid and then pass in bill total input okay this is just an example of how you would get this specific one right over here all right so what i'd recommend is you grab not just this one but all of them so you have all four of these divs and have access to them that's what i would recommend you do here going underneath here i would i recommend that on line 24 line 25 get number of people from number of people div so once you get access to these four divs bill input tip input number of people div and per person total div you can use the number of people div and from there you can actually get access to the number of people by pulling the dot text okay and remember to type cast so anytime you get a thing so let's say thing input and then you either do value or dot inner text but both of them are going to return to you a string that's going to look like this and then you call the number function on it and then that will turn it into an actual 10 okay and then you'll be able to do math on that because remember if you take 10 string and you add another 10 string to this this is actually going to give you not 20 but 10 10 10 10 10 okay which is going to be silly so you want to do you want to do it the right way okay so make sure you type cast it use that number function okay so this is where you're going to set up all your globals and then you're going to be good to go now let's go into each of these functions at a high level so you're gonna create three functions here all right um and you're gonna define these three functions so calculate bill calculate bill will pretty much run all the time like you should calculate bill when a user types it here automatically you should calculate bill when the user updates the tip you should calculate bill when the user hits this plus sign you should calculate the bill when the user hits this minus sign and ultimately what calculate bill is doing is it's updating this number over here the total per person owed okay that's the ultimate job of calculate bill okay you can see it says calculate the total bill per person that's what it does and then if you go here there are ample ample ample amounts of tips for you on how to actually do this okay so i have tons of notes for you as you go and code this along so i hope you don't have too much problems there okay i i'll guide you through everything hey get the user input and convert it into a number so i'm reminding you to type cast here hey get the tip from user and convert it into a percentage hey get the total tip amount calculate the total amount and then update it on the dom and show it to the user right so updated on the dom means update this right here so calculate bill hopefully that kind of makes sense at high level increase people what this will do is splits the bill between more people all right so what should happen here well it walks you through it should increment the amount of people amount of i'll just say amount of people then you update the dom with the new number of people all right so what does that mean so you increment the amount of people and then once you increment it you make sure that you write that to the dom like you change this one to a two for example and this function runs increase people increase people function runs every time you hit this plus button so when you hit this plus button that function runs when you hit the minus button decrease people function runs okay hopefully those are kind of selfexplanatory uh but hopefully that makes sense and then at the end you want to calculate the bill based on the number of people so i'm already giving you a hint you're going to be reusing some of the functions you've created previously okay perfect so i'm going to close this go here decrease people it splits the bill between fewer people okay so there i'm gonna go over the similarities between increase and decrease people right if you look at this increment update the dom calculate the bill decrease people decrement amount of people update the dom with the new number of people and then calculate the bill based on the new number of people so they're pretty similar and how they work so once you figure out one of them the next one will be really easy the only difference between decreased people is you when you hit plus you can go as high as you want but when you hit minus you shouldn't be able to go below one because it wouldn't make sense right you have the bill but then how come it has zero people that owe it that doesn't make sense so it shouldn't have zero or you can't have negative people right so you can't decrease the number of people to zero or negative so here i recommend you write a guard clause i haven't shown you what a guard clause is but basically it's just an if here it's a fancy name for just an if statement and if statement is just something along the lines of this okay if something something is not true i'm just gonna write in english just return and what that basically means is this will end the function so if you say return it just won't activate any lines that are below it so let's say you were going to decrement the number decrement the number of people here but here you check for the condition is people equal to one one or less oh hey is people less than or equal to one if people is less than or equal to one then don't run any of these lines of code right like just stop the return here just like hey stop the function end it right here okay and and you're not even giving it anything to return just return stop right here so that's an example of how that would work okay so i'm gonna get rid of all of that now so that would be our decreased people function okay so i hope that this exercise kind of gives you everything you need to know and now you should be able to get started working on this project i wish you the best of luck and give it your best shot try as hard as you possibly can i really believe you're going to make a lot of progress and i think that if you really push yourself you should be able to do this if you don't get this done don't get discouraged it's okay i'm right here right we'll code this together i'll show you the solution next um and yeah we'll just walk through this together okay so pause the video now give this a shot and try to nail this and get this done and then what i recommend is you come back and walk through the solution because our solutions might be different and you might be able to pick up you know a lot of things from how maybe i solved the problem versus maybe how you solve the problem okay and remember in coding there always can be multiple different ways and one way isn't necessarily wrong okay it's kind of an art form so we're gonna have different ways where we get to something so that's it um i hope you enjoyed this and uh get to working and i'll see you soon all right so i hope that you gave it a try and if you got it good job for solving the tip calculator if you didn't it's okay we're gonna do it now let's do it together so let's build the tip calculator so here we're gonna walk through right and let's pay attention to the instructions the first thing is we're gonna get access to all of our inputs and divs okay so our bill input tip input number of people div and per person total diff so let's get access to all of these now so i'm basically going to say cons bill input and we're going to say document.getelementbyid and we're going to say bill input total build total input and then we're going to get access to our tip input so we're going to say document.getelements by id and i'm going to paste in tip input because these are the specific ids i need then let's get access to our number of people div and we're gonna do get element by id and then we're gonna paste that in right there number of people and we're gonna do get access to our per person total okay and this will be per person total so we're going to get access to all of this and what global access means is because we're defining it all the way up here all of our functions will have access to all of these divs all right another thing we're going to need is we're going to need the number of people from number of people div so now i'm going to say let number be why i'm saying let here is because the number of people is going to change so sometimes it's going to be 1 sometimes it's going to be 2 3 4 5 right so number of people is going to change so we're going to say let number of people equal we're going to go to our number of people div right and then we'll try and see if we can do inner text and let's type cast it into a number now let's see if any of this works okay so in my calculate bill i'm just going to try to do a console log and i'm just going to say hey show me number of people and let's just see if like any of this is even working right so if i type in here every time i type it runs my calculate build function and every time it runs that it actually shows me my number of people right um my number of people is one so that's why i just keep saying one one one one one okay now i can do console log and we can also do bill input right and i can get the bill input value and we can console log that too so i can go here and say one two three and you can see we got one two three at the bottom right and the console log abc and i got abc at the bottom hopefully you can see that it's right there perfect so it looks like i'm able to uh get information from from these divs and things so that's working so i'm gonna now remove these console logs because i verified what i needed to verify now i'm just going to follow the instructions that i have written here so get bill from user input and convert it into a number so i'm going to basically say hey bill input and what i'm going to say dot value should honestly get me the actual bill now i should just have to type cassette to a number and this should get get me the actual bill and now let's just save it to a variable and we'll call that bill let's console log bill and uh let's see what happens okay so let's run our app and one two three right and our bill is constantly being printed out to the screen and it's a number so that's that's good so i'm gonna remove this console log don't need that anymore now we're to get the tip from user and convert it into a percentage so we're going to say const tip is equal to we're going to do the same thing and we're going to say tip input dot value this time and we're going to actually convert it into a percentage right because that's what it says convert into a percentage divided by 100 so we're going to divide it by 100. now let's console.log the tip percentage let's run this and i'm gonna do 10 and notice it gave me 0.1 because 10 divided by 100 is 0.1 so that's perfect right we're getting our to percentage that means it's 10 great so i can get rid of this console log don't need that anymore all right now we're going to get the total tip amount and how we're going to get this is we're just basically going to say you know it's going to be bill multiplied by tip percentage right so now let's go ahead and console log this and we're going to say tip amount tip amount okay and i'm gonna just put it as an object so it prints out kind of nicely so let's go ahead and let's do writing this is the same as writing this both are the same so this is just like a pro little pro hack all right so i'm going to say 10 and tip amount did not get updated interesting so let's go ahead and fix that let's run this again let's say 10 oh because i'm not putting in a bill total so let's go ahead and do hundred dollars ten percent on that tip amount is ten uh what if it was two hundred dollars seven mile would be twenty dollars let's do three hundred dollars and you can see that tip amount is calculating correctly right it says 30. uh that's perfect so it looks like this is working so i'm going to go ahead and remove this console log don't need that anymore all right now next up we need to calculate the total so the total is going to be tip amount plus bill so let's go ahead and do const total and we're gonna say tip amount plus bill okay let's go ahead and console log that now and let's run and when i type in 100 and i type in so uh 10 so right now tip is assuming zero percent so now we have a hundred oh by the way let's do that little trick we'll do this wrap in an object let's try this again and we're going to say 100 and we're going to give a tip of 10 and you can see total is 110. right let's give a tip of 20 and total is 120. so this is working exactly like how we wanted to let's get rid of this now now we're going to calculate the per person total where we're going to divide by the number of people so that should be easy to do per person total and we're going to do total divided by and we already have access to number of people right here right this is pulling number of people is pulling straight from here okay so it's one and we're type casting it into a number so it's going to not be a string of one but it's a actual number of one right so we're gonna do that divided by number of people and now let's go ahead and let's show that so we're gonna do per person total let's run this and we have one hundred dollars tip is ten percent and per person total is one hundred and ten it's because right now we're not able to increase the number of people right but let's say i went to my html file and i just hard coded that one to a two let's see what happens i'm going to hard code that to a two let's run our app and let's see if this works so i'm going to say bill is you know bill is 100 and then tip is 10 and you can see that it says 55 dollars per person right which which makes ample amount of cents 55 per person why because it's 110 110 divided by two people is 55. so now let's go and change that hardcoded to back to a one let's run our app again and uh because we want to change that dynamically right we don't want to like hard code it in so make sure that this is back to a one when you run your app perfect so what's up next let's go down and let's see what's up next and now update the per person total on dom and show it to user okay cool so let's go do that so i'm gonna grab per person per person total div because i have access to it from up here oh let's just call it per person total diff okay so per person total div we have access to it up there let's p yeah per person total div and we're going to change its inner text to uh per person total right over here okay so i'm going to say per person total oh i'm sorry okay i'm uh yeah i'm just kind of misunderstanding this but like what i mean is this is going to be total per person okay so that's that's this div right here per person total so we are updating it correctly okay so let's just see what happens now let's run this let's go ahead and type in 100 let's type in 10 and let's see what happens we're getting back 110 so that's good but we want it to be in dollars so let's go ahead and do string template literals and we're gonna wrap it in this and just put another dollar sign so this dollar sign will just make sure this is javascript and then this dollar sign will actually put an actual dollar sign it's also 100 and we'll do 10 and when we go here you can see that it says a hundred and ten dollars okay great now what happens if we have a bill that's something like this 148.5 what happens if we have a bill that's like decimals you know or has maybe weird decimals and now you can see that it started showing like lots of decimal places right like so for 135 dollars and 52 cents it says 149.072 like how are you going to pay that in cents that doesn't really make sense so what we want to do here is we want to do a dot 2 fixed so we're going to do that now so you can actually do dot to fix two and pass in two right there and it's gonna make sure that it doesn't go beyond two decimals so let's try some number again like that and you'll notice that now it actually just goes to two decimal places now what if the bill is more like three thousand dollars or something like that it gives you 3300 but it doesn't you know it'd be nicer if it kind of put a comma in there right so if you want to kind of do that what we can actually do and this is a cool uh trick that i learned that i use a lot actually so that's why i kind of want to show it off here you can do dot locale string and just pass in um en us so it's just gonna format it to us currency like a dollar currency or whatever right and uh now if you try some bill right you notice that it's actually putting that dollar sign and that comma or sorry not the dollar sign but the comma which is nice so like if you get some like i don't know you're never going to have a bill this much when you're eating food right but all the commas are there and if you get up to 25 million the commas are still there so this is good and we just want to make sure that we still do that dot to fix things so let's do two fixed and pass it to two places right so fix it to do decimals first and then turn it into with commas let's try it so let's try some big number and let's do decimal places like crazy and notice that the decimal places here don't change okay so great all right in this case all right lesson learned so it seems like if you try to use dot 2 fixed and locale string it doesn't work so just pick one in this case we're just going to stick to dot to fix for now okay so without making it much more complex and that'll just take care of the decimal places which is perfectly fine actually but yeah our decimal places will be fine and then you can give whatever percentage tip and everything will work out as expected so let's get rid of this console log we don't need this anymore so i just got rid of it perfect so now it seems like our calculate bill is doing exactly what it needs to do write it it calculates the bill in a really intelligent way so now all we got to do is increase and increase let's work on increased people so here it says increment the amount of people well i already have number of people number of people right here in line 29 so what i'm going gonna do is i'm just gonna copy this and paste it here and i'm just gonna do plus equals one so we're just gonna increment the number of people by one and then we're gonna update it on the dom so we're gonna grab number of people div which is going to be this div right here okay and we're just going to pop in the number of people that we now have so we're going to say number of people is equal to number of people dot inner text is equal to number of people okay so now let's run this and let's hit plus and you can see that every time i hit plus it actually increments the number of people and then it shows it and that's why you can see that it's showing it exactly how we want it to right and right now minus doesn't work okay so that's fine we'll do that in a second but watch what happens when i do this the bill doesn't calculate the right way i have 10 people okay so let's run this again let's go a hundred dollars tip is ten percent okay and let's run this and you can see it's saying everybody owes a hundred and ten dollars per person that doesn't make sense because 110 dollars that's eleven hundred dollars so how come the bill started with a hundred and ten dollars and now we owe 100 110 or something's wrong so what we need to do is once we do this we need to recalculate the bill based on the new number of people which is super easy all we have to do here is reuse the function we just created so just call this function and that should handle everything so let's go ahead run this i'm going to say we have 100 bill i'm going to say we're tipping let's say 10 number of people is two and boom look at that it's 55. why does it work because remember per person total is calculated total divided by number of people so when you update number of people here this number of people updates and that's the number of people calculate bill function has access to so when you run it again it just recalculates this with a new number of people after you change them pretty beautiful right so very very simple let's go ahead and do the same thing so this code is going to be really really really similar for decrease so decrement the amount of people instead of plus one we're gonna do minus one number of people div we're gonna change to update that and then we're gonna recalculate the bill so it's gonna be very similar to increase so watch what happens when i have a hundred dollars i have a 10 tip i can go one way and i can go backwards look at that how nice but here is the problem i can go more than i can go less than one watch i went to negative one what is that i'm going to negative numbers what is happening how can i have so what the restaurant now owes me for eating there like they should you know what i mean like the royalties there to eat you are special you're a royalty so if you went and the restaurant owed you money i would understand okay fair enough because you're here watching this tutorial you're top of the food chain all right while everybody struggles out there you're here grinding it out so then you can level up your career provide for your family provide for your kids you're a champ tap yourself on the back pat yourself on the back do both tap and pat do them both all right so we don't want to go below one person so we're gonna add what i call a guard clause here basically gonna say if number of people is less than or equal to one homie just stop just stop stop don't run this simply here means end the function right here and the decrease people function on line 70 and don't run any of this so let's try this again and i'll explain 110 now when i hit minus watch what happens hit minus nothing happens when i hit plus it works when i hit minus it works but when i hit minus now it doesn't work so what is happening when it's one or less than one it just says hey i noticed that this function is running but i want you to only run here and when this condition is true because number of people is one right just one less than or equal to one yes it's true so then the code just stops and doesn't end up running any of this now in the other case scenario where a number of people is let's say two it goes to less than or equal to one and it goes false so then it doesn't run this but it ends up running all of these here okay so that's why it's a guard clause right so we're just guarding the entire code base and we stop it okay to prove to you i'm just going to say so log number of people so i'm going to stop okay so let's go ahead and run this and watch what happens when i hit minus it detects one is one or less than one so i'm gonna stop right when i go here and try to run minus see it doesn't happen it doesn't happen the console.log statement doesn't happen doesn't happen even here doesn't happen even here but when i go one more below boom one is one or less than one so i'm gonna stop one is one or less than one so i'm gonna stop so it's detecting it right every single time every single time okay so we can even like leave a little message for the user and say you know hey you can't go you cannot less than one person right so now like the user can see this message and no okay i can't do that right so plus plus plus minus minus minus hey you cannot have less than one person and if you want to make it more intrusive and more visible to the user you can even do something like an alert so now we go 100 10 tip plus plus plus minus minus minus minus says hey right you cannot have less than one person so it lets us know right there that that's not a possibility so you can do it whatever way you want okay you could throw an error if you want and like that'll kind of crash the app and if you want to be really pro i can give you one like kind of pro javascript tip is uh what you can do is you can throw an error and show the user they're doing something wrong but like kind of in a sneaky way so here you can say you can you can replace this alert with something called a throw and they'll throw an error so you do throw and then what's nice about throw is you won't even need that return like or just leave the return here but like you won't really need it okay so you can do that return pattern i'm leaving this return here to show you use a return pattern again and again because that's normally what i do but here if you want to throw an error and really let the user know you could do that right so for example boom hundred ten percent i try to hit minus and it throws like a red little error at the bottom says hey you cannot have less than one person so it's very clear that the user is trying to do something that they're not allowed to do and like you can make it visible all right so there you go let's see if this entire thing is working or not let's open it up here and let's check right we just built this and we're excited right let's see if it works so we got a bill we just went and ate at a nice restaurant let's say you went to cheesecake factory you took your family out i mean it's a nice night out right they gave you a big fat bill for 375 dollars maybe you maybe you brought some friends with you and they're like hey mandatory tip is 20 so you all start freaking out who's going to calculate it what is it going to be what's happening right so you go okay we got the tip is you know 10 or we're going to give a 20 tip so that's oh that's 450 right now but you only have one you only have selected as one person but luckily you brought your friends with you right you brought the entire gang hopefully so you know you got you got uh juanes you got daniel you got frankie you got lance you got nas i mean you got the whole gang up in there right so you got all these six people look at that your bill is only 75 dollars that's not too bad right that's not too bad that's that's easy maybe maybe you bring in two other people from somewhere you go to them and you grab them and you're like hey come join our party and split the bill with them too now the more the merrier am i right you got 56 dollars and 25 cents i mean this is at this point the restaurant should be paying you right this is nothing cheesecake factory nice night out with the family and friends i mean come on that's a bargain the 20 tip right so this is this is really nice right this is really nice app that we could actually use and what's amazing is it's already hosted online thanks to repple yeah it's deployed on the interwebs so you could put it on your portfolio you could do whatever you want with its live ready to go okay ignore that sound that was i'm having a focus session and it makes this a little big so now what i want you to do is you're gonna grab all of this javascript code that you wrote go back to this exercise file okay and uh go to tip calculator go to exercise go to the script.js okay and then delete everything that's in this exercise file okay and then paste your code in here all right and give it a try and see if it works so go and run it so go to your now project exercises you should be able to go to tip calculator you should be able to type in things like 100 10 plus plus plus plus minus minus minus it should all work smoothly okay so make sure you go ahead and do that update your exercise as exercise as you go so you have the most uptodate version with all of your projects completed all in one place nice and ready for you to use all right that was the tip calculator i hope you had fun i had a ton of fun actually sharing it it's 11 53 p.m i was supposed to have a date night on my girlfriend we're gonna watch the boys the new
