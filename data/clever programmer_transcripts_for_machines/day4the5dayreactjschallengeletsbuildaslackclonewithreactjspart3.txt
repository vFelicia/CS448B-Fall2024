you if we get to 200 likes do you think we can get started then i mean we could get started before but if we get to 200 likes 200 likes and we get started bro no no i set my limits i said my limits bro oh my gosh invite your friends guys about your friends because if you don't if you don't i'm sorry we're not going to get started so make sure you like subscribe all the things okay very important if you're not on your js challenge what are you still doing click the link below to join guys that's the only way you'll be considered for the uh for the what for the prize so of course very important let's get to 100 200 103 likes you see that right there 103 likes and look at this guys before we get started here's what we are building today our goal is to get to this section you see how we have clever programmer day three day cp this guy's actually is coming from a database right so for example i can say hello daniel you know daniel not only that you're actually logged in as rafi yes i'm also oh check this out guys i can log out so let me i will click on this icon right here i will log out oh look at that i will click sign in right right here sign in with google give it one second sign in sunday stuff just takes a while for it to all fall to work i will select my email look at this guys how sick is this and that's it i'm in and all your data is stored in the database so you get the chats that you already had in your in your your logo is here the name is here your chats are all here you have different channels everything guys this is actual slack clone and it looks sick and i for example say yo daniel daniel is not cool no then he's not see i'm sorry bro what a lie i'm sorry and other people can be chatting here so i can give this to daniel and i should daniel can go ahead and business and for a crazy part we're going to we're going to host this live guys host it live on firebase so you can go ahead and share it with your friends with your family and be like yo check out what i got you got this no you don't but i got it exactly five more likes left and we'll get started oh five more likes we'll get started let's go do guys five four three two come on guys two two you know guys come on two two two two two and we are 200 likes let's go this is how we get it done all right are you ready for this all right so yo we just got twenty dollars what christian europe please death oh my god christian thank you so much let me show it to you here show it to everyone man chris 20 yo that's a canadian that's canadian i don't care man that's awesome let's go i probably said yesterday 20 bucks to dance wrong oh christian thank you so much for the donation i hope i went all out on that dance for you so that it was worth it for you we appreciate you guys we appreciate the support all the time we got to 200 likes nas let's get started man that's it so dive into it all right open up your laptops open up the code right because we are not getting into code so the first thing that we need to do guys is pretty simple this is the project that we left off from yesterday right right here right we have the channels on the left hand side okay okay right here we have things like right this main chat right here there's a chat box let's make this a little bit less loud right there this main chat box right here and we have a chat input right here right so a lot of things already set up but a lot of today is going to be a lot of javascript and react to yes so a lot is going to be the behind the scenes nitty gritty that's what's going to happen today okay all right so let's kind of work on the login and to do the login right a few things need to happen first for it to fully fully fully work now real quick now before we dive in i do want to remind you guys this will get a little more intense because we're going to dive deeper into firebase we're gonna be doing a lot of different things nas will explain it every step of the way but if you do get lost or if you do get left behind don't worry at all just keep watching keep learning see nas create this magic because you can always go back to the replay we'll be posting it right away and you can then go through and wrap it up for yourself always always always so let's think about this okay for the login what we do we need to do well a few things okay let's think about how we want to even for example do the login okay if you look at the current route okay the current route is pretty simple we have route to the room or we have route to login now we don't necessarily want that what we want is you want to be able to show the room we we want to get into the room only once the user exists you see what i mean so only if we logged in if the user is there right basically we know of what the user is that only then do we log in so here's what we do i will go ahead and i will create a state here called a state here called users i'll say const user user can you guys see this right make this a little bit larger or now what do you think yeah i will have here const user user comma set user so what does this will do this will be where our user gets stored understood good so and here we'll say use state use state okay state right here and for now we'll just say nothing for now we'll just say you stay to nothing okay so we're going to initialize the value to nothing from it initially make sense makes it good okay cool now what's going to happen we're going to check if the user exists or not and depending on that will set the login page so look at this inside the router inside the router look at this so here's what we'll do we will check if the user exists i will go ahead and open up my brackets and just like you can do in javascript i will say if user but i'm going to say if not user mini if there is no user if there is no user what what's going to happen is a pretty simple process it's like if there is no user i will go ahead and display the login page like so otherwise here's what i'll do otherwise i will do everything else um so if the user is not logged in because there is no user we want to take them and redirect them to the login page to make them log in exactly because there's not any information we can show them until they log in after exactly so this right here as you can see this is saying hey if there is no user this question mark is like a shortcut for an if and l statement okay if there is no user then we log in they will go to the login page however if they use a user then we go to this room page does that make sense okay cool so let's try that right now so i'm gonna save this and you can see right wait this look at this it took away straight to login page because why because there is no user signed in there's no user signed in exactly so let's go to the login page and let's work on the login page itself so i'm going to go i'm going to say login.js and everybody you guys should be doing at the same time as well logan.js right here and in the log in the gs a few things are going to happen number one of course is let's make sure that we have the container right just so we have a style components we'll have container right here so container container container boom right there and it's gonna also be closed out with a container as well oh container boom right there okay it's going to close that out oh and so you can see of course we have an issue with container not defined because we need to add a styled tool look at this guy know what he's talking about i've just seen noz do it so many times osmosis you know yeah import styled from what tell me tell me the styled components oh come on bro you knew that bro come on i know i forgot that i know and i also misspelled styled as well right so don't misspell this kind of stuff guys okay all right so i'm gonna say const container is equal to styled that div for now cool inside is this look at that now we have the login this is the one okay inside this div guys what's going to happen is we're going to give it a positioned position kind of like a full on full on height that's the first thing that's going to happen but inside there we're going to have the content so kind of like how we had here let me take you back here right you have this div this right here let me just show you this is the container this is going to be the content now we'll have an image we'll have some each one and then we'll have a button it's a pretty simple process you want to see yep yeah okay all right let's go back to this all right so right here inside here we'll do content content content like so content voila close that out and then inside the content a few things are going to happen we will have an image that's part one and then we'll have a h1 tag and so forth so let's create an image and here we'll say we'll have slack slack image slack image let me see slack image and this is just going to be the remember how we said people like hey do you use only.div or do you use anything else well check this out guys this is the really cool part about you know the whole part with style components okay i can actually use an image as part of a style component look at this here's what i'll do i'll do this and i will say and for the slack image i will actually call it a component construct const slack image right there is equal to styled that image see without the image so i'm actually creating an image using style components see right there next thing for content let's go ahead and make that as also stuck so content so const content is equal to styled.div as well but there boom boom right there okay so that should still work of course there's nothing else at this point now let's go ahead and get the source so slack image every image has what a source exactly so let's get the link so to get guys the source of image the slack so we'll say slack logo here let's go to images select logo let's do like transparent logo i think this one will work well right there copy image address there you go no problem let's go back to our react app let's give this one a a boom see eng right there so if i save this now okay let's go and refresh this if i save this it is not showing up anything and there's a i think there's a reason because i said image is not image it should be people actually were calling it out on this yeah thank you i just showed this oh look at this bro jack that is jacked i agree with that bro and by jack which would be huge yeah so let's work on the container first the containers we know is going to be one so we'll say the container is going to be remember how we said the container is going to be the full the full width of like this is the container correct so the width is the width is going to be of this container with oh width of 100 okay and the height is going to be what daniel what is 100 as well actually 100 vh 100 vertical high remember that guys it's very important 100v means 100 vertical 100 is hard to define because that depends on the parent and i mean if the parent is only 50 pixels a hundred percent of 50 pixels what do you pick the pixels right so that's what doesn't make sense so height is going to be 100 vh right here save that and now the container is 100 now granted that still does not really change much but that's okay we'll set a background color to faf8f8 like so by the way someone asked can you add that source link into the style component which one so you know how the slack image source this link can we bring that into the style component or does it have to be on the component when you have it up here you wanna you wanna it will have to be here okay yes it has to be here so because the image now all these attributes that a normal image has it inherits it you see what i mean those aren't styling those are parts of styling that's not like the css that's the actual html exactly that component that's why it doesn't go in the bottom got this bro let's go okay cool so we have not the background color of course there's nothing nothing too crazy about this let's go ahead and do now let's now create the content the contents can be pretty simple right the the content of this one is going to be i'm trying to think of what to do for the content um okay here's what we'll do we'll make the slack image actually select slack image will give this like image a height of 100 pixels there okay now the 100 pixels okay so that's now that that which is great okay and the content is now going to be the white background so we'll say background color background color white white right there right there background white see this okay so you can see the content is right here you see this right here that's the content you see how it's like the image is here and the content uh div is here and this is the gray container you see that right there right there so here's what's going to happen now for this to properly work what we will do is simply go ahead and we'll make this display grid we can display flex actually display flex flex guys right there okay right there you see and now what we'll do to make it horizontally line what do we do horizontally is that the item or is that the justified justify content vertically guys you guys need to learn you guys made to memorize this to ver to horizontally align the center see look at that now this content is horizontally lined but you see how it stretches out you see how this white stretched out yeah you can fix that you know how by doing align items align items item center center boom boom right there oh you see now this whole thing is just kind of here you see this gray area is the container this white area is the content and then simply just wraps the logo for now nice yes so to not wrap it now do not have it just wrapped local this will do we'll give this container actually a padding of uh actually a content will give that content actually a padding of 100 pixels look at this 100 pixels boom oh you see that much better look at this you see yes now it has some nice spacing there exactly exactly we will also go ahead and give it a nice border radius to make it some like a little bit just uh you know a little bit nice curvature because we like hers bro right we love curves yeah like smooth smoothies no i actually crazy enough you know why people like curves in terms of like um uh you know like apps and so forth because we ourselves are people we're curved like like we have no jagged edges like we as people and so this is why we relate to nice curves in terms of like when we see a laptop or a computer or when we see anything right there's no jacket edge jacket edges yeah that's something that uh that is the the head of design at apple said that's crazy yeah that's crazy and i know curve everything guys no nothing straight nothing straight nothing whatsoever streets curse everything okay also let's make a small box shut us we'll add a box to the shadow to the content right here this is the box shuttle guys it's a pretty pretty i know this is a big big one but it's okay don't worry about it here box shadow you can just copy this guys for yourself right here box show zero one pixel three pixels rgb uh this is the box hey there we go there you go this is the box you see so starting to look pretty good once you say so it looks really i know it looks looks sexy okay cool next up what we need to do guys is the following let's go ahead and h1 tag in here so we'll do this and we'll say and before we do that nas can you quickly copy and paste this link into the youtube comment section just because we're asking some people if they could get it just like uh the image link so by the way guys this is something where you could go to google and find a similar one it doesn't have to be the exact copy to to listen to you the the yeah you can send it to me and put it over here um depends on where slack is uh where is slack i have no idea just just press on select button which type button yeah just open up slack there you go send it to me oh let's go okay oh my gosh where's daniel right right above david david's already there bro yeah right there all right guys here only for you guys only for you guys only for you guys okay only for you guys okay cool so yeah boom awesome so we got that that's the image you guys got hopefully that's that will fix that let's go ahead and create each one now element and sedation will say we'll go sign into slack sign sign in slack send this slack okay sign in to slack so we got that portion okay that's amazing oh look at that oh that looks good that looks great now of course it looks hideous because it's also not centered so we can fix that how do we fix that just if i got it oh let's go leave me hanging bro i know i'm trying to do like 10 things [Laughter] so now inside the content we'll go display flex and in this one as well so we'll say display flex flex as well and we'll say justify what happened here justify content to find content actually we'll do let me see um we'll say flex direction column x so it will make the flex direction column because right now you can see this is a row you see it goes this by row from here to here you see that we want to be stacked on time exactly so we'll say flex direction column and look and look at the difference boom i know don't worry about it we're getting there don't worry then we'll do is we'll say justify content center content center right there okay center it right there now this is center now okay and we'll do online items items center as well oh you see that's actually fixed so line item center actually what that does is you know how we said line items vertically aligns it remember that well for column hold on i know i don't want to say i know but for column for column it's actually a horizontal line items do you get it you get it bro you get it it switches probably it's like a switch it's a little confusing but that's dope now by the way guys lure this lord ten dollars ah let's go lourdes we know lord she was actually in the react.js workshop i hope i think that's the lord is what you're talking about maybe maybe maybe i know but she said may the force be with you cp lunares thank you so much i appreciate your donation we greatly appreciate it and we also hope the force is with you as well yes always always all right let's make sure the first is with us in this in this javascript and this day four day part three of the slack clone wait did you just get another one yo on what's up bro i did another one oh my god are you serious right now what is this on thank you so much by the way shout out to guys 300 likes we'll do a dance we already got bro come on we got a code thank you on thank you there so much we greatly appreciate it okay so signing slack let's now create next thing you want to do is create a button to sign in alright so let's go do this i'm going to sign in button sign in button boom right there okay and the sign in button will say sign in with google okay now that was going to happen it's pretty simple on the signing button with google hey that was for all the donations that we just got a while ago we have to make up for things exactly all right so on the signin button let's go ahead and make the assignment button much much much more prettier because right now so anybody's undefined so of course we'll define it where we'll design it below so say const sign in button is equal to styled dot look at this now it's not div button see so now we're actually adding styling components to different types of tags yes you can see now now this is just a simple div but we'll make it look just epic will make it look so good that you'll be like oh my god i want this i think we just got one more oh my gosh oh my gosh thank you so much he says you guys are awesome with a 10 donation thank you yeah i think the more we dance the more they like it i don't know i know we just need to keep dancing oh no we need a code guys we need a code we can't dance forever but thank you so much man we greatly appreciate it awesome so let's go ahead for the button let's go ahead and make add a little bit of a margin to the top kind of because i like that and let's go ahead and put it to the right hand side so we can make this really simple all right margin top wait is that daniel who's who who's who who made the donation um this was iorinde ojo okay gotcha okay so marcia 50 pixels will push this button a little bit out you can see here so now pushes it a little bit out we'll also do a background color we'll do a background right here background color right there color like so okay for this background color pretty simple guys this is the color we want to use for now it's a pretty cool color it's kind of just kind of like uh this uh here let me show you boom see it's a green color right here okay next up let's go ahead and do uh the text color white so we'll say color that's that will change the text color guys text color white beautiful okay so that's much better now it still looks hideous as you can see would you agree with that one yes disgusting right now disgusting so we'll do his will do also you see this border right here that we have around we'll remove that border by saying border none border none okay cool save that awesome next step let's go ahead and do this we'll say height of this thing is going to be height of 40 pixels of 40 pixels boom save that oh let's go and that's going to give it a border radius of 4 pixels bro because we want smooth smooth it's always about smooth okay next up uh let's go let's look at that that looks much better now let's make a cursor pointer to make sure it's a dash cursor is going to be pointer for this one okay cool as you can see i can hover over it it becomes a core cursor pointer beautiful nice and then what's going to happen i'm going to let's do a font size a font size if one size of 15 pixels boom done look at that see now we have ourselves a button that's pretty cool let's go ahead and also add you see how we have the margin top 50 pixels let's also add a margin to this logo right here so it's a little bit spaced out you see that right there yeah yeah oh do you think we should leave it like this actually i kind of like i mean obviously it looks clean but if you want to clean up a little more actually no i like it like this it looks good to me you guys you guys like it give me a thumbs up in the chat guys if you guys like it like that drop a fire drop a [ __ ] it drop drop it all drop trouble like it's hot drop drop drop drop it like it's okay sorry so so okay guys so we now have the sign in functionality but it's not functional just yet guys because now we have to go up to firebase and actually enable it check this one out okay let's all go here but we are 322 people watching right now and we are almost 300 likes let's go you guys are just so good let's go ahead and make sure we share this guy's video oh okay who can share this video on facebook i want to see it oh a facebook share uhhuh whoa shut up facebook guys i want to see you guys share on facebook bonus points for you bonus points bonus yes yes always okay why did you put that one back in bro [Laughter] all right moving on so here's here is our database okay to enable authentication guys with our database as you know we already enable firebase firebase just in general correct this is firebase right here correct right here now to enable to enable what do we try to enable here bro firebase sign in authentication you go to authenticate authentication okay go here that's the first step okay at that point get started there we go okay now hold it okay pay really close attention okay we will go to google right here click on google click on enable below here select the email this is the project and click save well done see that right there that's done okay so we have that that's being done that's being completed right now okay cool cool cool so now we have the slack now we have google enabled now how do we now use it we have users right here this is where google google will actually save the users that log into our app nice got it nice to fully fully make this work with google we need to go back to our firebase.js guys right here okay all right let's do that and as you can see guys we make sure to hit the firebase config from you uh because from the last time you guys stole it from us and so we hit that firebase config to make sure we're proud of you guys for being hackers but yes but it was it was no bueno no but no no bueno so what's gonna happen is we now need to enable authentication in a firebase config as well to do that we'll do const auth okay off is equal to what is equal to firebase.also say firebase dot auth firebase.off okay okay cool save that awesome then what's going to happen guys is we need to go ahead and provide a provider so it's a cons provider and the provider is what is it google provider is a facebook provider that's what it's asking for okay makes sense makes sense good so provider is equal to new firebase right there dot off dot off newfound.google right here google no google off no auth provider right here see that right there well let me show i actually make sure i have it fully correct so i'm going to do that right there so it's a new firebase product not mew as a meal meal meal that's funny people are calling you out over here really the mew i love it that's funny okay so we've got the provider this is the google provider guys this right here is the authentication which will allow us to sign in which will allow us to use the google auth sign in now we need to be able to use it and export it so we'll do like this we'll do export and we'll do export and we'll say export auth provider so say export auth comma provider awesome does that make sense you see that right there yep cool let's make sure we put that kind of above here i want to make sure it's up top here cool all right save that awesome so we have the firebase config that's the only thing we need to do to configure our firebase comprende i'm running completely good okay now let's go back to login.gs and this is where our login will actually fully work so now okay let's create a sign in function in here in the login here let me go ahead and move this all right and here let me go back to our react app again again it's fine don't worry about this at all no problem whatsoever okay okay let's do const sign in is equal to what is equal to what it's a function okay great let's go and import author product from firebase so we'll say import import off right there like so we need to import it off like this and by the way since you see nas importing someone literally asked why are we exporting as objects and the reason is so that we can import them into other components like nods is literally doing in line three right now yes this is why well here's why i actually know why okay why here's why because well what is this no what you do no it's all good now so here the reason we're doing this this is kind of allows us to export multiple things um right so this will also act for example i can export auth and provider otherwise i'll just ask for one thing but an object like this allows mama to export this and this as well makes sense and then now we could use it throughout other places in the code exactly that's what pretty much the whole goal okay cool let's go back to our what where we were log in you were importing stuff cool okay and from you to import from firebase guys from firebase and here we'll do dot firebase hey we got another donation thank you so much for speaking nas terminology he really appreciates that everybody's just the comprendent now where's that even start in the workshop yeah that's in the workshop yeah that was funny that was funny i love that part okay so cool we have the sign in we imported our auth firebase provider that's all good now here is how we use it pay really close attention now guys okay really close attention check this out right we will do off and we'll say off dot sign in sign in with popup right here with popup and we'll provide the provider so our provider is actually the google provider which we enable remember that yep that was a good part would you enable so we'll say provider provider right here and then what's going to happen is this gives us a promise and i'll promise i did not explain this too much but i promise it's like almost like it's like a handshake it's like hey bro does that give me a handshake hey i will give you some data later on i promise you okay it's a promise got it taking them too long it's a promise i better get that data i want that data so this is what's going to happen i will say that then that then is when you accept the promise when i give you the actual data so that then i will say like this that allowed a little up but then this gives a function in the promise i said i get the data called the result and this result is actually going to the data of the user guys that's the cool part here's what i'll do i will do console.log console.log log now say result result.user just for you guys to see okay resolve that user okay cool let's let's go ahead and make sure we catch just to make sure cache also is like let's say that i did not give you the data and something some error happened so you broke you'll be catching i broke my promise i'm sorry bro i'm sorry oh my gosh i'm good at breaking promises all right cool so just to emphasize the promise is that nas is going to give me some data in the later date it's going to take him some time to find it the then is if he does bring me the data what is it and the catch is if he had an error trying to get the data for me correct so here we'll do error right and then here alert what alert error dot message right here that message now but here in the sign in this is where we will actually sign in so now how does that work out well that works out but simply just us clicking on the unclick function here's what we'll do we'll say on the sign in button we'll say on click on click okay we'll do like this data we'll say sign in and so what's going to happen is an on click of the sign in button we will go ahead and call this sign in function does that make sense all right let's go and save this ready for this bro oh hold on let's say for example right there's an example okay look at this let's go inspect element now now nothing happened of course because that was a purpose right but but now we have some data look at this this my friends is data about qazi wow you see that's a lot of data that's a lot of data i'm not trying to deal with this i'm not sure you know but you can see here we have rafikaze is the name we have cleverprogrammer.com right here and we also have really important portion which we have what which is the photo where's our photo right photo url right there the photo url of kazi look at this guys how sick is that that is pretty we get everything we need from the profile so that we can use that data exactly in our application so let's now go ahead and save this guys remember how the photo url the one we're going to use is we will use the photo url and we will also use display name from kaza right here you see that's the only thing we'll use let's do that now let's go when we sign in let's create a new user we'll say const new user is equal to okay and we'll say we'll make an object and we'll say name is equal to what result that what what does it tell me uh is this user dot display i was gonna say display name but display name right there comma and let's also give it a photo url so we'll say photo we say result result.user dot url the photo photo url look at this and that is it and so now i can actually go ahead and console log the new user let's try it one more time we'll say new user okay so the new user save that sign in with google okay one more time classic club pokemon inspect down button on this one console oh oh let's go oh look at this beautiful you see that everybody let me go ahead and zoom in on this so you guys see it zoom in look at this look at this bro so god so good hey okay good so okay now with that what do we do with this user that's the big question guys okay that is the big question with this new user we now need to save that user in the state okay no i was gonna say what is the state but so the state estate guys is like let's say we have a component right in our case we have a state that is for example the app correct for the app we need to save and every single component has its own state kind of like so it has its own kind of little state right here right state and it's kind of like a database data right here and so can happen is literally i can go ahead and i can create one element another element and it will remember that state or remember that data so our goal is to be able to add a user to this like a to our first to the state so we can remember who the actor is now we can remember who the user is okay let's do that right now what's going to happen is i will go back to my app.js guys app.js right here and what another one holy moly man whoa guys we're gonna code not dance what do we do now i mean hold on let's let's wait for the beat to drop okay we're going to wait for the beat to drop this way yeah yeah we'll wait for the beat the job okay when they drop they're going to dance for you guys okay the next date guys is thirty dollars to dance okay thirty dollars that's it so us dollars we gotta increase the price now thirty us dollars okay oh my god who are you bro i was bad bro i'm trying to code here so look we have the user now you see this user is in the app state everybody everybody understand this it is currently in the app state right here see it's kind of like what i'm talking about here right that's where the goal is to put that user state this say user is actually here make sense how do we put the user well the site user function is what actually sets the user okay what's going to happen is you will pass it up okay all right fine right oh my god bro yeah i go so hard to actually get out of my chair just for you guys oh my gosh that's funny bro so i interrupted you you were explaining yes um yes i state okay yes so um so we pass it now the site user function we pass as a user function into login and we'll say say user look at this this is where it's so cool you can pass in functions to write different components like i say say user is equal to set user right here save that okay okay what should happen then we will we can use this set user function inside login.js like so and we can accept it by using use something called props props you see that right there props are like parameters for functions okay and in here now we'll do this we'll say props props dot what that set user right there and we'll pass in the new user oh let's go look at this and so what's going to happen is whenever we log in we're going to pass in a new user to the state of the app we will now have that state and you will see that what's going to happen is if you go to app.js this user will now be here and so if i do console.log user simply console.log i'll log okay we'll say user in app user in app state okay and we'll do comma comma user right there just so you guys see it just so you guys see it right here let me go ahead and i will remove this i don't need this path right now just let's remove this path for temporarily guys okay remove this path for now remove that don't need that for now okay okay we got that we got that that's all good and look at this i want you to pay attention now i will save everything file save all okay file save all you ready for this bro refresh this oh sign in with google oh okay what's going to happen now sign up with google then we will go ahead and sign in with actual google classiclarvpro.com okay good let's go you see what happened here now we inspect element let's go to console look at this guys user and app initially when we started when we had when we were on the login page right user in app state was undefined this is why the login page was displayed okay this is why the login page was displayed but then because we set the user we set the user by using using the site user function guys function okay we went ahead and now the in app state this now has a name and look at this a name and a photo and this is where all of this now actually lives inside the state so now we can access it we could change it if we ever need to but that data is there whenever we're in the application correct how guys this is the beauty of react and just the beauty of javascript the beauty of coding i love it so much beautiful i love it so much anyways okay let's close this up so look at that we got that now what's gonna happen is we can actually use this user object okay we can use this user object anywhere you want pretty much bro we got the user object we can now use it okay okay let's go ahead and save this we can use this user object you know where where we'll check this out where we can use this user object actually inside the header you see how we have this name nazari here yeah who's that guy let's that's that's this cool guy oh oh yeah that guy was correct guys cutting right so the user object let me go ahead and close this part out okay we can replace the desire with the actual user data let's go back to where let's go back to header right here let me go ahead and go back to header okay and what's going to happen is we will passing user now into the header like so again we're passing so much data throughout all these components make sense let's go to the header okay header and remember how we had the header name and so forth what we could do now is look at this we can say header we can say props props and in here we'll say props right there props dot name look at that props that name okay and of course if we were uh i need to refresh this hold on props that name actually i'll props the user that name props the user user dot name oh let's go look at that it says rafa kazi right here beautiful because that's the actual user that's lost that's the actual use that's logged in wow now we're getting somewhere guys give us some fire down below guys how cool is this this if you're students for the first time this is the beauty of coding right you have so many possibilities abilities it's insane so good you got this you got this if you develop these skills you'll be able to code yes if not like gnaws you'll be able to code better than that but it's going to take a lot of time because nas has been coding for a long time yes so look at this rafikaze now it says here okay great but here's the cool thing i want you to learn something called this is called destructuring okay i can actually structure this props and i can actually get the user out of this process by using using something like like this i will do for example object right here user like this user so just this is called destructuring guys i can go ahead basically take out the user from props imagine if this was a parameter right i can do structure using this and then now the user is kind of like here makes sense and now at this point i do not need this props i just need to use it now at this point and that's it and we're still got rafikaze so i want to introduce this new kind of topic to you all right beautiful all right that is all said and done what's next bro next is let's go ahead and change this image when you have this image right here this image source we can also change this using this using for example user user let me go back to uh where's my header here we'll have user here user user user dot photo boom so now hey look at that that's the user photo of that person crispy clean man that's cool right yep that's cool i love that okay all right we got that now of course one thing we need to make sure is that sometimes the user form might not exist guys right this user photo might not exist exactly so we need to check to make sure that user photo exists so we'll do user photo if user photo exists then we'll use the user photo like so otherwise otherwise we'll use a static image that's just simply this image right here i'm gonna give it to you i'll give it to you right now this image right here so otherwise we'll use this static static image right there that's pretty much it okay and this image if you want it i can give it to you if you want to go ahead and pass it down i'll pass it to you bro i'll pass it to you let's go this is the static image right here okay okay so then we'll go ahead and make and make sure you guys got it okay let's go ahead and say this because sometimes you might not have a photo that's that's just pretty much the reason why all right refresh this okay now here's another issue now here's another issue you see every time we need to sign in with google look at this sign in with google true kaiser cloud programmer okay great that's also all good and done and the reason why every time i refresh you see it takes me back to the login page why do you think that's the case guys why do you think that's the case it's because because yes we save an estate but the state gets refreshed every single time that we refresh the page so we need to have something where we could store the user for a period of time like perhaps a session yeah maybe a local store or local storage so what's going to happen is now we get into something called local storage local storage is kind of like storage for your browser for your website this comes directly with your browser chrome safari anything and we can access it from our website as well check this out so let me go ahead and just show to you what i mean by local storage we'll say local storage storage react.js there so session storage and local storage and the way you do local storage guys right here the way to local store is pretty simple so i just do local storage okay the way this local storage is the following you see i can create a local storage item i can get a local storage item i can remove a local storage item or i can fully clear it it's kind of like a brain it remembers kind of who you are forever until you clear it make sense exactly so we can utilize that when we log in let's think about this okay and when we log in so let me go ahead and do this all right let me go back to uh login.js you know you see how we say the set item we can use this local storage set item let's go ahead and do this we d we set the user but we also also are going to i'm going to login.js let's go to login just but you also will set the item so here's what i'll do inside here i will say local storage that say item and i will say user user now we cannot just say new user like this guys new user like this this will not work right here because why because because local storage accepts string it accepts json string so what we need to do is to do json json does stringify and we pass in this whole new user boom right there and so now this new user which is an object initially in javascript will go ahead convert it be converted to a string using javascript just json.stringify and it will be saved in local storage check this out and and someone asked is local storage the same thing as a cookie no it's not no it's not cookie is different a cookie is basically for a session a cookie is kind of like uh it's um it's it's similar it's similar yes it is similar but it's two different technologies in terms of how we save data cookie is very much used with the server so for example when you have a server it's like when you have a back end when you have a backend server you have a cookie that kind of communicates between the server and the frontend okay local storage is mainly just kind of saving data for the browser nothing has to do with the backend whatsoever that's what the cookie is and that's local storage is perfect yeah okay cool all right let's go ahead and go back to our app which is which one which one it's this one right here okay good all right now if i log in if i log in guys check this out if i log in sign in with google okay let's do this oh let's go back to here so i know google i will do kaziklarpur.com look at this okay i'm signed in but if i inspect element i go to look at this i want you to go to application go to local storage and look at this hold on hold on hold on oh let's go look at this bro look oh there it is the user is right here um inside that local storage you see local storage name avakazi photo and now that we have this here someone actually has a great question they said does the local storage die after the app closes or the user logs off or how does this work no it does not die when you when you close the browser whoa guys and that's why we have in local storage because we want to make sure we keep the user logged in until they decide to log off yes exactly the log out on the log on portion when we click log out that's when we destroy local storage okay make sense all right so let's go check this out so we have local storage that's cool let's now of course if i refresh though it still goes back because again with silicon storage but we're not using it correctly so let's now go to app.js right here okay inside app.js here's what's going to happen we'll say user say user this right here inside whatever you put in here this is the default value default value that's default value when the app starts okay well what we can do guys what we can do is let's go ahead and go to app.js here what we can do is i can actually get my local storage i can do local storage local storage okay git item because we set the item before git item and we'll say here we'll say user back user right there but again we cannot just do user because again this is a string right here when i do get item it gives me a string i need to parse it and convert it into an object so here's what i'll do i'll do you remember how you adjacent that stringify now we'll do json.parse to go the opposite way so is that we convert from a string to an object exactly boom boom right there save that awesome save that boom and now check this out okay check this out really really quickly just disadvarse now it's going to store the user inside here and actually what's going to happen is if i refresh it actually should not take me back perfect so now it recognizes that rafikaze is logged in oh let's see look at that it does not take me back but once you log out let me go hi hold on so it's like here here here if i go to console you see here then where is it i don't have i don't have the console here but it's because of the fact that the user is still there right and we simply set it inside here when we refresh the page right the state might be gone but local storage is now gone local storage is still there okay so just keep that in mind all right now the question becomes is how do we log out that part two now is how do we log out well the logo function will become from here when i click this button i want to be able to log out that's going to happen okay make sense yep yes let's do that right now okay to create the logout function again pretty simple step i will go to my header let's do a header header in here as well okay and what's going to happen is in the header on the click of this i will have a sign out function on the click of the header okay now again what i will do is i will do what's going to happen i'm going to pass in the sign off function sign out function into the header and i will use it i will say unclick unclick of the button is equal to right here and i will say unclick sign out right there and now we'll go back to app.js and i will pass in the button of course there okay and now if we go to app.js so again this function will be clocked clicked on if i go ahead and if i just kind of use your image this uses the image right here this is directly connected to this guys just so you know okay make sense content yep good good awesome all right next up let's go ahead and go to app.js beautiful and now inside this app.js we will pass in a sign off function to the header because that's what we're using remember that yep all right let's pass in the sign up function in the header we'll say sign out sign out is equal to what some kind of a sign out function that we have which we have not created just yet so we will we will do is we will have here we'll say const sign out is equal to what is equal to the following that's how we code apparently if you just say gibberish the group comes all is gibberish it's always your fish that's what mom says actually mom says whatever you're what are you writing you're some gibberish just [ __ ] literally when you're coding yeah yeah yeah yeah literally he's like i understand what you're writing you're some gibberish i'm sorry she's like no comprehend no comprendo that's for sure okay cool cool awesome you guys are amazing we are almost at 400 likes let's go can we get to 400 bro how much what did we get to the last time how many likes did we get to the last time 600 700 i forgot already it might have been 600 oh my god so let's get to 400 likes let's go you guys and we'll dance of course we'll dance nothing bad about that okay so on the sign up function now to do sign again we're going to use the auth from that's going to come from database so we'll do provider auth provider so we're going to copy this same thing is going to happen here we'll say off provider just how did off to sign in we'll use off to sign out okay well here here we'll have auth dot will say sign out sign out like so okay and then we'll do that then so that again is a promise when it's successful to sign out okay i'll make a function inside this function i will go ahead and do the following i will do the two things one is i will set user to null why do you know why daniel yes because we don't want in our database or in our local storage anymore yes in the state so site user will only change it in the state right here but now we want to delete it in local storage too so let's delete that so we'll say local storage local storage dot what that what remove item user done save that you see now it's going to remove the user from local storage it's going to remove the user from what from where it's going to remove the user from uh let me show you go to motherboard user from the state as well and now it should actually take us back to login page because you know why because here we say if the user does not exist where do we go login you see that's the whole goal so i'm going to go and save this you ready for this bro i'm ready um okay let's also make sure this cursor is also uh make this button a cursor pointer let me go back to header dot js we'll make the user image right here a cursor pointer so i'm going to go scroll all the way down okay we'll make this cursor pointer because to make it a button cursor pointer save that and now are you ready for this bro do it are you ready guys for this are you ready somebody says smash that like button so many times you guys can hear it we're currently holy [ __ ] i still haven't smashed a like button let me smash that [ __ ] it was good 362 likes come on let's go okay guys really quickly now now if i go ahead and if i log out look at this i will click this oh look at this bro it's not back it's not back to login page because we removed the user from the session that is beautiful and all i gotta do is i gotta sign in again to bring the user back into the session i will sign in and we do this again send it one more time let's go ahead and do this close declutter programmer uh no this right here oh how cool is that bro what happens if you log in with a different email instead of the quasiclear programmer you want to test it out let's see it we could we should have an empty chat technically you should i mean no no no no no no the chat oh yeah the chats are the same but there should be a different person but maybe a different interpreter thank you try frankie huh frankie should we try frankie yeah let's try frankie sorry frankie oh frankie lacone is right here you see this so this works yes works guys this works so now currently we're franklin guys everybody give a shout out to frankie like an amazing guy who is behind the scenes doing so many amazing stuff he's literally not behind this he's just behind the scenes yes so that is so so cool man i am actually really really really pumped away are we all good with the with the thing the live call wait we're 60 bucks donations bro wow now we get two coffees thank you guys so yeah i know there's some expensive coffees man oh my amazing amazing cool all right we've got the login functionality we got the logo personally tell us let us know comments guys if you're still pumped with us if you're still with us right now and if you're coding if you want to go on and see the next thing and of course to go on we want to make sure we see 400 likes because if we don't see 400 likes we don't go on i'm sorry hey sorry i thought it wasn't gonna be that loud all right let's go ahead and get to this all right quickly we've got the login we've got the log out now the big question becomes this it actually becomes this chat right here okay okay is we now should be able to switch different chats because currently we're only one charcoal clever clever right we should be able to get different chats based on where we are we want to be because you want to go to different rooms like testing or team nas and daniel right okay okay for sure for sure so to make this work a few things kind of need to happen um by the way so let's think about this one is i need to be able to get one chat or i actually need we need to be able to link these channels right here these channels to different chats you see these how do we link them pretty simple let's go back to our sidebar sidebar okay let's go to our sidebar here oh not here save that go to a sidebar okay sidebar the sidebar has what the channels right here to go ahead and link them we're going to create a function called go to channel let's do this right here so we'll say const go to channel right there okay go to channel okay good go to channel and what's going to happen now is we're going to pass in an id into this channel okay watch this with this i will say if id exists as if we pass an id of the channel we will go ahead and do this something something called history so in um in the what's it called in the react router dom router dom we have some something called history guys dumb history history right there the history object the history object guys is what allows us history object is what allows us to be able to actually basically go from one page go from one page to another page to another page and so forth that's what kind of how react kind of allows us to do that now there's multiple ways to do it this is one no this is our way that we're going to do this today okay so let's do this right now let's go back to here okay good good good we'll do we'll use the history from react router down so we'll say import import let's see import import use history use history from we'll say react dash router dash dom boom right there react react broader down okay and then what we'll do is we'll say history we'll say here we'll say we'll say const it's just so initialize the history we'll get the history cons history is history is equal to use history use history right there okay boom okay cool then we'll say the following we'll say the following we'll say history.push history.push dot push right there instead push and we'll give it a a link now how are we going to get them like explain to me daniel well we want to uniquely identify these channels yes how um well if i remember correctly i think in the firebase database you have some sort of unique identifier for these channels correct so if we go look at our database you see we have an actual by the way i don't know if you guys see but we actually have two different people now inside the authentication side of firebase which is pretty cool but yeah you can see we have multiple people who have signed in yeah that's pretty cool right awesome awesome so if we now go to our fire store okay go to firestore you have all these rooms and you can see all these unique ideas these are ideas of rooms so we can identify each room by its individual id you see now to make that work with react with our page what's going to happen is we're going to we're going to take them to in a room so we'll say room we'll go dash room dash and we'll provide the id of the room like so now the way this works is similar to like any other for example like kind of like you know i have a url right here says material icons you see here for example right material icons right it's a url with a unique identifier unique key to that page same thing is going to happen here okay this is going to happen with this room make sense yep cool now check this out so we'll take him to this room id right here this room id and now we need to call this go to channel function from somewhere how well that's going to happen when we go to the channel so if we go to channel we'll say on click on click right here no not add channel unclick we'll actually go ahead and do the following we'll say unclick choo choo choo choo okay and we'll call the function go to channel i'm gonna make sure i get it right so go to channel go to channel guys right there and click go to channel and what are we going to pass into the go to channel function should we pass in the id yes because the item we get the name but we also get the id so we'll say item dot id right here and now we have basically we can create this url that's going to be unique so that we know what channel we're talking about exactly comprende good so let's think about this okay if i go ahead and i will go ahead and i'll console log the id for you guys so i'll say console.log.log that log id right there okay okay d good all right so we got that let's save that next up let's go and inspect element let's do console okay and if i now click for example clever programmer boom you see it's changed the url right here you see this url with the id of clever programmer and we have the id that we get inside the go to channel function boom right there now of course nothing really changes here because why it's all static right now it's all static right now of course that's not rafikaze it's not rafael well who was her name amanda what was her name i don't know amanda something yeah amanda amanda the the the slack the slack clone uh presenter presenter presenter i think i like that the genius the genius exactly so now of course now we need to go back to the routes let's go back to other gs guys and inside the routes to see how we currently accept the room well this is where we need to be a little bit smarter now if we go to app.js okay we need to be able to accept the room with the id so we'll say like this will say slash and we'll say we expect to get back a channel id channel id right here okay and that will allow us to make this chat company okay we got that now however if we do not have a channel id meaning we just go straight to some kind of random into a a a to what's it called to a uh a a root url mmhmm what shall we do maybe we should tell them that hey you need to select the channel or if you don't have anything create a channel yes so we'll do it we'll do route we'll do route and we'll say the path for the route is going to be let's say the route so path is escape the root if they go to simply just a root url right here we'll say here what we'll say select or create channel select or create or create channel now by the way this is something that nas i don't know if you've remembered to mention yesterday but whenever you have your routes which one has to be the last one the last one always has to be the route always because initially we will check whichever one is kind of like uh abides by the rule whichever one fits the rule so will this one fit will someone else put and the root is always the last one because the rule the rule will kind of fit everything i mean make sense okay good so we got that now if we go to our chat look at this if i go you see this is still good you see the rule is still good right but if i go ahead and let's say i go ahead and just simply go to room right here if i go to the room boom see it says select or create channel guys select or create channel and so i simply go to clutter programmer and boom now i'm on the channel and boom different channel different different different different and that's it that's it that's it that's it good okay good so guys well wait guys hope you're doing it well i hope you're going doing great let's go ahead and get to 400 likes be according to 376 likes while we eat the months while we eat some gummy bears okay let's make sure we get those 2 400 400 likes bro not sponsored these are the snacks oh yeah we're not sponsored let me show you the back they only have nutrition facts bro i don't know so hold on so a little bit of explanation guys to you while we drink so let's get some water okay beautiful okay now at this point really quickly let's go ahead and change something when we're going to click on the channel we should be in different channel would you agree with me outside yes yes so let's go do this if i now go to chat.js you see this chat the channel name is actually here so how do we change that bro we need to pass it in as a prop correct but also we need to create a function called get channel i'll do this what's this we'll say const get channel is equal to what guys 400 likes and we will go ahead and dance come on 381 likes come on let's go let's get to 390. like that button right there come on guys you know smash that like button defeat the youtube algorithm you guys we're delivering a ton of value we are working so hard me and dan this guy this guy's almost dying we're almost dying i'm done but i'm doing it for you guys i'm here for you guys so let's go ahead and smash that like button we are working all so hard to make sure that we provide this to you because we want to teach you to the best possible way out there right you want to be the best the best community out there and we are the best community out there at this point so that's going to hold the goal awesome let's go ahead okay cool cool cool so get channel what's going to happen get channel is we will go ahead and use a database to get the channel information about it but so we'll say this we'll say this what's up db the collection now of course need to actually import the b so we need to say import db from where from where our db file which is firebase all right so we'll say from firebase so say dot dot slash we'll say firebase and again the reason why we said is because chat is inside components right here and the firebase is actually outside of components firebase file is actually inside outside the component so dot dot is like hey go outside the components folder and then go inside here does that make sense cool all right so that that will give us the db also db.collection right here and we'll get the rooms collection remember how i said the collection was like a notebook okay collection rooms to do rooms right here rooms okay and inside there we'll give it provided a room id dock some id but of course we don't have the id where because where's the id is it in the database it's in the url oh it's in the url the id is actually in the url so what react butter does for us is we actually can get 30 so say let's for example channel id look at this guys we'll say channel id is equal to is equal to pay attention here real quickly use params params now where does this come from this comes from react router dom use prem so i'll go ahead and copy this here it comes from regular dom use params it's a function that comes with react to router dom which we'll go ahead and look at the the the id here okay look at the id here and because if we go to app.js we define this to be channel id it will directly map this right here this string to the channel id variable like look at that you see right there and so now if we go to right there if we go to chat.gs we can use that we can say get parameter channel id because we know we mapped it correctly all right good and now we can say channel id channel id cool and then we'll say oh that's good you good some reason it's just not it kind of does not show up somebody okay so doc dot on snapshot dot on snapshot okay basically a picture of the current channel so it's kind of like it's taking like a it's like it's kind of like taking a snapshot of the current channel id of the current channel and then what's going to happen is we will very simply just go ahead and we'll get the data so we'll say on snapshot we'll get the snapshot right here we'll get snapshot snap shot boom right there snapshot snapshot and we'll now do is we'll now set the channel data but how do we set the general data well for one we can do console.log let's see this for now we'll say console.log here we'll say the following we'll say console.log snapshot snapshot dot data check this out guys okay now okay let's do console.log let's do and let's do get channel here get let's go ahead and call this function actually we'll call this function all right so look at this now this we have the channel id let's go ahead and right click inspect download this console and what do we have oh we have an object and look at this here's a channel goona why do we name it do we need that and if i change it now look at this if i change it now we have travel you see team nas team nas and daniel what i'm just driving because i'm i don't remember those channels i don't remember them either honestly i don't know why you think someone's back in there i don't know whatever programmer is in the other one of course as well okay guys that's the really cool part about this so that's what happened right you can channel but of course now what needs to happen is we need to go ahead and call the get channel function whenever we do what whenever we go ahead and actually just simply change the channel id so what we do is we use something called use effect we do comma let's use user effect use effect effect right there use effect okay and inside here was to do this was i use effect use effect okay this is a function and the way it's going to work is pretty simple guys check this out okay what's going to happen is we will now change the channel id so this will listen for changes in the channel id of the params whenever the param of the channel id changes meaning we click on a different channel so now this changes boom it's going to fire whatever whatever you put in here that's that's the really really kind of like like this this is why use effect is so important like so important super duper okay cool all right inside here is the user effect of course whenever we change the channel id we will do the get channel function digital function okay and i'll just go ahead and do this and i will do let's inspect element cool cool cool cool all right object this is the object wheels get channel if i go ahead and click team daniel oh let's go oh testing ooh challenge guys how cool is that okay that's awesome next up we now need to use that data the snapshot data somehow well we can use use state so we'll say cons channel and we'll save the data inside the state i'll say set channel say channel okay and we'll make it equal to use state state and of course we need to import state so it's going to use state and we'll import state in here so we'll say comma use state guys use state okay comprende good all right and inside here now whenever we get the data instead of doing console.log we'll do set channel set channel snapshot.data boom right there and now this chat.js component will have what daniel the data the data it will have the channel state right here the channel that we set in here you see and we can use that now by doing it go hashtag instead of doing clever we say channel now what name name so now guys are you ready for this bro yes do it dude look at that travel react testing guna gonna i think it's gonna dude travel all right look at this you see it changes based on what on whatever the url is guys and what we select let's get us to 400 likes for this amazing edition of a feature guys we are currently at 395 likes can we get to 300 400 bro i think so i think we can i'm uh what oh we lost like oh come on guys someone's messing with us got it 396 okay 26 398 guys 398 ready wait wait wait for this ready for this bro thank you guys so much oh and we are at thank you so much for the 400 400 let's go 400 likes that is what i'm talking about i know i'm gonna i'm gonna drop it right later on we'll drop it later on later on later on later on okay cool what are snapshot for great questions so a snapshot right here so let's go back to uh here a snapshot is how we get the data of this channel individually okay snapshot is basically saying on this on the picture kind of like um snapchat is almost like do we have the book the piece of paper no we don't okay snapchat is like let's say you had that book right you had that book guys okay i took a picture of that book i took a picture of that book and it has the data of the current date and time okay has that data that's a snapshot a snapshot basically is the data of that channel that's it that's all it is the data of that channel and whenever the thing is why the reason why you say on snapchat is because whenever the snapshot changes meaning we maybe we modify something whenever it changes we actually will go ahead and this be called again and the set channel will be modified as well you see that yep cool so that hopefully explains a little bit about the about the channel okay cool all right now we got the channel we are currently going through all the different channels but what but what's the big thing that's missing bro we're still missing all of the conversations from a channel the messages right here the messages this is the big part this is the the big thing this is the the main portion of the slack the meat the meat the potatoes the potatoes and we need to make it work okay you ready okay i'm ready okay so let's get to messages guys right now all right for the messages let's go back to firebase and here's the thing every single the way we're going to save a message is pretty simple every single channel in here is so you have a scene fire in firebase you see that right there testing guna testing right there and so forth we will go ahead and do for every channel we'll have a collection called messages okay so let's do this we'll start collection we'll say messages messages collection that's right here okay cool next and inside here every message now inside the messages collection every message will now have some sort of data well look at this it will have things like for example let me go ahead and share this with you it will have things like for example text text so this is for example let's say text message that's the value okay it will have a field like for example well a user so let's say for example this is a rafikazee it will also have something like a user image so it's a user image right here user image and that may be an image so for example an image of qazi might be let's say this is frankie let's go back to here we'll right click on this we'll copy image address and we'll pay to put into here okay sorry frankie rafikaze is going to be frankie so that's fine and then what we'll do is we'll have a timestamp so do timestamp is when somebody added this specific that specific thing understand yes oh okay next up thank you for the 400 yes thank you so much so timestamp and the timestamp is actually going to be a timestamp value right here guys so this out timestamp value let's do it today so we'll go ahead and select it today as well and we'll just save okay and you can see that now this react challenge uh collection uh channel now has a collection of messages inside of it where every message there's a list of messages are going to be saved in here you see yep yes okay good now the question because is our first goal right now is to get the messages how do we make that work well let's go back to our react application let's go back to our right here chat and let's create a function called what called get messages so what we'll do is we'll just if you have a get channel we'll say const get messages right here is ecotool function boom okay get messages and then sorry come on let me get the water once i can guess inside here now we'll use the db that collection to get a message so here's what we'll do we'll do db the collection just like we did before give you the collection rooms okay we'll select the individual room so we'll say dot dock and we'll here we'll do channel id just how we've done it before channel id you see that right there yes channel id okay now within that room channel we have more what the chat more chats so we have more now collection so we'll say dot collection right it's like almost like having a book within a book you see what i mean it's like a book within a book so you're getting one book which is the rooms then getting another book called messages within that book you see so let's try that that collection and now we'll say here we'll say messages messages and this will and then we'll order the messages order by so say order by order by time step ascending so we'll go from the the last one to the newest one so we'll say we'll do order by we'll say time stamp comma and we'll say ascending asc okay and again here we're going to use the on snapshot portion we'll say on snapshot boom just how did for every single one boom boom boom boom boom boom boom we'll have the snapshot in here order by that order by that order by dot on snapshot snap shot right here snapshot right here beautiful okay and with this one this is what we now will go ahead and just save the messages now where will we save the messages bro where we say oh gotcha gotcha in the snapshot.data yes that's where we get the data but how are we going to save this data in the state or in the component oh we're going to put in the state exactly i give you the answer bro so i'll say cons let's tell them bro comments right here we'll say messages messages comma set messages so again we'll say the messages in the state okay is equal to what is equal to use state and we'll initialize it with just an empty array okay initialize that's a default value okay and whenever we go ahead and now on the snapshot we'll do the following we'll say send messages set messages messages actually let's go ahead and do this we'll say let let messages is equal to snapshot dot docs dot map and the map is again is going to loop through every single message okay and we'll go ahead and get a doc right there doc doc and will return to us doc dot data so doctor data about that message makes sense comprehending yes good that will be the message and what's going to happen now we do send messages you will now pass it into the state right here so we'll say messages oh right there okay and now when we the question becomes is where do we call this get messages function what do you think you get messages function is going to be called whenever we go into the channel we want to get the messages so we could display them yes exactly so here whenever you see how whenever we change the channel channel id well we get the channel why not get the messages as well hey so we go ahead and we'll do we get get messages right here we save that portion in the get messages function boom save that and now if we go to here let's go ahead and do do refresh and we have a name of undefined let's see so canary property name of undefined that could be interesting for some reason let me see name name name channel name let's remove this for now okay that's fine that's fine so color programmer so let me see so get channel get messages that's fine let me try one more time channel that name channel set channel function inside here okay do it one more time all right that works i think there's a glitch or something i think there might be money but glitch or something like that maybe we forgot to reload i'm not sure but anyways so look at this now of course we now had the messages so if i go ahead and console log let's go into console.log the log messages guys messages what's going to happen because all the messages i will do right click and we'll do inspect them on here okay console look array of zero no messages here but if i go to clever programmer oh you see well now send no messages why do we have a message by the way which one we haven't made any messages we did react challenge oh okay look at that right there let's go you see that right there timestamp text messages the message that we sent and the user image bro how sick is that everything we need everything we need now so we got these messages in here okay great now to show them in here all we do is we loop through them man yeah because we already set up the component to take it on and make it pretty like that let's go ahead and look for them so we got the messages right here in the bottom of the chat let's go and loop through them and actually show them so here's what i'll do in the message content where do we have the message content right here message container yeah mr container i will go ahead and do this i will create a function i'll not function but i will say if the messages if there are messages so say message.length is greater than zero zero okay and so this is actually a shortcut guys we'll do messages the map we're going to loop through every single message right here okay and then that's weird no no no no this is weird remember how we did the one chat message this is where we now go ahead and use the chat message you see how we had that static check message but now we use that chat message when we loop through every single message so here we'll save data yeah of course we're going to use the index here for a second here but by the way do you understand what this means this means right here the first part this portion right here basically you want to make sure that there's actually messages inside of this mesh message list correct and then from there you're going to start to iterate through all of those correct make create chat message components from that correct the way this works guys is pretty simple when basically what this end is kind of almost like um if saying is if this is true then we execute this basically that's what this is going it's like a shortcut okay so basically if the length of messages is greater than zero meaning we have messages then we will loop through them and actually show them make sense otherwise we won't show them at all okay cool so the chat message now of course if i save this okay if i save this granted nothing pretty much i'm gonna do this again oh come on every single time come on channel that name i think it's because get channel let me see channel oh i know why because i need to do this guys if i say you do is say channel because it needs to exist yes there you go there cool because sometimes it's called the risk condition sometimes the channel does not exist yet but you know it loads kind of later on that's the whole goal that's why so look at this we have now this if i go to travel you see this it doesn't exist but a photograph challenge exists because that's where one of those messages are but it's just the problem is what is the problem now it's not displaying what we want to display still displaying the old static information exactly well this is where we can pass in the props of that data so remember what did the data have well the data had a few things well if you go to data data had text and so forth so we'll do do we'll do this we'll say text is equal to data what text okay then we have what image name i think right then we have user or name go go into the we have user so we'll say name is equal to data dot what user next we have what image say image is equal to what data dot user image user image okay cool and the last one is which one time time stamp so say time time stamp is equal to what data [Laughter] he's working very hard you know so data timestamp okay and we pass all those into the chat message you see so chat message right there cool how do we you know get that from here daniel well since they're props we got a little prop guy there but we'll unfold the props like this yeah so here we'll say what do we say text come what name comma what image image come what time time stem all right all right so now we get the time stamp right there time step okay and now we can replace this stuff like this so it's now rafael khanzi look at this bro change this to name coffee rossi what what i mean put that name in there which one where i was messing around it's not rafikaze i was like it's coffee rust the text now goes here guys should this out text now goes here and look at this by the way if we go and look at this right now oh let's go rafa costa coffee rossi and a text message that's the message that we put in where in the database oh right there bro right there that's so beautiful okay let's now go ahead and change this image right here we'll change this image to also now contain what to contain uh the image url the image url so let me cut i think so image image so we'll say here jsx i'll say image image as well so let's go ahead and refresh this oh let's go that is amazing okay cool next up what's going to happen now let's go ahead and change this time step that's the only thing i need to do so channel message one second hold on message wait maybe i'm a little confused what shouldn't that be the rafikaze image no because we set it manually inside okay we we yeah yeah yeah yeah that's why that's why all right so yeah but we probably should change it later on okay for now frankie frankie could be kazi for now yes temporarily okay i think he will find so here's we'll do we'll use this time set the one we'll use this time to is pretty simple we'll do like this we'll we'll do a new date okay and we'll do no not like this we'll do a new date like this or is the function a new date that's the function that kind of comes with javascript no date not new data and then we'll do a timestamp we'll pass in a timestamp right here and we'll do the dot to date to convert to a date because right now it's just a string and we'll do to date and actually let me see i think that's pretty much it let me see if i save that all work all work oh my god oh my god if you meant order collection the thing is said send messages they'll react child i think has to do something with the date you see this date right here so time step dot to date i think i need to convert it to a ut let me think about this let's see dot 2 utc string there we go so this made it into an object but we need to convert to a string like this right here see gotcha come printing so we got that look at this we have all this we have the master so now if i go ahead and add a new message here let's go let's say if i change a message here say yo ready update cafe rossi oh let's go guys that is awesome that is sick holy moly we are so close to being done to fully finishing oh oh frank in the house right here come on frankie also good to see him oh yeah hold on just let me get these two okay what up everybody hold up okay cool so no guys who is bomb with us who's ready to find to create the last portion of the slack thumb drop it down the comments below and we'll get it done you ready bro yes yes what are we doing i know you're telling me we are gonna crush this slack club and that's not the right way to do it no so guys the last part that we need to do is very simple all of this works right here okay the last part is actually the input we now need to be able to allow everybody's like we already know let's go we now need need to be able to to what send a message that's it that's the main goal now okay so let's go and send the message are you ready for this bro i oh um hey dude my neck is sword it's your fault but not mine all right guys all right let's go get in by get into it here all right so we get the text message in here that's amazing that's all awesome um now let's go back to the chat this is where now we will go ahead and actually and actually control how we submit and how we send a message to the chat okay if we go to the chat input right here let's go to chat input that's a chat the chat has a form okay the chat form when you click submit we need to go ahead and actually send the send data to to our database okay now what's going to happen is if you go back to chat.js we can actually do that by creating a function called what what was the question i was reading the comments over here send a message so we need to create a function called bad student bad student fast student daniel guys everybody called daniel best student all right so send message is the function that we will create now at this point all right this send message function will pretty simple simple it will take an input of text in text okay text right here ah no not this text right here so text is what we will get okay cool text right here awesome inside this text okay look at this inside this text what we will do is we will add this to db the collection of images so here's what we'll do if it will say this if channel is so currently if we are currently at channel so if channel id exists okay if channel id channel id okay good then we will go ahead and add the what's called the uh the text so let's kind of first thing we want to do is create something called a payload a payload is what you will kind of like um i know how you have a payload for a trailer right it's like a it's some you know it's a box where it might be or a rocket a rocket okay fine all right rockets have payloads that you send to fuel pillar right fuel well we also have a payload we will send back to database and that payload guys is actually the data of the text message so let's do this we'll go ahead and say the following it could remove this all right if channel id will say let payload is equal to an object in our case audio will have a few things the first one is going to have a text so the text is the actual text we'll say text and we're going to pass in the text that we pass in from the send message function but there okay so this right here will come in from here okay cool next up we'll do user we'll say user is equal to how do we get the user now um we will pass in the user we're passing the user where but the user is currently inside where the app.js inside here we need to pass in the user back to chat as well so if we go ahead go to chat you see we'll say user is equal to user right there see now if i go to chad.js okay yes and i will accept the user as a prop and i will i'll go ahead and i will unbind it so i'll say user right here i can also i can now also inside here where is it say user user.what name i think right or user and username that's what we did right let me go check it check it out to make sure it's all good let me share let's go to login yeah user dot name right there user dot name that's something we want to use correct let's go to chat.yes good user dot name that's going to use and then for the photo image for the user image image image we'll say user that what folder image photo photo name correct so we'll create that payload and the last thing to do is we need to create a timestamp so timestamp timestamp is the time of when we will go ahead and edit the database now the way we do this is actually you see some using fires to fire base what's going to happen is go ahead let's go ahead and import firebase we'll say import import firebase from from where firestore from firebase right here ah firebase right here okay cool let me see uh and it's by the token oh that's fine oh timestamp because why and what's going to happen is you will use the firebase firestore timestamp let's do firebase dot firestore dot timestamp right there dot now this is a time set that comes directly from firebase so if i go ahead and do this let's say firebase firebase uh timestamp right there right there see this gives us a way to actually get let me see this one let me show it to you i want to show it to you here for a second for one second right there firebase that fires up the time step the timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or calendar represented as seconds and fractions of a second or 90 seconds in utc that's why it's so important got it perfect cool and that's exactly what we're going to use so comma in here comma and that's what we will pass so let's do console.log the log and we'll do send message so uh the payload so payload is what we will pass in now check this out guys let me show you with this payload how do we now save this payload to database we have to uh save it to the collections so we will do db dot collection and we'll give it what rooms collection and then we have to get the chat we have to pass in the channel yeah so we have dog correct oh damn look at that bro oh come on i gotta hide it from you that what collection collections okay of what of messages right of messages right there of messages and this is where we now add the pillow do that add the what payload right there payload pay load and that's it and that is pretty much it we add the pillow and that is it my friend got it going right there boom that is it so you be the collection of rooms like dog channel id collection messages so basically we're getting the rooms we're getting the current channel we're getting the messages from the current channel and we're adding a new text a new message to that payload to that channel make sense beautiful good all right now the question becomes is how do we call this function where where we're gonna call it whenever we do the on submit hey let's go you see you can throw a payload exactly exactly now we call and submit inside the chat input that means that inside the chat input we actually need to call the send message function so we'll pass in that function inside here so send message is equal to send a message i'll pass it a function into the component itself i will go to chat input in the chat input i will accept that component or that function by saying send message and now look at this this is where guys we are so close you have no idea like literally like almost like five minutes away from fully finishing this application man i'm not kidding this is exciting it's exciting man this is exciting just comes in like funny clicks we have all these between the css the html and it finally comes together to this point right now all right let's watch this really quickly all right so i am pumped all right if we go ahead and go to check input right there i will create a function here called send consent this function is pretty simple this function will be called by the button itself right here right there okay the button itself the send button is what we'll call when i unclick when i do unclick of this button okay on this button what's going to happen is pretty simple i will say unclick and i will say send send it send it send it now the button by default actually passes in what passes in the event like this this event will actually refresh the page and we do not want that to happen okay so so we want to do we will do e dot prevent default to prevent the refresh of the page right there and this is where we go ahead and do send message we call the send message that we get from the chat right here now the question becomes is what do we pass in what text do we pass in would it be the text from the payload yes well yes and no this is where we have to keep track guys i don't know just daniel this guy just like you know he's like he's feeding but you know i don't know so look so this is where we need to keep track of our input again i'm going to create a state called const input input input set input right here input this will allow us to keep track of what we're currently typing look at this let's say use state and for now i will say nothing i will say it's an empty string then what's going to happen is unchanged what happens here you state oh you said i defined you need to import it here so you state we'll say user state you state okay brando why not all good oh good oh good oh god you stay awesome and what's going to happen now at this point is is pretty simple is we will now go ahead and we will on the change of the input whenever we type we'll do unchange on change what are you laughing at [ __ ] the comments but i pay attention i love it dude i think i already failed man how do you feel bro oh my god unchanged we'll pass on the e that's so that's what happens when we get input okay we'll pass in the e right here e right here and we'll d we'll set the input here because why daniel because it's on the event no guys what do you think daniel deserves for this give it a b c d e d or f in terms of great guys let me know but then but then grade me on my djing and dancing skills and i'll be happy i'll be happy let's grade him on this on his skills oh my god it's funny so here we'll do this okay we'll see you've got the answer right there bro set input right and this is where here's the thing on the change right the input itself has an e value this is called an event and the event contains something called e dot target that value right there right there you take that value and so we will do is we will change this input right here every single time that we change the input as we type make sense yep good good good i'm i'm curious so what people are saying yeah people are backing me up they're like don't bully him let's go okay thank you so much i appreciate that come on guys come on you guys are way too nice to him no no no no no but i did get lots of d's and f's yeah but it's all good some people give me a for both so i appreciate that awesome so when we send a message now all we simply do bro look at this bro see that's it because we're here we change the input right here you see as we type and then we send the message we simply now send it and that is pretty much it now of course if the input does not exist we'll say this if not if there's no input it basically if the text is nothing we'll say return basically we stop fully we stop fully but here the send message input let me just call it that message function make sense make sense okay good good good good now the last thing we need to do guys is pretty simply simple okay we need to call this right here send button we need to make this a submit button here why because we want to send it when someone submits and presses the button no oh man no because the submit button is what will allow us to hit the enter here's the thing when you make a type of submit button it will also it will also call it when you hit enter that's the big difference here okay so i will have her type is equal to equal to what submit in here submit guys okay submit okay now i was thinking about this okay so let's go ahead and refresh this okay and this is the button right here tab submit now of course if we go to send button we actually need to call it a button so instead of a there needs to be a button button okay now see how you see how it became a button let's remove the hideous border around it border none thank god okay good okay good so look we have the unclick we have the set input bro we're almost ready i think it's time to send it i think it's time excited time to send let's go thanks edison i think it's time i think it's time it's time it's time let's go let's go so look guys are you ready for this bro i am ready so guys what's going to happen we will go ahead we will hit here as you click submit as you click submit as you click send it will call this send function right here this send function you see this function will prevent default meaning it will not go it will not refresh the page it will then call the send message function with the input that provided okay then the in some message function will go actually back up right here because that's where we pass it in it will go back up to the app.js actually now the chat.js check the gs because where the same other send message is actually here it will be called then where inside here and here we'll save it where in the payload as ready let's go so at this point refresh hit enter let's go ready oh [ __ ] all right timestamp of undefined oh my gosh oh my god i know i know damn it so much ah okay we're close we're close don't worry we're close this is a small hiccup okay no nothing nothing with have it comes easy sometimes okay so that's okay so we'll go to let me see go to chat ah what happened what just happened oh i hit it hold on oh my gosh oh my god indeed hold on hold on i got this guys f3 brother hold on what is f3 oh it's gone oh man did you close it did i close it actually ah we're so close come on open integrate turn that's fine oh man no it's here it's working it's working and no it's working it's just because it's closed oh no it's there let's go oh my gosh that was close guys that was close that was insane okay cool so here's what we'll do here's what we'll do i'm going to go i will go to my chat gs check the gs okay i'll look at my firebase firestore i think i know why that's the case i think it's because the chat actually let me see oh because i need to import firebase from firebase module that's why firebase module that's why ah right guys are you ready now on the drop of the drop ready ready ready i think it'll work i think it'll win this time ready and three two it worked man it works let's go we're liking this franken he doesn't even know it [Laughter] that's me i'm the guy in the display picture guys oh that's the frankie guy right there that's so oh oh [ __ ] it is you bro [Laughter] okay cool guys okay awesome so does this hit naz no it's not it holy [ __ ] okay it's not that sorry but we're almost there almost there guys okay almost there so here we've got the messages guys if you are still with me let's go if you are excited for what's happening here let us know in the comments below give us a thumbs up give us a fire give us a rocket emoji if you have to if you can now one last thing i want to do i want to go to chat input after i go ahead and type something out i want to refresh it i want to go take it back to its original state so we'll say send message input and the last thing is going to be then that set input to nothing it's nothing right there because i want to refresh what i was in here i'm going to refresh it back to its normal state okay so for example here it makes sense hello right i hit enter you see now it doesn't refresh it but i need to refresh it so we'll go ahead and refresh this refresh it here let me see let me see give us some time to to think come on come on come on come on come on come on hey there we go beautiful hello yo it is not refreshed just yet for some reason why is that because i think because if we go to missy uh chat input let me see i had the issue before actually oh i know why because now i need to make this input the value of the input so say value is equal to input right here so whatever the value of this input that's it's being controlled by that's what could control the value of this input so now if i go ahead and say uh i am here i'm here oh look at that oh but you see an issue now whoa whoa whoa whoa oh what are you doing you see nation now though yeah i see biggest issue you see how now this is actually expanding everything you see that right there so we need to stop that from expanding what do we do in that case we're gonna have to use a flexbox oh yes we will but actually it's pretty much done for us guys look at this the only thing we need to do is check this out if i go to chat input chat.gs which is here let me go contr remove this all i gotta say guys because we have the auto i gotta give this a height of zero it's a little bit weird to understand why this is happening but if i do min height zero i'm going to refresh this whoa where'd it go oh there it is oh no did not work so it did not work oh man that's not good okay so to do that let me just think about this here so chat oh actually i know why so chat right here i have to go to message container okay then i have to set give the message container i have to give it a display flex that's gonna do this i'll do this we'll say display flex boom display flex okay we'll say what we'll say flex direction flex direction column direction column column and then what's going to happen is we'll give it an overflow y wow it can overflow and we get a little scrolling scrolling exactly and there we go wait no that does not work damn it fudge what are we missing here um we're missing something here flash direction column overflow y scroll main height of zero that's exactly what i have in there main content min height and height of zero let me see let's think about this so what is preventing this from doing that i'm just curious huh is it max height or min no it's min height of zero but i think most importantly it might because of the be the fact off let me think about this display flags that's so good that's no problem here great below 64 ottoman content that's fine here min height of zero that's fine as well do you think maybe because we need to set okay i think i know why in that case i think because as they would have the gs i need to go here yeah let's go to here app.gs inside here this is where the difference becomes instead of auto we actually need to give it a uh it's it's kind of like one fr four well one for real one for real yeah so we have min max zero comma one f4 right there see whoa so this is a little bit odd it's a little bit odd the way this kind of works it what what scroll all the way down brother what the heck who did this yo let's go wait how i told you not to show it i did not show the damn firebase thing we got from no come on man yo jake chyna you got us man no oh my god what i could i hate the thing guys all right all right this is good what about the other channels just that channel how bro i don't understand how i literally don't understand how that's possible i don't know how it's possible bro oh you gave it away somewhere man i know it's so funny guys anyways guys so look min max zero one of our basically this is the same ski it's saying that right here this is called one free space so this right here saying that take up only one the maximum you want to take up is the minimum will take up is zero the maximum you can take up is just one free space does that make sense because before when auto auto it kind of changes up what right here so auto uh when you do auto here it actually it actually kind of uh makes it to where um it fills up however much the content fills up but free space only fills up the free space however the free space is you see what i mean so if there's only this much free space it will fill up this free space it will not fill up the content oh man look at this bro loves you i mean technically we know who it is right because i mean thank you check china yeah yeah china i appreciate you appreciate it but j china please do not spam anymore appreciate if you love us please don't spam i don't know how you got this id i don't know how you got access to this but this is not i dude i don't know man but do not understand when your mother loves you how is this possible bro anyways guys so at this point we are pretty much done guys we have finished our app it is a doing everything you possibly can i can say yo jack china yo yo we can jake china get in the react challenge and let's have a conversation yo jake how are this you talk to us now guys this is the real life uh chat that we're talking about before exactly guys exactly so jaychan is like hey gentlemen it loves you okay now go back to the react one where we were talking this one can you make it to where it goes to the bottom by the way uh not yet okay oh he just he just continuously say oh he just made more channels hey channel how many how many how many plenty is there's plenty of love and what's going on we love the love brother appreciate it man i know should we share this link bro should we okay so guys that's it pretty much the last thing we need to do is pretty simple and that's gonna do is you need to host this data this uh this uh application okay so you want to host it so you could share with your friends everyone can jump in and log in and start chatting correct i will actually go ahead and stop the writing oh okay oh come on jake china did you delete everything hold on there's only one way i can stop this bro all right let's only want i can stop this all right jake ruined the fun for everyone thank you jake we're gonna share with everybody but not anymore publish god damn why why all right so oh man look what he did no i stopped it too i think you did that before you stopped it are you serious yeah um it's all good man let's just keep moving let's keep moving jake said stop it that's it okay so cool guys so we got that specific portion as you can see jake channel loves us which is amazing uh thank you so much jake chyna um thank you for the love and everything [Laughter] all right last thing guys is firebase firebase hosting let's do this right now let's go to data let's go to hosting in here okay let's go to get started okay this tells us exactly what we go ahead and need to do pretty simple process here okay if we go ahead and go to our firebase let's go ahead and open up a new terminal and we'll do the following because i'm really currently logged in i will do command k to clear this out i will do firebase log out for myself you don't have to do this right now but do firebase log out log out log out so you don't do this this is only for me because i'm already logged in i will now do firebase log in that's what you need to do firebase login okay i'll offer yes i'll say yes okay good i'll go to the login page this will take you to login page or firebase which is pretty simple okay i will say kaziklarpro.com right here okay i'll click allow and that's it now we are logged in okay good so this is now we are logged in now this what we need to do is we do firebase init so we'll say firebase firebase init that's it okay cool inside firebase name we do our goal is to do hosting so we'll say hosting so press space in the hosting section and press enter okay use an existing project and now your goal is to find an existing project we have i think the one that we currently have is going to be a which one it's going to be a slack clone challenge let me see can we find it select clone challenge this one right here slack clone challenge say this one and click now instead of doing public directory you see at the bottom we will do build directory build click yes click uh no for this one we don't need this and that's it so we're almost there now at this point almost almost there guys check this out now what i want to do is the following i want to go ahead and i'll do um npm npm run build to create a build of our of our application npm run build what this will do is it will take all of our react.js content it will take all this react gs right here all this js folder all this sidebar data everything at the gs and it will put it all into the build photo in here and it will make it all into like one big compiled compiled um kind of like compiled um and minified build application it will have index.html and it will have all the javascript needed so check this out well let's go ahead and doing this look at this i want to show it to you so create the build and here's what happened it created index.html here right here see it created index.html here and you can see how it's very much minified that's what happens when you do npr on build and i created all these javascript files look at this now you can't understand that because again it's all magnified it's all just gonna gibberish right but what happens is the actual code the actual browser understands it fully no problem that's the big difference you see so look at this and now all we do all we do now is pretty simple and once we've done the build we do now firebase right for this bro let's do it deploy [ __ ] all the way and that's it now we deployed the function are you guys ready to see the deployment version but once we deploy i feel like people are just gonna go there and they're just gonna spam the whole thing all right we'll shut it down five is deploy copy this lac clone challenge web app and look at this bro ready bro a a a ready oh firebase hosting set up complete you'll see you'll see this because your host is set up didn't i do it do this though um maybe i should refresh one more time one more time one more time one more time let me see slack clone open uh just to set up another sent to go build something i did firebase upload what do you mean project console says wait for five minutes bro five minutes that's a long time that's a long time we don't have five minutes ain't got no five minutes to wait we move too fast here move so fast so fast i'll do five buzzer plug again firebase deploy hard refresh command f5 doesn't like it i'm curious why homework maybe actually i think i know why cyclone challenge that cloud challenge um is hosting it's like what's on the web app okay it's fine that seems to be good i'm very curious but that's not working but that's okay that's fine all right we'll make it home for you guys okay we'll show you guys how to go and deploy it in the video no problem that was on purpose yeah i'm not sure if that's the case but sometimes it happens that way for some reason i don't know why i mean i mean we can do five minutes basically we can try it one more time let's see firebase is that because i did the right if i removed this right thing the firestore no that would not be it that was not because of that potentially i don't know no let me see it deployed for some people dude it did romney said it deployed for me maybe maybe it's annoying because we switched the the what i'm deployed let me see freaking jake china let's see let's see let's see let's see if i just deploy it happens sometimes i've i've had it happen before for some reason where it just kind of does not do fibers in it again i will do hosting one more time just because i want to ah no fibers in it with their firebase hosting tata let's do uh build what i wanted to put a fire emoji yeah but i put the and the r and the ice triple fry and it's french fries instead oh my god really that's funny that's funny so npm run build one more time yeah some people are saying after they waited a little bit yeah automatically just have to wait a little bit well we could start to take on some questions while we wait and we could try again like a couple so guys at this point let's take a question any questions you have guys because guys pretty much at this point we have finished the app it looks sick it looks amazing oh and then firebase deploy okay let's do one more time ah no it's not we got a quick question now yes what's the question when build and deployed will the hosted codes database have test data that you typed in during the code development phase what does that mean basically the stuff jake china stuff will that be the deployed version yes it will because it's all targeting this database yes yes yes yes yes daniel safer just giving excuses about the emoji he's so too hungry right now no i'm eating all these nuts over here man yeah yeah so this will guys yes we'll have the data that's correct yes all right any any more questions guys any more questions let's see okay doing the build process are no modules included in the build package yes everything is included guys when you include when you build everything right it includes the null modules it includes your your code from from you know from the one that you wrote right it has to include everything because otherwise it just wouldn't work otherwise you know what i mean okay nice can we add animations to our buttons hover effect of course you can make that homework you guys got this you're the developer you can do whatever you want to customize it however you want it okay deadline homework when is that oh what's the next step for the homework more customization or what yes so next step is pretty simple guys for the home right now guys okay for the homework here's what you need me to do okay for the homework let me go and do this okay here's the homework for today okay homework homework right here okay homework number one complete the app the slack lower app clone app that's part one okay okay part two part two is the following you need to go ahead and uh right and upload it and upload it upload it to to airtable we will provide the air table there a table okay this can be your homework okay and then finally part three is you will need you need to give us a testimonial for how this day how this challenge went for you again guys speaking about the prizes the more you engage and the more you do the homework the more it increases your chances of getting one of those special prizes the link provided link provided in the post in post okay in post also very important make sure to post a screenshot post a screenshot of your app app on discord and facebook right tag us again this will be in the under under the homework post homework post right there make sense that is pretty much it so guys go ahead and screenshot this right now squeeze this right now so you guys can go ahead and remember this exactly screenshot it right now you guys have five seconds to screenshot it and of course and that's pretty much it feel the completed slack homes whatever you guys got oh my god bro we're not sponsored by them so we're not going to show the brand but this shit's good at this point guys that's pretty much it so guys what steve's correcting you oh no thank you steve um thank you oh you shall say give shout out to me there you go hey i usually there we go all right two seconds of fame we're over guys okay guys very important guys so tomorrow tomorrow okay we will be talking about how to make a hundred thousand dollar developer don't miss out so really important guys for you tomorrow okay so the homework for tomorrow of course one more thing is i want to add is set a timer for tomorrow an alarm right now everybody right now if you are currently in the call set an alarm 4 11 for 11 am pst this is very important guys very important if you do not come tomorrow you will not be included for the price it's as simple as that you have to be tomorrow at 11 a.m pst we will be talking about how to go ahead how you can make a hundred thousand dollars as a regular developer do not miss out on this everybody understand give it to me right now down below in the comments say that i made an alarm i set an alarm everybody right now i set an alarm put it down in the gut we just got a uh what's it called let's go ah china thanks so much thanks donnie nothing daniel that was fun i like how she said danny she's a danny hey let's go awesome awesome sweetie thank you so much for that and yes to add on to those i mean you guys already have your portfolio you guys already have an amazing slack clone you're customizing going great now you need the road map set that alarm for 11 a.m psc because this roadmap is going to help you to get to six figures okay awesome okay awesome sweet so that is am amazing guys on that pretty much do you guys have any questions guys so of course we need to go ahead and make sure that your project is up there so one thing we'll send you is make sure to deploy your project we'll send you a small instruction on how to deploy for some reason does not work for us i'm not sure why did not work for us i still don't understand it maybe it works now no does not work still that's weird weird weird weird weird weird i don't know why i don't know why is it because hosting ah it's a bit if you want to keep looking into it and then if there's a question that pops up yeah what's the question yeah oh not yet hold on i'm telling these guys question please cause this it says here three files that's why that's like very small files there's nothing there should be a lot more files hmm oh i know why bro yo dixon thank you so much we just got another 10 dollar donation no way yep no comment so no shout outs there but thank you so much and thank you so much appreciate it man we are now at almost 80

just so sick i'll be i'll be pumped for that so amandev asked did you change your mind concerning the dark switch button no did not change my mind i think it's still a great option 100 so i actually i guys i think i know why our firebase did not work why because because here's the thing we built oh we made a build folder inside here inside source file because i was inside the source when i did fibers deploy look at this i need to do cd dot dot slash look at this this now will this this will work no problem i now do this okay got it this makes sense now okay cool i now do firebase.init dot init okay five is that in it okay that's fine hosting this will now work guys hosting ah should one more time that init this now will work 100 i know it yo so while not doing this shout out to kp
