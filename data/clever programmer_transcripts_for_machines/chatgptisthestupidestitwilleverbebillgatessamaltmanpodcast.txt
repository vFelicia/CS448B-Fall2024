Sam Alman the founder of open Ai and Bill Gates sit down and have a conversation about Ai and chat GPT and these AI models and right before we jump into the reaction I do want to say that if you want to use Ai and chat GPT and learn how to make money with it I've put together a free 19minute training below that shows you three app ideas that you could get started with today how to build apps with the I Chad GPT and do this even if you're a complete beginner this training will show you all completely free click the link below and sign up for the free training that said let's jump straight into the video right now I guess the we're looking a lot of productivity improvement from AI which you know that's overwhelmingly a very good thing which areas are you most excited about yeah so first of all I always think it's worth remembering that we're just sort of on this long continuous curve um so like right now we have an we have ai systems that can do tasks they certainly can't do jobs but they can do tasks and there's a productivity gain there eventually they'll be able to do more things that we think of like a job today um and so just some clarity there I think tasks are fix this specific coding bug job is be a developer for the company Chad GPT can't be a developer for the company right now it can't like think for you and do things for you automatically on its own it needs to be constantly prompted and assigned tasks that's kind of what you do when you have like an intern at your company you give them tasks but then when you have somebody who's a fulltime employee and can take over a lot of the responsibility that's a job well of course find new jobs and better jobs and I totally believe that if you give people way more powerful tools it's not just they can work a little faster they can do qualitatively different things and so you know right now maybe we can speed up a programmer 3x is about what we see I me that's one of the categories that we're most excited about it's it's working super super well but if you make a programmer three times more effective it's not just that they can write they can do three times more stuff it's that they can at that higher level of abstraction using more of their brain power they can now think of totally different things and this is nothing new think when we used to code an assembly lowlevel language you would be typing bits and btes and memories and allocation and right then you get higher level programming languages Python and you think at a completely different level because all the lowlevel work is abstracted now think at a company level when the CEO doesn't have to be the engineer and the customer support and all these other things the CEO can think of a big vision and get everybody behind it think of Steve Jobs think of Bill Gates so the higher level you go the more abstract your thinking becomes and the more things you can attack and that's what he's saying so these Concepts should be nothing new these should logically make sense to all of you hopefully and it's like you know going from Punch Cards to higher level languages didn't just let us program a little faster let us do these qualitatively new things and we're we're really seeing that and so as we look at these next steps of things that can do a more complete task you can like imagine a little agent that you can say go write this whole program for me I'll ask you a few questions along the way but it won't just be writing a few functions at a time that'll enable a bunch of new stuff uh and then again it'll do even more complex stuff some maybe there's an AI where you can say you know go start and run this company for me and then someday there's maybe an AI where you can say like go discover new physics this is where Alex heroi talks about I don't know if you guys know him but he's an entrepreneur he's jacked and he kind of blew up overnight so you can look him up but he talks about the more advanced and valuable somebody is the more General tasks you can give them and basically the Dumber somebody is you can only give them you give them very specific tasks for example if you have somebody really valuable you would just go and tell them hey start me a $10 million company tomorrow and that guy can go and figure that out and do it for you right uh like for example if you could hire Steve Jobs or Bill Gates how easily could they start a brand new company that would be worth a couple of million dollars probably very easy for them right or Elon Musk but then you take somebody who's kind of Dumber I don't know how else to say it right but this is that's just how I say it somebody who's Dumber you would have to tell them like press this button to actually turn on your computer or less skill let's say right you have to be like press this button to run this ad you have to get very microscopically specific and that's how it is with Chad GPT right now we have to be pretty specific with the scope it'll be like I'm sorry I don't understand but then in future hopefully you can say things like discover new physics or go start a new company on your behalf and then it should be able to do it all for you and it's the stuff that we're seeing now is very exciting and wonderful uh but I think it's worth always putting in context of this technology that at least for the next five or 10 years will be on a very steep Improvement curve um these are the stupidest the models will ever be but coding is probably the area the single area from a productivity gain we're most excited about today uh massively deployed and you know it's SC usage at this point Healthcare and education are two things that are coming up that curve that we're very excited about too but the thing that's that is a little daunting is unlike previous technology improvements this one could improve very rapidly and there's kind of no upper bound I mean the idea that it achieves human levels on a lot of areas of work you know even if it's not doing unique science it you know can do support calls and sales calls I guess you and I do have some concern along with this good thing that it'll Force us to adapt faster than we've had to ever before that that's the scary part it's not that we have to adapt it's not that humanity is not super adaptable we've been through these massive technological shifts and a massive percentage of the jobs that people do can change over a couple of generations and over couple of generations we seem to absorb that just fine yeah so it's not so much we'll we'll adapt and we'll find ways to adapt but Bill Gates is right this is never happened before this level of Technology things that can think and improve on their own for example when you figured out how to have electricity in a house that's quite different right once electricity happened in the house that was it it was done right it wasn't like electricity kept improving its own self automatically whereas that will happen with AI where the more it trains on data the smarter it becomes automatically so it's going to kind of have an exponential weird curve of improvement versus a lot of other things however Sam is like yo we've seen improvements and we've seen crazy big shifts so humans will find a way to adapt I'm curious what he's going to say next I just want to comment on the point he made about coding yes coding is very exciting today and as much as you hear me say or other people say end of programming it might not be 5 to 10 years from now and even when we say end of programming it really might be the end of traditional coding jobs and how they look where you have software developers sitting there writing code it's going to morph into you becoming a project manager or a product manager who's going to be writing to AI to build things and you're going to be overseeing it like you have a bunch of Junior developers under you and then when there bugs you might go and check it out and see what what's happening but the bugs are going to be start being less and less likely as time goes on as it starts to get better and even debugging it might actually not be you coding debugging it might be giving it instructions and letting it debug hey why did you start it on port 8080 you should have started on Port 7000 hey why were using mongod DB we needed to use you to use Firebase for this you know that that level of debugging kind like you would when you're interacting with the developer so coding is an exciting time you should still learn it it's incredibly valuable but start using these AI tools and Chad GPT tools that exist we've seen that with the great technological Revolutions of the past each technological revolution has gotten faster and this will be the fastest by far and that's the part that I find potentially a little scary is that's what I was talking about where this is a technology Revolution that will be the fastest adding electricity wasn't that like it got added and then the incremental improvement from there to something else was not as fast right you had fire and then after fire I don't know whatever else happened then you got electricity but it was like it took a while to have that happen whereas Chad GPT 4 like three and four is like 10 20 50 times better like GPT 4 is incomparably better to gpt3 gpt3 just looks completely stupid compared to it gpt3 looks like a 10yearold and GPT 4 looks like a 29y old and the difference between a 10yearold and 29y old in terms of intelligence usually isn't like two times or five times it's like 80 times 100 times the difference is really really wild just the speed with which society is going to have to adapt and that the labor market will change one aspect uh of AI is is robotics or blue collar jobs when you get you sort of hands and feet uh that are at human level capability and you know the incredible chat GPT breakthrough has kind of gotten us focused on the white thank you for not saying Chad GTP I mean how many of you watching this Chad say Chad GTP like what the [ __ ] is that who started that like why are there so many like majority of the people say GTP I don't understand thank you Bill Gates for saying it right caller thing which is super appropriate but I do worry people are losing the focus on the blue collar piece so how do you see robotics super excited for that we started robots too early um and so we had to put that project on hold it was hard for the wrong reasons it wasn't helping us make progress with the difficult parts of the ml research and you know we were like dealing with bad simulators and breaking tendons and things like that and also we realized more and more over time that what we really first needed was intelligence and cognition and then we could figure out how to adapt it to physicality and it was easier to start with that with the way we've built these language models but we have I never thought about that that's actually really smart yeah cuz you end up wasting time on building the robot back up because he broke his freaking arm instead of working on the actual thinking of the robot and so huh that's why they decided not to do robots and just focus on the intelligence and cognition part very cool always planned to come back to it we've started investing a little bit in robotics companies I think on the physical Hardware side there's finally for the first time that I've ever seen really exciting new platforms being built there and at some point we will be able to use our models as you were saying with their language understanding and future video understanding to say all right like let's do amazing things with a with a robot but it's the hardware guys you know who've done a good job on legs actually get the arms hands fingers piece and then we couple it you know and it's not ridiculously expensive that could change the job market for a lot of the the blue collar type work pretty rapidly certainly the the prediction like the consensus prediction if we rewind seven or 10 years was that the impact was going to be blue colar work first white colar work second creativity maybe never but certainly last cuz that was magic and human obviously it's gone exactly the other direction and I think there's like a lot of interesting takeaways about why that happened you know creative work act ah interesting so it was like creativity would be the last thing and now creativity is the first thing being taken away interesting because a lot of people you see using Chad GPT right now will use it to write their emails we'll use it to send messages to people we'll use it to um come up with content ideas and so if you think about it it's actually a lot of creative work creative thinking that we kind of assigning to Chad GPT which is interesting I didn't actually think about it like that even when I'm brainstorming with Chad GPT often times it's very deliberate like hard decision making and thinking and I'm having a back and forth interesting and so if but eventually once it turns into Robotics and gets physicality then it'll start to take over you know Constructor construction working jobs which will be a hard thing to achieve physicality wise and cognitive wise and all of that for it to achieve I don't think that's happening anytime soon I would I might have to guess like 10 years 20 years um who knows it might happen soon and blow my mind but I just feel like that's really complex cuz if you even look at Tesla right the car can barely drive itself like it runs into crashes and has bugs right people have died because of that and so to have things that are creating buildings you don't want to make a mistake there right and then the building breaks down and it endangers so many people's lives so very curious about that but very interesting that the blue collar jobs will be the last ones kind of Taken actually the hallucinations of the the GPT models is a is a feature not a bug it lets you discover some new things whereas if you're you know having a robot move heavy machinery around you better be really precise with that and I think this is just a case of you've got to follow where technology go and you have preconceptions but sometimes the science doesn't want to go that way interesting so instead of making your own assumptions it's better to see where technolog is actually going and just follow the science step by step rather than I think this is what's going to happen because that might change because people thought robots would happen first well it's ch GPT happening first which is interesting because like I would think it'd be easier to make a robot that goes and does stuff for you right brings you cake or some [ __ ] but apparently it was easier to invent this thing that could solve any [ __ ] problem like what like I would that's crazy like if you think about Chad GPT I mean now we're kind of normalized to it but it's insane and I was thinking we would have a robot that would bring me freaking water and so it's going the other way and so that's the way that we should actually look at it from but yes this is the stupidest these models will ever be so if you find that interesting at any level and you want to be like yo how can I use chat GPT and and how can I use these tools to learn how to build apps learn how to make money with it any of these things if any of that makes you interested or even slightly curious I have a 19minute short free training for you below in the description go check it out because in that training we're going to go through and talk about Chad GPT we're going to talk about AI we're going to talk about the three app ideas that you could build and even if you're a complete beginner this training will fit you and even if you're a developer this will help you so it's 19 minutes of pure value click the link in the description join the training I'd love to see you inside with that said I hope you enjoyed the
