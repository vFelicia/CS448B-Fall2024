hey guys how's it going so in the last video we talked about doing projects right so we going over the solutions of some projects and this video what I talk about is dictionaries they're very important in a lot of programming languages and other ones and C C++ it might be called maps in Python it's called a dictionary so let's see what it is about okay so essentially the idea behind dictionaries is to map keys to values hopefully that defines everything right now basically that's a very cryptic definition that I gave you if you don't know what it is yeah it maps two things okay so anytime you have a relationship between two things you want to use dictionaries and when you don't have a relationship relationship between two things you want to use a list for example if you want to just remember a bunch of numbers and that's all you care about you want to use a list okay so for example I only care about a bunch of numbers like this I want to use a list now what if I want to know a way where hmm I don't know I use my cell phone right I use this thing over here and using this thing I can look up a person's name and based on that person's name it gives me back their phone number right or if I type in their phone number it kind of goes the other way around whatever how can we do that well that's the beauty of dictionaries my friend so you're going to learn something very powerful today so let's let's go at it let's say I wanted to make a phone book write with what we know in list I mean can you think of a way how you might do it I don't know I mean you could store numbers right like this as a string and then store the second number as a string and go 4 5 6 2 2 4 4 3 3 right something like that whatever these are not clearly very silly numbers but ok and then you can say phone book and give me the zeroth number phone book give me the first number also notice we're using something different for coding we're using rappelled IT right so it's actually spelled repl by T and the beauty of this is that it teaches you how to code while it makes it very easy for you to code you can use this without having an actual working environment locally downloading onto your computer you can just run your code on the fly and what I'm going to do for you guys is once I'm done with this session I'm going to take this link and paste it into the YouTube description and that way you can actually get access to these notes directly ok so you'll be able to come to this link and get for example the link right now is this ok by it but by the time we're done with this video the link might be different and I'll post the most updated link for you guys in the YouTube description ok so the website is repl DT and you can pick programming language Python for your programming language and then just code here ok so let's check out what this does let's make sure to add print print let's check it out so you can see you have 1 2 3 & 4 5 6 right you printing out the zeroth element and then the first element of this list that's great but I mean it's not really fun to remember names as numbers right because you're not going to be you're not gonna go oh I'm gonna call you zero Johnny and I'm going to call you 1 Bob and then every time you have to look at Johnny's number you're going to type in zero to get back Johnny's number or one to get Bob's number that would be terrible and what if you had stored hundreds of people in your list then it gets really complicated but now let's use dictionaries here's how dictionaries work okay let me describe right here in notes dictionaries okay here's other word you have some dictionary we will called it a dick okay and you did and the store key value pairs so if you put in a key gives you back the value okay and how you store things into a dictionary is like so your key goes here and your value goes here okay let's set a key one value 1 then we can say key value 2 okay and you can keep doing this all day all right now let's create a dictionary ok so let's create our example phonebook so I'm going to say Kazi which is my name which is my last name but I got go on my last name pretty much everywhere so we're going to take the string cause E as the cause e is the what is that the key or the value if you said key good job and we're going to store the number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 now notice that I'm storing this as a string and not an actual number like an integer or something why do you think that is well think about it if I remove the quotes from here what is this going to do is going to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 and I'm going to end up getting back on negative 8223 so it's actually going to end up storing it like this that's not what I want I want the exact number so usually when you want things exactly how they are strings are perfectly good data type to use there and now I'm going to say Bob and I'm going to store Bob's number as okay is this a which key is this this is the second key and now there's going to be the second I'm going to store his number as 2 2 2 2 2 2 & 2 2 2 2 very easy number that Bob has he gets tons of wrong calls and he gets very annoyed now to make it a little bit nicer on me to read this dictionary sure I can have it as a long one line but as you can imagine as we begin to store multiple people it's going to be spilling over to the right side so what I want to do is make it easier on my eyes and make it easier to type so I'm going to go to the start of the line hit enter and python knows what to do with it and where to put it and i'm going to go to the start of this line and hit enter okay i'm also going to go here and hit enter and i'm going to go here and hit enter okay and what this does for me is it just makes it easier for me to read okay kind of like this um and i can just simply start putting things in here we can leave that here there that's not a problem we can leave that one right up there and i can put in another person right cat cat cat let's just do cat caller cat let's say her number is 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ok and now what I can do is I can do phone book and what's the way I can get back cause ease phone number right so imagine you go to your phone your iPhone or whatever you have and you simply swipe up or down right you go to your words contacts how does contacts work I go to my contacts and I type in let's say my name right so how does it find it and how does it give me back the actual number well today you're going to find out the secret behind how it works ok so it takes in the key or my name Rafa Kazi and it spits back the value associated with it it could be my email address it could be my phone number it could be whatever the heck I want it to be right so now let's go into phonebook and we can say Kazi right that's you put in the key and this whole thing liquefies and turns into the value okay so that whole thing turns into one value okay so let's print it out and let's see what we get and I'll break it down how this expression works so we got back one two three four five six seven eight nine zero phone book is just this whole dictionary starting with the squiggly is right so phone book is this thing right there and I'm indexing that phone book by Kazi okay so as you can see I have this list here and I'm simply indexing it by qaz I okay and once I index it what happens here right once I index it by Kazi I just get back the value so this whole thing liquidates into that and then that result actually gets printed out on the screen okay that's how the dictionary works now let's say I wanted to make it a little bit more complicated to where each person had you know like their names and each person had their own email address associated with them and whatever right so we could make it a little bit more interesting for example let's say that I wanted to add more values associated with Kazi I don't want just his phone number but kind of like how my phone does it it also has caused these email addresses and it also has causes home address and whatever else right so how would I do that well what I need to do is I need to have one key that gives me back multiple values associated with it here I have a key Kazi I have a key Bob and I have a key tag so what I need to do to cause e for example is make it give me back multiple values well what's a pretty darn good thing to give back multiple things hmmm I remember it's a list how about a list of things so let's turn this from a spare string to a list that contains one the phone number and then we can say to it contains one email address so we can say Ozzie at cause e.com okay fake email address let's close that down there and okay sweet so now we have a list containing two strings inside of it the first at first index it's a phone number and then order 0th index rather and then at the first index we have two email address I can do the same thing to the other ones but let's just play around with it and see what we get so I'm going to change this from phonebook Aussie and I'm going to say ok I know that once I run this line of code what I will get back is actually this list this whole thing is actually going to evaluate to the value of Kazi right so you put in the key look at the formula at the top right you put in the key and you get back the value from the other side so I'm going to run it and let's see what we get so you can see that we get back the value I know that this thing is going to turn into a list then I have to think about how can I access different things from the list let's say my question to you was can you get me cause these phone number you would say okay I'll get you cause these phone number I know that it's inside of a dictionary where the key is Kazi where there is a key cause II and if I access that key Kazi right if I access the key the dict and if I access the key Kazi I get back a list of things containing his a phone number and email right so you're like boom now I know that I have a list of things how can I access things inside of a list I remember how you access things inside of a list is based on the index number right so for example if I go up here if I have to access the first element or the zeroth element of the list I would do this and this gives me the first element list whereas for a dictionary you would actually put in for a dictionary you would actually put in a name or something something that's nice and easy to remember in a list you use numbers so then you go okay well I know that cause ease email address is at position one right this is index zero and this is index one so if I ask you the question of getting me cause ease email address you know that this whole expression evaluates to a list well then you can just say one right just like this thing over here and let's change it to zeroth element the list just to be very accurate let's hit that and you can see that I get back Ozzy's email address well what if I wanted to get a cause ease phone number I would just change this to a zero and you can see that I got back that's the same thing now let's say I want to do the same thing for Bob right turn this is the phone number this is Bob at Bob calm and then we have let's turn this into a list of things and let's call it cat at cat calm and we have this closing I have to make sure that I close my quotes here close the quotes there okay great so I have a phone book let's get the terminology right let's just practice with the terminology it's good to say it over and over again I don't care if I sound crazy and I you shouldn't care the few sound crazy but understand the terminology because is going to help you be able to research it better understand it better synthesize the information better and be able to write better code ultimately because you will understand all of the data structures whereas if you just keep mumble and handwaving you're going to get very confused later on you might be able to get past some of this stuff but then when we get into list inside of dictionaries inside lists of dictionaries is going to get very complicated you can be like oh man I wish I learned the terminology when it was nice and easy so let's let's just talk through it I have a dictionary that contains how many keys three keys what's each keys name Kazi Bob cat what do each of the keys contain each of the key contains a value and that value is a list okay good each key contains a value which is a list that's good and how many elements is each list contain each list contains two elements right as we can see right here so now if I wanted to get cats number I could do cat and I can say zero and I get back three three three three three three three three three three so let's give it an exact let's give it a run and you can see on the righthand side that's what I get back okay so I will leave this here for you guys and I will link you guys to the code so you guys can go and play around with this stuff as well okay that's it for dictionaries and we will get into its better use cases later on for now you're gonna watch boolean algebra jujitsu after this video great job guys take care I will see you in the next video
